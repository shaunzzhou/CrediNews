Guardian,"It’s not the economy, stupid, that could deliver a win for Kamala Harris","There are themes playing out in the US presidential election that are familiar to most people across the developed world.
The lack of affordable housing. Rocketing home insurance and childcare costs. How expensive owning and running a car has become.
More acutely, at least for lower income groups, an inflationary surge has sent food prices soaring by more than 20% in the last two years. In the US, voters can add healthcare and pharmaceutical costs to the list of unaffordable items on the average household’s ledger.
Psychologically, US households were hit by inflation more than in other countries, if only because they had become used to cheap stuff over many decades.
Much as the UK experienced during the Brexit vote in 2016, there is a desire to kick the incumbent administration. In 2024, it is Donald Trump’s most powerful political weapon.
Travelling around Pennsylvania and hearing how families scrape a living is sobering, when in close proximity there are ordinary and yet much wealthier households that have few money worries. Of course, it’s the same story in France, Germany and the UK, where millions of people feel left behind and are responding with a vote for a populist candidate.
By most measures of the economy, logic says the reaction will be very different. If anything, there should be a huge wave of gratitude for Joe Biden, rolling through to Kamala Harris, for a rate of economic expansion most European nations would envy.
Productivity rates, driven by the US pharma, tech and financial services industries, and even sections of manufacturing, remain well above European levels. And the US hosts major consumer and industrial brands that are world-beaters.
Prices in the shops might be higher, but petrol stations are selling fuel, as they have been in most countries, at almost pre-pandemic low levels .
To shift the blame for high prices, Biden and Harris have tried to blame major companies, accusing them of price gouging. There is a growing audience for claims of corporate greed. Hopefully, voters have pricked up their ears.
Education is another possible winning card for Harris, who has tended to steer clear of putting forward a vision for the economy in speeches and television appearances.
As the economist Robert J Shapiro wrote in the not-for-profit magazine Washington Monthly, the Democrats have a positive story on education.
“Under the Biden-Harris administration, federal support for elementary and secondary schools increased by 44%, versus Trump, who pushed for deep cuts in federal funding for public schools every year he was president, even during the pandemic. This year, he promised to defund and abolish the department of education, a position fully aligned with Project 2025,” said Shapiro, who was an adviser to Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.
About 16 million US citizens in the seven swing states destined to decide the election rely on Medicaid. Democrats can show they have streamlined the application process, reduced waiting periods, scrapped limits on lifetime benefits for people with costly chronic conditions, and ended state work requirements. Harris hasalso pledged to go further and increase rural access to hospital care, and expand maternal health coverage.
“Every budget Trump proposed as president pressed for deep cuts in federal funding for Medicaid, ranging from $780bn to $1.1tn over 10 years, averaging 20.5% of federal support for the programme in those years,” says Shapiro. “This should be an especially sensitive issue for groups that have tended to support Trump, since the 16 million Medicaid recipients in the swing states include nearly 3 million who live in rural areas and almost 12 million who never attended college.”
While Trump’s team is trying to distance the Republican candidate from Project 2025 and disown the people behind it, saying they will disbar its supporters from official positions should Trump win, it is the guiding light for many of the party’s biggest donors. The privatisation of large sections of state provision is a central theme of the project – a 900-page policy “wish list” for the next Republican president that would expand presidential power and impose an ultra-conservative social vision.
Constructed from a free-market playbook championed by the Heritage Foundation thinktank, among others, it would defund more than just education. A publicly provided healthcare safety net would be whittled away and federal support to tackle environmental issues would largely disappear.
It means there is a yawning gap between the candidates on healthcare, education and the environment that will hopefully play into the hands of the Harris team from Pennsylvania to Nevada. When only a few thousand votes could swing the election, there must be a chance that bread and butter issues push Harris over the line.",2024-11-02
Guardian,Everything you ever wanted to know about vaginas … but were too afraid to Google,"The vagina is the whole genital area
FALSE
“The word vagina only refers to a specific internal part: the muscular tube leading to the cervix. The outside part, including the labia (or lips) and clitoris, is called the vulva,” says Zoe Williams, interim director at the Vagina Museum. “There isn’t really a good word to describe both … apart from slang words,” she laughs. It’s no wonder that 45% of women couldn’t accurately label the vagina in a 2019 YouGov survey. “The recommendation is that children know the proper terms by the time they’re 10,” says Dr Maureen Whelihan, an obstetrician and gynaecologist and fellow of American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. “But parents can only teach them what they know.”
Tampons can get lost inside your vagina
FALSE
“It’s a common fear, but the cervix is at the top of the vagina and only has a small opening, which a tampon can’t pass through,” says Dr Shazia Malik, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at London’s Portland hospital. “This myth can cause unnecessary anxiety and deter people from using tampons, which are safe and effective.”
You should clean your vagina with soap
FALSE
“It’s good to wash the vulval area with water but we don’t need to clean inside the vagina,” says Clare Bourne, a pelvic health physiotherapist and author of Strong Foundations: Why Pelvic Health Matters. “The vagina is a unique self-cleaning part of the anatomy that maintains a healthy pH balance,” says Malik. This is between 3.8 and 4.5 – similar in acidity to an orange. “Using soaps can disrupt this balance and lead to vaginitis, bacterial vaginosis (BV) and yeast infections.” A healthy vagina will have a mild scent that varies throughout the menstrual cycle, during pregnancy or after having sex or exercising, she adds.
If you have vaginal discharge something’s seriously wrong
MOSTLY FALSE
Most discharge is a sign that the vagina is doing its thing: preventing and fighting off infections, says Ashfaq Khan, a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist at Harley Street Gynaecology. “If it’s a clear mucousy or off-white discharge in the middle of the menstrual cycle, it’s normal,” he says. “A lot of my patients don’t accept that. They have an idea that there should be no discharge at all.”
But a change in colour, smell, or texture, could signal an infection. “If it’s very white or grey and has a ‘fish odour’ it could be bacterial vaginosis. With green or yellow discharge there’s a chance it could be a sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as trichomoniasis or gonorrhoea. And if there’s any blood mixed up in the discharge it should be investigated,” says Khan.
A normal vulva is one that’s tucked in and neat
FALSE
“I’ve been looking at them for 27 years and the tucked in ones are the least common,” says Whelihan, who gets up close and personal with about 5,000 vulvas every year. “Variety is the norm, not the exception. The vulva is as unique as someone’s face.” Dr Shirin Lakhani, a former GP turned aesthetic physician, shows patients her “wall of vulvas” to hammer this point home: “Some labia minora [the inner lips] may extend beyond the labia majora [outer lips], while others may not. Both are perfectly normal and largely determined by genetics and individual physiology.”
Having sex makes your vagina looser and your labia longer
FALSE
“The vagina is an elastic organ capable of stretching to accommodate a baby’s head, so something as small as a penis isn’t going to make it looser,” Williams chuckles. Lakhani agrees: “Sex doesn’t cause permanent changes to the vagina or labia. They return to their usual shape afterwards and the appearance of the labia is not determined by sexual activity.”
Dr Sarah Jenkins, a former GP who now specialises in postnatal support and pelvic health, adds: “The heat and friction from sex actually maintains our skin and prevents atrophy [where the skin thins and the vaginal canal gets shorter and drier].”
It’s more hygienic to remove pubic hair
FALSE
“Removing pubic hair is a personal preference and not a medical necessity,” assures Sachchidananda Maiti, a consultant gynaecologist and obstetrician at Pall Mall Medical and senior lecturer at Manchester University medical school. “This myth is widely believed, especially in western cultures where hairlessness is often associated with cleanliness and attractiveness,” he adds.
A 2024 study found that about 80% of women groom their pubic hair. But the humble bush has a very important job: to trap sweat, bacteria and oil. “Unless the hair is infested with lice or other harmful elements, its removal can actually lead to irritation and a higher risk of infection, especially if done with unclean razors,” Maiti adds.
If you’re turned on, your vagina will get wet
FALSE
Like the inside of the mouth, vaginal tissue is a mucous membrane, meaning it is somewhat moist at all times. “We have Bartholin’s glands at the vaginal opening that get activated by arousal and give us extra lube. But there are many things that can interfere with natural lubrication even if you’re aroused,” says Whelihan. Age, menopause and a loss of oestrogen, vaginal infections and medications such as antihistamines can all dry the vagina out.
Best not to use how wet you get as a barometer for horniness, says Silva Neves, a psychosexual and relationship psychotherapist accredited by the College of Sexual and Relationship Therapists: “It’s important not to focus on wetness as the only evidence for being turned on because other parts of the body can react to being turned on, too.”
There’s something wrong with your vagina if you never orgasm through penetration
FALSE
“Most women report requiring clitoral stimulation to climax,” says Nicole Prause, a sexual psychophysiologist and founder of sexual biotechnology company Liberos. “And the vast majority cannot experience orgasm through vaginal penetration alone.”
Only 18% of women do, according to one study. “Well that makes sense,” says Whelihan. “It feels good for him when he’s rubbing his penis on the vaginal wall and getting stimulated but the clitoris is on the outside wall getting ignored! A study said if the distance between the clitoris and vaginal opening is less than 2cm, there’s a possibility of having vaginal orgasms. If it’s more than 2cm, you may never have one.”
Vaginal birth stretches your vagina out and it never goes back
FALSE
“Usually after one normal-sized baby everything goes back nicely,” says Whelihan. “After two, three and four, the muscles may lose a bit of memory. If it’s a nine-pounder, that’s a big stretch, but the vaginal tissue can take the hit,” adds Whelihan, although the muscles may need a bit of retraining. “I wouldn’t get hung up on laxity [lack of firmness].” A 2023 study found that post-birth vulva changes didn’t make the participants enjoy sex any less.
Yoghurt cures thrush
FALSE(ish)
“Yoghurt shouldn’t be used to treat thrush because the evidence is so patchy,” says Khan. Thrush, a yeast infection, is caused by the candida fungus and can develop if the balance of vaginal bacteria changes. Yoghurt is thought to redress that, but often imbalance isn’t the cause. “It works only on a very small group of people mostly because yoghurt doesn’t address the problem. It doesn’t kill the thrush, it just makes the environment more difficult for the thrush to grow in,” Khan explains.
While he wouldn’t prescribe yoghurt to cure thrush, he doesn’t mind patients using it to treat mild symptoms or help prevent a recurrent infection – but only after receiving proper treatment. “The frequency of application can vary,’” he says. “Most women use it every night during a flare-up but some may choose to apply it several times a week, especially during periods of recurrent symptoms or after antibiotic use.”
Pelvic floor exercises stop you peeing yourself
TRUE
Great news: “Pelvic floor exercises [or Kegels] treat incontinence and are recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) as a first line treatment. They’re an amazing part of recovery for people with incontinence,” says Bourne. The exercises – squeezing and releasing the muscles you use when you pee – can be done 10 times a day.
But they must be done correctly, warns Bourne: “After any squeeze or contraction of the pelvic floor, it is essential to fully let the muscle relax. If we focus too much on the squeezing element and not on letting go, it can even aggravate or worsen symptoms.”
The clitoris is tiny
FALSE
What you see is not what you get. “Most of the clitoris is invisible,” says Prause. “The rest is inside the body and even the external portion is typically covered by a clitoral hood.” To the 29% of women who don’t know what or where the clitoris is: it’s the small nub at the top of the vulva, but also boasts an internal wishbone-like structure that can range from 8cm to 10cm long.
The clitoris is a mini-penis
TRUE(ish)
This is where experts disagree slightly. “At nine weeks, babies look exactly the same and all have a little genital tubercle. Under the influence of testosterone it grows and becomes a penis; in the absence of testosterone it becomes a clitoris,” says Whelihan. It’s in exactly the same location and has the same structure, except in a penis the shaft goes up into the long tip, while in a vulva the crura [which fill with blood when you’re aroused] tuck in behind the outer lips.”
Dr Christine Ekechi, an acute gynaecology and early pregnancy specialist and obstetrician, feels differently. “The function differs as it doesn’t contain the urethra and isn’t for penetration,” she says.
Prause is in the middle: “There’s some truth to this one. The clitoris shares many features of the penis, including a type of foreskin and a shaft that responds to long stroking. But it cannot have the rigidity of a penis as it doesn’t prohibit blood outflow.”
The clitoris has more nerve endings than the penis
YET TO BE DETERMINED
The clitoris was long believed to have 8,000 nerve endings – double that of the penis. These nerves are pretty key for enjoyable sex as they can elicit a whole host of pleasurable sensations (depending on how it is touched and how aroused someone is). But, it has since emerged that this stat came from a study of cows published in 1976. Newer (yet still unpublished) research suggests it could be closer to 10,000.
Among the experts, the jury’s still out over whether clitorises or penises win this particular competition. “The density of nerves in the clitoris and penis isn’t uniform across either organ,” says Prause. Not to mention that “the area of nerve density can vary between individuals”, too.
However, Whelihan reckons it’s a tie. “The number of nerve endings are the same in both but sensitivity differs depending on whether the penis is exposed [circumcised] or not.” Perhaps Ekechi sums it up best: “The clitoris is believed to contain more, but it’s notoriously understudied and researched compared with the penis.”",2024-11-02
Guardian,Republicans vexed as Senate challengers fall behind Trump in polls,"Republican Senate contenders are falling behind Donald Trump in voter polling, vexing GOP leaders who had thought that aspiring senators would catch up to the party’s presidential candidate.
In Ohio, Trump is polling at an average of 8.7 percentage points above the Republican Senate nominee Bernie Moreno, RealClear Politics averages suggest. In Wisconsin, Trump has polled 2.2 points ahead of the Senate candidate Eric Hovde; they also both remain under 50% in the polls.
In Arizona, Trump is at 49.3% compared with Kari Lake’s 43.4%. In Nevada, Sam Brown is at 40.7% while Trump has 47.6%.
Meanwhile, Democratic Senate contenders are still besting Republican candidates in “every key battleground” in the presidential race, per the Cook Political report. But the site noted that their leads were tighter than in August, and that Wisconsin and Michigan Senate races could be prime opportunities for Republicans.
Polling has even prompted concerns over the US Senate race in deep-red Texas. Texas’s Senate race has shifted from “likely Republican” to “lean Republican”, suggesting that the Democratic representative Colin Allred might be gaining steam against the GOP incumbent Ted Cruz, the Hill reported.
Some data still indicates that Republicans have a strong chance of landing a Senate majority. They could potentially win simply by ousting Montana’s Democratic senator Jon Tester, per the website.
The polling nonetheless marks a dramatic shift for GOP senators, who just weeks ago had privately told mega-donors that the Senate was all but guaranteed for them, per Axios. Their optimistic speculation that the party would land 52 Senate seats came as top Republicans implored donors to contribute to cover funding gaps in several battleground states.
The situation is flipped in Maryland, a heavily Democratic state where former governor Larry Hogan has outpaced Trump by almost 30 points in the polls. Hogan has built a wall between himself and the former president, notably rebuffing his endorsement, Axios points out, citing the Real Clear Politics data.
For Democrats, it’s the opposite. Kamala Harris reportedly lags behind the Democratic Senate candidate in four of five battleground states.
The polling gap between presidential and Senate candidates is slimmer than Trump’s, about one or two points, as Harris’s split marks an improvement over Joe Biden’s. Harris is showing a one-point advantage over Elissa Slotkin, representative from Michigan, Axios said.
This new polling is among a mountain of data indicating that the presidential election remains a near toss-up. Harris had secured a four-point lead over Trump in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, according to New York Times and Siena College polls conducted from 5 August to 9 August.
But data from New York Times and Siena College from surveys between 21 and 26 September reveal that Harris’s lead has slimmed. In Michigan, Harris and Trump are respectively polling at 48% and 47%, “well within the poll’s margin of error”, according to the Times.
The polling is even more striking in Wisconsin. While Harris has 49% compared with Trump’s 48%, the newspaper notes that Wisconsin polling has “a history of overstating support for Democrats”.
There is potentially good news for Harris from Nebraska’s second congressional district. There, Harris is besting Trump by eight percentage points.
The district’s only electoral vote might prove crucial in the electoral college for a Harris victory. Should Harris win Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, this district could deliver the 270 electoral college votes she needs if Trump wins key Sun belt contests, per the Times.
This polling comes just before Tuesday night’s vice-presidential debate has raised still more questions about the race’s trajectory. Unlike the Trump-Harris face-off, which featured the ex-president’s characteristically brash behavior, JD Vance and Tim Walz focused on policy and remained civil.
Some believe that Vance outperformed Walz, and vice versa, while others believed there was no clear winner.",2024-10-02
Guardian,Lake Victoria stays unbeaten with Juvenile Fillies’ Turf win at Breeders’ Cup,"Lake Victoria, already the winner of Group One races over seven and six furlongs, justified odds-on favouritism in the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Fillies’ Turf on Friday under a patient and resourceful ride by Ryan Moore.
Moore had few options from his draw in stall one against the rail and stoked Lake Victoria towards the lead on the run to the first turn. The favourite suffered significant interference on the bend, however, as Totally Justified moved across from Moore’s right, and she exited into the back stretch in seventh place.
Moore took his time to work his way back into the race, confident that Lake Victoria’s turn of foot would still prove decisive. He was still scraping the rail on the final turn but then picked his moment at the top of the stretch to fire Lake Victoria into the open and past the front-running Thought Process on the way to a comfortable success.
“She had very strong form coming into the race, and really all she needed was normal racing luck and a clear shot,” Moore said. “We just about managed that and she proved to be much the best.
“She got pressure on the outside [on the first turn] and got pushed into the fence, and that was that, we had to come back. When that happens, it’s significant interference and puts you at a disadvantage, but they’d gone very quick and as soon as we got halfway down the back straight, most of the horses [in front] were done.”
Lake Victoria is still unbeaten after five starts and remains favourite for next year’s 1,000 Guineas at around 3-1.
Earlier on the card, Magnum Force was a first Breeders’ Cup winner for Ger Lyons in the Juvenile Turf Sprint, the first of 14 Breeders’ Cup races this weekend.
Magnum Force had seven rivals in front of him with just over a furlong to run, around a turf track that is tight even by American standards and tends to favour horses ridden prominently.
Colin Keane, though, managed to thread Magnum Force up the inside rail before switching outside the front-running Governor Sam as another Irish-trained runner, Arizona Blaze, stayed on into second. Governor Sam took third with the fast-finishing Big Mojo, attempting to give Mick Appleby a second successive win in the race, a nose away in fourth.
Lyons is a Classic-winning trainer in Ireland but his successes in the Irish 2,000 Guineas and Irish Oaks in 2020 were recorded while crowd restrictions were in place during the Covid epidemic.
“We won the Oaks and the Guineas standing on our own in the stands,” Lyons said. “Now I’ll take it, don’t get me wrong, but then you come here and that’s what sportsmen want. We work hard and we have more losing days than winning days, and just to get that buzz, money can’t buy that.
“The sky’s the limit next year, because it’s all about next year. We came here to teach him how to sprint, and you have to learn how to sprint and he’s getting better and better.
“I knew he was the right horse for the job, and when you’ve Colin Keane riding for you … He’s probably the most underrated champion jockey in the world, just because he’s a bit like his trainer, he likes to stay at home and walk his dogs.”
Europe completed a sweep of Friday’s three races on turf and Moore a double on the night as Henri Matisse took the Juvenile Turf from a wide draw in stall 13.
The win was Aidan O’Brien’s 20th success at the Breeders’ Cup, giving him a share of the all-time record at the meeting with the American legend, D Wayne Lukas.",2024-11-02
Guardian,US emergency crews struggle as climate crisis fuels ‘unprecedented’ competing disasters,"It’s been a brutal week in weather-related disasters across the US. Large parts of the south-east are still grappling with the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene, and another potentially catastrophic storm is barreling towards Florida. At the same time, much of the west has been sweltering amid scorching temperatures, which have elevated fire risks and fueled extreme fire behavior.
Hurricanes and fires aren’t abnormal in early autumn. But the climate crisis has turned up the dial and created more opportunities for catastrophes to overlap, ultimately adding strain on relief resources, emergency response, and those who have been impacted by the dangerous and destructive events.
While federal officials have been clear that emergency response agencies have been able to lead on recovery efforts following Hurricane Helene, strongly disputing rampant misinformation about misuse or politicization of the funds in areas devastated by the storm, the competing disasters nonetheless have severely strained the agencies.
The homeland security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, told reporters last week that Fema “does not have the funds to make it through the season”. Joe Biden echoed those concerns in a letter to Congress, calling on legislators to increase funding to ensure Fema won’t have to “forego longer-term recovery activities in favor of meeting urgent needs.
“The Congress should provide FEMA additional resources to avoid forcing that kind of unnecessary trade-off and to give the communities we serve the certainty of knowing that help will be ongoing, both for the short- and long-term,” the US president wrote.
Meanwhile, dangerous fire conditions in the west prompted officials to bump the country’s response to preparedness level 5 (PL5) on Tuesday, the highest level. The early-October designation – the latest PL5 since the system began registering the levels in 1990 – shows that resources for fighting fire are growing scarce as conditions linger into autumn.
It’s already been a busy season for firefighters, many who have logged up to 1,400 hours of overtime fighting blazes that have covered more than 7.6m acres in the US so far this year. Faced with dwindling budgets, the drawdown in seasonal crews, and deployment of more than a thousand wildfire personnel to aid in Helene recovery efforts, agencies are yet again scrambling.
In response, the National Multi-Agency Coordinating Group (NMAC), responsible for organizing the country’s fire suppression operations, called for plans for prescribed burns to be put on hold, potentially limiting how much mitigation work will be possible this autumn.
“Due to the unprecedented fire environment forecasted through mid-October, increased initial attack and growth on existing fires, competition for resources including a growing commitment of resources to Hurricane Helene, and the seasonal reduction in firefighting resources,” the agency wrote, “the NMAC urges extreme caution … in executing new prescribed fires in the current environment and would strongly caution against any reliance on national resources to achieve Rx objectives; new ignitions may pose a risk of escape due to current weather and fuels conditions which would further strain the availability of national resources.”
‘They all go hand in hand’
As the country cooks into the autumn months, stretching fire season longer and longer, the risks of devastating hurricanes climb.
“This is the normal time of year for hurricanes, but the Gulf of Mexico is so warm these storms get to be monsters really quickly,” said Dr Dave Easterling, senior climate scientist at the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI).
“Out west you have heatwaves, fire, drought – they all go hand in hand,” he added.
Meanwhile, Hurricane Milton rapidly intensified into a category 5 on Monday, as Florida prepares for what could be the biggest evacuation in seven years. The storm is surging toward population centers just weeks after Helene caused widespread destruction and became one of the deadliest hurricanes. More than 230 fatalities have been confirmed, a toll that’s only expected to rise.
Like fire season, the risks of catastrophic hurricanes could linger longer, adding complications to response and recovery, as warm temperatures stretch across more months of the year.
This year is already on track to rank among the hottest on record with a good chance at replacing 2023 at the top. Heat can be a deadly event all on its own, but it also sets the stage for destructive – and expensive – catastrophes. The US in 2023 logged 28 billion-dollar-disasters, an unprecedented number according to officials at NOAA, which called them “just the latest examples of the extremes we now face that will continue to worsen due to climate change”.
It’s not the first time disaster funding has become a concern. Costs associated with weather catastrophes are on the rise and even with boosts to the budget, agencies have struggled to keep up, according to Jonathan Sury, a senior staff associate at the national center for disaster preparedness at Columbia University.
“Even though there has been a lot more money going to Fema’s budget to respond to these things, the scale of these disasters has really been sucking that money up,” he said, noting the rising amount of repeated events like the back-to-back hurricane threat.
He has contributed to a product called the natural hazards index, which maps community vulnerability, and said it’s now much more common to see extreme events overlap or compound, hammering communities one after the other, and taxing emergency management, first responders, and affected communities.
Future planning, especially at the community level, will be essential to prepare for and adapt to the present threats that are only expected to worsen as the world warms.
“We know heat is coming and will get worse. Some parts of that we can’t stop but there are ways we can adapt our communities and livelihoods to better manage ourselves and our resources during future disasters,” he said.
In the meantime, Easterling has cautioned all to take imminent warnings seriously. In his community outside Asheville, North Carolina, the onslaught from Helene showered more than 17in (43cm) of rain in mere days. Neighbors, though, saw roughly double that. Friends barely escaped their home before it washed away in the floods, which broke records set in 1916.
“The bottom line is when you hear warnings, take them seriously,” he said. “We are not going to necessarily see more hurricanes in the future but when the sea surface temperatures are as warm as they are, especially in the Gulf, we are going to see more powerful ones.”",2024-10-09
Guardian,‘I try not to get my hopes up’: campaigners make final push to save abortion rights in Florida,"As she stood in the parking lot of an auto supply store on Friday evening, Brittany Robinson was practically vibrating. With just a few days left before the 2024 presidential elections, the 32-year-old Floridian needed an outlet for her anxiety.
So Robinson decided to go knock on strangers’ doors in support of Amendment 4, a ballot measure that, if passed, would enshrine abortion rights into Florida’s constitution and overturn the state’s six-week abortion ban.
“I wish I started earlier,” said Robinson, a native of the Tampa Bay area who had never before canvassed for a political campaign. Living under Florida’s ban, she said, is “terrifying”. When she was a freshman in college 13 years ago, Robinson discovered she was seven weeks pregnant and had an abortion a week later.
“I wouldn’t have been able to do that now,” Robinson said.
Come Tuesday, Florida will be one of 10 states where voters will have the chance to amend their state constitution to add or expand abortion rights. Of all those measures, the battle in Florida may be the most intense – and the most uphill for supporters of abortion rights.
Florida has taken a sharp turn towards the right in recent years, and its hardline conservative government has effectively launched a war against the Amendment 4 campaign.
Amendment 4 needs to garner 60% of the vote to pass. Although abortion rights advocates have won every post-Roe v Wade abortion ballot measure in the US, none have hit that threshold.
“I am extremely confident that the people of Florida want Amendment 4 to be passed,” said Laura Shaw, a 21-year-old working on the campaign. “However, I am also all too aware of the steps that the Florida government is taking to suppress those ideas.”
In the last days before the election, nothing seemed certain.
“I don’t know what to think,” said Sanderlyne St Cyr, a 20-year-old who voted early for Amendment 4. “I’m just going to sit back and observe and let Jesus take the wheel.”
Over the last several weeks, Florida law enforcement has investigated people who signed a petition to get the measure on the ballot, while the health department sent cease-and-desist letters to local TV stations that aired an ad supporting it. (Abortion rights activists sued and won.) Florida’s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, has also claimed that Amendment 4 would eliminate a law that requires Florida minors to obtain parental consent before getting an abortion – a claim legal experts say is overblown.
While canvassing, Makenzie Martin, a 23-year-old organizer with the campaign for Amendment 4, has run into people who wrongly believe that the measure – which would protect the right to abortion until viability, or about 24 weeks – would allow abortions into the ninth month of pregnancy.
One woman, Martin said, thought abortion rights activists wanted to allow doctors to perform abortions after birth – a wildly inaccurate talking point that Donald Trump has raised repeatedly in presidential debates. (That would be murder and it is already illegal.)
There are now more than 1 million more registered Republicans in Florida than Democrats, which means that in order to pass, the nonpartisan campaign for Amendment 4 will probably need to secure the votes of a sizable swath of Trump supporters.
One recent poll found that 58% of Florida voters supported Amendment 4, while 34% opposed it. Six per cent were undecided.
Instructions handed out to canvassers advise them not to respond to any comments about candidates and to emphasize how the amendment would “kick ALL POLITICIANS, regardless of their party affiliation, out of private medical decisions”.
The instructions also suggest that canvassers ignore public polls and claim that most of them have been surveying people “in ways that are highly misleading”.
As she knocked on doors in one Tampa neighborhood on Friday evening, Martin had little luck getting voters to answer. Although one woman heartily agreed with Amendment 4 – “You never know what a woman is going through!” she shouted from her yard at Martin, adding: “She could have gotten raped!” – Martin more often ended up just tucking purplish brochures about the measure into houses’ chain-link fences.
Robinson, too, largely struck out. However, she was delighted to encounter a teenage girl at one house, who, Robinson said, excitedly endorsed Amendment 4.
Shaw had better luck earlier in the day, when she and other organizers set up a blue tent near an early voting site on the University of Southern Florida, Tampa, campus, where they handed out Amendment 4 merchandise and neon-colored boxes of emergency contraception. Several of the dozens of people who stopped by already knew about and supported Amendment 4. When Shaw tried to walk one woman through her pitch, the woman cut her off: “This is to end the abortion ban, right?” She then unfurled a sample ballot; all she wanted was for Shaw to tell her how to vote yes.
“I’m a nurse, so I worry about my patients’ rights too. My biggest thing with all my patients is: ‘It’s your body, it’s your choice,’” said Lauren, who asked that her last name not be published due to her conservative workplace.
She’s trying not to think about election day or what its outcome may be. “Honestly, I have no idea,” she said. “I try not to get my hopes up.”",2024-11-02
Guardian,Microsoft workers fired over Gaza vigil say company ‘crumbled under pressure’,"Two Microsoft employees who were fired last week after organizing a vigil for Palestinians killed in Gaza say the company retaliated against them for their pro-Palestinian activism.
The two, Abdo Mohamed, a researcher and data scientist, and Hossam Nasr, a software engineer, organized the event outside Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington, on 24 October. They were fired later that evening.
“Microsoft really crumbled under pressure, internally and externally, to fire me and to shut down and retaliate against our event, not because of policy violations, simply because we were daring to humanize Palestinians, and simply because we were daring to say that Microsoft should not be complicit with an army that is plausibly accused of genocide,” said Nasr, who has been criticized on social media and in internal Microsoft employee communication groups over his support for Palestine.
Both employees were members of No Azure for Apartheid, a group of Microsoft workers protesting the company’s sale of its cloud computing technology to Israel.
The group demands Microsoft sever all Azure contracts and partnerships with the Israeli military and government, disclose all ties with Israel, call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in the conflict in Gaza, and protect and uphold the free speech of employees.
Microsoft denied that the two, who are originally from Egypt, were fired for their activism. “We remain dedicated to maintaining a professional and respectful work environment and provide many avenues for all voices to be heard. But, importantly, we ask that this be done in a way that does not disrupt business operations and be aligned to our company policies and behavior expectations,” a spokesperson said.
“We do not permit employees to use devices like bullhorns and speakers in public areas to disrupt the work of their colleagues. We were clear about our policies in advance with the event organizers and instructed that this gathering take place on public property. The organizers chose to disregard this guidance and were terminated.”
But Mohamed and Nasr reject allegations that the vigil was disruptive and claim it was in accordance with Microsoft policies. They say that the event, which sought to raise money for humanitarian efforts in Gaza, followed the same procedures as other employee charity events regularly held by other employee groups. The vigil was set up outdoors during lunchtime on the Microsoft headquarters campus, with a microphone for speakers and some chairs and signs set up for attenders.
According to No Azure for Apartheid, more than 200 employees attended the vigil in person and virtually.
Nasr and Mohamed both claimed they were in communications with Microsoft ahead of time, and addressed any concerns that were brought up before the lunchtime event, the purpose of which they said was to honor Palestinian lives lost in the conflict and call attention to Microsoft’s ties to Israel. They said police were called to the event but only observed it, and that only a microphone for speakers was used.
“They never at any point said that termination was on the table or even the disciplinary consequences were on the table,” Nasr told the Guardian.
They both questioned how it happened that Nasr’s dismissal was publicized by the group Stop Antisemitism before they themselves were notified they had been fired. Nasr provided a call log showing he received a call from Microsoft at 9pm on 24 October, while the group posted on social media that Nasr was “no longer with Microsoft” an hour and a half earlier.
Nasr also alleged a double standard at the company, arguing that he had experienced repeated internal investigations and reprimands for comments about Gaza that he had posted on Microsoft internal employee groups, while posts he flagged internally for racism or personal attacks against him did not result in any disciplinary actions.
He pointed to posts insinuating he and another employee are “members of Hamas or just supporters”. As far has he knows, these never resulted in reprimands. He also said HR opened an investigation into a post of his that said: “With or without your sympathy, Palestinians will attain the dignity, the freedom, the respect, and the liberation that they deserve, everywhere from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea.” However, he reported, the company did not act when another employee wrote: “From the river to the sea, Israel will forever be.”
A Microsoft representative declined to comment on the specific examples.
The No Azure for Apartheid group characterized the firings as retaliatory and alleged Microsoft has engaged in intimidation toward Palestinian voices. The group disputed Microsoft’s claims of policy violations by the employees and is calling for their reinstatement and an explanation for the leak of their termination before the employees were themselves notified.
A Palestinian employee at Microsoft who requested to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation told the Guardian that Microsoft’s internal message board has been full of messages in recent days expressing anger at the firings. They also accused Microsoft of double standards when it comes to enforcing harassment and behavior policies toward Palestinian voices.
“It was unjust and very intentional as a message to the community to silence the loudest voice in our community,” said another Palestinian worker at Microsoft who requested to remain anonymous.
A spokesperson for Microsoft did not comment on the ‘No Azure for Apartheid’ campaign, its demands, or allegations of bias.
The spokesperson added the company was investigating the allegation that a social media post about the terminations was published by Stop Antisemitism before the employees were informed.
A report by the Israeli-Palestinian outlet +972 Magazine reported that the Israeli military has increased the purchase of services from Microsoft Azure since October 2023 and for years it had been the main cloud service provider for Israel. The company has also funded several Israeli startups that provide services to the military.
“Microsoft is refusing to hear its worker demands,” said Mohamed. “This is what’s happening within Microsoft. People are calling them out, and they’re even refusing to engage and look at serious concerns that come with the use of these technologies.”

Guardian,Did Bidenomics work? How the US economy fared over the last four years,"Joe Biden promised a “recovery for everybody” as he prepared to take over an economy ravaged by the pandemic four years ago. Few predicted what would follow.
One of two candidates – Kamala Harris, his vice-president, and Donald Trump, his predecessor – will succeed Biden in January. As millions prepare to elect the next US president, here is how the world’s largest economy fared under Biden.
Inflation
The shock waves unleashed by Covid-19 were still rippling across the world when Biden took office in January 2021. In the US, and many other economies, they set the stage for an extraordinary rise in inflation.
For months, the White House and Federal Reserve insisted the factors driving this surging price growth were “transitory”. By the time the consumer price index peaked, reaching its highest level in a generation in June 2022, officials had changed their minds.
The Fed embarked upon an aggressive campaign to tackle inflation in March 2022. Interest rates – cut to close to zero at the outset of the pandemic – were increased at 11 meetings, to a two-decade high.
Suddenly the central fear looming over the US economy was not runaway inflation, but the specter of recession. As the Fed scrambled to cool activity in an attempt to tackle prices, warnings of a prolonged downturn cast a shadow.
Jobs
Such effects failed to materialize. The US economy remained remarkably resilient.
Millions of jobs were created in the labor market. Non-farm payrolls, the key monthly measure used to take the temperature of the US economy, held firm. Unemployment slipped to lows not seen in half a century.
About 399,000 jobs were added each month in 2022, on average – followed by about 225,000 each month in 2023. While growth has trended lower over the past year, and essentially flatlined in October amid disruptions wreaked by strikes and storms, hiring in September proved unexpectedly strong.
The robust data sparked hope that policymakers would successfully guide the US economy to a so-called “soft landing”, with price growth normalized and recession avoided.
The Fed started to cut rates in September. When officials at the central bank make their next decision on Thursday, two days after the election, they are widely expected to cut rates further.
Food prices
While the US economy has remained remarkably resilient, many Americans have not been feeling it. The vibes have been off.
Earlier this year, a clear majority of Americans wrongly believed the US was in an economic recession, according to a Harris poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian. This gloom had only shifted slightly by the time pollsters reran the survey in September.
Positive economic data releases – softening inflation, healthy recruitment levels, steady growth – are unlikely to move the needle when your bank balance continues to dwindle. The cumulative effect of years of inflation are still taking a toll.
Falling inflation does not mean falling prices. The grocery store bills which rose so rapidly in 2021 and 2022 have not crashed back down to earth. For many Americans, the cost of living is much higher today than it was four years ago.
Stock markets
For Biden’s predecessor, and potential successor, no barometer of US economic success was greater than Wall Street. Reassuring his Twitter (now X) followers that Covid-19 was “very much under control” in the US in February 2020, Trump added: “Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”
It has been looking even better under his successor. The S&P 500 has rallied by more than half since Biden took office at the start of 2021, and all the major stock market indexes have hit new highs under his tenure.",2024-11-02

Guardian,Amber Glenn survives fall to win first Grand Prix figure skating title,"Amber Glenn overcame a fall and her own doubts to win a maiden Grand Prix figure skating title Saturday at the Grand Prix de France.
The American skater Glenn had the lead from Friday’s short program. That and the support of the crowd got her through a tough free skate in which she fell on a triple flip and put a hand onto the ice to steady herself on two other jumps.
“I didn’t feel that great out there today but I really tried and the audience really got me through that last half when I was doubting myself,” Glenn said. “The audience was really strong and really encouraging, so I really fought for everything I could.”
Glenn posted the day’s third-best score in the free skate but it was enough to win overall with a total of 210.44 points, ahead of Japanese skaters Wakaba Higuchi, who won at Skate America last month, and Rion Sumiyoshi.
South Korea’s Kim Chaeyeon had been second in the short program but dropped Saturday to fourth overall, one place ahead of 17-year-old US skater Sarah Everhardt, who was on her Grand Prix debut.

Guardian,Trump may become president again – but he’s already a useful idiot to the mega rich | Marina Hyde,"During his term as US president, there was an established routine to Donald Trump’s evenings in public service. When he got into bed at 6.30pm with the big cheeseburger and the bucket of Diet Coke – boudoir TVs set to “channels talking about me” – Trump liked nothing more than yakking on the phone to this billionaire or that. He whined, he bitched, he divulged, and when they finally ended the call, whichever billionaire had been on the other end of the line promptly called one of the other billionaires to laugh about it all behind his back.
“What a fucking idiot,” Rupert Murdoch once remarked after getting off a call with Trump in which Murdoch had had to explain that actually, the Silicon Valley elite did not “need” Trump’s help, as he imagined, having just enjoyed eight years where they “practically ran” the Obama administration. Obviously, Murdoch’s a notorious bitch; almost the Regina George of it all. But – also obviously – he was one of the special guys officially given “cleared caller” status in Trump’s White House, meaning they could get through to him any time. Plastics gotta plastic.
So yes – much as I am enjoying all the miles of complex in-depth coverage wondering what it is the current crop of Trump-backing billionaires want from him, I can’t help being reminded of a remark by the tech billionaire in Succession who is attempting to buy into American power and is attending a pre-election party. “I thought these people would be very complicated,” he reflects. “But they’re not. It’s basically just money and gossip.” “Oh yeah, that’s all there is,” comes the reply. “Money and gossip.”
Kamala Harris has more billionaires backing her, we keep hearing in news I think is supposed to be a matter of accomplishment for the vice-president. But the particular billionaires pulling for Trump stand on the potential threshold of huge money-and-gossip times. Among the mogul class’s truths-universally-acknowledged is the idea that money is best obtained via deregulation and tax cuts – and, in the case of, say, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, ever-more lucrative government contracts. As for how gossip is obtained … People say showbiz is mean and gossipy, but there really is no business as mean and gossipy as “mogul”. Money does not buy you happiness but it totally buys you a better quality of gossip, with the likes of Murdoch, Bezos, Steve Wynn, Stephen Schwarzman and all the others operating at an absolute weapons-grade level.
The gossip-money continuum is sort of everything to these guys, and most of them see Trump as their useful idiot. Or useful fucking idiot, in Murdoch’s case. Consider Nelson Peltz, the infamous activist investor (who British people may know as the father-in-law of would-be hot sauce mogul Brooklyn Beckham). Three years ago, Nelson was telling everyone that Trump would carry the disgrace of the 6 January insurrection for ever. “We had people shooting at each other in Congress,” Peltz fumed. “I mean, it’s beyond belief. And how could you say that is anything but his legacy?” Oh but you could, it turns out. In fact, by early this year, Nelson could be found throwing wildly lucrative fundraisers for Trump at his home. And why not? All manner of things could be in it for him. Peltz spent a chunk of Trump’s first term covertly trying to push him to launch an antitrust investigation into Amazon on account of its effect on the US Postal Service. Trump didn’t go that far that time, but he did launch a number of aggressive tweets about it. And rest assured, meanwhile, that the Amazon founder, Bezos, will have bitched a lot on the phone about that. Everybody’s always talking about everybody, in the in-crowd.
Why would you ever want to cast yourself out of this high-rollers circle jerk by appearing to have a principle or – even worse – allowing the help at one of your most junior businesses to appear to have one? In fact, speaking of Bezos, take his insistence last week that his Washington Post forego its traditional candidate endorsement editorial, a decision which has thus far seen members of its editorial board resign and caused a reported 250,000 readers to cancel their subscriptions.
Or take Howard Lutnick, the Cantor Fitzgerald CEO, who is moonlighting as a senior official on Trump’s campaign, and who recently floated the idea that all government appointees to any pending Trump administration would have to prove “fidelity and loyalty” to him. Hey – Howard’s just saying whatever needs to be said to stay in the loopy-loop. It’s not like government workers are going to be making any of the decisions anyway.
The only billionaire who doesn’t quite fit in the gang is Elon Musk. My gut says the other billionaires are not at all sure about Musk. At the Allen & Co Sun Valley conference, that annual retreat for the point-nought-nought-nought-nought-nought per cent, you suspect none of them would like to get stuck in the barefoot yurt with Elon. He’s weird, he’s creepy (but not in the Monty Burns way they’ve all legitimised), and – this is the worst part – he comes off like he might somehow take their money. Not clear how, just … vibes. His billionaire vibes are off. I would kill to hear what they say about him in the mogul phone call circle. At the very least I expect Elon to one day make an aggressive attempt to acquire WhatsApp off Mark Zuckerberg, purely so he can read all their messages slagging him off.
In the meantime, as the election bears down on the US and the wider world, we must while away our time wondering why these extremely transactional mega-rich men back this other extremely transactional mega-rich man. It would be lovely, come Wednesday morning, not to have to put one’s finger on it.

Guardian,Johnson followed McCarthy in working with Democrats. Can he avoid his fate?,"The Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, pursued the same strategy as his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, to prevent a government shutdown this month – working with Democrats to pass a bipartisan funding deal.
Now Johnson has to hope he can avoid the same fate as McCarthy, the California congressman who was ousted from the speakership by hard-right members of his own conference last year just days after the House voted to keep the government open.
The House voted 341 to 82 on Wednesday to extend government funding through 20 December, averting a shutdown that was set to begin next week. The stopgap funding bill, known as a continuing resolution, attracted the support of 132 Republicans and 209 Democrats in the House.
But 82 House Republicans, representing more than a third of Johnson’s conference, voted against the legislation. That widespread opposition could spell trouble for the future of Johnson’s speakership.
It was only a year ago that eight hard-right Republicans joined 208 Democrats to oust McCarthy from the speaker’s chair less than a year after his election. The congressman Matt Gaetz, who led the charge against McCarthy, had fiercely criticized the then speaker for working with Democrats to keep the government open.
In the days leading up to the shutdown deadline last year, McCarthy initially tried to pass a more rightwing funding proposal with only Republican support. That bill failed after 21 House Republicans, including Gaetz, voted against it. The failure forced McCarthy to take up a more neutral funding bill that ultimately received more support from Democrats than Republicans, just as Johnson’s bill did on Wednesday. McCarthy’s act of bipartisanship prevented a shutdown but cost him his job, after Gaetz forced a vote on a motion to vacate the chair.
That historic vote kicked off weeks of chaos in the House, as Republicans repeatedly tried and failed to unify around a new speaker. In the end, Johnson, who was House Republicans’ fourth speaker nominee in the three weeks after McCarthy’s removal, emerged victorious and seized the gavel.
Now Johnson finds himself in the same position that McCarthy did. Last week, Johnson tried to pass a more rightwing funding bill that was combined with the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (Save) Act, which would require people to show proof of citizenship when they register to vote. But that bill failed to pass, as 14 House Republicans and all but two House Democrats voted against the proposal.
After that setback, Johnson reckoned with a reality he had ignored for weeks: that the only way to fund the government would be to pass a continuing resolution narrow enough to win Democrats’ support.
The concession sparked outrage among some hard-right Republicans, who condemned the continuing resolution as another symptom of reckless government spending. But it remains unclear what their frustration will mean for the speaker’s future, and unlike McCarthy, Johnson’s prospects may benefit from the election calendar.
With less than six weeks left until election day, Johnson repeatedly warned fellow Republicans that it would be “political malpractice” to shut down the government. In a “Dear Colleague” letter sent on Sunday, Johnson cited polling showing that 63% of independent voters, who will play a crucial role in House elections, opposed a government shutdown.
Johnson has bristled at comparisons between him and his predecessor, insisting his strategy is nothing like McCarthy’s because of the “very different circumstances” of the latest funding fight. And Johnson has already survived one threat to his speakership, after the House easily quashed the congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene’s resolution to oust him back in May. Greene had attacked Johnson over his reliance on Democratic support to pass several major bills, but a bipartisan coalition voted to kill Greene’s motion to remove the speaker.
But more Republicans may turn against Johnson if Donald Trump lashes out against the speaker over the shutdown fight. Trump had previously called on Republican lawmakers to reject any funding deal unless it was linked to “election security” measures, a demand that was not met. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Johnson insisted there was “no daylight” between his position and Trump’s.
“President Trump understands the current dilemma and the situation that we’re in,” Johnson said. “I keep him apprised all the time of everything that’s happening because he is our nominee for president, and he’s going to be the next president, so we’ll continue working closely together. I’m not defying President Trump. We’re getting our job done, and I think he understands that.”
Even if Johnson can keep Trump in his corner, his efforts to keep the speakership may be for naught depending on the results of the elections in November. Democrats only need to win five more seats than they did in 2022 to retake the majority, which would probably elevate the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, to the position.
Asked about his expectations for November, Johnson said he was “very optimistic”, but he sidestepped a question about whether he would run for minority leader if Republicans lost the House.
“We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it,” Johnson said on Wednesday after the vote. “I believe we’re going to hold the House, and I intend to be the speaker in the new Congress.”
Time will tell whether Johnson’s colleagues have other plans for him.",2024-09-26
Guardian,The Biden Crime Family by Rudy Giuliani review – hapless is as hapless does,"As a federal prosecutor, Rudy Giuliani sent a congressman to jail, locked up mobsters and perp-walked Wall Street bankers. As mayor of New York City, he made the streets safe. After 9/11, he reassured a frightened city.
But ambition and hard living got the better of him.
His appearance in the second Borat movie four years ago, shoving his hands down his pants in a hotel room, is an image best forgotten – but very hard to actually forget. His work as Donald Trump’s personal lawyer lingers too. After Trump’s defeat in 2020, as Giuliani pushed the voter fraud lie under lights and cameras, hair dye ran down his face. Another scene for the ages.
Disgraced and disbarred, Giuliani stands criminally indicted in Georgia (with Trump) and Arizona too. In Manhattan, a federal judge recently ordered Giuliani to hand valuables and his Upper East Side penthouse to Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, Georgia election workers he defamed. The former mayor owes the two women $150m – and still he rants and raves. Last week at Madison Square Garden, at Trump’s hate-fest rally, Giuliani was just another warm-up act.
This week, seven days before election day, Giuliani published The Biden Crime Family. Another stab at relevance, it is less a book than an opposition research dump gone awry, another reminder of its author’s shambolic descent. It was written for a different presidential race, the one that existed until Joe Biden withdrew in July. Months later, here it is. Hapless is as hapless does.
There is some autobiography, inevitably interesting given Giuliani’s picaresque career. He revels in his past triumphs as a federal prosecutor – but in doing so, burns Trump again.
A rehash of the 1986 trial of Stanley Friedman starts off with a description of the “very powerful – and very corrupt – boss of the Democratic party in New York’s Bronx borough” who Giuliani set out to take down. So far, so good.
“He was a lobbyist who got people hired, then used that influence to get what he wanted. At the time, he wielded a great deal of power within New York Mayor Ed Koch’s city hall government.” Still good.
But here’s the thing: as reported by CBS in 2016, during cross-examination Rudy highlighted Friedman’s relationship with Roy Cohn – then Trump’s personal lawyer and fixer, the role Giuliani would later hold himself.
Giuliani: “And you told us during your direct examination, Mr Friedman, that during the latter part of time that you were deputy mayor, you had meetings with Roy Cohn and talked about joining his law firm; isn’t that correct?
Friedman: “Roy Cohn told me sometime prior to [that], ‘When you leave government, if you are ever interested in coming with my firm, let’s talk, and I’m interested in you.’ Words to that effect.”
Giuliani: “Now, isn’t it a fact that in your last week to 10 days in office, you signed for the very profitable deals with one of Roy Cohn’s major clients, Donald Trump – multi-million-dollar deals? You signed while you were deputy mayor, and you were going to his law firm a couple of days, if not a week later? … You knew that Donald Trump was a client of Roy Cohn … You knew he was a client of the law firm that you were about to join, a couple of days later?”
Friedman: “Yes, I did.”
Game, set, match. Friedman got 12 years.
Decades later, awaiting his own courtroom fate, Giuliani attributes his legal problems and those of Trump to persecution by “a fascist regime”. Practically speaking, the F-word is not one Giuliani should be dropping right now, and not just because John Kelly, Trump’s former chief-of-staff, recently called Trump a fascist.
Back in 2000, the Village Voice published an examination of Giuliani’s family history by Wayne Barrett, the great investigative reporter and biographer of both Giuliani and Trump. Barrett described conversations round the Giuliani dinner table during the second world war. Harold Giuliani, Rudy’s father, was there, rather than at the front – because he was a mob enforcer and stick-up guy who’d done time in Sing Sing, and was therefore not the kind of guy Uncle Sam wanted in uniform.
As Barrett wrote of Rudy’s mom, meanwhile, “The fact that their homeland was an Axis country did not diminish Helen Giuliani’s sense of patriotism. ‘She liked Mussolini and things like that,’” recalled Anna, Rudy’s aunt.
There’s more – though not, of course, in Giuliani’s new book. In 1989, amid Giuliani’s first campaign for mayor, news broke of a concentration camp survivor, Simon Berger, attending Giuliani’s office for questioning, only to be forced to sit near a blackboard bearing the message “Arbeit Macht Frei”, the slogan on the gates of Auschwitz. Alleging “Nazi tactics”, Berger was acquitted.
As Giuliani now writes: “I’m going to quote my good friend Steve Bannon, who always says, ‘There are NO conspiracies but there are NO coincidences.’”
Giuliani’s book was released on Tuesday – the day Bannon was himself released from prison after serving four months for contempt of Congress. Bannon gives Giuliani a foreword. It lacks the fire and fury of past pronouncements by Trump’s former White House strategist. Calling Giuliani a “brilliant lawyer”, Bannon concludes: “It will be clear to any American, after reading this book, that the Biden family … and even non-blood-related close allies – are a threat to the United States.”
To repeat: Biden hasn’t been a candidate for re-election for three months and more.
Still, none of these folks are prepared to leave the stage. Four years ago, Trump pardoned Bannon on fraud and conspiracy charges. In December, Bannon will go on trial in New York, in connection with an alleged border wall scam. It’s a state case, so no presidential pardon is possible. Elsewhere, Trump and Giuliani face their own felony indictments. Next week’s election will do much to determine how long either stays free.

Guardian,Harris v Trump: election campaigns pit the traditionalist against the troll,"Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are making their last-ditch pitches to voters, both crisscrossing the swing states furiously enough to rack up millions of airline points if they were flying commercial – but in other respects running two very different styles of campaign.
On Monday last week, Harris was in three battleground states hoping to win over moderate Republicans with a series of traditional campaign events. On the same day, Trump dressed up as a McDonald’s worker to serve French fries in suburban Philadelphia, trolling Harris’s own experience working at a McDonald’s franchise in the early 1980s.
“Hello, everybody. It’s my first day at McDonald’s, I’m looking for a job,” Trump said as he entered the restaurant, which had been closed for the purposes of the stunt and where the customers driving up to the drive-thru window were carefully vetted.
A week later, with the White House as a backdrop, Harris gave a forceful closing argument about turning the page on the Trump era, standing at a podium in Washington DC where her opponent held the 6 January 2021 rally that ended with his supporters storming the US Capitol to overthrow the democratic results of the election.
Trump, meanwhile, responded to the outcry about his rally in New York’s Madison Square Garden where a comedian called Puerto Rico “a floating island of garbage” – and Joe Biden’s awkward response – by rolling up to a Wisconsin rally in a white garbage truck, in dark orange makeup and wearing a bright orange safety vest.
“How do you like my garbage truck?” he asked reporters. “This truck is in honor of Kamala and Joe Biden.”
The two approaches could not be more different.
One candidate – Harris – is running a largely traditional political campaign hoping to persuade undecided college-educated suburbanites and women of all races and education that Trump is set on taking away their rights. Unlike Hillary Clinton in her failed election bid in 2016, Harris has barely mentioned the potential significance of the US electing its first female president, let alone its first Black female president.
The other candidate – Trump – hopes to energize his white working-class base and to reach politically unengaged young men of all ethnic backgrounds who may feel left behind or disparaged by the cultural upheavals of the social justice and racial equality movements. To reach them, Trump has looked to viral stunts and podcasts – such as his three-hour sit-down with Joe Rogan, which 36 million people listened to on YouTube alone. While Harris has so far declined to also sit down with Rogan, she has been on other large podcasts, though the tactic feels less central to her campaign.
Fundamentally, the two campaigns reflect their candidates and their supporters. Harris wants to appeal to Democrat loyalists and moderate Republicans, Trump to parts of the working class who may feel Democrats condescend to them.
“It’s a traditional Democratic problem,” says the Democratic strategist Hank Sheinkopf. “She’s acting as the president, he’s acting as the populist.”
Trump has attended mixed-martial arts fights and football games, while relying on personal outreach at mass rallies across the country – particularly in districts such as Butler, Pennsylvania (where he came close to being assassinated in July), that are on the cusp of turning from rural to suburban.
Those rallies are often seen as a form of community bonding for his followers, with tailgate parties and bake-offs.
Some attenders at the Butler rally told the Guardian they were shocked by the attempted assassination but also disappointed that they had missed the opportunity to hear Trump, with his lengthy, freewheeling stories about electrocution and sharks, peppered with ominous talk of “enemies within” and personal insults.
Meanwhile, Trump has largely rejected interviews with traditional media outlets, in which he would probably face an intense grilling that he rarely receives from the more friendly exposure he otherwise courts. For example, Trump turned down an interview with CBS’s popular 60 Minutes; Harris accepted. Harris has been interviewed on CNN, Trump has not.
Trump also refused to do a second TV debate with Harris, after she was widely seen to have won the first, unless it was moderated by the hard-right-leaning Fox News.
It remains to be seen which tactic will work on the US’s 2024 electorate – the populist trying to shatter America’s political norms or the traditionalist warning against the explicit dangers and threats that Trump represents.
At the moment the polls have the pair virtually neck and neck across the country as a whole and in the crucial swing states that are the key to winning the White House. With just a few days until election day, almost all pollsters agree that either Harris or Trump could win and that at the moment the election promises to be historically close.
In that way, the different tactics of the two candidates perhaps represent simply a divided nation that each is trying to appeal to.
“She’s traditional, he is not,” says Sheinkopf. “She’s acting as the president, he’s acting as the populist. The French fries were a populist thing to do. You can’t manage Kamala Harris doing that … It’s a divided country, nothing is in the middle.”",2024-11-01

72 mins. There’s a lot of defending to do for England, as NZ have started to pepper them with kicks to compete the latest of which is this close to being won by Tele’a as Freeman knocks it on.
THe next scrum has another penalty awarded to the All Blacks and they will have a lineout in the 22. This feels ominous for the home side.
69 mins. Slowly, the NZ scrum is starting to assert itself, and young Fin Baxter folds under pressure from the All Black push. Penalty awarded, but NZ can’t win their own lineout and the games is stalled near halfway.
PENALTY! England 22-17 New Zealand (Damien McKenzie)
67 mins. The All Blacks are working carries in the England half, but the defensive intensity has increased from the home side. They are stopping everything and in the end Itoje is in to rip the ball out at the breakdown. But the TMO intervenes as he saw a no arms tackle from Earl.
McKenzie pulls three points back and we’re in for a very interesting last 13 mins or so.
65 mins. Harry Randall feeds and England scrum on their own 22. It’s solid as a rock and there’s a textbook exit drill to find Ford who locates touch with a kick.
63 mins. We’re in the final quarter and the benches are pretty much emptied. Will there be enough continuity and composure from either side to get over the line. Advantage England presently, obviously, as NZ have to score twice.
60 mins. Meanwhile, back and where it all happened, Smith tees the ball up and hammers it through the posts. That feels like a very important few minutes for the outcome of the match.
DISALLOWED TRY! England 19-14 New Zealand (Beauden Barrett)
59 mins. The ball is loose on the ground after Clarke knocks it on, but England gather and continue and so play goes on. But soon after the ball back in NZ hands and Barrett is over to ground it. There a ringing boos from the crowd as they consider the Clarke intervention to be a deliberate knock-on.
Ref Gardner decides to take a look and the concurs with the howls. NO TRY and penalty to England!
57 mins. There are two attempts at an attack from the lineout by England, both of which come to nowt. But NZ make an even bigger horlicks of their go of clearing their lines as tehy overwork the offloads and the ball spills forward under pressure from Tom Curry’s chase.
England have a free kick from the scrum and Smith decides to simply whomp it up in the air for everyone chase as it comes down on the NZ tryline! Wonderful, chaos inducing stuff that sees Freeman get his hands on it but the All Black defence smother him.
55 mins. Marcus Smith hammers a 50:22 kick behind Tele’a to win his side a lineout deep in NZ territory. That was the latest expression of what a mature and assured performance* this has been from the Quins man
52 mins. Earl fishes the ball out of a retreating England scrum, but the ball pops out of hands to Caleb Clarke who races forward and puts the white defence on the back foot. But again, there’s not precision and the attack breaks down.
England have a new front row: Theo Dan, Fin Baxter, Dan Cole replace Genge, George and Stuart.
49 mins. England go wide to wide with a cross kick to Freeman on the left then worked all the way back right via hands to Feyi-Waboso. The wing puts his head down and into contact but he holds on for too long and it’s a penalty to NZ around halfway.
TRY! England 19-14 New Zealand (Immanuel Feyi-Waboso)
45 mins. Tuipolotu has a big carry in the England half, but on the recycled possession Smith races out of the line to intercept the pass to Jordan and he’s away and running for 5o metres. He doesn’t have the legs to go all the way, but he calmly feeds Furbank on the inside who pops to Feyi-Waboso in support who finishes off a superb try, the perfect mix of opportunism and class.
43 mins. A clever kick by Smith turns Tele’a around as he’s forced to retreat to field it on the ground. The winger does enough under pressure to show his defensive work has improved of late.
“This has been a pretty watchable game so far, Lee,” reckons Guy Hornsby. “England’s defence has been full on and risky, they’ve let the All Blacks in at times, but they’ve scrambled well. England have not quite clicked, and for a couple of balls going wide of hands from both sides, this could be a rollicking 25-20 game. The All Blacks have been electric at times, but England have been full of vigour and are very much in touch, but that last drop goal attempt summed up the England half. But they’ve quietly got on top in the scrum. That may prove fruitful.”
40 mins. An England lineout is quick off the top, but it all gets gummed up in midfield and is going nowhere before NZ let them off by Vaai’i coming in from the side.
Off the next possession nothing much is happening so Smith has an attempt at another drop goal. The best I can say about it is that it was better than the last one awful one. 0.000012% better is still better, OK? Give the lad a break.
38 mins. Another incredible jinking, sprinting run from Sititi has him in the open. He flings a long pass left to Vaa’i but it’s just in front of him and the big second row can’t get down low to grip it on the England 22. So very close to another try for the visitors. Sititi an absolute menace when on the hoof.
33 mins. A massive shot on Tupou Vaa’i by Cunningham-South wakes the crowd up. The England backrow jumps up and is giving it the full WWE to the crowd to whip them up. If there were ropes around the pitch he’d be standing on the second turn buckle and chinning two cans of beer, Stone Cold style.
31 mins. Another tackle off the ball by NZ, this time from Sam Cane, has ref Gardner having a long chat with Scott Barrett about sorting it or it’s card time. Smith slots another kick to keep his side in touch on the board.
As I said before, England’s defence is tenacious, but that try came from NZ working out that the energy means they are liable to over-defend via too many people rushing out to give it the large one in the tackle. Beauden Barrett is far too cute a player to not unlock this and that’s exactly what happened.
Poor Ellis Genge has been left flailing for both All Black tries, but he’s blameless in fairness to him.
28 mins. The ball is moving left as Beauden Barrett runs diagonally, pulling Feyi-Waboso in, before he pops the ball to Jordan on a scissor angle who eases around a scrambling Genge into open pasture to sprint over the line from 25 metres.
26 mins. More lost possession from a handling error, this one from England in the NZ half. The All Blacks work it quickly to Sititi in midfield who gasses through a gap and over halfway – he is RAPID for a backrower, let me tell you. The attack breaks down at the next breakdown.
23 mins. Feyi-Waboso has been very busy in the opening quarter and his latest contribution is to gather a kick on his own 22 and drop his shoulder to beat the chasing defender to race 25 metres. He’s brought to a halt as he’s absolutely clattered (legally) by Aumua.
21 mins. SponsorNameDome at Twickenham jumps to life as Ben Spencer breaks on halfway. He chip, chases and gathers his own kick in the NZ half but he’s just in touch as he looks to bear down on the Will Jordan. Flag up, whistle blown, everyone sits down again.
18 mins. The scoreboard is a fair reflection of the game so far, both sides have had some territory and some moments but it remains even. England’s new defence under Joe El Abt looks energetic and tenacious.
17 mins. Our first real look at a first phase attack pattern from NZ, and they are very nearly through the England defence via a looping run from Tele’a and a pop pass to Ioane on the angle. The centre is offloading again but Lawrence does a good job of getting amongst it an forcing Ioane to drop the ball.
Ioane hurt his hand in the midst of that, and is replaced by Anton Lienert-Brown
15 mins. The game is high energy and with concomitant lack of poise at times, especially these last few minutes of both sides a little jittery. The latest breakdown of play is a Spencer knock-on which gives NZ a scrum platform just inside the England half.
12 mins. It’s end-to-end stuff as England find themselves back in the NZ 22 with another advantage for a tackle off the ball. This is due to All Black tacklers being too keen with their anticipation of the ball arriving in the hands of their marked man, but unfortunately for them it never arrives.
On the advantage Smith floppily attempts a drop goal with a boot like a bag of overcooked ramen.
No matter as he beckons for the tee and slots this one with a far more assured kick.
9 mins. The first visit of the All Blacks to the England 22 has Wallace Sititi carrying into contact and flipping and delightful offload to Tele’a who looks up, sees Genge in front of him and does the prop with a quick in-to-out step before galloping up the left touchline and over the line. Lovely stuff.
Barrett hammers a great conversion over from out wide.
7 mins. NZ look to move the ball left, but the English defence is up quick and forcing Beauden Barrett into a kick that is fielded by a covering Smith. The England 10 looks up and fires a punchy kick one bounce into touch back in All Black territory. Sensible option.
4 mins. The home side are working some phases before Martin can’t grasp a pass in his massive lock mitts. The ball is forward, but the advantage was still rolling meaning Smith can call for the tee and put three points on the board.
2 mins. Beauden Barrett attempts to find Clarke with a kick pass on the NZ 22, but Feyi-Waboso is up in his face to spoil possessions. The ball squirts loose and it puts England on the attack with an advantage
The national anthem formalities out of the way, it’s time for the Haka.
There’s been some noise about this in recent days after Joe Marler’s controversial comment that it’s “ridiculous” and “needs binning”. Of course by controversial I mean boring, unoriginal and been said about 5.7 million times before. He’s since apologised saying it was out of context, although quite how it could be given it was the only thing written in the post, and that post was on his own X feed. Patently nonsense.
Anyway, the haka happened here and it was great theatre and brilliant as always. The crowd responded by singing an slavery related song – which is an interesting choice.
“I enjoyed The Game (1997),” says Conor Galaska, “though it is a minor work in David Fincher’s filmography. It uses a weirdly common twist in movies too, which undercuts a lot of the film’s earlier tension.”
Expect a similar situation when the All Blacks score a late winner after looking out of it for most of the match.
Steve Borthwick is a consistently sensible man and this is reflected in his “as you were” selection; something that is his hallmark of late. Injury keeps out Ollie Chessum, meaning George Martin partners Maro Itoje in the second row while Tom Curry continues his return from injury as he’s selected at openside. There’s a 6-2 bench which features a return for Nick Isiekwe and Harry Randall.
For the visitors, Beauden Barrett is trusted to bring his cocktail of experience and outrageous yet sensible talent to the 10 shirt, where he partners Cortez Rataima in the halves. Damien McKenzie is among the replacements.

Welcome the the SponsorNameDome here in Twickenham for the curtain raiser of the Autumn International 2024 series for England as they take on the not currently as mighty as they used to be but still probably mighty enough New Zealand.
If one were to view this fixture as the final match in the three test series that started in the summer down in Aotearoa, then for the All Blacks this is a dead rubber given they won both matches back in July. However, England will know how close that mini series was and recall the agony they felt flying home so there’s nothing dead about this game for Steve Borthwick’s men. New Zealand will want a win to see a smoother improvement trendline than has so far been evident under the Scott Robertson regime.
The home side have seen developments in their attacking game in the past 12 months, and if this season’s Premiership season is anything to go by then the ball will be flung about all the circumspection of a Liz Truss budget. But the game is also played without possession and this is the first outing for England since the controversial departure of defence coach Felix Jones.
It was a tight affair a few months ago between the two nations and we can expect more of the same here, methinks.",2024-11-02

Guardian,Harris to call for tougher border action on Arizona visit; Trump threatens to prosecute Google for ‘bad stories’ – as it happened,"Harris meets border patrol agents on tour of border wall in Arizona
Kamala Harris has arrived at the US-Mexico border in Arizona, where the vice-president was briefed by two customs and border protection officials.
Harris stepped out of her motorcade on a dusty desert road outside Douglas, Arizona, and shook hands with two men, the Associated Press reported. Harris chatted with the uniformed agents as they walked along the rust-colored border wall in temperatures that neared 100F (38C).
The section of the wall Harris is viewing was constructed during Barack Obama’s administration, in 2011-2012, according to the White House pool reporter.
Harris’s conversation with the CBP officers was not audible to the pool reporter on scene. A White House official told him that Harris had “heard directly from CBP officials on their efforts to combat traffickers and transnational criminal organizations”.
Kamala Harris delivered a speech on immigration policy, laying out the balance she wants to strike: what’s important to her about the US immigration system is that “it works in an orderly way, that it is humane and that it makes our country stronger”.
Donald Trump threatened to prosecute Google for “displaying bad stories” about him. In the middle of a busy day of presidential campaign events in Michigan, a key swing state, Donald Trump posted on his social media platform that, if elected president, he plans to prosecute Google for, he alleged, “only revealing and displaying bad stories about Donald J Trump” while “only revealing Good stories about Kamala Harris”.
And, the Department of Justicefiled a lawsuit against the state ofAlabama for last-minute voter purges. The justice department is suing Alabama for what it alleges is an illegal attempt to remove voters from the rolls too close to November’s election.
Here’s what else happened today:
Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke after his meeting in New York with Donald Trump and said the two men had a “very productive” talk. Ukraine’s president said the two “thoroughly reviewed” the situation in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion more than two-and-a-half years ago, Reuters reports.
In a video address on Friday, the FBI director, Christopher Wray, spoke of the indictment of three Iranian nationals for their role in a “wide-ranging hacking campaign sponsored by the government of Iran”. Wray said: “These individuals, employees of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, targeted a US political campaign, current and former US officials, and members of the American media, all in an attempt to sow discord and undermine our democracy.”
Kamala Harrisarrived in Tucson, Arizona, from Washington DC for election campaign events, including a visit to the US-Mexico border.
Kamala HarrisandDonald Trumpare tied among voters in North Carolina, a new poll shows. The CNN poll, released today and conducted from 20 to 25 September, shows Harris and Trump both receiving 48% of support among likely voters in North Carolina.
Eric Adams, the New York City mayor, pleaded not guilty to corruption charges when he appeared in court in Manhattan. He denies federal bribery and fraud charges. The mayor’s arraignment began just after noon local time at a federal courthouse in New York. It is the first time that a sitting mayor of the city has been charged with crimes.
AfterKamala Harrisspoke about her policies related to the southern border during a speech inDouglas, Arizona, the National Border Patrol Council, the labor union representing the US border patrol, said that Harris “has ignored the border problem she created for over three years”.
“She goes down there for 20 minutes for a photo op and decides to repeat some of the things the NPBC has said before. But again, where has she been the last 3 1/2 years?” the union wrote on X, repeating a Trump talking point.
Google followed up on Donald Trump’s claim that the search engine is illegally using a system to only reveal bad stories about him and good stories about Kamala Harris by issuing a statement:
Both campaign websites consistently appear at the top of Search for relevant and common search queries,.
Following up on a report by Fox News, Google continued: “This report looked at a single rare search term on a single day a few weeks ago, and even for that search, both candidates’ websites ranked in the top results on Google.”
Here’s some more in-depth reporting from the Associated Press, capturing how the reality of what is happening at the border has changed dramatically in the past few months, even as the political rhetoric (Trump’s in particular) really hasn’t:
As midnight nears, the lights of El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, fill the sky on the silent banks of the Rio Grande. A few months ago, hundreds of asylum-seeking families, including crying toddlers, waited for an opening to crawl through razor wire from Juarez into El Paso.
No one is waiting there now.
Nearly 500 miles away, in the border city of Eagle Pass, large groups of migrants that were once commonplace are rarely seen on the riverbanks these days.
In McAllen, at the other end of the Texas border, two Border Patrol agents scan fields for five hours without encountering a single migrant.
It’s a return to relative calm after an unprecedented surge of immigrants through the southern border in recent years. But no one would know that listening to Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump talking about border enforcement at dueling presidential campaign events. And no one would know from the rate at which Texas is spending on a border crackdown called Operation Lone Star – $11 billion since 2021.
If you’re looking to put both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris’sclaims about what’s happening at the US-Mexico border in context, this article from August is a good place to start:
Here’s how Hamed Aleaziz, a longtime immigration reporter, summed up the substance of Harris’s immigration policy today for the New York Times:
In a sign of how the politics of immigration have changed, Harris is promoting a policy that resembles a Trump-era effort to ban asylum for those who cross the border illegally. Harris says that she understands that people are desperate to come into the United States, but that the system must be ‘orderly.’
In the same speech, Harris slammed Trump for separating immigrant children from their families and putting “children in cages”, and called for a gentler rhetoric about immigrants, and a focus on solutions, rather than blame and attacks.
Harris is getting big cheers from a Democratic audience as she shifts from talking about tough enforcement and Congress’s failures to pass immigration reform to talking about legal paths to citizenship for immigrants who have been in the US for years, the importance of helping “Dreamers” – undocumented young people who came to the US as children – and the many contributions of immigrant farm workers.
Harris is repeating a central part of her immigration rhetoric: that Donald Trump deliberately torpedoed a bipartisan immigration reform bill because “he prefers to run on a problem than fixing a problem.”
Harris’s campaign, like the Biden administration previously, is highlighting Mitch McConnell’s own remarks about Trump’s influence on the legislation.
The White House has been using this approach to the immigration issue since early this year: “Congressional Republicans do not care about securing the border or fixing America’s broken immigration system,” Biden said in a statement in early 2024. “If they did, they would have voted for the toughest border enforcement in history.”
As Kamala Harris begins her speech on immigration policy, she lays out the balance she wants to strike: what’s important to her about the US immigration system is that “it works in an orderly way, that it is humane and that it makes our country stronger”.
Among the people who introduced Kamala Harris, who is beginning her remarks on immigration and border policy, was Theresa Guerrero, a woman from Tucson, Arizona, who has become an activist after her son, Jacob, died of a fentanyl overdose.
Trump’s campaign also previously featured remarks, during the Republican national convention, from a parent of a child lost to fentanyl.
The Harris campaign is already attacking Donald Trump using a video of his comments from Warren, Michigan, tonight, talking about tariffs and how prosperous the US was in the 1890s.
Trump has been making the case for high taxes on imported goods, which Congressional Republicans who oppose tariffs hope they can “water down” if he’s elected, the Washington Post reported yesterday.
Mark Kelly,the US senator from Arizona, has been shepherding Harris during her visit to the border town of Douglas on Friday.
Kelly began his remarks by sending greetings from his wife, the former Arizona representative Gabby Giffords, setting off a round of cheers for the beloved former representative.
He retold the story of negotiating the bipartisan border deal in Congress only to see Trump torpedo the package by pressuring Republican senators to reject it.
“This is the most hypocritical thing I’ve seen in three-and-a-half years in Washington,” Kelly said, calling the plan “the deal that Arizona needs”. Harris has vowed to revive the bill, if elected, and said she would have signed it into law.
Kelly ended his remarks by saying that the playbook for winning in November was simple: hard work.
“This is not rocket science. If it was, I could help,” the former astronaut quipped, as he campaigned for the vice-president.
Biden embraced a more Trump-like border policy. Trump still claims Harris is weak.
Some context, as we wait for Harris to give a campaign speech in the border town of Douglas, Arizona, where she is expected to call for tougher action at the US border with Mexico:
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris made criticism of Trump’s harsh immigration policies part of their bid for the White House in 2020. But the Democratic administration has increasingly moved right on immigration, leading to criticisms that, though Biden certainly does not verbally attack and revile immigrants as Trump does, Biden’s actual policy regarding the US-Mexico border made him a kind of Trump 2.0.
Harris, who supported decriminalizing undocumented border crossings in 2019 during her brief presidential run, has moved away from that stance in her new campaign, also striking a more law-and-order tone, which she is expected to continue in her border policy speech today.
Trump has made political attacks against Harris, blaming her for the border crisis, a central part of his campaign against her. Polls have suggested US voters trust Trump more than Harris on immigration.
The global picture: in the US, as in the UK and Europe, wealthy democracies have spent decades trying to deter immigrants from coming across their borders to seek a better life by making border crossings increasingly surveilled, militarized and deadly. This has not, broadly speaking, stopped people from continuing to migrate in hopes of finding safer lives for themselves and their families, particularly as wars, climate change and other crises provide reasons to seek asylum elsewhere. But deterrence policies do mean that children and adult attempting to migrate are more likely to die because of the conditions that wealthy countries create at their borders, in hopes of persuading people that it’s too dangerous to migrate.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll last month found that 43% of voters favored Trump on the issue of immigration and 33% favored Harris, while 24% either didn’t know, chose someone else or declined to answer, Reuters reports.
Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s town hall in Warren, Michigan, is running about an hour behind schedule, the New York Times reports. (The Detroit Free Press has a livestream here, should you wish to follow along.)
PBS also has a livestream of Kamala Harris’s expected campaign remarks on border policy in Douglas, Arizona, that will go live in about a half-hour.
Asked what she had learned from her conversation with customs and border protection officials, Kamala Harris told today’s White House pool reporter:
They’ve got a tough job and they need, rightly, support to do their job. They are very dedicated. And so I’m here to talk with them about what we can continue to do to support them. And also thank them for the hard work they do.",2024-09-28
Guardian,Liz Cheney calls Trump would-be tyrant as he imagines ‘guns trained on her face’,"Donald Trump has called former congresswoman Liz Cheney a radical war hawk and said she should face being under fire with rifles “shooting at her” – prompting the anti-Trump Republican to warn the public against dictatorship and a presidential candidate who “wants to be a tyrant”.
Cheney recently endorsed Kamala Harris and has campaigned with her, trying to persuade Republicans who don’t want Trump to win another term in the White House in this election to vote for the Democratic ticket of the US vice-president and her running mate, Tim Walz.
Harris on Friday said Trump’s violent rhetoric about Cheney “must be disqualifying” ahead of the 5 November presidential election. Meanwhile, the Arizona attorney general, Kris Mayes, on Friday said her office had opened a “death threat investigation” surrounding Trump’s comments about Cheney.
While still in office, Cheney co-chaired the bipartisan special House committee that investigated Trump’s conduct on January 6, when extremist supporters of his stormed the US Capitol to try, in vain, to stop the certification of Joe Biden’s electoral victory over him. She lost her Wyoming seat in 2022 as Trump supporters turned against her. Trump has called for her to be jailed for investigating him.
Trump was in Arizona on Thursday evening, doing a sit-down talk with the conservative broadcaster Tucker Carlson, and he brought up Cheney in the context of her father, Dick Cheney, the former vice-president who was a hawkish architect of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003 during the George W Bush administration. Trump has been critical of that war and has also criticized the current US president, Joe Biden, for becoming involved in Ukraine’s struggling defense against the invasion by Russia.
“She’s a radical war hawk,” he said of Liz Cheney. Then said: “Let’s put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her. Let’s see how she feels about it. You know, when the guns are trained on her face.”
Early on Friday, Cheney issued a stinging response on X.
“This is how dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death. We cannot entrust our country and our freedom to a petty, vindictive, cruel, unstable man who wants to be a tyrant. #Womenwillnotbesilenced #VoteKamala,” she posted.
Trump made his comments on Thursday about Cheney after complaining that Democratic criticism of his campaign had fueled what according to authorities were two failed assassination attempts against him.
Mayes told Arizona’s 12News it was not yet clear whether Trump’s comment amounted to protected free speech or a criminal threat.
“That’s the question, whether it did cross the line. It’s deeply troubling,” Mayes said, according to Reuters. “It is the kind of thing that riles people up and that makes our situation in Arizona and other states more dangerous.”
Cheney has said she has never voted for a Democrat before but will do so “proudly” for Harris in this election to ensure Trump never holds a position of public trust again. Her father will join her in casting his ballot for Harris.",2024-11-01
Guardian,"This tight race is, in part, about sexist backlash. But feminists can lash back, too | Moira Donegan","There’s one story of the 2024 presidential contest that says that this election is all about men, and their anger. Men, in this account, have gotten a raw deal: the decline of the industrial economy in the years since the postwar boom means that many of the jobs that gave dignity, structure, and steady paychecks to their fathers are now gone, and some men, especially those without college degrees, have fallen into a cycle of desperation and despair, unable to make the kind of living for which they could respect themselves.
This economic argument about men is usually followed by a cultural one: that women aren’t as nice to men as they should be, or maybe not as nice to men as they used to be. On one end of this conversation, there are paeans to male loneliness and discussions of the male suicide rate, quasi-poetic odes to their depths of despair and acute feeling: women just don’t understand what it’s like to be sad the way that men are sad.
On the other end, writers and commentators point to more recent cultural trends that they say have alienated men, making them feel attacked or unnecessary. They point, apparently seriously, to the fact that some young feminists online have used the term “toxic masculinity,” which they say makes men feel bad, bad enough that their feelings are an emergency for the nation. They point to those t-shirts that were popular in 2017 that said, “The Future Is Female.” This, too, is reflective of a great social pathology, a sign that we as a nation have failed men and boys. Why, they plead, can’t the future be male?
Those who worry for the state of men may be right that young men and boys feel this way. They may be right that the men of America are small-minded and narcissistic enough that they can be driven to depression and self-doubt by the sight of a novelty t-shirt that doesn’t defer to them sufficiently. They may be right that women’s modest but real gains over the past decades – their surge into the paid workforce in the decades since the second wave era, their more modest efforts to encourage a more egalitarian realignment of their private heterosexual relationships – have driven men to the brink. They may be right that men, now, feel nothing so much as resentment and anger at women, and are motivated by nothing so strongly as a desire to punish them. That, at least, seems to be the bet that Donald Trump is making.
In the waning days of the election, it seems that the Trump campaign has placed a lot of its hopes in the support of these angry young men, hoping to use misogynist resentment to drive them to the polls. Much has been made of the gender gap in this year’s election, which is especially stark among young voters: polls show Trump winning men under 30 by a comfortable margin and Harris winning women of the same age cohort by an even larger one.
A conventional politician would have tried to narrow this divide, tailoring his message to try and make it more appealing to women voters. Trump has not taken this approach. In the waning days of his campaign, he and his supporters have emphasized their misogynist rancor, anti-woman grievance, and chauvinist policy agenda at every turn.
There was Tucker Carlson, the Trump surrogate and fired Fox News Host, who compared a potential Trump victory in incestuously sexualized terms to a stern father, Trump, “spanking” his disobedient daughter, the Democratic electorate. There is his running mate, JD Vance, who since 2020 has gone on seemingly every rightwing podcast to bemoan the “psychopathic” tendencies of “childless cat ladies.” There are Jesse Watters, the pro-Trump Fox personality, and Charlie Kirk, the founder of the Trumpian youth group Turning Point USA, both of whom have expressed outrage that women might vote differently than their husbands.
Then, of course, there is Trump’s major financial backer, the pro-natalist Elon Musk, who routinely offers to inseminate women in public jabs meant to sexualize and humiliate them, and is reportedly working on setting up a compound in Austin for his 11-plus children and the women who have birthed them. His political action committee, America PAC, recently ran an ad that declared “Kamala Harris is a C-word.” “You heard that right. A big ole C word,” the voiceover says. At the end, the ad winkingly reveals that the word is “communist.”
And then there is Trump himself, the architect of Roe v Wade’s reversal, who famously once bragged that he liked to grab women “by the pussy” and has been accused by more than two dozen women of more or less that. The former president took to the stage at a rally in Wisconsin this week to present himself as a “protector” of women. “I’m going to do it whether the women like it or not,” he said.
All of this is meant to appeal to men. Perhaps it will. But women are listening, too.
For all the anxiety over men’s feelings of inadequacy and insult, their perceived loss of status, and their desire to have their masculinity and domination over women vindicated by a second Trump term, there has been comparatively little attention paid to how women are feeling.
Women, after all, have also lost status: because of Trump, they lost Roe v Wade, the US supreme court precedent that not only granted them control over their own pregnancies but had also long stood as a symbol of women’s formal equality under the law. Now, without it, women are suffering and dying; many more have simply been humiliated, made aware that their government does not see them as equals and adults who can be trusted with control of their own lives.
There is a lot of sympathy, in the political media and among the pundit class, for the ways that men feel that the Second Wave era and its aftermath have hurt them. There is comparatively less sympathy – and a good deal less attention – paid to the way that women feel now that those Second Wave achievements in rights, dignity, and equality are being taken away.
There is no reason to doubt the power and appeal of misogyny: Trump may well be right that resentment and hatred against women will be a winning message among men. But women’s feminist sympathies – their anger, their grievance, their sense of having the American promise yanked away from them – should not be underestimated, either. We may be in an era of profound and trenchant antifeminist backlash. But feminists can lash back, too.

Guardian,Harris responds to Trump's violent rhetoric about Liz Cheney – video,"Kamala Harris has responded to Donald Trump's attack on the former congresswoman Liz Cheney, arguing the violent rhetoric 'must be disqualifying' ahead of the 5 November presidential election. Trump called Cheney a radical war hawk and said she should face being under fire with rifles 'shooting at her'. 'Trump is increasingly, however, someone who considers his political opponents the enemy, is permanently out for revenge, and is increasingly unstable and unhinged,' Harris said",2024-11-02
Guardian,Shark bites off surfer’s leg in Hawaii,"A shark bit a Maui surfer on Friday and severed his leg, authorities said.
The man, 61, was surfing off Waiehu Beach Park on Friday morning when a shark bit him. Police officers who arrived to the scene first tried to control the bleeding with tourniquets. His right leg was “completely severed just below the knee,” Maui county said in a news release.
The man was alert while being treated on shore and then taken to Maui Memorial medical center in critical condition.
The man said he did not see the shark approach, authorities reported.
The incident prompted officials to close the beach park. Officials warned people to stay out of the water in the area. The public warning to stay out of the water for a mile in each direction of the incident will be in effect until at least noon on Saturday. The warning will be extended if there is a shark sighting in the area.
Maui fire and ocean safety officials were patrolling the waters using rescue watercraft and a drone. State officials provided shark warning signs and helped with cordoning off the area.
There were no details provided on what kind of shark was involved.
In June, well-known surfer Tamayo Perry was killed in a shark attack while surfing off Oahu’s North Shore.
However, shark attacks are relatively rare across the world but attract a disproportionate amount of news media attention. In many areas of the world shark populations have been decimated by human activities, including being hunted for food.",2024-11-02
Guardian,The Guardian view on the US presidential election 2024: a Democratic government is the one we need,"It is hard to imagine a worse candidate for the American presidency in 2024 than Donald J Trump. His history of dishonesty, hypocrisy and greed makes him wholly unfit for the office. A second Trump term would erode the rule of law, diminish America’s global standing and deepen racial and cultural divides. Even if he loses, Mr Trump has shown that he will undermine the election process, with allies spreading unfounded conspiracy theories to delegitimise the results.
There are prominent Republicans – such as the former vice-president Dick Cheney – who refused to support Mr Trump owing to the threat he poses. Gen Mark Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff under Mr Trump, calls his former boss a “fascist”. America was founded in opposition to absolute monarchy. The Republican nominee models himself after the leader he most admires: Russia’s autocratic president, Vladimir Putin.
Mr Trump’s authoritarianism may finish US democracy. He has praised and promised to pardon those convicted in the January 6 insurrection. He has suggested bypassing legal norms to use potentially violent methods of repression, blurring the lines between vigilantism, law enforcement and military action, against groups – be they Democrats or undocumented immigrants – he views as enemies.
His team has tried to distance itself from the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 and its extreme proposals – such as mass firings of civil servants and erasing women’s rights – that poll poorly. But it is likely that, in office, Mr Trump would adopt many of these intolerant, patriarchal and discriminatory plans. He aims to dismantle the government to enrich himself and evade the law. If Republicans gain control of the Senate, House and White House, he would interpret it as a mandate to silence his critics and entrench his power.
Mr Trump is a transactional and corrupting politician. His supporters see this as an advantage. Christian nationalists want an authoritarian regime to enforce religious edicts on Americans. Elon Musk wants to shape the future without regulatory oversight. Both put self-interest ahead of the American people. Democracy erodes slowly at first, then all at once. In office, Mr Trump appointed three supreme court justices, who this summer blocked efforts to hold him accountable for trying to overturn the 2020 election: their immunity ruling renders the president “a king above the law”, in the words of the liberal justice Sonia Sotomayor.
A historic president
Since Kamala Harris stepped into the spotlight following Joe Biden’s exit, her campaign has been a masterclass in political jujitsu, deftly flipping Mr Trump’s perceived strengths into glaring weaknesses. With a focus on joy, the vice-president sharply contrasted with Mr Trump’s grim narrative of US decline. In their sole televised debate, Ms Harris skillfully outmaneuvered Mr Trump, who fell into her traps, appearing angry and incoherent. She is confident and composed. He sounds unhinged.
The Trump agenda threatens to dismantle voting rights, women’s rights and minority rights – not just reversing decades of social progress but burying it. Mr Trump was behind the shredding of reproductive rights. The conservative forces rallying to him are now intent on imposing a national abortion ban, with – should he win – dire implications for IVF and birth control. Republicans have been hurt in the polls by being associated with such unpopular policies – a weak spot that Ms Harris should keep exploiting.
The vice-president has energised Democrats with savvy media appearances while appealing to swing voters. Progressives, determined to defeat Mr Trump, remain committed to freedom and equality. But Ms Harris has disappointed those who have urged her to take a stand on US complicity in Israel’s bombing of civilians in Gaza and Lebanon. Downplaying war crimes, as arms flow to Israel, has already harmed Democratic chances in key swing states like Michigan.
In a political system where style often rivals substance, perception is crucial. While Ms Harris hasn’t made her race and gender central to her campaign, her victory would be historic: she would be the first woman, and the first woman of color, to be president. Symbolism matters to her base. Her candidacy rallied key constituencies – the young, women, African Americans and Hispanics – who were cooling on Mr Biden. This election is a leap of faith in Ms Harris, who offers a sense of possibility for the future, while Mr Trump clings to a reactionary past.
Protecting democracy
Despite his criminal conviction and being declared a rapist by a judge, Mr Trump remains dangerously close to reclaiming the presidency. Many voters still back a man who was the worst US president ever. But probably not a majority of US voters. Republicans benefit from a skewed electoral system: Democrats have won the popular vote in all but one election since 1992, and secured the overall popular majority for the Senate in every six-year cycle since 1996. Yet the country has often been led by Republican presidents and a GOP-controlled Senate, and therefore a Republican-dominated supreme court. In a close race in November, that could mean Mr Trump doesn’t need to win the election – just a court case.
Mr Biden has been a transformational political figure, but he didn’t transform the country. He aimed to tackle inequality, broken public services and the climate crisis with a $4tn plan funded by taxing the rich. His goal was to restore his party’s political credibility by marrying social liberalism with economic justice. But corporate influence and the Democrats’ slim Senate majority shrank his ambitions. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine shifted his focus to national security, as America experienced rising prices. However, Mr Biden made historic investments to green the economy and refocused industrial policy to take on China. Ms Harris’s plans aim to recapture the spirit of Mr Biden’s insurgency.
The US economy is stronger than it has been in decades, yet Mr Trump consistently outpolls Ms Harris on economic issues. This perhaps reflects decades of neoliberalism. Real wages for blue-collar workers have stagnated since the 1970s, while inflation-adjusted house prices have doubled. Polls show 70% of Americans feel significant political and economic reform is needed, putting Democrats at a disadvantage as they are linked to the status quo.
Political hope fades when we settle for what is, instead of fighting for what could be. Ms Harris embodies the conviction that it’s better to believe in democracy’s potential than to surrender to its imperfections. The Republican agenda is clear: voter suppression, book bans and tax cuts for billionaires. Democrats seek global engagement; the GOP favours isolation. The Biden-Harris administration laid the groundwork for a net zero America. A Trumpian comeback would undo it. A Harris win, with a Democratic Congress, means a chance to restore good governance, create good jobs and lead the entire planet’s climate efforts. Defeating Mr Trump protects democracy from oligarchy and dictatorship. There is too much at stake not to back Ms Harris for president.",2024-10-23
Guardian,‘He’s lying’: Ohio Senate candidate blames staffers and family for errors,"Bernie Moreno, the Republican candidate for US Senate in Ohio, came to the US from Colombia at the age of four. He has said he learned English through Ronald Reagan’s speeches. That claim has been questioned, but if Moreno did learn the language that way, it seems one famous speech may not have fully sunk in.
At the Republican convention in 1968, Reagan said: “It is time to restore the American precept that each individual is accountable for his actions.”
Throughout a tight race – in which defeat for Sherrod Brown, the incumbent Democrat, could decide control of the Senate – Moreno has displayed a distinctly un-Reaganlike tendency to dodge responsibility for questions about his own actions, choosing repeatedly to blame others instead, a review of reporting and court documents shows.
Last month, after Moreno was shown to have falsely claimed to hold an MBA from the University of Michigan, including signing legal documents containing the claim, his campaign blamed “a staffer who made a mistake”.
Moreno told a radio host: “I’m proud that I got a bachelor’s of business administration, and I thank some of the reporting pointing out that it was with high distinction. There was a clerical error made by one of my admins, seven, eight, nine years ago, that put that I had an MBA. It was a BBA.”
Moreno may have been right that his opponents “want[ed] a headline” on the issue but he also claimed they wanted “to confuse people, say, this guy lied by going to college. Absolutely not.”
That is not what Democrats say. Bill DeMora, an Ohio state senator, said: “The new reports that prove he is lying about having an MBA from that school up north are disqualifying. Anyone who lies about having a made-up-business degree from Michigan has no business representing Ohioans.”
The episode of the phantom MBA is not the only one in which Moreno has blamed others for alleged missteps.
Also in September, as Brown faced reporting about his late payment of property taxes, Politico reported that “a trust belonging in part to the wealthy Republican Senate candidate [Moreno] was more than a year late on paying a $20,000 tax bill on a house that it owns” in Key Largo, Florida, “leading to the issuance of a lien in June 2023”.
The debt was paid the day of the report, Politico said. A spokesperson for Moreno said the error was not his fault.
“Bernie does not manage the finances related to the house,” Reagan McCarthy said. “One of his siblings does and it was an unfortunate oversight.”
Nor have such moments been confined to the general election campaign. Similar issues affected Moreno during the Republican primary, which he won in May, Donald Trump’s coveted endorsement propelling him past what the Associated Press called “more moderate alternatives”.
In January, multiple outlets reported a Massachusetts case from 2017 in which Moreno was sued for non-payment of overtime at his auto company. According to court records, a judge said Moreno “either did not retain or shredded … monthly reports” that he “knew or should have known” he was required to keep. Ultimately, a jury found Moreno liable for withholding wages and ordered him to pay $416,160 in damages.
Primary opponents raised the issue. Moreno claimed political bias, calling the jury in the case “ridiculous” and the judge “a Harvard elitist lunatic”. The judge in question was appointed by Republicans.
Moreno also blamed the plaintiffs, whom he called “two of my worst salespeople, the guys that never even showed up on time, who didn’t punch in or punch out, who had no proof that they worked overtime”, and blamed the overtime pay issue on a staff member who he said “actually managed payroll”. In court, the staffer testified that she had not been responsible for such matters.
More luridly, back in March, the AP reported that Moreno, who it said had “shifted from a public supporter of LGBTQ+ rights to a hardline opponent” was “confronting questions about the existence of a 2008 profile seeking ‘Men for 1-on-1 sex’ on a casual sexual encounters website called Adult Friend Finder”.
Moreno’s lawyer said the candidate was not behind the account, and provided a statement in which a former Moreno intern, Dan Ricci, said he created the account as “a juvenile prank”.
Contacted for comment, Moreno’s spokesperson did not immediately respond.",2024-10-21
Guardian,Live US politics live: ‘improbably tight’ polls questioned by experts as Trump reportedly grows anxious in final days of race,"Nicolle Wallace, communications director under Bush, is the latest former aide to urge ex-president to back Harris",2024-01-01
Guardian,Mormons were once reliably Republican – but they could tip Arizona Harris’s way,"A valuable Republican voting bloc in Arizona is seeing a shift from members towards Kamala Harris in numbers that Democrats believe could make the difference for them in an election where the latest polls have Donald Trump slightly ahead in the swing state.
With nearly 450,000 members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, commonly known as LDS or Mormons, living in Arizona, they make up about 6% of the state’s population and both the Harris and Trump campaigns have been going all out to woo them.
While the church’s home base of Utah is one of the deepest red states, in neighboring Arizona there is a growing partisan rift.
Mormons in Arizona are now “poised to support Kamala Harris more than any other presidential Democratic ticket in 60 years”, Jacob Rugh, an associate professor in the department of sociology at the LDS church-run Brigham Young University, said in a Harris-Walz campaign call in August.
In the 2020 election, Joe Biden delivered the first Democratic win in Arizona in a presidential election in 24 years. He garnered an estimated 18,000 votes from the LDS community, double Hillary Clinton’s share of LDS voters there – and won the state by just 10,457 votes.
“The 18,000 votes was more than the margin of victory, and it showed the significance of the LDS vote,” said Robert Taber, the national director of LDS for Harris-Walz.
“Where Biden got 18% of the LDS vote in 2020, I think Harris could hit 25-30% of the LDS vote,” Taber added, citing the increased Democratic campaign efforts there this cycle, as well as the “post-January 6” environment.
“I think there’s a decent chance that Harris does a little bit better than Biden,” he said, which, if it happens, could help the Democrats to “hold on to Nevada and Arizona”, he added.
In the United States, members of the LDS church make up a relatively small, predominantly white voting bloc – about 2% of the population – and have traditionally been among the most loyal voting blocs for the Republicans over the last several decades, historically aligning on traditional conservative values such as religious freedoms, pro-life stances and small government.
But in 2016, when Trump was nominated as the Republican presidential candidate, some in the community felt conflicted. That year, after the Hollywood Access tape was published, Deseret News website, which is owned by the LDS church, called on Trump to resign, stating that he did not align with the community’s ideals and values.
A small but increasing number of LDS voters continue to shift away from him.
Julie Spilsbury, a Republican council member in Mesa, Arizona, and an LDS church member, recently endorsed Harris .
“I think the character of our leaders matter,” Spilsbury, 47, said. “And when I hear him talk about – women, immigrants, refugees, people who disagree with him – I cannot, in good conscience, vote for someone like that.”
Spilsbury voted for Trump in 2016 but later abandoned him due to his character, divisiveness and rhetoric, she said. She voted for Biden four years later – but quietly. Now she’s publicly supporting Harris.
In 2020, about half of LDS voters under the age of 40 voted for Biden, and in Utah, he performed the best of any Democratic presidential candidate since 1964.
While most LDS voters nationwide are expected to vote for Trump, if Harris can better the Biden numbers among the group, it could make a crucial difference in Arizona – and Nevada, where Mormon numbers are also strong, although there is less data available about their voting history in that state from 2020.
The Harris campaign launched an LDS advisory committee in Arizona in September and in Nevada in early October to canvas Mormon voters and hold events.
The Republicans launched a Latter-day Saints for Trump coalition in early October, and Trump called in to an LDS for Trump video call as the campaign tried to shore up the vote.
But in Arizona, John Giles, a lifelong Republican, LDS member and the mayor of Mesa – once dubbed the most conservative city in America – publicly backed Harris just eight days after Biden dropped out of his re-election campaign.
He wrote an op-ed in the Arizona Republican saying Harris “is fighting to make sure Americans can get ahead and be safe from gun violence and to restore and protect the rights of women”, while Trump stood for the far right, “crudeness and vulgarity”.
And at a recent Harris-Walz rally in Arizona, Giles said the GOP had been “taken over by extremists”, and described Trump as “morally and ethically bankrupt”.
In recent years, Trump has also clashed with prominent LDS members, including Mitt Romney, Utah’s retiring US senator and past presidential nominee, who voted to impeach Trump after the January 6 attack on the US Capitol; Rusty Bowers, the former speaker of the Arizona house who resisted Trump’s demands to undermine the 2020 election in Arizona; and former Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, who recently endorsed Harris.
“I saw a lot of people really upset about the way that he attacked very well-respected Arizona politicians like Rusty Bowers,” said Lacy Chaffee, a member of the LDS church and a candidate for school board in Mesa.
“Rusty campaigned for Trump, but he wasn’t willing to lie,” she added. “So I think that that’s something that speaks very deeply to members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We hold very deeply the sense of integrity and truth, and I think that, for a lot of people, was the breaking point.”
The Mormon church itself maintains political neutrality, but it encourages civic participation and for members to elect politicians who are “honest, wise and good”.
Rugh, the sociology expert, said his analysis showed that candidates who denied that Biden won the 2020 election lost substantial LDS votes.
Meanwhile, the church teaches members that the principles in the US constitution are divinely inspired, said Taber, the director of LDS for Harris-Walz. . But Trump has said the constitution should be “terminated”.
The LDS youth vote is also shifting significantly. Brittany Romanello, an anthropologist and faculty associate at Arizona State University, said that Harris and the Democrats “have a very big opening” with young LDS voters because of greater diversity both of people and opinions in their ranks, and agreater willingness to disagree with the church majority.
“Gen Z is the most politically, ethnically, sexually and romantically diverse generation, and they’re a huge part of the voting bloc, and this includes Mormons,” Romanello said.
Rugh’s analysis also found that more than 50% of gen Z LDS members voted for Biden in 2020.
In terms of more LDS voters being willing to buck the norm, and be open about it, Spilsbury said:
“If me speaking out helps some others, specifically LDS women, know that there’s another choice and that we don’t have to vote Republican just because it’s the thing we think we’re supposed to do, then that’s really important to me.”
She said a lot of the reaction from her community to her choice had been “rough” but that she received some positive messages, too.
Meanwhile, Mormonism is a conservative, pro-life religion but known as less fiercely anti-abortion than some, generally supporting exceptions for rape, incest and the health of the mother or child. Harris has zeroed in on reproductive rights since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022, after Trump’s three appointees tipped the bench to the right.
LDS Arizona resident Monica Chabot, 28, had a miscarriage last year and elected to have the fetus removed rather than wait for it to pass naturally. Her experience changed her perspective on the Republican party and its anti-choice stance, she said. She believes the
procedure would probably not have been allowed under an extreme ban dating from 1864 that briefly took effect in Arizona after Roe was overturned, before some Republicans crossed the aisle to repeal it, which the state’s Democratic governor signed off on, leaving a less harsh ban.
“It made me realize how little Trump and other Republicans seem to care about me and my experiences and my body,” she said. “And hearing Kamala talk about it and fighting for that is a big reason why I’ve been involved in the Harris campaign.”
Arizona voters have a ballot measure this November that would enshrine in the state constitution the right to abortion until viability, or around 24 weeks. It remains to be seen whether it will encourage split tickets as conservatives who want reproductive choice vote for the measure but also for Trump, or whether it boosts women’s turnout in a huge windfall for Harris.
Chabot said that while she would never choose to get an abortion, or encourage others to get an abortion, she doesn’t believe in the government making that decision for a woman.
She said: “We talk a lot about agency in the church, and how it’s one of our greatest gifts from God – the ability to choose.”",2024-11-01
Guardian,Pregnant Texas teen died after three ER visits due to impact of abortion ban,"A pregnant Texas teenager died after three separate visits to an emergency room in attempts to get care in another incident that has highlighted the medical impact of the loss of abortion rights in the US.
Nevaeh Crain, 18, had gone to two different emergency rooms within 12 hours in October 2023, each time returning home feeling worse than before. Crain was only diagnosed with strep throat upon her first visit. The hospital did not investigate her sharp abdominal cramps, according to reporting by ProPublica.
Crain is one of at least two Texas women who died under the state’s abortion ban brought in after the US supreme court overturned the federal right to abortion. Josseli Barnica, 28, died after a miscarriage in 2021.
These incidents are seen as evidence of a new reality in which US healthcare professionals in states with new tough abortion restrictions are hesitant or even afraid to give care to pregnant mothers over fear of legal repercussions. Texas’s abortion ban threatens prison time for interventions that end a fetal heartbeat, regardless of whether the pregnancy is wanted or not.
Medical records indicate Crain tested positive for sepsis, a potentially life-threatening condition, on her second visit. But doctors still cleared her to leave after apparently confirming that her six-month-old fetus still had a heartbeat.
On her third trip to the hospital, Crain was finally moved to intensive care after an obstetrician insisted on two ultrasounds to “confirm fetal demise”, reported ProPublica.
She died hours later after suffering organ failure. A nurse noted that her lips had turned “blue and dusky”, ProPublica said. The teen would have turned 20 this Friday.
Though Texas retains exceptions for life-threatening conditions, the fear and uncertainty instilled in doctors over which treatments may or may not be considered a crime has had devastating effects on women in need of healthcare.
The result is that in states with abortion bans, patients are often traded between hospitals in order to shirk responsibility and argue about legalities, an act which wastes precious and potentially life-saving time.
“Pregnant women have become essentially untouchables,” Sara Rosenbaum, a health law and policy professor emerita at George Washington University, told ProPublica.
The president and CEO of Reproductive Freedom for All, Mini Timmaraju, said Crain’s death underscored the deadly threat posed by abortion bans.
“Pregnancy should not be a death sentence,” Timmaraju said in a statement.
Timmaraju placed the blame for abortion bans on the shoulders of Republican politicians such as Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, the incumbent Texas senator who is facing a tough re-election fight against the Democrat Collin Allred.
“This has to stop,” she said. “And our best chance to do that is to vote for reproductive freedom,” including by supporting Allred and Kamala Harris against Trump in the 5 November election.
By doing so, “we can restore the right to abortion and these bans,” Timmaraju said.",2024-11-01
Guardian,2024 US presidential polls tracker: Trump v Harris latest national averages,"On 5 November 2024, millions of Americans will head to the polls to choose between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump for president of the United States. The two candidates have offered starkly different visions for the future of the nation. As the election enters the final stretch, the Guardian US is averaging national and state polls to see how the two candidates are faring.
Latest analysis: Nationally, Harris has a one-point advantage, 48% to 47%, over her Republican opponent, virtually identical to last week. Such an advantage is well with the margin of errors of most polls. The battleground states, too, remain in a dead heat.
But in a fractured political landscape that has featured threats of retribution from Trump, accusations of fascism and racism from Harris, and warnings that democracy itself is on the ballot, the bigger picture – that uniformity, over a prolonged period – has seasoned observers scratching their heads.

Notes on data
To calculate our polling averages, Guardian US took a combination of head-to-head and multi-candidate polls and calculated a rolling 10-day average for each candidate. Our tracker uses polls gathered by 538 and filters out lower-quality pollsters for national polls. Our state polling averages use a lower quality threshold for inclusion due to the small numbers of state polls. If there were no polls over the the 10-day period, we leave the average blank. On 11 Oct Guardian US began rounding averages to the nearest whole number to better reflect the lack of certainty in the polling figures.
Polling averages capture how the race stands at a particular moment in time and are likely to change as the election gets closer. Averages from states with small numbers of polls are also more susceptible to errors and biases. Our averages are an estimate of the support that the candidates have in key swing states and on the national stage. The election is decided by the electoral college, so these averages should not be taken as a likelihood of winning the election in November.

Guardian,Political violence has marked the 2024 race – but risks rise after election day,"A year punctuated by two assassination attempts, high levels of threats and harassment, and a number of troubling, violent incidents in the lead-up to election day will culminate on Tuesday with an election deemed existential by all sides.
It’s the first presidential election since the January 6 insurrection, a reminder of the ways political violence can manifest that leaves Americans with a fear that such an attack could happen again. Those who study the attack and its participants say they aren’t convinced criminal convictions against them will fully deter those involved on January 6 from future political violence, but that the biggest threat is a lone actor, not a large, coordinated event.
In the last few weeks, a man in Arizona was allegedly stockpiling weapons and plotting a “mass casualty” event, according to police who arrested him for shooting at Democratic party offices. The person behind explosive devices that burned hundreds of ballots in two drop boxes in Oregon and Washington is suspected to be a metalworker who could be planning more attacks. Arguments at polling places over political paraphernalia, banned at the polls in some places, have become physical. A young man waved a machete at a polling place in Florida.
The risk of political violence only increases after election day, experts say, once races are called. Certain places could become targets of people or groups upset about results or who claim fraud.
“The strategic value of political violence will go up once there’s an initial winner,” said Robert Pape, director of the Chicago Project on Security and Threats at the University of Chicago. “I would not say the left is totally off the hook, but it’s most dangerous on the right, simply because Trump did it before.”
Trump and his supporters have turned to incendiary rhetoric in recent days, contributing to the tense environment. A speaker at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally called Kamala Harris the devil, while another spoke of the “slaughter” of Democrats. Trump said on Thursday that the former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney should face being under fire with rifles “shooting at her”.
Social media platforms have enabled some of the conditions that could lead to offline violence. Militias are using Facebook to organize, and in some instances, Facebook has auto-generated militia pages, Wired reported. X, formerly Twitter, has become a frequent source of election disinformation that could be weaponized to stir people up post-election. The platform created a new “election integrity community” where users can post unsubstantiated claims of fraud. Online forums frequented by the far right are showing patterns similar to those that preceded the January 6 attack.
“It’s absolutely possible that someone motivated by mis- or disinformation that they see online about some polling place in their community could show up with a gun and try to enforce vigilante justice,” said Brian Hughes, associate director of the Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab at American University.
Alex Jones, the longtime conspiracist, has issued reports on his show for several days warning of a deep state plot to sow chaos around the voting process. “And then there will be a big disputed election and it will get Democrats and Republicans all mad at each other, and that’s the civil war conditions,” Jones said on a broadcast this week.
Elections officials emphasize that voting is still very safe in the US, and the threat of political violence should not deter people from casting a ballot. Levels of political violence have actually been lower this year than recent years, but there has been a continuation of high levels of threats and harassment, said Shannon Hiller, executive director of the Bridging Divides Initiative at Princeton University, which studies and tracks political violence. Elections officials in particular have been consistent targets of threats and harassment campaigns. Concerns about political violence among local elected officials have also risen.
“Whether it’s bad actors or foreign actors, even trying to create that environment of fear is part of what people are doing to undermine our democracy,” Hiller said. “So the best way to push back on that is to remind folks it’s very safe and secure to vote and people feel confident to do so.”
Still, voters feel a sense of unease. A recent survey of swing state voters by the Washington Post found fears that there would be violence if Trump loses the election. In six swing states, 57% of voters said they were at least somewhat worried about Trump supporters turning violent if he loses, far more than the percentage of voters who feared the same for a Harris loss.
January 6 memory hole
The January 6 insurrection serves to some as a reminder of what a riled-up populace ready to take action for political aims can do. But for Trump, it’s now a “day of love”. He has promised to pardon many of those involved in the attack and referred to them as political prisoners.
Having a leader encourage acts of violence or “fear and loathing” of the other side “creates a permission structure for people who want to commit acts of violence to go ahead and do so. They feel more justified, and they expect that they’ll be protected,” Hughes said.
Experts don’t believe the US Capitol could see a similar attack because of precautions taken since January 6, but state capitols and other buildings may not be as prepared.
Pape has studied those involved in January 6. So far, more than 1,300 have been arrested for their actions that day, the vast majority of whom were not clearly affiliated with a domestic extremist group like the Proud Boys or Oath Keepers. Most of those sentenced have since stayed off the radar and are not commenting online about their political beliefs, Pape has found. Of those who do speak publicly about their charges or beliefs, many have doubled down on the issues that motivated them after the 2020 election. They have continued to express support for Trump and for election fraud narratives.
Billy Knutson of South Dakota was charged for his actions on January 6 and has since rapped about the insurrection: “Since they stole the election we living behind enemy lines … We are the people, we won’t be defeated / No peace and no quarter, we never retreated.”
Jake Lang, who is alleged to have swung a baseball bat at police on January 6, has been in prison for more than three years awaiting trial. He has brought in more than $240,000 in an online fundraiser on GiveSendGo, the rightwing crowdfunding site, to fund a “J6 truther” website: “This is the single most important thing you can do to support the Jan 6 political prisoners and help exonerate these brave patriots,” he tells donors. He has also been helping set up a “network of election deniers and conspiracists” known as the North American Patriot and Liberty Militia, or Napalm, Wired reported.
The “patriot wing” of the DC jail where some violent January 6 participants are being held may be further radicalizing the people staying there, a New York Magazine report posited. Extremism experts told the magazine that “its inmates might re-enter society more primed to take violent action than they were before the Capitol riot”.
By reframing what January 6 was, Trump has given permission for his supporters to take similar action again, political violence experts warn.
Lone actors a risk
A memo from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) warned in September that there was a “heightened risk” of domestic violent extremists mobilizing “against ideological opponents, government officials, and law enforcement in an attempt to initiate a civil war” until at least early 2025. The document, obtained by the public records watchdog group Property of the People, said the threat comes from lone offenders, as large group action would probably be deterred by the January 6 convictions.
The two assassination attempts against Trump could inspire copycats or retaliation, the agency said. “Real or perceived mistakes or discrepancies in the electoral process” could also play into broader election fraud narratives that stir up domestic violent extremists. Issues like mass migration could drive these extremists.
“Widespread or high-profile civil unrest, mass immigration, or crimes by migrants or minorities perceived as threatening the United States may drive some DVEs [domestic violent extremists] to mobilize to violence to ‘save America’ from perceived threats,” the memo said. “For example, online users discussed the potential of a sweeping Executive Order that would have given some migrants citizenship, with one user stating, ‘Biden does that executive order, we shoot all democrat officials. And the supporting federal agents.’”
Another DHS and FBI intelligence bulletin obtained by Property of the People from early October said the threat was heightened until inauguration day in January 2025 and extremists could use tactics such as “physical attacks, threats of violence, swatting and doxing, mailing or otherwise delivering suspicious items, arson, and other means of property destruction”. The memo also said there was potential for violence based on grievances related to immigration, LGBTQIA+ rights and abortion access.
Surveys have shown increased support for the use of violence to achieve political goals. When support for violence is more mainstream, it can nudge volatile people who are considering taking action over the edge because they believe they are fulfilling a popular mandate, Pape said.
“There’s a political cause that they sense from the media is popular, and then they want some of that popularity and fame for themselves, so they do a violent act in the name of that political cause,” Pape said.
The risk of violence doesn’t automatically dissipate after the election. But while a Trump loss could inspire his supporters to take action, it could also release the hold he has on the right.
“When you have a very influential leader who acts as the center of gravity for a movement that engages in threats and even violence, when the leader recedes from you, that center of gravity has a way of dissolving, and the problems have a way of dissipating,” Hughes said. “So there is a possibility that the outcome of this election will in itself improve the problem somewhat.”",2024-11-02
Guardian,"If Trump wins the election, he could seize control of America’s courts","If Donald Trump re-enters the White House on 20 January he will do so emboldened by a power that no previous incoming president has ever enjoyed: immunity from criminal prosecution for any act carried out in his official capacity.
The protection, awarded in a July ruling from the far-right supermajority of the US supreme court, changes fundamentally the dynamics of the Oval Office.
“The justices wrote a how-to guide for a president who wants to break the law,” said Michael Waldman, president of the non-partisan Brennan Center for Justice. “In practical terms, if you are a president who wants to break the law, make sure your co-conspirators are also government employees – then you’re off the hook.”
The immunity ruling, in Trump v United States, is the clearest example yet of the judicial feedback loop that the former president established during his 2017 to 2021 presidency. With the active support of Republicans in the US Senate, then President Trump appointed three new hard-right justices to the country’s top court, creating a 6-3 conservative-to-liberal supermajority.
That super-majority duly repaid Trump. First it abolished the constitutional right to an abortion in Roe v Wade, and then it granted him substantial immunity from criminal charges.
The immunity ruling has had a direct bearing on the federal prosecutions against Trump brought by the special counsel Jack Smith. It could alter the parameters of a second Trump term, which he has already indicated will be devoted to retribution against his political enemies, mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, mobilization of the military against domestic targets, and other legally questionable moves.
A similar feedback loop is also operating in the lower courts. Take the US district judge whom Trump appointed in Florida, Aileen Cannon, who in July dismissed the criminal case against him for having hoarded classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago club. The judgment is being appealed.
At stake in this historically important election is whether Trump will be able to strengthen and deepen this feedback loop during a second term. And if so, how he would then deploy it.
The most obvious way to bolster an already powerful mechanism is to appoint more judges. Last time, Trump filled no fewer than 234 federal judicial seats.
That included three supreme court justices: Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. He also placed 54 appeals court judges, the most powerful judges in the nation other than supreme court justices – just one fewer in four years than Barack Obama achieved over his entire eight years in office.
Top of Trump’s list of priorities will be to cement the far-right grip he has already secured on the supreme court. He could ensure the dominance of the supermajority for years to come if he could replace the older ultra-right justices, Clarence Thomas, who is 76, and Samuel Alito, 74, with similarly strident ideologues half their age.
Given their own fondness for the political values of the Make America Great Again movement, the two oldest justices may well be tempted to step down while Trump were in the White House to ensure continuity. Thomas, a rightwing stalwart, has already been on the top court for 33 years.
“The most likely retirement would be that of Justice Thomas,” said Steve Vladeck, a law professor at Georgetown University law center and an authority on the supreme court.
An even greater prize for Trump would be if one of the three liberal-leaning justices were forced to step down from her lifelong post. All eyes will be on the oldest of the trio, Sonia Sotomayor, 70.
Were Trump able to replace even one liberal justice, the supermajority would be boosted from its current dominant status to one that would be unassailable. A 7-to-2 balance would eradicate any ambiguity, remove any chance of compromise or moderation, and lock in a watertight far-right jurisprudence for at least a generation.
“If Donald Trump takes the White House and the Republicans control the Senate then it will be the next one, two, three justice appointments, and this will be our entire judiciary,” Elizabeth Warren, the senator from Massachusetts, told CBS News recently. “There will be no one to stop them, and with a supreme court that has basically said Donald Trump can be a king, there will be no checks on him.”
In the lower courts, Trump would also push to continue his remolding of the judiciary, both by aggressively pursuing new appointments to the federal bench and by championing judges who pay lip service to Maga values. If the Republicans regain control of the US Senate next week, there would be few impediments to him pursuing his goal.
“The extent to which the Senate had any kind of a backbone during the confirmation process for new judges during the Trump administration is likely to go away,” Vladeck said. “The constraints on Trump’s most extreme picks would vanish.”
A main target would be to push the powerful appeals courts further to the right. The New Orleans-based fifth circuit, the most hard-right appeals court in the country, already has six Trump appointees among its 17 active judges, and a second Trump term will aim to enhance that figure.
Waldman pointed out that the most ideologically driven judges appointed by Trump came towards the end of his presidency, indicating the increasingly radical direction in which he was moving. Those later appointments included Matthew Kacsmaryk, appointed as a federal district court judge in Texas in June 2019.
Some of the most controversial cases to reach the supreme court in recent months were initiated by Kacsmaryk in his northern district of Texas court. That included the ban on the abortion medication mifepristone (the supreme court restored access to the drug this summer).
Cannon, the judge who threw out the classified documents case, was also a late Trump appointment. She took up her federal position just two months before he left the White House.
Extreme judge appointments would be just one side of the coin. There are indications that Trump might go on the offensive in a second term to take on troublesome federal judges who put loyalty to constitution before loyalty to Trump.
One of the big frustrations of his four years in the White House was that federal judges repeatedly refused to allow him to act in unconstitutional ways. The courts blocked his initial Muslim travel ban, border asylum restrictions and attempt to allow healthcare discrimination against transgender patients, among many other actions.
In a second term, Trump is likely to toughen his approach. John Eastman, the lawyer who was central to the conspiracy to overturn the 2020 presidential election, has called for the removal of sitting judges. “We’ve got to start impeaching these judges for acting in such an unbelievably partisan way from the bench,” Eastman told a national conservative conference recently.
Waldman has detected another legal strategy that Trump could pursue in a second term as a way of bypassing constitutional objections to his most egregious policies. It is based on identifying relatively obscure federal statutes that were framed decades or even centuries ago and are written in such a loose way that they would give him substantial leeway.

For instance, Trump has threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, originally enacted in 1792, which would allow him to deploy the US military domestically against Americans. The law is so broadly cast that it gives a president wide powers to decide when it could be activated, and Waldman’s Brennan Center has called for the statute to be tightened up to prevent abuse.
At his Madison Square Garden rally last week, Trump also name-checked the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, a federal statute that was used to intern Japanese nationals in the second world war. The law, which allows citizens of foreign countries to be rounded up and removed in case of war, “invasion or predatory incursion”, could be used as legal justification for his plans to mass-deport millions of undocumented immigrants.
“Even a diligent judge would have a hard time imposing limits on some of these statutes that have very few guardrails and give presidents an awful lot of power,” Waldman said. “It turns out that it has been self-restraint, more than anything else, that has stopped these powers from being abused.”
Even Trump invoking vast powers vested in him by vague ancient laws pales beside Vladeck’s worst fear. What if Trump dares to flout the rule of law itself?
“My biggest concern is the very real specter that the courts rule against him, and he tells the courts to pound sand,” Vladeck said. “What if he tells his supporters that the supreme court justices are a bunch of Rinos [Republicans in name only] and tries to defy them? Who at that point will stand up for the courts?”",2024-11-02
Guardian,US presidential election updates: false videos of voter fraud spread as election approaches,"The Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, has said a video that claimed to show a Haitian immigrant who voted multiple times is “false”, “targeted disinformation” and likely the work of a Russian troll farm.
“As Americans we can’t let our enemies use lies to divide us,” said Raffensperger, who also asked that “Elon Musk and the leadership of other social media platforms … take this down.”
Meanwhile, Musk has deputised his followers on X to spot and report any “potential instances of voter fraud and irregularities”. The election integrity community he spawned is rife with unfounded claims passed off as evidence of voter fraud.
As Americans race towards the presidential election, claims of voter fraud – as well as real example of political violence – are growing, with burning vote boxes, attempts to steal ballots and online hoaxes all reported this week.
Here is what else happened on Thursday:
Kamala Harris election news and updates
-
Kamala Harris said on Thursday that Donald Trump’s comment that he would protect women “whether the women like it or not” showed that the Republican presidential nominee does not understand women’s “agency, their authority, their right and their ability to make decisions about their own lives, including their own bodies”.
-
Harris, who has been receiving a slew of celebrity endorsements, got an A-list boost from pop star and movie actor Jennifer Lopez in Las Vegas, after basketball great LeBron James endorsed her earlier in the day. “I like Hollywood endings. I like when the good guy, or in this case the good girl wins,” said Lopez.
-
The cast of Marvel’s Avengers movies also came out in support of Harris. In a video posted first on Vanity Fair, actors Robert Downey Jr, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Don Cheadle, Chris Evans, Danai Gurira and Paul Bettany playfully riffed on their respective characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe while encouraging viewers to vote for Harris.
Donald Trump election news and updates
-
Trump acknowledged that Elon Musk and Robert F Kennedy Jr could be “influential figures” in a potential second administration as he sat for a lengthy interview with conservative broadcaster Tucker Carlson in battleground state Arizona. Trump also called Liz Cheney a “war hawk” who should be placed in the line of fire to “see how she feels about it”. The former congresswoman has become one of his most prominent Republican critics.
-
Trump made stops in New Mexico, a traditionally Democratic state, and the swing state of Nevada. Trump predicted he would defy experts who said campaigning in New Mexico was futile. “They all said ‘Don’t come. You can’t win New Mexico.’ I said, ‘Look, your votes are rigged. We can win New Mexico,’” Trump said.
-
Trump’s refusal to publicly acknowledge his defeat in 2020 and suggestion that if he loses this year, he will once again claim fraud, have changed the lives of many formerly low-key election offices and secretaries of state nationwide, who now regularly face threats and harassment, Chris Stein reported from Arizona.
-
Elon Musk failed to show up to a required hearing in a Philadelphia case challenging his $1m-a-day sweepstakes. His absence would have risked contempt of court had the case continued in Pennsylvania court, but it was moved to federal court in response to a motion filed by Musk’s attorneys, who did attend the hearing. No hearings were immediately scheduled in the federal case.
-
Musk’s get-out-the-vote effort for Donald Trump has come under renewed scrutiny after paid canvassers reported not knowing beforehand that they were being hired to support the former president. Workers recruited by Musk’s America Pac to canvass in the battleground state of Michigan only discovered they were working for the Space X and Tesla entrepreneur to drum up voter turnout for Trump after signing non-disclosure agreements, Wired reported.
Elsewhere on the campaign trail
-
Practising witches from around the world gathered in Salem by the hundreds on Thursday night to honour Stormy Daniels at their annual “magic circle” ceremony recognising loved ones who have died. Daniels – the adult film actor who allegedly had an affair with Trump and was at the centre of his May criminal trial that led to the former president’s conviction on 34 felonies – was chosen to be honoured in the Halloween ceremony as the organisers believe that she has been the victim of a modern-day witch-hunt.
-
White House press officials altered the official transcript of a call in which President Joe Biden appeared to take a swipe at supporters of Donald Trump, drawing objections from the federal workers who document such remarks for posterity, according to two US government officials and an internal email obtained on Thursday by the Associated Press.

Guardian,Donald Trump’s freakshow continues unabated | Sidney Blumenthal,"Donald Trump’s threat to execute Liz Cheney, “with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her”, is the apogee so far of his Hitlerian rhetoric. By his own words, Trump has proved her point that he is a “danger” to the constitution and defied his apologists who insist he can be contained or that he doesn’t really mean what he says. “And let’s see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face,” he said. “Shoot Liz Cheney” has replaced “Hang Mike Pence.”
Hours after Trump declared his wish to kill Cheney, the Wall Street Journal editorial board, his reliable excuse maker for the executive collaborator class, published an editorial stating, “We don’t buy the fascism fears, and we doubt Democrats really do either.”
Trump is hellbent to break through any “sane-washing” of the media smoothing over his viciousness and vulgarity. His call for an elaborate execution of a pre-eminent political opponent, a conservative Republican of the most partisan pedigree, is his definitive and final answer to those who quibble about his intentions and his unmooring from all traditional politics.
His fascist-themed freakshow in Madison Square Garden followed by his firing squad fantasy are an augury of a second administration. His closing act has overwhelmed any media reflex for euphemism and both-siderism. He contemptuously stomps on every effort at normalization.
Time and again, day after day, event after event, Trump insists on posing as the salient question of the election, certainly about the candidate himself: are you crazier today than you were four years ago?
Many of Trump’s former White House staffers, cabinet secretaries and commanding generals are frantically attempting to warn against his madness, that he is “a fascist to the core”, as former chairman of the joint chiefs Gen Mark Milley has unequivocally stated. In private conversation, former staffers and others with intimate knowledge of Trump, all reliable people, talk about the real man as far viler than those who haven’t seen him behind closed doors could possibly know.
Knowledge of Trump’s vileness is widespread among top-level Republicans. “They all hate him,” a former senior Trump adviser told me categorically. And they all have stories, some exhibiting his narcissism, others his malice: how, for example, the time two senators from one state were summoned to the Oval Office to listen to Trump say he would travel there to have a mountain named after him. As a rule, they agree with Senator Mitch McConnell that he is “despicable”. Unlike those former Trump staffers waving their arms, they are silent and complicit.
Now, former staffers speculate about the hazy fine line between Trump’s infantilism and his dementia. There is no responsible person left around Trump. He has learned the lesson, sealed by January 6, not to trust the “normies”.
Trump’s night in the Garden on 27 October was early Hitler in style, not middle Hitler. The bellowing obscenities, racist sneers and violent threats were more reminiscent of the Munich beer hall phase of Hitler rousing the street gangs of Brownshirts than the Nuremberg rallies of disciplined ranks of storm troopers massed before his reviewing stand.
“An immense wave of eccentric barbarism … A primitive fairground brutality,” wrote the great German novelist Thomas Mann in 1930 about the Nazi rallies he observed. “This fantastic state of mind, of a humanity that has outrun its ideas, is matched by a political scene in the grotesque style … hallelujahs and bell-ringing and dervish-like repetition of monotonous catchwords, until everybody foams at the mouth. Fanaticism turns into a means of salvation, enthusiasm into epileptic ecstasy, politics becomes an opiate for the masses, a proletarian eschatology; and reason veils her face.”
“A quarter-of-an-hour before the opening time I walked through the chief hall of the Hofbräuhaus on the Platz in Munich and my heart was nearly bursting with joy,” wrote Hitler in Mein Kampf.
“The love in that room,” said Trump after his rally at Madison Square Garden. “It was breathtaking. It was like a love fest, an absolute love fest.”
Trump’s festival at the Garden was a fascist foreshadowing masquerading as a farce. As a screwball flying circus, it was a version of the Marx Brothers’ Night at the Opera. Everything was turned upside down in a pandemonium. Trump’s comedians, however, were no Groucho. It would have been better for Trump if his speakers had been equipped like the mute Harpo with a honking horn.
Trump’s master race of misfits found an authentic voice in the comic relief of Tony Hinchcliffe, who amid his slurs about Black people (“We carved watermelons together”), Latinos, Jews and Palestinians, said, “There’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. Yeah, I think it’s called Puerto Rico.”
Hinchcliffe is the host of a podcast aptly called Kill Tony. With a dubious laugh line, as if on cue, the stage swiveled. Triumph of the Will turned into West Side Story. His performance fatally died like the character Tony in West Side Story, only this Tony died by suicide.
Life is all right in America
If you’re all white in America
With his assent, Trump’s night at the Garden was orchestrated by a malevolent crew of eternally stunted pranksters and gangsters who took control of his campaign’s closing argument. They were brought together principally by Trump’s son Don Jr, a pitiable figure who engages in abominable displays to gain his father’s approbation, and who has become central to the organization of the entourage floating around the campaign.
“Poor Don, he really got the brunt of everything,” said Ivanka. Abandoned and abused, he was shipped off to Czechoslovakia after the divorce of his parents to be raised during the summers by his mother’s grandparents – “the most memorable time in my life”, he said. He learned to speak fluent Czech. Back home, his new stepfather tried to choke him. His college roommates at the University of Pennsylvania recalled Trump coming to visit and smashing Don Jr in the face in front of his friends, knocking him to the ground. When Trump was invited to give a formal speech at Penn, Don Jr refused to attend. He wouldn’t speak with his brutal father for years. He drank heavily, “a fall-down drunk”, said a college friend. His first wife, Vanessa, once said to him, “You’re the one with the retarded father.” Now, Don Jr does anything he can to win Trump’s distracted attention and alienated affection. On the podium, he called out to his dad as “the king of New York”.
Tony Hinchcliffe rose to the level of insult comedian as an opening club act for Joe Rogan. They both live in Austin. Rogan devoted three hours on his podcast on 26 October to a limp interview with Trump in which he failed to challenge Trump’s dozens of flagrant lies. Rogan traffics in being conspiracy theory curious and science hostile to explain the world, which he punctuates with guffaws of jocular misogyny, the occasional racial inference, some gay bashing and tough-guy posturing. He is the faux regular bros’ Alex Jones, the incels’ Hugh Hefner.
Both Rogan and Hinchcliffe are pals of Tucker Carlson. Tucker lately warmed up a Trump rally in Georgia with his sexual fantasy of a “hormone-addled 15-year-old daughter”, when “Dad comes home and he’s pissed … You’ve been a bad girl. You’ve been a bad little girl and you’re getting a vigorous spanking right now. And no, it’s not going to hurt me more than it hurts you. No, it’s not. I’m not going to lie. It’s going to hurt you a lot more than it hurts me. And you earned this.” A former colleague of Carlson’s says he has been talking intently about his spanking obsession for years, though this was the first time in public.
Tucker would appear as the interviewer of Trump on 31 October at an Arizona rally, where he brought up “Dick Cheney’s repulsive little daughter”, which triggered Trump to call her “deranged” and then call for her execution.
Tucker, Don Jr’s buddy, was instrumental in the selection of JD Vance as Trump’s running mate. JD, with his deep thoughts on “childless cat ladies” and “the whole purpose of the postmenopausal female”, is a new addition to the boys’ club. Except for Rogan, all of them, from comic to billionaire to VP candidate, appeared on the podium at the Garden. Tucker Carlson, taking his turn at standup, distinguished himself by slagging the woman who’s been a bad girl: “As the first Samoan-Malaysian, low-IQ, former California prosecutor ever to be elected president …”
Then, Elon Musk, relocated to Austin. He has launched himself like one of his spaceships into Trump’s orbit. The aspiring oligarch has donated tens of millions to a political action committee to support Trump, produced misleading TV spots to smear Harris, and used X to promote disinformation for Trump. He offers a million-dollar giveaway to register voters, cheap money, which has landed him in a Philadelphia court. He speaks secretly to Putin. Whenever Musk strays from his skill at hardware and software into the realm of human interaction, however, he falls flat on his face. His robo-taxi crashes through a shop window.
Musk’s acquisition of Twitter and its transformation into X was doomed to fail because it is about his greatest weakness: human expression. He treats human relationships as a horror show. He is the father of 12 children, some of whom he’s given the names of software programs and he has savagely disowned his trans daughter. He bought an enclosed compound in Texas to contain former wives and children. “He has even offered his own sperm to friends and acquaintances,” the New York Times has reported. He seeks life on Mars because he’s an alien on Earth. Techno authoritarianism is the only comfortable spot on his political spectrum. He calls himself “Techno-King”. Trump has promised him that he will be put in charge of the federal workforce “to start from scratch”. Musk was sanctioned by the Securities and Exchange Commission in September. His regulatory troubles will all go away with Trump. The Nasa and defense contracts will flow. If anything might befall Trump, Musk and his fellow techno authoritarians have Vance positioned a heartbeat away. At the rally, Musk introduced himself, “I am dark Gothic Maga.”
Among the other speakers in the Garden, David Rem, a 60-year-old New York sanitation worker, mounted the podium to hex Harris as “the antichrist” and “the devil”. He claimed to be a childhood friend of Trump’s from his Queens neighborhood, but, in fact, had only recently met him. In 1991, he pleaded guilty to acting as a courier to distribute cocaine and was sentenced to 151 months’ imprisonment.
Grant Cardone, a real estate operator from Florida, is a longtime Scientologist and major donor to its slush fund used to harass critics. He told the Maga faithful that Harris and “her pimp handlers will destroy our country”. To great applause, he flipped his middle finger.
A local New York radio broadcaster, Sid Rosenberg, who had called Harris’s husband, Doug Emhoff, “a crappy Jew”, to Trump’s approval in April, told the crowd, “She is some sick bastard, that Hillary Clinton, huh? What a sick son of a bitch. The whole fucking party, a bunch of degenerates, lowlives, Jew haters and lowlives. Every one of them. Every one of them.”
The obscenities echoing in the Garden embroidered the vulgar vision of the great replacement theory. “America is for Americans and Americans only,” declared Stephen Miller, a former Trump aide. If Trump were to be elected, Miller would play a large role in implementing what Trump boasted would be “the largest deportation program in American history”.
Trump came on stage to shout threats to the rafters. “The United States is now an occupied country, but it will soon be an occupied country no longer,” he said. “We don’t have the same country any more.” He stated he would restore the country to what it was by reaching backwards in history. “I will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. Think of that. That’s how far back. That’s when they had law and order. They had some tough ones. Think of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798.”
Undoubtedly, Trump had no clue he was referring to the political period that Thomas Jefferson described as “the reign of witches”. President John Adams enacted the Alien and Sedition Acts to harass and imprison his critics and opponents, the Democratic-Republicans organized by Jefferson and James Madison, a grouping that was the origin of the Democratic party. Adams lost the election of 1800 to Jefferson. Adams was bitter, but freely and peacefully gave up the presidency, and transferred power in the first election after Washington. The acts expired, except for the Alien Enemies Act, which is invoked now by Trump. Yet, that act is only operative during wartime.
“And when I say the enemy from within, the other side goes crazy, becomes a sound hole,” Trump barked. “How can he say now they’ve done very bad things to this country? They are indeed the enemy from within. But this is who we’re fighting.”
Trump’s vision of America was also Hitler’s understanding of the country. Albert Speer, Hitler’s architect and chief of war production, became his confidant. He participated in hundreds of dinner table conversations with Hitler. “In general, no such thing as an American people existed as a unit,” Speer wrote in his memoir of Hitler’s view. “They were nothing but a mass of immigrants from many nations and races.”
After the disastrous show at the Garden, Rogan, keen on his commercial viability, separated himself from his sinking sidekick, Hinchcliffe, while at the same time winking at his bro base with a couple of little racially tinged asides. “I’ve gotta tell you, that joke kills at comedy clubs. I don’t like the joke, [but] it kills,” Rogan said on his podcast. “It’s just like, if you’re Puerto Rican and you hear that in the audience, you’re like [groans]. But it’s a funny joke. The joke does well. But I said to him, I go, ‘Dude, that’s the one that’s gonna get you stabbed.’ And he used to talk about it on stage, saying, ‘Joe Rogan always says that’s the one that’s gonna get me stabbed.’” After creating some distance between himself and Hinchcliffe, he singled out Barack Obama for criticizing the “joke” as “really fucked up. You know that’s a joke. That’s like going to a Quentin Tarantino movie [and saying], ‘And then the man killed that woman.’ Like, he didn’t really kill that woman … this is a movie.” But “Kill Tony” really did make himself roadkill and in the process “stabbed” Trump in what was not a movie or a comedy club.
Dancing around having Harris as a guest, Rogan decided that if she would not drop her schedule to see him he would not deign to travel to interview her. Instead, he hosted JD Vance for three hours on Halloween, in which Vance held forth on how young men with more testosterone are more conservative, liberal women are “celebrating” their abortions with “birthday cakes”, and that the surefire way to gain admission to an Ivy League university “is to be trans”. Then, after confidently predicting Trump would win “the normal gay guy”, Vance pronounced the Emily In Paris Netflix series a “masterpiece”.
Conspicuously missing from the cabal that staged the Garden fiasco was the most diligent student of Hitler of all the minions swirling around Trump. Steve Bannon, imprisoned for defying a congressional subpoena to testify on his role on January 6, was still behind bars.
When Bannon saw Trump descend down the Trump Tower escalator to launch his campaign in 2015, he thought, “That’s Hitler!” Bannon was ecstatic, he told New York Times correspondent Jeremy Peters in his book Insurgency: How Republicans Lost Their Party and Got Everything They Ever Wanted. Trump was the demagogue he was waiting for.
After a career on Wall Street, Bannon spent years failing as a film producer; then, radicalized as a rightwinger, he announced his ambition to become “the Leni Riefenstahl of the GOP”. Promoting his dreadful documentary in 2011 on Sarah Palin, The Undefeated, he said, “People have said I’m like Leni Riefenstahl.” Riefenstahl was the leading film-maker of the Third Reich, mistress of Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels, and auteur of Triumph of the Will, a brilliant, innovative account of Hitler’s 1935 Nazi rally in Nuremberg. Bannon, who became Trump’s campaign manager in 2016 and White House senior adviser, saw himself staging Trump as Riefenstahl filmed Hitler. He boasted that he asked himself, “What would Leni Riefenstahl do?”
Bannon walked out of federal prison on 29 October. He still faces New York state charges of financial fraud in a scheme to fleece donors to build Trump’s wall along the Mexican border. He declared that he would resume where he left off. He was on to the coup of 2024. He picked up once again on the big lie of “election integrity”, that the 2024 election might be stolen from Trump just like in 2020. “If people think American politics have been divisive before,” said Bannon, “you haven’t seen anything.”

Guardian,Obama says ‘you can count on Kamala’ at Philadelphia rally – as it happened,"The Guardian’s Alice Hermanwas at the rally given by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders for Harris in Wisconsin earlier.
At the rally, Ocasio-Cortez likened Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant remarks to the words of Adolf Hitler and sought to rally progressive support for Harris.
The New York congresswoman called the election a “precipice” and condemned the former president’s Madison Square Garden rally, where a comic referred to Puerto Rico as “garbage”, spurring widespread outrage on the island.
“They knew exactly what they were doing; let’s dispense with this idea that this is a joke,” said Ocasio-Cortez. She denounced Trump’s guests for saying “absolutely horrific things” about women and minorities.
“It’s the same kind of logic that says a Puerto Rican girl from the Bronx has no business connecting with the community of Madison, Wisconsin,” said Ocasio-Cortez, in a speech that sought to reject Trump’s racist rally and project a vision of unity.
Here is our full report on Obama’s rally for Harris earlier, from Matthew Cantor and Lois Beckett:
Barack Obama made an impassioned pitch for Kamala Harris at a Philadelphia rally with Bruce Springsteen on Monday, telling voters: “It’s not just policies that are on the ballot, it’s who we are.
“Whether this election is making you feel excited or scared, or hopeful, or frustrated, or anything in between: do not sit back,” the former president said. “Put down your phone and vote.”
Speaking in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania as Democrats make a final push for support, Obama – sleeves rolled up and relaxed – ripped into Donald Trump with a blend of criticism and humour. “We have to reject the kind of politics of division and hatred that we saw represented” at Sunday’s Madison Square Garden rally, where a comedian opening for Trump made a series of racist jokes.
“Here’s a good rule,” Obama said. “If somebody does not respect you, if somebody does not see you as fellow citizens with equal claims to opportunity, to the pursuit of happiness, to the American dream, you should not vote for them.”
David Simon, who wrote the TV show the The Wire, among other things, has added his name to the growing list of people cancelling their Washington Post subscriptions following the editorial board’s decision not to endorse a candidate this election.
Simon says he wasn’t going to cancel, but after reading Jeff Bezos’s op-ed explaining the decision, has decided to do so:
In his essay Bezos – who founded Amazon – said he had taken the decision because he was worried that people had lost trust in the traditional US media and were getting their news from social media, leaving them vulnerable to disinformation.
“Most people believe the media is biased. Anyone who doesn’t see this is paying scant attention to reality, and those who fight reality lose,” Bezos, one of the world’s richest men, said.
He added: “Presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election. No undecided voters in Pennsylvania are going to say: ‘I’m going with Newspaper A’s endorsement.’ None. What presidential endorsements actually do is create a perception of bias. A perception of non-independence. Ending them is a principled decision, and it’s the right one.”
Here is our full report from Trump’s rally earlier in Atlanta:
Donald Trump yet again descended upon Atlanta with a week and a day to go, looking for votes in a state that is rapidly running out of voters to woo.
“I do hear the votes are coming in very nicely,” the former president said. When he asked the crowd who had voted, about half raised their hands and cheered. “We’ve got to finish it off.”
Just before Trump took the stage on Monday afternoon across the street from the CNN debate stage that took Joe Biden out of the race, Georgia’s early vote count crossed the 3m mark. More than 40% of Georgia voters have already cast a ballot. About 5 million people voted in Georgia’s 2020 presidential race.
Trump refrained from his regular practice of trashing Atlanta, though he disparaged Fulton county’s district attorney Fani Willis and the election interference charges he still faces, referring to “Fani and her boyfriend” attempting to lock up their “political opponent”.
He described the Harris campaign as one of “demonization and hate”, then referred to her “radical, lunatic left policies”.
“They say: ‘He’s Hitler.’ They say: ‘He’s a Nazi.’ I’m the opposite of a Nazi,” he said. “How can Kamala Harris lead America when she hates Americans? … They’re very bad people who are a threat to democracy.”
Trump took issue with recent criticism made by Michelle Obama. “She was nasty,” Trump said.
There are nearly a million Puerto Ricans living in swing states, according to Politico. Because they live on the US mainland, they are eligible to vote next week.
Almost half a million live in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania.
The Archbishop of the Puerto Rico Archdiocese, Roberto O. González Nieves, has called on Trump to personally apologise for the racist anti-Puerto Rican remarks made at his Madison Square Garden rally in New York, Politico reports.
Sanders addresses voter concerns about Gaza in new video
Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has released a video addressing voter concerns about the Biden-Harris administration’s response to Israel’s war on Gaza.
In it, he seeks to address a comment and question he says he has heard repeatedly: “I disagree with Kamala’s position on the war in Gaza. How can I vote for her?”
In the video, Sanders says that his best answer is, in part, “Even on this issue, Donald Trump and his rightwing friends are worse. In the senate, in Congress, the Republicans have worked overtime to block humanitarian aid to the starving children in Gaza. The president and vice-president both support getting as much humanitarian aid as possible into Gaza as soon as possible.”
He then repeats comments made by Trump, including saying that Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has is” doing a good job” and that the Gaza Strip would make excellent beach-front property for development.
“After Kamala wins, we will together do everything that we can to change US policy towards Netanyahu,” Sanders says.
“And let me be clear. We will have in my view a much better chance of changing US policy with Kamala than with Trump […] but let me also say this, and I deal with this every day as a US senator. As important as Gaza is, and as strongly as many of us feel about this issue, it is not the only issue in this election.”
Sanders then talks about threats to abortion and to addressing climate change.
It’s been an evening of intense overlapping rallies across the US, as Kamala Harris and Donald Trump make their final pitch to swing state voters in a race that still appears to be incredibly close. Some key updates from this evening’s political rallies:
In Atlanta, on a day his campaign is facing furious backlash for a comedian’s racist remarks about Puerto Rico and Latinos at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally the night before, Donald Trumpreturned to attacking immigrants and once again pledged to carry out the biggest mass deportation in US history. He blamed immigrants for raping and murdering American women and girls.
Trump repeatedly compared migrants and asylum-seekers to an invading army. “The United States is now an occupied country,” he said. “November 5, 2024, will be liberation day in America. On day one, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history. We are going to get these criminals out.”
In Ann Arbor, Michigan, Kamala Harris struck a characteristically more optimistic and unifying tone: “We’re not about the enemy within. We know we’re all in this together.” She also highlighted the frustrations of younger voters.
More than a dozen Gaza solidarityprotesters briefly interrupted Harris’s speech. “Stop the genocide!” one yelled. Another was carrying a sign reading “Abandon Harris.”
In Philadelphia, Barack Obama joined Bruce Springsteen to rally support for Harris, describing her as an empathetic and experienced leader, and one who would work for the people, not for herself. Mostly, Obama spent his speech ripping into Trump, including mocking the Trump-branded Bibles the candidate is selling arguing that the good economy during Trump’s first term was the result of his own eight years in office.
In the face of ongoing backlash to the Washington Post’s billionaire owner blocking the paper’s editorial board from endorsing Harris, Jeff Bezos himself has written a note in the newspaper explaining why he thinks newspaper political endorsements are a bad idea.

Republicans ask supreme court to weigh in on ballot-counting in Pennsylvania
An important update from Reuters:
Republicans asked the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday to block a judicial decision from Pennsylvania requiring the counting of provisional ballots cast by voters who make mistakes on their mail-in ballots, potentially affecting thousands of votes in the Nov. 5 presidential election.
The Republican National Committee and Republican Party of Pennsylvania asked the justices to put on hold the Oct. 23 Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling in favor of two Butler County voters who sought to have their provisional ballots counted after their mail-in ballots were rejected during that state’s primary election for lacking secrecy envelopes…
If the justices are not inclined to pause the state court’s ruling in its entirety, the Republicans asked for an order segregating the provisional ballots at issue in the case, which potentially would give the U.S. Supreme Court time to review the legal dispute after the election.

Guardian,‘It can get worse’: Arab and Muslim Americans make final push for Harris,"Many Arab and Muslim Americans across the country are making a final push to get ballots cast for Kamala Harris for president – despite other members of their communities being strongly opposed to a Harris administration given the White House’s support for Israel.
Haitham Wahab, a resident of Dearborn, Michigan, and a Lebanese American who has been canvassing for the Harris-Walz campaign, said one of the best ways to effect change is “from the inside, through coalition-building”.
“As an Arab American, you should definitely vote,” Wahab said. “Voting for Harris is the best possible choice to preserve the maximum political power of the Arab American voter.”
That idea, that a vote for Harris is a strategic one if not necessarily a moral one, is being pushed by a number of advocates trying to turn fellow Arab and Muslim Americans out to the polls.
“We deeply share the pain you experienced this past year from the unimaginable destruction in Gaza, and most recently in Lebanon, which has left us heartbroken and at times deeply traumatized,” Arab Americans for Harris-Walz said in a statement last month. “We come to you as fellow Arabs, many of us once uncommitted voters, asking you to join us in committing to progress.”
A group of Arab American leaders endorsed Harris on Monday in Michigan – the swing state with the US’s largest Arab American population. The endorsement came on the heels of a survey, conducted by the Arab News Research and Studies Unit and YouGov, that showed Arab American voters favoring Donald Trump over Harris.
Wahab told the Guardian about the “hard conversations” he’s had over the past few months while knocking on doors of Arab and Muslim residents still on the fence about voting.
“The reason why they are hard is because … this community is experiencing real pain,” he said, referring to the area’s many Arab residents with family members overseas in harm’s way as Israel continues to strike Gaza and Lebanon.
Wahab added: “For the rest of America, what’s happening in the Middle East is foreign policy, but for these guys, it’s domestic policy.”
The Biden administration has offered “rock-solid, unwavering support” for Israel – a major point of contention among Arab and Muslim voters who have implored the White House to take a tougher stance on Israel, which has killed more than 43,000 Palestinians in Gaza in the last year.
Harris, the vice-president to Joe Biden for the past four years, has been criticized for not breaking with Biden when it comes to her Middle East foreign policy. Harris’s campaign also rejected pleas from activists to allow a Palestinian to speak on stage at the Democratic national convention this summer.
Before Biden dropped out of the election and Harris became the Democratic nominee, activists managed to get nearly 700,000 people to vote “Uncommitted” or similar in the Democratic primaries, in protest against Biden and in an effort to move him on Israel.
Now, leaders of the movement are urging their base to vote against Trump, even though they have not explicitly endorsed Harris.
Among their arguments, they point to Project 2025. In a video, the Uncommitted co-founder Lexis Zeidan calls the blueprint – drafted by conservative strategists for a potential Trump presidency – an “objectively insane document”.
“The current administration’s handling of this genocide has been beyond enraging and demoralizing. But the reality is, it can get worse,” Zeidan says in the video. “No one wants a Trump presidency more than [Israeli prime minister] Netanyahu, because that is his ticket to wiping Palestine off the map.”
An ad targeting Uncommitted voters in Michigan features one of the movement’s leaders, Abbas Alawieh, imploring voters to consider Trump’s potential Palestine policy. “Project 2025 calls for the elimination of all humanitarian aid to the West Bank and Gaza, and here in the US, Trump plans to silence anyone who stands up for Palestinian rights,” he says.
The former Trump administration also has a track record of actions taken against Palestinian statehood, including moving the US embassy to Jerusalem and recognizing the city as Israel’s capital, despite Palestinian claims to part of it as their own future capital. Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and former senior adviser said in March that “Gaza’s waterfront property could be very valuable” and to “move the people out and clean it up”.
Advocates are also urging their communities to remember Trump’s “Muslim ban”, which he vowed to restore if he wins in November.
Emgage Action, the political arm of a prominent Muslim American group that mobilizes Muslim American voters, formally endorsed Harris last month.
“To prevent Trump from returning to the White House, Emgage Action is endorsing Vice-President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz,” the group’s statement said. “This endorsement is not an agreement with Vice-President Harris on all issues, but rather, an honest guidance to our voters regarding the difficult choice they confront at the ballot box.”
Alzayat, a first-generation Arab and Muslim American and former US diplomat who worked on Middle East policy, said if voters, including those from within his own community, don’t invest in Harris, who may cut her own path on Middle East policy, they run the risk of electing “somebody who’s going to be worse”.
“If somebody is so upset at this moment because of what’s happening to the Palestinians, you wouldn’t go and bring somebody who’s going to be worse because of that anger and hurt,” Alzayat said. “You invest in a candidate that at least is going to give you an opportunity. And we think Kamala Harris will give us a better chance to advance an anti-war agenda.”",2024-11-02

Guardian,"When Trump says he’s going to ‘protect’ women, he means ‘control’ them | Arwa Mahdawi","Could Republicans take away a woman’s right to a credit card?
“Hello, I’d like a line of credit, please.”
“Well, before we can even consider that, are you married? Are you taking a contraceptive pill? And can your husband co-sign all the paperwork so we know you have a man’s permission?”
That may not be an exact rendition of an actual conversation between a woman and a US bank manager in 1970, but it’s close enough. Before the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) was passed in 1974, it was considered good business practice for banks to discriminate against women. It didn’t matter how much money she had – a woman applying for a credit card or loan could expect to be asked invasive questions by a lender and told she needed a male co-signer before getting credit. All of which severely limited a woman’s ability to build a business, buy a house or leave an abusive relationship.
Then came the ECOA, which was signed into law 50 years ago on Monday. Banking didn’t magically become egalitarian after that – discriminatory lending practices are still very much an issue – but important protections were enshrined in law. A woman finally had a right to get a credit card in her own name, without a man’s signature.
When things feel bleak – and things feel incredibly bleak at the moment – it is important to remember how much social progress has been made in the last few decades. Many of us take having access to a credit card for granted, but it’s a right that women had to fight long and hard for. Indeed, the ECOA was passed five years after the Apollo 11 mission. “Women literally helped put a man on the moon before they could get their own credit cards,” the fashion mogul Tory Burch wrote for Time on the 50th anniversary of the ECOA being signed.
If feels fitting that such an important anniversary is so close to such an important election. While we must celebrate how far we’ve come, it’s also important to remember that progress isn’t always linear. Rights that we have taken for granted for decades can, as we saw with the overturning of Roe v Wade, be suddenly yanked away.
Is there any chance that, if Donald Trump gets into power again, we might see Republicans take away a woman’s right to her own credit card? It’s certainly not impossible. Trump’s entire campaign is, after all, about taking America back. The former president has also cast himself as a paternalistic protector of women.
“I’m going to do it, whether the women like it or not,” Trump said at a rally on Wednesday. “I’m going to protect them.”
Of course, we all know what “protect” really means in this context: it means “control”. Should he become president again, Trump and his allies seem intent on massively expanding the power of the president and eliminating hard-won freedoms. Conservative lawmakers and influencers want to control a woman’s access to reproductive healthcare. They want to control the sorts of books that get read and the type of history that gets taught. They want to control how women vote. They want to control whether a woman can get a no-fault divorce. They might not take away women’s access to credit, but they will almost certainly try to chip away at a woman’s path to financial independence.
Elon Musk denies offering sperm to random acquaintances
A recent report from the New York Times alleges that he wants to build a compound to house his many children and some of their mothers. “Three mansions, three mothers, 11 children and one secretive, multibillionaire father who obsesses about declining birthrates when he isn’t overseeing one of his six companies: It is an unconventional family situation, and one that Mr Musk seems to want to make even bigger,” the Times notes. Apparently, in an effort to do this, he has been offering his sperm to friends and acquaintances. Musk has denied all this. This joins a growing list of sperm-based denials. Over the summer, he denied claims in the New York Times that he’d volunteered his sperm to help populate a colony on Mars.

Guardian,"If Trump is re-elected, a familiar face may lead the fight against wind: RFK Jr","Donald Trump has hurled insults at wind energy, calling it “bullshit” and “disgusting” and, if elected US president, may turn to another staunch opponent of offshore wind turbines to help stymie the nascent industry: Robert F Kennedy Jr.
Kennedy has emerged as the leading foe of offshore wind in conservative circles and well-connected opposition groups, blaming new turbines, baselessly, for a spate of whale deaths and accusing former friends in the Democratic party of abandoning environmental ideals to the right. Allies see a perfect role for him in advising a new Trump administration crackdown on offshore wind energy.
“I would love to see that because of Robert F Kennedy’s background. He has so much to offer, he’s a real free thinker,” said Robin Shaffer, president of the anti-offshore wind group Protect Our Coast New Jersey, promoted by Kennedy earlier this year. “He has a love for the environment, he clearly loves the outdoors. He comes with some insights you wouldn’t get from a typical politician.”
Kennedy, who ended his own presidential run in August to endorse Trump, has already suggested he will help shape agricultural and health policy should the Republican nominee win. He did not respond to questions on a potential role to combat offshore wind, too, but the Trump campaign said it was “proud” to have his support.
“President Trump will choose the best people for his cabinet to undo all the damage dangerously liberal Kamala Harris has done to our country,” said Steven Cheung, a campaign spokesperson. “But formal discussions of who will serve in a second Trump administration is premature.”
Trump has ramped up rhetoric against wind energy in recent rallies, heightening the nervousness among climate campaigners and the wind industry before next week’s election. The former president has taken aim at offshore wind, saying he will cancel projects on his first day in office while accusing Harris, his Democratic opponent, of enabling the deaths of birds and whales. (Trump also, separately, told a child on Fox News recently that Harris wants to ban cows. She does not.)
“You want to see a bird cemetery? Just go under a windmill, you see thousands of birds dead,” Trump has said. “They are all rusting and disgusting looking. It’s the most expensive form of energy there is. It sounds so wonderful, the wind, the wind, the wind. Wind is bullshit, it’s horrible. It’s too expensive, it doesn’t work.”
This stance chimes with that of Kennedy, who in the early 2000s, as a prominent environmental lawyer, helped kill off a proposed offshore wind farm near his family’s compound in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Since endorsing Trump, Kennedy has appeared with the prominent rightwing figures Jordan Peterson and Tucker Carlson to further tie this cause to the former president’s campaign.
“The Democrats are putting these offshore wind farms in, they are exterminating the whales,” Kennedy told Carlson. “They are about to extinguish the right whales, the last ones on Earth, with these monstrosities.”
Kennedy has few qualms about onshore wind but has said that offshore wind is a “boondoggle” and that green groups and Democrats have “this fixation upon carbon alone”. He told Peterson: “Republicans are focused on protecting the environment, protecting habitat, protecting our children from these toxic chemicals, and the Democratic party and the associated environmental groups have forgotten about that mission.”
The US had just one relatively small offshore wind farm, off the coast of Rhode Island, when Joe Biden took office, but since then the president’s administration has approved 10 commercial projects along the Atlantic coast that, it says, will provide enough renewable power for more than 5m homes.
About 2.6m acres (1.1m hectares) of federal waters, in total, have been leased for about 3,200 turbines that the administration considers to be critical in providing clean energy needed to shift from the fossil fuels causing the climate crisis.
But the rise of US offshore wind has coincided with an apparent spike in whale deaths, with about 230 humpback whales found dead along the coast from Maine to Florida since 2016. Even more worryingly, as many as 20% of the world’s remaining 370 north Atlantic right whales, which are critically endangered, have been killed or injured in this timeframe.
Federal government scientists have stressed there is no evidence that offshore wind turbines are responsible for the whale deaths. Whales have been killed by disease, or after being hit by ships or entangled in fishing nets, autopsies have confirmed, with the warming oceans possibly pushing the marine mammals to forage for food in different, riskier areas.
Wind turbines can have “direct and indirect” effects upon marine life, according to Andy Lipsky, chief of the offshore wind ecology branch at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, with their fixed structures either attracting or deterring different aquatic creatures.
The noise of construction and attached electric cables may also add to what is an increasingly industrialized ocean, he said, but added that more research needed to be done to understand these interactions.
“Noise is a big concern for animals that spend time under water, but the operational noise of these turbines hasn’t caused anything like a mortality event,” said Lipsky. “There is a lot of hard evidence that has examined the dead animals that show they have collided with vessels or tangled with fishing gear. We haven’t had any evidence linking these deaths to wind energy.”
Still, Kennedy has found common cause with several groups, some funded by fossil fuel interests, that have sought to slow the rollout of offshore wind amid some difficulties faced by the industry. Companies have been beset by rising costs, as well as opposition, with the Danish firm Ørsted canceling two projects off New Jersey last year.
Meanwhile, in July, a 300ft-long turbine blade snapped off from the Vineyard wind project, prompting the closure of several Massachusetts beaches to swimmers as the debris washed ashore.
Bonnie Brady, executive director of the Long Island Commercial Fishing Association, said she was “thrilled” to speak with Kennedy on his podcast about the alleged harm of offshore wind in June.
“No energy source wears a halo but the footprint [of wind] is so much dramatically larger than oil and gas,” said Brady, who has ties to a conservative Texas-based group that opposes renewables and promotes oil and gas use.
“I hope whoever wins the election stops offshore wind,” she said. “These turbines are a perfect doomsday machine. They won’t make anything better. They will destroy the ocean.”
But former allies of Kennedy have reacted with dismay to his alliance with Trump, who routinely mocks the dangers posed by the climate crisis and overturned dozens of environmental protections when he was president. Several green groups have condemned him as a conspiracy theorist who spreads “toxic beliefs” on vaccines and global heating.
“It’s been truly horrifying to see because Bobby was such a commanding presence in the environmental movement. He went from Time’s hero for the planet to a scourge,” said Dan Reicher, a lawyer and academic who got to know Kennedy through the Natural Resources Defense Council. The duo went kayaking and camping together in the 1990s.
“I’ve never seen such a fall from being an environmental hero to being an outcast,” said Reicher. “It’s sad to say but RFK Jr and Donald Trump are in perfect alignment now. It’s scary because it could set us back decades on climate change. It’s been such an extreme change, this is the last place I could imagine him ending up. I wouldn’t be surprised if his father and his uncle are rolling over in their graves.”
The seemingly unlikely alliance between Kennedy, a scion of Democratic royalty who campaigned against river pollution from New York to South America, and Trump, a Republican property developer who has called environmental concerns “a giant scam”, has resulted in Trump admitting to some jarring inconsistencies when campaigning together.
“He’s going to straighten out our health and all of that stuff,” Trump said of Kennedy at a rally in Nevada this month.
“I don’t know if I can have him working too much on the environment, I’m a little concerned about that with Bobby. I don’t know if I want him playing around with the liquid gold under our feet. Bobby, work on health. I like the liquid gold, oil and gas. I think I like that a little bit more than Bobby.”",2024-11-01
Guardian,The Guardian view on the US presidential election 2024: a Democratic government is the one we need,"It is hard to imagine a worse candidate for the American presidency in 2024 than Donald J Trump. His history of dishonesty, hypocrisy and greed makes him wholly unfit for the office. A second Trump term would erode the rule of law, diminish America’s global standing and deepen racial and cultural divides. Even if he loses, Mr Trump has shown that he will undermine the election process, with allies spreading unfounded conspiracy theories to delegitimise the results.
There are prominent Republicans – such as the former vice-president Dick Cheney – who refused to support Mr Trump owing to the threat he poses. Gen Mark Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff under Mr Trump, calls his former boss a “fascist”. America was founded in opposition to absolute monarchy. The Republican nominee models himself after the leader he most admires: Russia’s autocratic president, Vladimir Putin.
Mr Trump’s authoritarianism may finish US democracy. He has praised and promised to pardon those convicted in the January 6 insurrection. He has suggested bypassing legal norms to use potentially violent methods of repression, blurring the lines between vigilantism, law enforcement and military action, against groups – be they Democrats or undocumented immigrants – he views as enemies.
His team has tried to distance itself from the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 and its extreme proposals – such as mass firings of civil servants and erasing women’s rights – that poll poorly. But it is likely that, in office, Mr Trump would adopt many of these intolerant, patriarchal and discriminatory plans. He aims to dismantle the government to enrich himself and evade the law. If Republicans gain control of the Senate, House and White House, he would interpret it as a mandate to silence his critics and entrench his power.
Mr Trump is a transactional and corrupting politician. His supporters see this as an advantage. Christian nationalists want an authoritarian regime to enforce religious edicts on Americans. Elon Musk wants to shape the future without regulatory oversight. Both put self-interest ahead of the American people. Democracy erodes slowly at first, then all at once. In office, Mr Trump appointed three supreme court justices, who this summer blocked efforts to hold him accountable for trying to overturn the 2020 election: their immunity ruling renders the president “a king above the law”, in the words of the liberal justice Sonia Sotomayor.
A historic president
Since Kamala Harris stepped into the spotlight following Joe Biden’s exit, her campaign has been a masterclass in political jujitsu, deftly flipping Mr Trump’s perceived strengths into glaring weaknesses. With a focus on joy, the vice-president sharply contrasted with Mr Trump’s grim narrative of US decline. In their sole televised debate, Ms Harris skillfully outmaneuvered Mr Trump, who fell into her traps, appearing angry and incoherent. She is confident and composed. He sounds unhinged.
The Trump agenda threatens to dismantle voting rights, women’s rights and minority rights – not just reversing decades of social progress but burying it. Mr Trump was behind the shredding of reproductive rights. The conservative forces rallying to him are now intent on imposing a national abortion ban, with – should he win – dire implications for IVF and birth control. Republicans have been hurt in the polls by being associated with such unpopular policies – a weak spot that Ms Harris should keep exploiting.
The vice-president has energised Democrats with savvy media appearances while appealing to swing voters. Progressives, determined to defeat Mr Trump, remain committed to freedom and equality. But Ms Harris has disappointed those who have urged her to take a stand on US complicity in Israel’s bombing of civilians in Gaza and Lebanon. Downplaying war crimes, as arms flow to Israel, has already harmed Democratic chances in key swing states like Michigan.
In a political system where style often rivals substance, perception is crucial. While Ms Harris hasn’t made her race and gender central to her campaign, her victory would be historic: she would be the first woman, and the first woman of color, to be president. Symbolism matters to her base. Her candidacy rallied key constituencies – the young, women, African Americans and Hispanics – who were cooling on Mr Biden. This election is a leap of faith in Ms Harris, who offers a sense of possibility for the future, while Mr Trump clings to a reactionary past.
Protecting democracy
Despite his criminal conviction and being declared a rapist by a judge, Mr Trump remains dangerously close to reclaiming the presidency. Many voters still back a man who was the worst US president ever. But probably not a majority of US voters. Republicans benefit from a skewed electoral system: Democrats have won the popular vote in all but one election since 1992, and secured the overall popular majority for the Senate in every six-year cycle since 1996. Yet the country has often been led by Republican presidents and a GOP-controlled Senate, and therefore a Republican-dominated supreme court. In a close race in November, that could mean Mr Trump doesn’t need to win the election – just a court case.
Mr Biden has been a transformational political figure, but he didn’t transform the country. He aimed to tackle inequality, broken public services and the climate crisis with a $4tn plan funded by taxing the rich. His goal was to restore his party’s political credibility by marrying social liberalism with economic justice. But corporate influence and the Democrats’ slim Senate majority shrank his ambitions. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine shifted his focus to national security, as America experienced rising prices. However, Mr Biden made historic investments to green the economy and refocused industrial policy to take on China. Ms Harris’s plans aim to recapture the spirit of Mr Biden’s insurgency.
The US economy is stronger than it has been in decades, yet Mr Trump consistently outpolls Ms Harris on economic issues. This perhaps reflects decades of neoliberalism. Real wages for blue-collar workers have stagnated since the 1970s, while inflation-adjusted house prices have doubled. Polls show 70% of Americans feel significant political and economic reform is needed, putting Democrats at a disadvantage as they are linked to the status quo.
Political hope fades when we settle for what is, instead of fighting for what could be. Ms Harris embodies the conviction that it’s better to believe in democracy’s potential than to surrender to its imperfections. The Republican agenda is clear: voter suppression, book bans and tax cuts for billionaires. Democrats seek global engagement; the GOP favours isolation. The Biden-Harris administration laid the groundwork for a net zero America. A Trumpian comeback would undo it. A Harris win, with a Democratic Congress, means a chance to restore good governance, create good jobs and lead the entire planet’s climate efforts. Defeating Mr Trump protects democracy from oligarchy and dictatorship. There is too much at stake not to back Ms Harris for president.",2024-10-23

This legislation blitz comes on top of an existing health crisis in the West Bank, related to the Palestinian Authority’s fiscal crisis with Israel’s withholding of tax revenues, to the suspension of 40%-50% of travel permits for medical care within Israel since 7 October 2023, and also related to the decrease in Israel-provided healthcare in the West Bank.
As Israeli physicians who have long treated Palestinian patients in Israel and in volunteer-run clinics in the West Bank and East Jerusalem – with the aid of humanitarian organisations such as Unrwa – and who can no longer contact the organisation or get medications or medical supplies for our patients, we feel it is necessary we speak out against this blatant injustice.
Importantly, numerous Israeli physicians and medical personnel have recently co-signed a support letter for the American medical professionals who are against the ongoing health crisis in Gaza, and sent it directly to the White House, urging Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to stop the disaster in Gaza.
The Israeli legislation scheme against Unrwa is going to annihilate healthcare in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, on top of the unbearable catastrophe in the Gaza Strip.

Guardian,Jeffrey Epstein details close relationship with Trump in newly released tapes,"A New York author and journalist has released audio tapes that appear to detail how Donald Trump had a close social relationship with the late sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein that he has long denied.
The tapes, released as part of the Fire and Fury podcast series by Michael Wolff, author of three books about Trump’s first term and 2020 bid for a second, and James Truman, former NME journalist and Condé Nast editorial director, include Epstein’s thoughts about the inner workings of the former US president’s inner circle.
Wolff says the recordings were made during a 2017 discussion with Epstein about writing his biography. Epstein died by suicide while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges two years later. Despite his crimes, the wealthy financier was at the heart of a social circle of the rich and powerful in the US and overseas that contained many famous names.
Wolff claims the excerpt tape is a mere fraction of some “100 hours of Epstein talking about the inner workings of the Trump White House and about his longstanding, deep relationship with Donald Trump”.
Trump once praised Epstein in conversation with New York magazine in 2002, calling him “a terrific guy” and hinted at his interest in women “on the young side”. But he claimed the pair had fallen out 15 years before Epstein was convicted on a prostitution solicitation charge in Florida in 2008.
“I was not a fan of his, that I can tell you,” the president said after Epstein was arrested on federal sex-trafficking charges in 2019.
The Fire and Fury tapes reveal Epstein recalling how then president Trump played his circle off against each other. “His people fight each other and then he poisons the well outside,” he says.
The author names Steve Bannon, Reince Priebus and Kellyanne Conway as being among the acolytes and officials Trump played off each other like courtiers in a competitive court.
“He will tell 10 people ‘Bannon’s a scumbag’ and ‘Priebus is not doing a good job’ and ‘Kellyanne has a big mouth – what do you think?’
“‘[JPMorgan Chase CEO] Jamie Dimon says that you’re a problem and I shouldn’t keep you. And I spoke to [financier] Carl Icahn. And Carl thinks I need a new spokesperson.’”
Epstein continues his exposition of Trump’s approach to management: “So Kelly[anne] – even though I hired Kellyanne’s husband – Kellyanne is just too much of a wildcard. And then he tells Bannon: ‘You know I really want to keep you but Kellyanne hates you.’”
In response to the podcast, Karoline Leavitt, Trump campaign national press secretary, said, “Wolff is a disgraced writer who routinely fabricates lies in order to sell fiction books because he clearly has no morals or ethics” and accused the author of making “outlandish false smears” and engaging in “blatant election interference on behalf of Kamala Harris”.
Wolffs claims on the podcast that he became an “outlet” for Epstein “to express his incredulity about someone whose sins he knew so well, and then this person actually being elected president. Epstein was utterly preoccupied with Trump, and I think, frankly, afraid of him.”
In the broadest strokes, Wolff’s intention is to paint a picture of two wealthy men of the 1980s whose shared interests lie in money, women and status. He describes how they socialized together in New York.
The Guardian recently revealed that in 1993 Epstein had taken Stacey Williams, a Sports Illustrated model and his girlfriend of two months, to Trump’s Fifth Avenue penthouse and allowed or perhaps encouraged the former US president to grope her in what she described as a “twisted game”.
Speaking on the podcast, Wolff said: “Here are these two guys both driven by a need to do anything they wanted with women: dominance and submission and entertainment. And one of them ends up in the darkest prison in the country and the other in the White House.”",2024-11-01
Guardian,"Dead-heat poll results are astonishing – and improbable, these experts say","The US presidential election campaign enters its final weekend with polls showing Donald Trump and Kamala Harris in seemingly permanent deadlock and few clues as to which of them will prevail on Tuesday.
At the end of another unruly week that began with Trump’s racially charged rally in New York’s Madison Square Garden and was punctuated by celebrity endorsements, misogynistic comments and insults about “garbage” being levelled left and right, the Guardian’s 10-day polling average tracker showed little change from seven days earlier, with voter loyalty to their chosen candidate appearing relatively impervious to campaign events, however seismic.
Nationally, Harris, the Democratic nominee, has a one-point advantage, 48% to 47%, over her Republican opponent, virtually identical to last week. Such an advantage is well with the margin of error of most polls.
The battleground states, too, remain in a dead heat. The candidates are evenly tied at 48% in Pennsylvania, often seen as the most important swing state because it has the most electoral votes (19). Harris has single-point leads in the two other blue-wall states, Michigan and Wisconsin, while Trump is marginally ahead in the Sun belt: up by 1% in North Carolina and 2% in Georgia and Arizona. In Nevada, his average advantage in the polls is less than a percentage point.
The latest polling has come against a backdrop of unprecedented levels of early voting in multiple states which, as of Friday, had seen about 65 million Americans already casting their ballots.
It is notoriously difficult to predict anything about future results from early voting, though some 58% of early voters in Pennsylvania aged 65 or over were registered Democrats, Politico reported, compared with 35% from the same cohort who were registered Republicans; the two main parties have roughly equal numbers of registered voters in the state among older adults. About 53% of the demographic voted for Trump in Pennsylvania in 2020, even while he lost the state to Joe Biden.
Trump, in contrast with four years ago, has encouraged his supporters to cast early ballots. That Democrats are turning out in greater numbers may be a positive indicator for them in a bellwether state where commentators have predicted turnout is key to the result. Democratic strategists have claimed they have a 10%-20% lead in senior voter turnout across the three blue-wall states.
But in a fractured political landscape that has featured threats of retribution from Trump, accusations of fascism and racism from Harris, and warnings that democracy itself is on the ballot, the bigger picture – that uniformity, over a prolonged period – has seasoned observers scratching their heads.
The polling-analysis site FiveThirtyEight’s simulator – based on a collection of national and state data - on Friday morning forecast that Trump would win 53 times out of 100 compared with 47 times for Harris was, again, similar to a week before.
In one late burst of positive news for Harris, a Marist poll on Friday held out the possibility that she could break the deadlock: it showed her leading Trump by 3% in Michigan and Wisconsin and 2% in Pennsylvania. Winning all three states probably represents Harris’s clearest path to the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the White House. But the results remained within the survey’s margins of error.
This near-monolithic picture, emerging from multiple polls, has triggered suspicions among some analysts of “herding” around state poll averages by pollsters cautious of being proved wrong for the third time running after significantly underestimating Trump’s support in 2016 and 2020.
Writing on NBC’s website, Josh Clinton, a politics professor at Vanderbilt University, and John Lapinski, the network’s director of elections, pondered whether the tied race reflected not the sentiments of the voters, but rather risk-averse decision-making by pollsters. Some, they suggested, may be wary of findings indicating unusually large leads for one candidate and introduce corrective weighting.
Of the last 321 polls in the battlegrounds, 124 - nearly 40% - showed margins of a single point or less, the pair wrote. Pennsylvania was the most “troubling” case, with 20 out of 59 polls showing an exact tie, while another 26 showed margins of less than 1%.
This indicated “not just an astonishingly tight race, but also an improbably tight race”, according to Clinton and Lapinski.
Large numbers of surveys would be expected to show a wider variety of opinion, even in a close election, due to the randomness inherent in polling. The absence of such variation suggests that either pollsters are adjusting “weird” margins of 5% or more, Clinton and Lapinski argued – or the following second possibility, which they deemed more likely.
“Some of the tools pollsters are using in 2024 to address the polling problems of 2020, such as weighting by partisanship, past vote or other factors, may be flattening out the differences and reducing the variation in reported poll results,” they write.
Either explanation “raises the possibility that the results of the election could be unexpectedly different than the razor-close narrative the cluster of state polls and the polling averages suggest”, they added.
Amid the uncertainty, one thing is certain: however close pollsters have depicted the contest for the past several weeks, as Harris and Trump go head to head in the final days of the most consequential US election in decades, something has to give.",2024-11-02
Guardian,"In Saginaw, where children are dying of gun violence, local races loom large","Tiffany Owens stood before the city council in Saginaw, Michigan, struggling to contain her anguish.
“I hate this city because this city took away something that was so precious and dear to me. I’ve been living here all my life and I had to bury two of my kids. They out in Forest Lawn cemetery,” she said, her voice shaking with grief.
“We just need y’all to do something. I don’t want another mother to have to stand here where I’m standing. It’s not fair that we all are here but I do not want another parent to have to go through this trauma, go through this pain.”
Owens’ eldest son, Tamaris, was 12 years old when he was killed by a stray bullet from a drive-by shooting. Her 26-year-old daughter, Tamarea, met a similar fate nine years later in 2021. Owens fears for the wellbeing of her remaining son.
The family tragedy does not stop there. Owens’ niece, Tonquinisha McKinley, was killed outside her home during a family celebration before Tamarea’s high school prom in 2013.
Behind Owens, other mothers held photographs of children murdered in one of the most dangerous cities in the US. Saginaw has at times had the highest crime rate of any city in Michigan during recent years, surpassing Detroit, with which it shares many of the same problems of industrial decline, deepening poverty and diminishing population over decades.
More than 180 people have been murdered in the city of Saginaw over the past decade, most of them with guns, alongside hundreds of non-fatal shootings. About 20 people have been murdered so far this year.
The bereaved mothers were pleading for action from Saginaw’s city council at its last meeting before local elections alongside the presidential ballot on Tuesday. For some, the local race is the more important of the two as they look to reverse their city’s decline while the Saginaw council stands accused of dithering and focusing on the wrong priorities. Others see Saginaw’s fate, and the safety of its families, as also inextricably tied to who gets into the White House.
Tamara Tucker also spoke at the council meeting. She was still in high school when her 17-year-old brother was shot dead. Not long afterwards, she joined the support group Parents of Murdered Children to help her mother through a terrible time.
Tucker remained a member when a few years later she, too, came to experience the grief of being a parent losing a child after her daughter was murdered.
“I thought, my God, how can this be? Not again,” she told the Guardian.
Tucker’s daughter, MoeNeisha Simmons-Ross, was trying to prevent her boyfriend from leaving her Saginaw apartment with a gun. He shot her with it. She was pregnant with their child. The boyfriend was convicted of murder.
That wasn’t the end. A few months later, Tucker’s younger sister was killed in Florida, and then her nephew in Saginaw.
Tucker blames “selfishness” for the violence and the city’s failure to curb it.
“It’s going to take the whole community to turn this around. I keep saying it, and I will say it until I’m blue in the face, it’s going to take the community caring. Apparently, there’s not enough children being murdered for them to actually say we got to do something about this,” she said.
Barbara Clark went to college to get a degree in criminal justice in an effort to understand the causes of the violence in Saginaw and what to do about it after her son, Tommie Ford, was murdered at 17 years old by another teenager jealous of Ford talking to his former girlfriend.
“I wanted to learn as much about the criminal justice system because I need to be able to talk to them in their language so I can know what you’re talking about when they tell me what you can and can’t do,” she said.
Clark said that politicians, the police and people in other parts of Saginaw county were too often willing to blame parenting and gang culture for the killings so as to sidestep the part played by poverty, which runs at about 34% of the city’s population, and lack of resources.
She ties the rise in murders, shootings and other crimes to Saginaw’s economic decline as more than a dozen car factories closed since the 1990s and the population fell sharply to about 45,000 today. Abandoned houses and bulldozed lots dot many streets on the lower-income east side of the city. Schools have been closed and consolidated. With a dwindling tax base, the city government cut back on services including recreational facilities.
“Everything that was there to help those young people, to go to recreation centres, to do anything, has been shut down, decimated. All the schools here are gone. The schools are now placed on the other side of town so you gotta be commuted to it,” she said.
“A lot of people want to say the parents ain’t doing their job. That may be true in some cases but not in all. There are some parents, for instance us, we are doing the best that we can do. But when you have limited funds, there’s only so much you can do. You’re looking at a poverty level of people in the inner city that things are happening to the family. What needs to happen is for the city of Saginaw to bring things back in for these young people to do, give them a chance.”
There was plenty of sympathy for the mothers from city council members. One expressed condolences for the family of the latest victim, 14-year-old Keyvon Bentley, who was killed at the end of October.
Council member Michael Flores, who is not running for re-election, read the names of some of those killed.
“The thing that hurts me the most as a public official is that we lose Saginaw’s future constantly throughout every year that I’ve been here,” he said. “And a lot of the murder victims that I just listed off were 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 ... It’s the saddest thing that I’ve experienced on council.”
But there was little commitment to specific change even from those members up for re-election.
Criticism of the council has focused on how it is spending $52m in grants under Joe Biden’s American Rescue Plan Act (Arpa). The council used half of the funds to fill a budget shortfall.
The council’s plan for the rest of the money includes $10m to support “community centres, childcare and youth development”. But how that will be spent is still unresolved, to the frustration of campaigners.
Flores told the Guardian the city “lacks either the imagination or the ability” to provide opportunities for young people, including initiatives to help those who are otherwise drawn into “a life of crime to be able to produce money for their families”.
He said the council was too focused on allocating money to develop upscale housing, in the hope of drawing higher-income residents to the city, at the expense of affordable homes that would improve the lives of lower-income families. He pointed to a recent case where the council spent $3m to upgrade a building only to sell it to a developer for $1,000 to convert it to relatively upscale condos while rejecting a higher offer that would have brought more affordable housing.
“The council always has the opportunity to be on the side of the people or be on the side of outside developers that want to come in and get tax abatement or tax credits for developing. We never tend to give it to the people that really need the help,” he said.
Carly Hammond is a union organiser running for a seat on the council who is campaigning for more Arpa money to be spent on facilities for young people.
“There is a lot that the city council can do to combat youth violence and create youth opportunities. Back in the 1960s, there used to be much more robust after-school youth education programmes, community centres, funded by the city,” she said.
“A lot of these organisms and concepts were strategically dismantled. Rebuilding them takes a whole lot. Youth development means investing in neighbourhoods.”
Hammond accuses the council of hiding behind its own bureaucracy to explain why it is not doing more on affordable housing and support for community organisations. She also accuses the council of leaving some federal money on the table from the community development block grant because it failed to put together the proper documentation.
“The lack of investment overall in the community is felt most by the children. They just feel like there’s no future. If you hear parents and young people talk about this, they’re asking for direct action. They’re not asking for sympathy,” she said.
The council also heard from Matthew Carpus, president of the Saginaw police union. He said officers on the force long ago lost confidence in the city’s police chief and council to address crime.
“Most victims in this city don’t speak out. Either they move out of the city or they suffer in silence. Very few come to these meetings because, like officers, they feel you’re not going to do anything,” he said.
“Not only isn’t it being solved, it’s not getting better, it’s trending in the wrong direction. We need to try something different.”
Flores wants to see more of the Arpa money spent on policing.
“I have done many ride-alongs with police officers. For the amount of area that they have to cover, they’re drastically understaffed,” he said. “There were calls, some of them domestic violence calls and the like, that just weren’t able to be picked up because there were more pressing issues in the moment.”
The city has brought in the state police to patrol parts of Saginaw but Clark said that had resulted in little more than racially profiled stop-and-searches of cars.
“It’s not helping. Instead of them doing what they were brought in to do, which is community service, they’re targeting. If these young men are blessed to have a nice car with nice rims and dress nice, you’re definitely targeted. If your car is dressed, made up a certain type of way, they’re definitely going to pull you over,” she said.
Clark is looking to the new council to change the trajectory. But she said the presidential election would be decisive because while Biden has directed financial support to lower-income communities, she expects Trump to do just the opposite.
“Who’s in the White House does affect us because it, I won’t say it trickles down, it starts down and works it way up. They come for our programmes before they do anybody else’s programme. They will cancel our programme before they cancel anybody else’s programmes,” she said.",2024-11-02
Guardian,From an Olympian to a 45-race veteran: the hopes of New York Marathon runners,"New York is a city built on detours. Even the most straightforward journey can turn on a dime – be it an unexpected road closure, unreliable subway, or the unorthodox navigation of a cab driver – into a protracted, often painful, expedition.
The city’s marathon is no exception.
As the sun rises on Sunday, more than 50,000 runners will descend on Staten Island with their sights set on reaching Central Park. While the most direct route to the finish line would cover a little over 16 miles, a 26.2-mile slog through the city’s five boroughs, across five bridges and a multitude of rolling hills lies ahead for the runners.
The New York City Marathon is widely considered the toughest world major for a reason.
Tamirat Tola of Ethiopia and Hellen Obiri of Kenya, each victorious a year ago, are back to defend their titles. They will face stiff competition: other previous winners returning to the fray include Evans Chebet, Albert Korir and Geoffrey Kamworor in the men’s field; and Sharon Lokedi and Edna Kiplagat in the women’s.
A string of American hopefuls are also in the mix, with Olympians Conner Mantz, Clayton Young and Dakotah Popehn back from Paris; CJ Albertson competing just a few weeks after a strong performance in Chicago; and 2018 Boston Marathon winner Des Linden returning for a fifth time.
But the pack of the world’s largest marathon is as wide as it is deep. The former champions and Olympians confronting this course will also lead a legion of runners – first-timers, fundraisers and octogenarian veterans among them – on this convoluted tour.
The Guardian spoke to four athletes as they prepared for Sunday’s race.
Minutes into the race, as the elite pack scales the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, and the highest point of the course, Linden allows herself a brief glance to her left. “I always take a moment to appreciate the views going into the city,” she said. “It’s just spectacular.”
Weaving through each neighborhood, and experiencing each unique community, “the roads are shut down for you to be in the center, have a parade and get this tour of the city,” Linden, a two-time Olympian, says.
The bridges are steep, but the chance to run across them – and take in the views – is “pretty special,” she adds. New York “is the center of the universe, particularly on marathon weekend.”
Linden, 41, represented Team USA at the London 2012 and Rio 2016 Olympics. She has run Boston 11 times and New York four. This time, the aim is for a “same-day finish”, she says with a grin.
The hot favorites, including some of the dominant performers in Paris this summer, may be “a little bit too rich for me, at this point in my career”, she admits. “I’m still enjoying and loving racing, but I don’t have anything to prove, necessarily, at this point.”
But you never know how the race will unfold. “Anything can happen,” says Linden. “We’ll see how it plays out.”
Connie Brown, 80, has run this race more than any other woman: 44 times. For months, she has been training for the 45th.
She remembers finishing for the first time in tears, as her hope that she could do it gave way to the realization that she had. She remembers the live bands, witty signs and kind words which have helped her get to Central Park so many times since.
And she remembers celebrating the early years by dancing the night away, including one post-race party at a Broadway nightclub.
Brown has run New York through heatwaves and showers, under sunshine and lightning – the latter would more likely hit a building than a person, she told herself as it cracked overhead – and past throngs of cheering spectators.
Days before she had been due to fly up for this weekend’s race, personal circumstances forced Brown to stay home. in Sarasota, Florida. She still plans to run a marathon on Sunday, heading out at around 3am to beat the heat.
At this stage, the endeavor is “part of who I think I am,” she says. “I’m the person who runs at least one marathon a year.”
Over the decades, running “has given me a confidence”, says Brown. “Anything you put your mind to – make a goal, make a plan, follow it through – you can do. If you can do this, you can do anything.”
Thousands of runners travel across the world to take on New York. Nate Kahaiali’i, 33, has flown nearly 5,000 miles from Hawaii.
When the teacher and his neighbors were evacuated as wildfires swept Maui last summer, he figured he would return soon enough. Kahaiali’i picked up a few bits and pieces, not realizing what he chose would become all he had left from his house.
Like so many others, he lost his home.
Among the small collection he had salvaged were his trusted pair of bright orange Nike Vaporfly running shoes. To him they have become “symbolic, in a way,” of his hometown of Lāhainā.
Wearing them, as he will on Sunday, is “a way for me to honor, but also represent, the community,” says Kahaiali’i, who has raised almost $7,000 (and counting) for the reconstruction effort by selling T-shirts with the words “Lāhainā Strong”.
“The main hope – whether they buy the shirt, or not – is just to keep Maui in people’s minds,” he says. “It’s been a year, but there’s still a lot of work for a lot of families out here in Lāhainā.”
Kahaiali’i, who teaches health, also hopes his marathons will inspire his students, who call him Mr K. “Every time I come back, they’re like: ‘Did you win? Did you win?’,” he says. “I’m like ‘No, I’m not that fast’.”
He is planning to wear his Vaporflys at all six of the world major marathons. With four to go, “they’re still in pretty good shape.”
Concepcion Gonzalez, 65, had not run “even a mile” before this summer. She is about to run her first marathon.
For years, Gonzalez – who has lived in New York for more than three decades – has sat in the grandstand cheering on her daughter, Teresita, and son, Luis.
She watched as hundreds of people, of all abilities, and from all walks of life, crossed the finish line. “I saw people who look like me, and I thought I could do it, one day.”
Gonzalez is under no illusions that it will be easy. “Everybody goes through tough times,” she says. “People fall down. They can get up. I, too, can embark on this journey.”
For many who tackle it, this course is less a race than it is a feat of resilience; more a test of perseverance than pace. But she is prepared.
Gonzalez, who will run alongside Teresita, 29, and Luis, 32, on Sunday, is excited to see her city from a new angle. “I feel a sense of pride, being from New York City,” she says, “in being able to represent New York City”.
Brown, who first ran New York in 1978, has plenty of advice for first-timers. “Don’t eat anything you haven’t eaten before” the night before, for starters. Don’t fret too much about sleeping well, either. And if one of your knees starts feeling dodgy, “think about your other knee”.
Linden recommends treating the first two miles – a steep uphill climb on the Verrazzano, setting up a sharp downhill descent – as a warm-up, and not worrying too much about pace. “Really, it’s great,” she says, “because New York’s only a 24-mile marathon when you take those two out.”
Conversely, once you reach Manhattan in the second half, try not to push too hard. The crowd is “just electric”, says Linden, “and you’re going to feel like ‘I must be winning,’ cause they’re going so nuts. But you’ve still got a long ways to go.”
Just soak it all up, adds Brown. “Don’t miss things,” she says. “Don’t be so into yourself and focused on your running that you’re not seeing the neighborhoods, that you’re not seeing the people that are there.”
Some people run New York to show the world. Others are out to show themselves.
As elite marathon times get faster and faster, those at the very front are running against the clock. But the majority of runners who stride through the five boroughs are running for something.
For some, this marathon amounts to a grueling physical test. Others will encounter the mental challenges that materialize when your body is pushed to its limits. Many, if not most, will be forced to grapple with both.
No matter the journey that led them here; whether it’s their first time, or 45th; whether they’re a few thousand miles, or a stone’s throw, from home; some 50,000 will gather in Sunday’s early hours with the same fundamental goal.

Guardian,Lake Victoria stays unbeaten with Juvenile Fillies’ Turf win at Breeders’ Cup,"Lake Victoria, already the winner of Group One races over seven and six furlongs, justified odds-on favouritism in the Breeders’ Cup Juvenile Fillies’ Turf on Friday under a patient and resourceful ride by Ryan Moore.
Moore had few options from his draw in stall one against the rail and stoked Lake Victoria towards the lead on the run to the first turn. The favourite suffered significant interference on the bend, however, as Totally Justified moved across from Moore’s right, and she exited into the back stretch in seventh place.
Moore took his time to work his way back into the race, confident that Lake Victoria’s turn of foot would still prove decisive. He was still scraping the rail on the final turn but then picked his moment at the top of the stretch to fire Lake Victoria into the open and past the front-running Thought Process on the way to a comfortable success.
“She had very strong form coming into the race, and really all she needed was normal racing luck and a clear shot,” Moore said. “We just about managed that and she proved to be much the best.
“She got pressure on the outside [on the first turn] and got pushed into the fence, and that was that, we had to come back. When that happens, it’s significant interference and puts you at a disadvantage, but they’d gone very quick and as soon as we got halfway down the back straight, most of the horses [in front] were done.”
Lake Victoria is still unbeaten after five starts and remains favourite for next year’s 1,000 Guineas at around 3-1.
Earlier on the card, Magnum Force was a first Breeders’ Cup winner for Ger Lyons in the Juvenile Turf Sprint, the first of 14 Breeders’ Cup races this weekend.
Magnum Force had seven rivals in front of him with just over a furlong to run, around a turf track that is tight even by American standards and tends to favour horses ridden prominently.
Colin Keane, though, managed to thread Magnum Force up the inside rail before switching outside the front-running Governor Sam as another Irish-trained runner, Arizona Blaze, stayed on into second. Governor Sam took third with the fast-finishing Big Mojo, attempting to give Mick Appleby a second successive win in the race, a nose away in fourth.
Lyons is a Classic-winning trainer in Ireland but his successes in the Irish 2,000 Guineas and Irish Oaks in 2020 were recorded while crowd restrictions were in place during the Covid epidemic.
“We won the Oaks and the Guineas standing on our own in the stands,” Lyons said. “Now I’ll take it, don’t get me wrong, but then you come here and that’s what sportsmen want. We work hard and we have more losing days than winning days, and just to get that buzz, money can’t buy that.
“The sky’s the limit next year, because it’s all about next year. We came here to teach him how to sprint, and you have to learn how to sprint and he’s getting better and better.
“I knew he was the right horse for the job, and when you’ve Colin Keane riding for you … He’s probably the most underrated champion jockey in the world, just because he’s a bit like his trainer, he likes to stay at home and walk his dogs.”
Europe completed a sweep of Friday’s three races on turf and Moore a double on the night as Henri Matisse took the Juvenile Turf from a wide draw in stall 13.
The win was Aidan O’Brien’s 20th success at the Breeders’ Cup, giving him a share of the all-time record at the meeting with the American legend, D Wayne Lukas.",2024-11-02
Guardian,From JLo to Beyoncé: the double-edged sword of celebrity endorsements,"The 2024 presidential election is, as best as anyone can tell from the inexact art of polling, essentially a toss-up. No one knows who is going to win on Tuesday (and we probably won’t know for a while afterwards, for that matter). In lieu of any definitive edge in numbers, both prognosticators and casual observers are resorting to vibes – that amorphous, indefinable and personal sense of who has the momentum, where the energy is shifting, what feels true. And for the candidates, one guaranteed way to assert a vibe – albeit maybe not the one they intended – is to recruit arguably the defining element of modern American politics: celebrity.
In the past two weeks alone, both Trump and Harris have assembled their respective famous avengers (including in Harris’s case, the actual Avengers), to stump for their campaign. Harris, unsurprisingly, boasts far more and higher-profile endorsements, including but not limited to: Taylor Swift, LeBron James, George Clooney, Jennifer Aniston, Julia Roberts, Marc Anthony, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Tyler Perry, Usher, Lizzo, Eminem and the Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny, who released a video this week rebuking the racist comments made by the comedian Tony Hinchcliffe during Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden. During the final weeks of the campaign, Harris was joined on the trail by Beyoncé, Bruce Springsteen, Stevie Wonder, Maggie Rogers, Willie Nelson, Jennifer Lopez and Oprah, among others.
What to make of the roster? On the one hand, it suggests a level of popular enthusiasm for Harris in strong contrast to Trump, who has trotted out his usual stable of ex-wrestlers and a handful of actors. Celebrities joining the Trump campaign in the past month include Kid Rock, Elon Musk, Hulk Hogan, Dennis Quaid, Zachary Levi, the rapper Kodak Black, Dr Phil, the former NFL quarterback Brett Favre and country singer Jason Aldean. Celebrity endorsements are one way to measure the vibes in an election whose polls are too close – and, for a large swath of the electorate either scarred or delighted by 2016, too untrustworthy – to reasonably make out the frontrunner, and on the level of star power, Harris certainly has the edge.
But a bulwark of celebrity support also presents what Shamira Ibrahim, writing for the Guardian just after Swift’s much-coveted endorsement in September, called a “double-edged sword” of Hollywood glitz. Endorsements may gin up enthusiasm among a star’s fanbase, but they also play into Republicans’ arguments that Democrats are the party of the coastal elites. (It should be noted, however, that Trump, a celebrity by trade, has not shied away from any semi-famous endorsement, even posting an AI deepfake Swift endorsement that she later condemned.)
It also gives the impression of desperation – either on behalf of the campaign or the celebrities – for relevancy in an election that has been relatively light on substantive issues (again, an unfair double standard for the Trump campaign, but a complaint lodged by many in Harris’s own party). As Harris has stumped for her expanded child tax credit, building back the middle class, restoring reproductive freedoms and “not going back”, many headlines have focused on her guests – the beatific presence of Beyoncé chief among them, giving uncanny flashbacks to the final self-satisfied days of Clinton’s campaign in 2016.
All this celebrity speechifying, while there is still little evidence to support the notion that celebrity endorsements make much of a difference. The gold standard example of celebrity influence remains Oprah supporting Barack Obama in 2008 – her first presidential endorsement, credited with bringing in about 1m votes for the then-Illinois senator. But that was during the Democratic primary, when engaged Democratic voters were largely deciding between Obama and Clinton, not the general election between Obama and John McCain. For general elections, celebrity effect remains difficult to quantify, and more or less minor. According to a recent YouGov survey, only 11% of Americans report that a celebrity has caused them to reconsider their stance on a political issue, and only 7% say an endorsement has led them to vote for a certain candidate. Democrats are far more likely to say that celebrities weighing in on politics helps democracy, though still less than half of them do – 41% compared with 12% for independents and 7% for Republicans.
Where celebrities can make a difference is in attracting fundraising, attention and participation, if not necessarily shifting a vote. After Swift posted her endorsement of Harris in September, 406,000 people clicked her link to Vote.gov, which directs people to state voting websites (though it’s unknown how many followed through and actually registered). A 2024 study by the Harvard Kennedy School found that celebrities can increase voter registration or poll worker signups with their platforms, particularly for younger voters disillusioned with older voices or institutions. One cited example was when Kylie Jenner posted a non-partisan voter registration link in 2020; the site later reported a 1,500% increase in traffic compared with the day before and an 80% increase in total users registering to vote. As David Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center, put it to CBS 58: “Overall, celebrities would like to think they could influence voter behavior, but they are more valuable as fundraising tools and door-opening opportunities to their followers.”
Registering to vote is, while not nothing, also not the same as actually going to vote, let alone voting for a celebrity’s preferred candidate. But when the election may come down to a handful of counties in a few states, in an election projected to feature record voter turnout from gen Z, the vibe is urgent. There’s a sense of desperation, trying to get every single voter over the finish line – maybe a Maggie Rogers fan in Michigan, or a Beyoncé fan in Houston, or a secretly Harris-leaning woman moved by Julia Roberts’s ad, although it’s admittedly hard to fathom how a voter either undecided or tuned out would 1) pay attention to just the rally with said celebrity or 2) seriously reconsider not voting for Trump because of it. (In reverse, it’s hard to imagine the Hogan or Quaid diehards on the fence, but maybe they exist!)
In the end, given the lack of evidence – yet – on a celebrity actually getting people to vote their way, the meaning of all these endorsements goes back to vibes. Maybe Harris’s overwhelming advantage in celebrity firepower feels like an actual advantage, maybe it feels ominously out of touch. Whether you view the endorsements as a good thing or an omen is, in these final days of the campaign, really just how you feel.",2024-11-02
Guardian,How can the candidate with most votes lose? The US electoral college explained,"Even though the United States touts its status as one of the world’s leading democracies, its citizens do not get to directly choose the president. That task is reserved for the electoral college – the convoluted way in which Americans have selected their president since the 18th century.
Contrary to its name, the electoral college is more a process than a body. Every four years, in the December following an election, its members – politicians and largely unknown party loyalists – meet in all 50 states on the same day and cast their votes for president. Then they essentially disappear.
In recent years there has been growing criticism of the electoral college, accelerated by the fact that two Republican presidents – George W Bush in 2000 and Donald Trump in 2016 – have been elected president while losing the popular vote. But there’s no sign that US elections will change any time soon.
Here’s everything you need to know
What exactly is the electoral college?
Article II of the US constitution lays out the process by which a president is elected.
Each state has a number of electors that’s equal to the total number of representatives and senators it has in Congress. Washington DC gets three electoral votes. In total, there are 538 electors. A candidate needs the votes of 270 of them, a simple majority, to win.
The constitution says that state legislatures can choose how they want to award their electors. All but two states have long chosen to use a winner-take-all system – the winner of the popular vote in their state gets all of the electoral votes.
To complicate matters further, two states, Maine and Nebraska, award their electors differently. In both states, two electoral college votes are allocated to the statewide winner. Each state then awards its remaining electors – two in Maine and three in Nebraska – to the winner in each of the state’s congressional districts.
Why does the US have an electoral college?
When the founding fathers gathered in Philadelphia to draft the US constitution in 1787, they had a lot of trouble figuring out a system for choosing a chief executive. Initially, they proposed a plan that would have Congress choose the president. But that led to concerns that the executive branch, designed to be independent from Congress, would be subject to it.
A contingent of the delegates also favored electing the president through a direct popular vote. But the idea never got broad support and was shut down repeatedly during the convention, the historian Alexander Keyssar wrote in his book Why do we still have the electoral college.
There were a number of reasons the idea was not widely popular. First, the convention had adopted the racist three-fifths compromise in which slaves were counted as three-fifths of a person for population purposes. This was a win for the southern states, in which slaves made up a sizable chunk of the population. A popular vote system would have disadvantaged the southern states because they had fewer people who could vote.
There were also concerns about giving too much power to larger states and that voters would be unable to learn about the candidates from different states, according to Keyssar. It was a debate driven more about pragmatics than about political rights, he writes.
Towards the end of the convention, a committee of 11 delegates was appointed to deal with unresolved matters and one of them was how to select the president. They proposed a version of what we have now come to understand as the electoral college.
“This brief nativity story makes clear that the presidential election system enshrined in the Constitution embodied a web of compromises, spawned by months of debate among men who disagreed with one another and were uncertain about the best way to proceed,” Keyssar wrote. “It was, in effect, a consensus second choice, made acceptable, in part, by the remarkably complex details of the electoral process, details that themselves constituted compromises among, or gestures toward, particular constituencies and convictions.”
What is a swing state?
States that either presidential candidate has a good shot at winning are often called “swing states”.
In the 2024 election, there are seven swing states: Pennsylvania (19 electoral votes), Wisconsin (10 electoral votes), Michigan (15 electoral votes), Georgia (16 electoral votes), North Carolina (16 electoral votes), Arizona (11 electoral votes), and Nevada (six electoral votes). Whichever candidate wins the election must carry some combination of those states, which is why the candidates will spend the majority of their time and resources there. Joe Biden carried all of those states bar North Carolina in the 2020 election.
The idea of a swing state can also change over time because of changing demographics. Until recently, for example, Ohio and Florida were considered swing states, but they are now considered pretty solidly Republican. Michigan was considered a pretty solid Democratic stronghold until Donald Trump won it in 2016.
Does the electoral college allow for minority rule?
There have been five elections in US history – in 1824, 1876, 1888, 2000 and 2016 – in which the candidate who became the president did not win the popular vote. This has led to wider recognition of imbalances in the system and a push from some to abolish the electoral college altogether.
The loudest criticism is that it’s a system that dilutes the influence of a presidential vote depending on where one lives. A single elector in California represents more than 726,000 people. In Wyoming, an elector represents a little more than 194,000 people.
Another critique is that the system allows a tiny number of Americans to determine the outcome of the presidential election. In 2020, about 44,000 votes between Wisconsin, Georgia and Arizona allowed Biden to win the electoral college. Such a slim margin is extraordinary in an election that 154.6 million people voted in.
In 2016, about 80,000 combined votes gave Trump his winning margins in key swing states.
Do electors have to vote for a specific candidate?
State political parties choose people to serve as electors who they believe are party stalwarts and will not go rogue and cast a vote for anyone other than the party’s nominee. Still, electors have occasionally cast their votes for someone else. In 2016, for example, there were seven electors who voted for candidates other than the ones they were pledged to. That was the first time there was a faithless elector since 1972, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Many states have laws that require electors to vote for the candidate they are pledged to. In 1952, the US supreme court said that states could compel electors to vote for the party’s nominee. And in 2020, the court said that states could penalize electors who don’t vote for the candidate they’re pledged to.
How has the electoral college remained in place for so long?
Since almost immediately after the electoral college was enacted, there have been efforts to change it. “There were constitutional amendments that were being promoted within a little more than a decade after the constitution was ratified,” Keyssar said. “There have been probably 1,000 or more constitutional amendments to change it or get rid of it filed since 1800. Some of them have some close.” (There were more than 700 efforts as recently as 2019, according to the Congressional Research Service.)
When the idea of a national popular vote was proposed in 1816, Keyssar said, southern states objected. Slaves continued to give them power in the electoral college, but could not vote. “They would lose that extra bonus they got on behalf of their slaves,” he said.
After the civil war, African Americans were legally entitled to vote, but southern states continued to suppress them from casting ballots. A national popular vote would have diminished their influence on the overall outcome, so they continued to support the electoral college system.
The country did get close to abolishing the electoral college once, in the late 1960s. In 1968, George Wallace, the southern segregationist governor, almost threw the system into chaos by nearly getting enough votes to deny any candidate a majority in the electoral college. The US House passed the proposed amendment 339 to 70. But the measure stalled in the Senate, where senators representing southern states filibustered.
That led to continued objections to a national popular vote so that southern white people could continue to wield power, according to the Washington Post. President Jimmy Carter eventually endorsed the proposal, but it failed to get enough votes in the Senate in 1979 (Joe Biden was one of the senators who voted against it).
“It’s not like we are suddenly discovering this system really doesn’t work,” Keyssar said.
Is there any chance of getting rid of the electoral college now?
The most prominent effort to get rid of the electoral college today is the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. The idea is to get states to agree to award their electors to the winner of the national popular vote, regardless of the outcome in their specific state. The compact would take effect when states having a total of 270 electoral votes – enough to determine the winner of the election – join.
So far 17 states and Washington DC – a total of 209 electoral votes – have joined the effort.
But the path ahead for the project is uncertain. Nearly all of the states that haven’t joined have either a Republican governor or legislature. And legal observers have questioned whether such an arrangement is constitutional – something that would probably be quickly put to the US supreme court.",2024-11-01
Guardian,The key US Senate races that could determine who controls the chamber,"The Democrats are fending off a Republican offensive aimed at overturning their tiny majority in the Senate.
Retaking control of the US Congress’s upper chamber may represent the GOP’s best opportunity of success in November’s election, according to analysts, surpassing their chances of retaking the White House or even retaining control of the House of Representatives.
But with a burst of enthusiasm from Kamala Harris’s campaign, Democrats are still competitive.
What is the Senate’s current makeup?
The Democrats currently hold 48 of the 100-member chamber’s seats plus having the support of three independent senators who sit with the party’s caucus and back it on important votes. The Republicans have 49 seats, meaning they only need to gain two in November – when one-third of the seats are up for grabs – to regain control.
How likely are Republicans to take control?
On the face of it, the GOP have the edge. The retirement of Joe Manchin, a centrist Democrat from West Virginia with a track record of taking Republican-friendly positions, is almost certain to result in a GOP gain in a state that has become a party stronghold.
If Donald Trump were to retake the White House, winning West Virginia alone would be enough to in effect hand the Senate to the Republicans, with the vice-president being awarded the casting vote under the US constitution in a 50-50 split scenario.
Where are sitting Democrats most vulnerable?
Two Democratic incumbent senators in GOP heartland states are seen as particularly vulnerable; Jon Tester of Montana and Sherrod Brown of Ohio. The latter is a one-time election battleground that has been won by Trump in recent elections and is now considered solid Republican territory.
In states that have become increasingly conservative, both Tester and Brown have sought to stay competitive by emphasising their independence from the more liberal national party organisation. Each stayed away from August’s Democratic national convention in Chicago to focus on wooing independent and swing voters whose support is deemed vital to holding their seats. The Cook Political Report has designated Montana as leaning Republican and Ohio as a toss-up.
Montana
John Tester v Tim Sheehy
Tester, who has held the seat since 2006, is running for a fourth term in a state Trump won by 16 points four years ago against Tim Sheehy, a former Navy Seal and businessman, who has the former president’s backing.
Read David Smith’s reporting about the Montana Senate race here.
Ohio
Sherrod Brown v Bernie Moreno
Brown has been in the Senate for as long as Tester and is also seeking his fourth term. His opponent, Bernie Moreno, is another Trump-backed candidate who was not the choice of the Republican establishment in Ohio.

Key presidential battleground states where the Republicans hope to make gains
Nevada
Jacky Rosen v Sam Brown
Jacky Rosen, a first-term senator elected in 2018, is facing a challenge from Sam Brown, a Republican with a bracing back story but a thin political résumé. Brown, a graduate of West Point military academy and veteran of the long US-led military effort in Afghanistan, barely survived a roadside bomb attack in Kandahar that left him permanently scarred. Like Tester and Brown, Rosen opted to skip the recent Democratic convention to focus on her Senate defense.
The Cook Report categorizes the race as leaning Democrat.
Wisconsin
Tammy Baldwin v Eric Hovde
The two-term senator Tammy Baldwin is up against Eric Hovde, a wealthy GOP banker and businessman who is funding his own campaign. But his local bona fides have been questioned by Democrats who have stressed his connections to southern California.
The race is judged as a toss-up by the Cook Report.
Read Alice Herman’s reporting about the Wisconsin Senate race here.
Pennsylvania
Bob Casey v David McCormick
The three-term incumbent Democratic senator Bob Casey is pitted against David McCormick, former chief executive of Bridgewater Associates, one of the world’s largest hedge funds.
Casey is favoured to hang on to his seat, partly because of strong local name recognition. His opponent has already suffered defeat in a Pennsylvania Senate race, having narrowly lost the Republican state primary in 2022 to Mehmet Oz, who then lost to Democrat John Fetterman in the election for a seat that had been left vacant by the retirement of a GOP incumbent, Pat Toomey, one of only seven Senate Republicans to vote to convict Trump over the January 6 attack on the US Capitol at his second impeachment trial.
The Cook Report also classes it as a toss-up.
Read Joan E Greve’s reporting about the Pennsylvania Senate race here.
Arizona
Ruben Gallego v Kari Lake
A seat left vacant by the retirement of Kyrsten Sinema, a former Democrat who quit the party to become an independent, is now a key target of Kari Lake, a one-time television news anchor who has positioned herself as a vocal Trump supporter and arch-exponent of the lie that the 2020 election was stolen. She repeated the tactic when she lost the 2022 Arizona governor’s race to Democrat Katie Hobbs. Her opponent is Gallego, a Democratic member of the House and former Marine who served in Iraq.
The Cook Report judges the contest as leaning Democrat.
Read Lauren Gambino and Rachel Leingang’s reporting about the Arizona Senate race here.
Michigan
Elissa Slotkin v Mike Rogers
Here the Republicans are on the offensive to replace a retiring Democratic senator, Debbie Stabenow, who is stepping down after 24 years. Trying to fill her shoes will be Elissa Slotkin, currently a Democratic member of the House, who will be in a race with Mike Rogers, a mainstream Republican who once said his party had to move beyond Trump before changing tack to embrace him, earning the former president’s endorsement.
The race is considered a toss-up by the Cook Report.
Maryland
Angela Alsobrooks v Larry Hogan
Solidly Democratic Maryland, which includes the liberal suburbs of Washington DC, is crucial to the party’s hopes of clinging to its Senate majority.
Instead, it’s turning into a dogfight between the Democratic candidate, Angela Alsobrooks, the executive of one of Maryland’s biggest counties, and the state’s former Republican governor Larry Hogan. An American Association of Retired Persons poll showed the pair at 46% each – despite Harris holding a 20% state lead in the presidential race. Part of the explanation is the moderate public profile of Hogan, a traditional Republican who has positioned himself as anti-Trump and has said he does not seek the former president’s endorsement.
Indeed, buoyed by the recent poll, Hogan has now gone further, marketing himself in a fresh ad as one of the few Republicans who has never “caved” to Trump and extolling his decision to dispatch the Maryland national guard to put down the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol.
The state that Trump lost to Joe Biden by 33 points in 2020 is in likely Democratic territory, according to the Cook Report.

Guardian,This race could affect Pennsylvanians more than the presidential election. Can Democrats win?,"In a Pennsylvania suburb whose voters are coveted by both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, Nicole Ruscitto walked from house to house on a gloomy Tuesday afternoon, informing residents that there is another important race in November.
“I’m Nicole, I’m running for state senate in your district,” she told voters on the doorsteps of their red brick houses in Bethel Park, a town about 30 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh, which, if yard signs and election results are any gauge, is about evenly divided between Trump and Harris supporters. “I want to go to Harrisburg to help our families.”
In a swing state that’s considered by both Trump and Harris as perhaps the most important to deciding the presidential election, Ruscitto is running for an office that receives less attention than the occupant of White House or members of Congress, yet may have far more impact on the day-to-day life of Pennsylvanians.
For three decades, Democrats have been locked out of power in the state’s general assembly. On 5 November, the party is hoping the elections of Ruscitto, a school teacher and former town councilmember, and three other candidates to the state senate will change that.
Should they wind up with control of the senate and the house of representatives – the party’s majority in the latter is just one seat – Democrats will finally be able to send Josh Shapiro, the Pennsylvania governor, a host of legislation that Republicans are currently blocking, ranging from increasing the minimum wage to abortion rights.
“If we could have that trifecta, Governor Shapiro would be able to do so many great things for the people here in Pennsylvania, and I plan on doing that 100%,” Ruscitto said in an interview at her campaign office.
While many Americans are fixated on the presidential election, there are 5,808 legislative seats in 44 states up for grabs in November, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, and voters’ choices may be more impactful than ever before. State governments across the United States have in recent years picked up the policymaking slack from Washington DC, where partisan gridlock and uncooperative Congresses have meant successive presidents have failed to enact many of their campaign promises.
The results can be seen in the stark differences between laws in red and blue states.
Where Democrats rule, governors have enacted laws to protect abortion access, cut down on emissions tied to climate change, curb gun violence and streamline the process to cast ballots. Republican-led states, meanwhile, have banned abortion to varying degrees, targeted gender-affirming care for transgender youths, restricted cities from passing gun control measures and expanded the role of religion in public education.
Many states have legislatures and governor’s mansions controlled by the same party. A smaller group of states, including Wisconsin, Kansas and North Carolina, have governors of one party and legislatures controlled by the other. Pennsylvania is the only state in the union where the two houses of the general assembly are held by different parties.
Considered a part of Democrats’ “blue wall” along the Great Lakes, the Keystone state has supported the party’s presidential candidates in most recent elections, though this year’s polls show Trump and Harris essentially tied. Democrats have also seen victories at the state level with the election of Shapiro and the US senator John Fetterman in 2022.
But control of the general assembly has eluded them since 1994. John J Kennedy, a political science professor at West Chester University and an expert on the state legislature, credited that to a push by Republicans to draw district maps in their favor, as well as Democratic voters’ tendency to be clustered in states’ urban areas.
“Democrats are at a natural disadvantage when it comes to the geography of a state like Pennsylvania, because they waste more votes,” he said. “Democrats are so concentrated, they’re at a sort of a natural disadvantage when it comes to accumulating a majority of seats.”
The tide began to turn two years ago, when Democrats barely took control of the house in midterm elections that saw the party perform far better than expected nationwide, fueled by voters’ outrage at the US supreme court for overturning Roe v Wade. But Republican control of the state senate has meant many of their legislative ambitions – including a bill intended to protect abortion seekers in the state, where the procedure is legal up until about 24 weeks of pregnancy – have gone nowhere.
Vincent Hughes, a Democratic senator who is the campaign chair of the Pennsylvania senate Democratic campaign committee, said he believes more voters are aware of the importance of legislative races, citing Trump’s attempts to get Republicans in Pennsylvania and other swing states to go along with his plan to block Joe Biden from taking office in 2020.
“What has happened is that the importance of state legislators nationally has become much clearer in the last four or five years, and I think that will lead to more folks getting more engaged in down-ballot races at the state legislative level,” he said in an interview.
Democrats’ hopes for a majority hinge on winning purple districts around the city of Erie, the state capital Harrisburg, and two in Pittsburgh’s suburbs – including the one in its western outskirts where Ruscitto is running against incumbent Devlin Robinson. A Marine Corps veteran and businessman, Robinson unseated a Democratic officeholder four years ago and promptly signed a letter, along with many of his colleagues, encouraging the top Republicans in Congress to delay certifying Pennsylvania’s election results as part of Trump’s disproven campaign of election denialism.

Ruscitto hopes her emphasis on cost-of-living issues and personal experience as a teacher, as well as attacks on Robinson for voting for a state constitutional amendment that could be used to curb abortion access, will give her an edge.
“We have the lowest minimum wage, and it sits in our state senate, and it’s not getting passed. And, to me, that’s absurd,” she said.
Residents of the district say Robinson has been stepping up his outreach to constituents as election day approaches. Joyce Reinoso, a retired teacher and campaigner for candidates who backs organized labor and public education, said he also has the power of incumbency.
“I don’t care what party, it’s always harder to beat the incumbent because the name recognition, if nothing else,” she said.
The Ruscitto campaign’s internal polling has found her leading Robinson by a mere two percentage points, within their survey’s margin of error. This week, the University of Virginia’s center for politics rated Pennsylvania’s house as a toss-up, but said the GOP has the edge in keeping the senate.
In Bethel Park, which was briefly thrust into the national spotlight in July when a man from the town tried to kill the former president, houses with Trump yards signs and flags sit across the street from those backing Harris, and the two candidates’ ads are ubiquitous online and on television. But signs for Ruscitto and Robinson are relatively scarce – as are strong opinions.
As she sat down for an early dinner at Ma and Pop’s Country Kitchen, Sandy Messiner, a retired bookkeeper, expressed no doubts about voting for Trump again.
“If Trump gets in, my investments will go up. We need a businessman to run this country,” the 70-year-old said. And though she knew less about them, she planned to vote for all the other Republicans on the ballot.
“I don’t care who gets in as long as they’re Republican.”
Sitting at the other end of the counter was Pam Cirucci, an 83-year-old retired nurse who was sure she would not be voting for Trump, because “he doesn’t respect females”.
A former Republican, Cirucci was less concerned with who controlled the legislature – or what the lawmakers in Harrisburg were up to at all.
“There are so many things that are more important,” she said.",2024-10-24

Guardian,The big lie 2.0: Trump plan to subvert 2024 election more organized than ever,"There is little doubt that Donald Trump will refuse to accept a defeat in November’s US presidential election.
The former president, who is deadlocked in the polls with Kamala Harris, has spent months priming his supporters to believe the only way he could lose is through fraud. “If I lose – I’ll tell you what, it’s possible. Because they cheat. That’s the only way we’re gonna lose, because they cheat,” he said at a rally in September.
He has refused to say, several times, that he will unequivocally accept the results of the election, only going as far to say that he will if “it’s fair and legal and good”. Having escaped any accountability for the attack on the Capitol on January 6, he has embraced those who violently attacked the US government to protest against the 2020 election results, calling it a “day of love”.
JD Vance, his running mate, has, at times, been even more forthright. The Ohio senator has said he would not have certified the 2020 race. During the vice-presidential debate in early October, he refused to say that Trump lost the 2020 election. He later said, more definitively, that he did not believe Trump lost four years ago.
But this year the Trump ticket’s efforts to pre-emptively deny the results in case of a loss of the election go beyond rhetoric. They are now backed up by widespread party support and a highly organized, massive legal apparatus.
“The effort to try to subvert the outcome is more thought-out, more strategic, more organized, more coordinated in 2020,” said Sean Morales-Doyle, director of the voting rights program at the Brennan Center for Justice.
Republicans are primed to support Trump’s efforts. Nearly one in five Republican voters believe Trump should declare the election result invalid if he loses, according to a recent survey by the Public Religion Research Institute (12% of Democrats said Harris, who has committed to accepting the election results, should do the same).
Dozens of people who have challenged the results of the last presidential election are in local offices where they have power over certifying vote totals. Led by Cleta Mitchell, a Trump ally who aided his efforts to overturn the election four years ago, Republicans have organized a massive effort to monitor election offices, challenge voters, and work in election precincts.
At least 35 officials who have refused to certify elections since 2020 will have a role over certifying the vote this fall, according to a report by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew), a watchdog group.
The Republican National Committee has spent months filing frivolous lawsuits that contain specious allegations of fraud. Legal experts say Republicans have no chance of winning the suits ahead of the election – many have already been thrown out of court – but they are instead designed to generate headlines and create the impression that something is amiss with the voter rolls.
The Harris campaign, voting rights lawyers, and civil rights groups are all preparing for the possibility of a chaotic post-election period that could include a flood of lawsuits trying to get ballots thrown out in an attempt to swing the election.
While there is little doubt that Trump will try and contest an election loss, experts are also nearly certain that he will not succeed. Judges turned away nearly every case Trump filed to try and overturn the election results – 61 in total – and experts expect that they will do so again.
Lawyers and election officials have also spent the last four years learning from what happened and are prepared to swiftly go to court at the first whiff of disruption. The month following election day could be chaotic and confusing, but they’re confident that the rightful winner of the election will ultimately be certified.
“The response to these attempts is also more coordinated and prepared. Election officials have seen what the election deniers playbook looks like over the last couple of elections and know what to prepare for,” Morales-Doyle said.
Vote-rigging allegations
Trump’s effort to contest a possible loss is likely to begin as votes are counted on election night. Just like 2020, it is likely that there will not be a winner declared on election night and key swing states are going to take hours or even days to count their ballots. The closer the election margin – and it could be very close this year – the longer it will take for news outlets to be confident enough to call the race, which could add to the uncertainty.
There’s nothing unusual about that lag. But Trump is planning to declare that the vote against him is rigged and that the slow count is evidence something is amiss, Rolling Stone reported in October.
That declaration of fraud is likely to be accompanied by swift lawsuits alleging various irregularities with the vote, supported by affidavits from people who say they saw something unusual at the polls or when workers are counting votes. While those claims are likely to be debunked, they’re likely to fuel the narrative that something wrong happened in 2020.
The Republican National Committee is already forecasting what these suits will look like. Over the last several months, they have filed suits in swing states alleging that states have dead people, non-citizens and other ineligible people on their voter rolls and asked courts to remove them. Judges have already tossed many of the lawsuits.
In Michigan, a swing state, for example, the Republican National Committee filed a lawsuit in March claiming that 76 of the state’s 83 counties had more eligible voters than citizens eligible to vote or “suspiciously high” voter registration rates. The RNC sent out a press release accompanying the suit, saying it showed Michigan had “inflated and inaccurate voter rolls ahead of the 2024 election” and the suit earned many headlines.
Michigan officials noted that the RNC had not identified a “single voter in any Michigan county who is ineligible to be registered but nonetheless appears as an active voter.” A federal judge dismissed the case on 22 October, finding that Michigan already had reasonable procedures for removing voters (federal law requires a waiting period before a state can remove a voter it suspects has moved from rolls).
The watchdog group Protect Democracy calls these and similar lawsuits “zombie lawsuits” and predicts that Trump and allies could try and revive them after election day to challenge the election results.
Nikhel Sus, a lawyer with Crew, predicted Trump and allies would revive some of the suits they’ve already filed, but that they wouldn’t go far.
“We’re going to see these zombie lawsuits come back to life in a strategic tactical way. And perhaps that was the goal from the outset,” he said. “You still need evidence to win a court case.”
Filing a case challenging voter eligibility before the election doesn’t give it a better chance of succeeding afterwards, Morales-Doyle of the Brennan Center said. Still, he said the litigation gives a false imprimatur to Trump’s claims of fraud.
“I do think you’re going to see after the election if people are upset about the outcome, pointing to “we’ve been saying for the last 8 months that they had bloated rolls and dead people on the rolls. Non-citizens on the rolls and the courts didn’t do anything about it,” he said.
After those suits are filed, Trump could move on to trying to stop certification of the vote at the local level. Long a little-followed process of elections, certification takes place at the local and state level to officialize vote totals after all of the ballots are tallied. Local boards – often staffed with party loyalists or little-known government officials – are responsible for undertaking this task, and generally do not have discretion not to certify.
But since 2020, Trump-aligned Republicans have embraced the idea that officials can refuse to certify the vote, something voting experts say is illegal. Across the country this year, officials on local boards of election have refused to certify primary and other elections, citing vague concerns about fraud. None of those efforts have been successful, and all of the boards have been forced to certify the results in the end.
Georgia, one of the seven battleground states, has been at the center of this push. Republican commissioners in Fulton county, home to Atlanta, have refused to certify elections twice this year. Trump-aligned Republicans on the State Election Board also passed last-minute rules this year that could have paved the pathway for local election officials to not certify the vote in November. A local judge blocked the rules, and said that discretion in the state is mandatory.
Nonetheless, Sus said he still expects that there will be local officials throughout the country who refuse to certify the vote, forcing groups to go to court to force certification.

“Even though it’s illegal and there will be potential stiff legal consequences for doing that sort of thing, it will cause some level of disruption,” he said. “There is a chance that by sowing distrust at the county level if president Trump loses the election that they’re going to lay the groundwork to dispute the results on January 6 2025 on the grounds that there was uninvestigated fraud or irregularities in particular states.”
Trump and Republicans could try and bring a final challenge when Congress issues the final certification of the electoral college vote on January 6, 2025. But they would find additional hurdles there.
In December 2022, Congress passed a bipartisan bill, the Electoral Count Reform Act, that made it harder to interfere with its certification of the electoral vote. Among other things, it made it harder for members of Congress to object to the electors, clarified that the vice president (Harris in 2025) cannot interfere with the vote count, and made it clear that only the governor of a state can certify a legitimate slate.
Narrative of voter fraud
In 2020, Trump pointed to the massive shift in mail-in voting and emergency changes in voting, driven by the pandemic, to create a narrative of fraud and claim the election was stolen. In 2024, Trump has shifted his focus to something else: non-citizen voting.
Several studies have shown that non-citizen voting is incredibly rare. And it is already illegal for non-citizens to vote in federal elections. Yet over the last year, Mitchell and other Republicans have led a robust campaign to seed the idea that non-citizen voting could affect Americans elections.
Earlier this year, Republicans passed a bill in the US House that would have required proof of citizenship to vote and outlawed non-citizen voting, something that is already illegal. It helped kickstart a the false narrative that Democrats are allowing non-citizens to cross the border to influence elections.
“Our elections are bad,” Trump said during the 10 September debate with Kamala Harris. “And a lot of these illegal immigrants coming in, they’re trying to get them to vote. They can’t even speak English. They don’t even know what country they’re in practically. And these people are trying to get them to vote. And that’s why they’re allowing them to come into our country.”
Other top Republicans have followed suit and amplified the false claims. And Republican election officials in a handful of states – Alabama, Texas, Virginia, and Tennessee – have all tried to back up Trump by releasing statements claiming to have found thousands of non-citizens on the rolls. Many of those announcements have been based on misleading methodology and further investigation has shown that many of those flagged have been eligible voters.
Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of X and a major backer of Trump, has significantly helped boost these lie that Democrats want non-citizens to vote, posting about it at least 52 times and racking up 700m views, according to an analysis by the Washington Post.
The Heritage foundation, a rightwing thinktank aligned with Trump, has peddled misleading videos purporting to show non-citizen registering. Other Republicans have also added to the rhetoric. “[Democrats] want illegals to vote now that they opened the border,” Steve Scalise, a top Republican in the US House, said in his speech at the Republican National Convention in July.
If Trump contests the election, the lie about non-citizen voting is likely to be at the center of his efforts.
David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, said the emphasis on non-citizen voting was a clear effort to set the stage to claim the election was stolen.
“This will be one of the primary, but among many, false claims made if Trump loses,” he said in September. “And it will be false, but it still could be dangerous because it could incite his supporters to believing a totally secure election was stolen.”
‘There’s real harm being done’
Even though he’s confident that any effort to overturn the results of the election will be unsuccessful, Morales-Doyle is still worried about the long-term effects on American politics.
Democracies, he said, depend on people believing that their leaders are legitimately elected and that belief is rooted in the idea that elections are legitimate. Weakening the belief in the results of an election weakens that fundamental piece of a democratic society.
As election night approaches, Morales-Doyle said he was concerned about the long-lasting effects that questioning the election results would have.
“Democracy only works if people believe in it. And this is a whole movement that’s built around distrust of our elections and spreading that distrust and I think that’s really harmful,” he said. “I’m fairly confident that our institutions will hold and we will show once again that we have a resilient democracy in 2024, but I think that there’s real harm being done in the long term to our democracy by these attacks and these attempts to sow distrust.”",2024-10-26
Guardian,This is how we do it: ‘We’re sexually fulfilled but oral sex is an issue for both of us’,"Nadia, 40
If we hear people are in the kitchen when we are having sex, we do it anyway. It kind of turns me on now
Eric lives in his studio in a shared, open-plan apartment, and when we first started dating over a year ago there was a problem because his room didn’t have a door, or a bed – he mostly sleeps in a hammock, though there is a sofa bed. It meant I felt we had to be very careful when we had sex in case other people saw us. After a while we made a curtain, which helps. If we hear people are in the kitchen when we are having sex, we do it anyway. It kind of turns me on now.
There is a 20-year age gap between us. I’ve had older boyfriends before but my experience has always been that after a couple of days of having sex, the frequency really goes down. I was always the one with a bigger appetite, but I don’t feel like this with Eric at all. Our libidos match.
We live in different cities and I spend one week at home, and one week with Eric. We don’t immediately have sex when we meet up. I need to be next to him, maybe lying in bed not talking about sexual things to help me feel connected. After that I start to crawl my fingers on his back, we kiss and that’s normally a sign.
We don’t tend to do a lot of oral sex. I feel some shame around it. I was raised in a Catholic family so everything about sex was forbidden. I didn’t have a lot of knowledge about it when I was younger, and because of that I’ve never been totally into it.
Though we do have a passionate and fulfilling relationship, I’m afraid Eric doesn’t like receiving oral sex from me – or he doesn’t feel that much from it, because he’s never come that way. I don’t feel that confident because I know Eric is very good at pleasuring himself when I’m not there, and I don’t think I can do it better than he can.
We’ve talked about it and he said receiving oral sex and hand jobs from me feels different to when he’s masturbating – that it’s a special, different feeling. I still don’t get the sense that I’m really good at them, but I’m trying. And we really like to talk openly, and are continuing to explore how to best give each other pleasure. There’s a lot of attraction between us, and a lot of love and care.
Eric, 61
I’m lucky because Nadia has an amazing libido and she loves sex
I don’t have a bedroom. I’m a musician and I live in my studio. Normally I just sling a hammock up to sleep. But if Nadia’s coming I put down the sofa bed. That works for me – we can have sex any time of day.
When we started dating a year ago I had not had a partner for four years. I became a master at masturbation. So I thought I was happy, but I missed the companionship.
I’m lucky because Nadia has an amazing libido and she loves sex. After we haven’t seen each other for a week, Nadia might just need a little time to settle down together so we talk a lot, and then we’re both ready for sex. We have quite a lot of sex for about three days, then it slows down.
I do love giving her oral sex but I think she has barriers in her mind about receiving it, which we’re working on. I don’t think she’s actually had an orgasm that way – maybe just the once. We’ve talked about it and I think she’s getting more comfortable with it, but I don’t know if there’s a hangover of shame from past partners. The other way around, she doesn’t give very good head. I have tried to work with her on that, but we haven’t got there yet. I mean, it’s still nice, it’s not unpleasant at all. I just find she’s doing too much.
I know she’s putting in a lot of lovingness, and so it’s very important for me that I don’t say things that would give her the impression it isn’t all really appreciated. And from my point of view, I don’t even have to have an orgasm, nor is oral sex important. I’m just very aware that as much as I want our conversations to be open, I have to be very careful not to say something that might be taken the wrong way. Ultimately, I’m so grateful for everything she brings me in our relationship. Our sex is very fulfilling and we’re both very happy.",2024-11-02
Guardian,Harris pitches self as a unifier with a ‘to-do list’ – is it enough for knife-edge race?,"On the second to last Sunday in July, Kamala Harris had just finished making pancakes and bacon for her grandnieces at the vice-president’s residence in Washington, and was sitting down with them to work on a jigsaw puzzle when Joe Biden called.
“I got up to take the call, and then life changed,” Harris recounted later. Biden, isolating with Covid at his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, and facing calls from all corners of his party to step aside, had reached the history-altering decision to end his bid for re-election.
“Are you sure?” Harris said she asked the US president. “Because what a big decision.”
With Biden’s endorsement, Harris, still wearing her workout clothes and hooded sweatshirt from her alma mater, Howard University, leapt into action. Time was of the essence. Over the next 10 hours, with pizza boxes littered around her, she placed 100 calls to Democrats whose support she would need to secure the nomination.
By the time Harris walked into her inherited campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, to the strains of Beyoncé’s hard-charging anthem Freedom, her ascension seemed suddenly – and unexpectedly – inevitable.
In the roughly 100 days since, Harris has enthralled her party, which had been all but resigned to defeat with Biden as its nominee. She selected a running mate, the affable Minnesota governor, Tim Walz; accepted the nomination at a joy-filled convention; supercharged volunteer sign-ups and on-the-ground organizing; raised a staggering billion dollars; dominated the contest’s only presidential debate against her opponent, Donald Trump. She secured endorsements from a host of his former advisers and aides, as well as several of the planet’s biggest stars. She appeared on popular podcasts, daytime TV and news networks and delivered a closing argument that blended the economic and the existential anxieties driving Americans’ choice in November.
But has it all been enough? The race has built to a deadlocked finale, with each of the seven battleground states – and the nation – virtually tied just days before the final votes of the 2024 election are cast. Along the way, some of that early shine has worn off. Trump has crept back in the polls. Critics have carped at the Harris campaign’s traditionalism, and a perception among some that she has focused too much on Trump’s threat and not offered enough of a vision of her own for Americans to be inspired by.
On Tuesday, she delivered her last major speech of the campaign from the Ellipse in Washington, a direct appeal to the vanishingly small slice of Americans who have yet to make up their minds.
The significance of the site, an oval-shaped park south of the White House, was twofold. It was intended as a stark reminder of the violent forces Trump inflamed from that very spot nearly four years ago, when he implored supporters to “fight like hell” before a mob of them stormed the US Capitol.
And it was meant to underline the possibility of a Harris presidency.

With the White House illuminated behind her, Harris declared: “For too long, we have been consumed with too much division, chaos and mutual distrust. And it can be easy to forget a simple truth: it doesn’t have to be this way.”
She cast the election as a contest between herself, a unifier with a “to-do list” and Trump, a “petty tyrant” seeking a return to “unchecked power”. In 90 days, one of them would take the oath of office. “Kamala! Kamala!” chanted the crowd, her largest to date with an estimated 75,000 people who spilled beyond the park, toward the Washington Monument.
Harris is running the shortest presidential campaign in modern US history. If she wins, she will have persuaded Americans to do something unprecedented in the country’s 248-year history: elect a woman and woman of color to the presidency.
At 18, could she have ever imagined this would be her life, Pro Football Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe asked the 60-year-old during a recent appearance on his podcast. “Never,” Harris said, shaking her head. “Never.”
The daughter of an endocrinologist from India and an economist from Jamaica, Harris said an “instinct to protect” propelled her career as a prosecutor, and was central to her opening pitch against Trump. From the courtroom, Harris took on “predators”, “fraudsters” and “scammers”, she would begin, building to the line: “So hear me when I say: I know Donald Trump’s type.”
In an election defined by a striking gender gap – with women powering Harris and men turning toward Trump – the central question may be who Americans trust to protect them – and what they believe they need protecting from.
Harris has vowed to protect Americans’ “fundamental freedoms” – abortion rights, clean air, decades-old alliances, and democracy itself. Trump has cast himself, by contrast, as the protector of a nation under “invasion”, overrun by illegal immigration and crime. At a recent rally, he crassly suggested he would protect women, whether they “like it or not”.
Harris’s critics – even those who will begrudgingly vote for her – knock her as a maddeningly scripted politician who lacks an ideological core and who has struggled to articulate a serious policy agenda.
At a CNN town hall, she hewed closely to a set of talking points, offering circular responses to pointed questions. And yet, during the 80-minute segment, she delivered her most forceful warning about Trump’s authoritarian tendencies. Yes, she agreed, her opponent was a fascist.
Harris has waved off any criticism, calling herself disciplined.
At a rally with Harris, Michelle Obama defended her further by suggesting critics were holding the nation’s first female and first Black vice-president to a “higher standard” than Trump, who often rambles incoherently, had threatened to jail his political opponents, and would be the first convicted felon elected to the White House if he wins.
“I hope you’ll forgive me if I’m a little frustrated that some of us are choosing to ignore Donald Trump’s gross incompetence while asking Kamala to dazzle us at every turn,” Obama said in Kalamazoo, Michigan. “Preach!” a woman shouted from the audience.
Over the course of her abbreviated campaign, Harris has laid out a broad strokes economic agenda with proposals for first-time homebuyers, caregivers, new parents, and the “sandwich” generation of adults caring for their children and their parents. She has, meanwhile, backed away from her past support for progressives policies on immigration and fracking, which helped fuel the San Francisco liberal caricature, though it never quite suited the former “top cop” of California. Drawing on support from anti-Trump Republicans, she has vowed to put a Republican in her cabinet, and insisted she would be a president for “all Americans”, including Trump’s supporters.
Along the way, many stars have aligned for her. Oprah sang her praise – “Kamaaaaala” – in a DNC speech. Taylor Swift endorsed Harris after her debate performance against Trump. Beyoncé embraced Harris at an abortion-rights focused event in Texas. Bad Bunny urged support for her after a shock jock disparaged Puerto Rico as an “island of garbage” at a Trump rally. She has also won support from the billionaire Mark Cuban, whose traveled the country making the case that Harris would be better for business than the man who made his name as a Manhattan builder.
Tory Gavito, the president of Way to Win, a hub for liberal donors and organizers, likened Harris’s dizzying “everything, everywhere, all at once” campaign to the Wizard of Oz. The vice-president was thrust to the forefront of American politics and quickly assembled an unlikely coalition that includes gen Z meme-makers and the former Republican vice-president Dick Cheney.
“Now here we are. This is the end of the road,” she said. “I just can’t imagine it having been done any other way.”
Although Harris has served as the vice-president for nearly four years, she nevertheless arrived at the top of the Democratic ticket relatively unknown. But in stark reversal of fortunes, she defied skeptics of her political skill, and her popularity soared.
“She has not put a foot wrong,” said Paul Begala, a veteran Democratic strategist and former adviser to Bill Clinton. If he had to identify a misstep, it would be during an appearance on ABC’s The View, where, when asked how she would distinguish herself from Biden, Harris responded: “Not a thing that comes to mind.” The Trump campaign seized on the line, tying Harris to the unpopular president.
Begala marveled at the way Harris has “squared the circle” between Democrats who believed her closing message should be centered around Trump’s threats to democracy – as the party did in the 2022 midterms when they blunted the anticipated red wave – and those who argued she should conclude with an economic-focused message, highlighting Americans’ top voting issue. Trump would arrive in office “obsessed with revenge” against an ever-growing enemies list, Harris says, while she would focused on her “to-do” list: lowering costs and fighting to protect what’s left of abortion access in America.
Since the supreme court overturned Roe in 2022, Harris has been a powerful messenger on abortion rights, framing it as a matter of bodily autonomy. On the campaign trail, she has been joined by women whose lives have been put a risk by their state’s abortion bans, as well as by the family of Amber Thurman, the 28-year-old mother from Georgia who died of sepsis in 2022 after being denied timely medical care to treat a medication abortion.
“We need to make sure that we know who is responsible for those deaths, and that is Donald Trump, his supreme court, and all of the Maga Republicans who have voted for legislation up and down the ballot across the country,” said Silvina Alarcón, political director at Reproductive Freedom for All.
Harris has also had to navigate, as she has her entire career, a torrent of racist and sexist abuse, including from her opponent, who has insulted her intelligence, calling her “dumb as a rock” and an “extremely low IQ person”. During a live interview with members of the National Association of Black Journalists, Trump attacked her racial identity and asked when she “happened to turn Black”. The remark drew gasps in the room.
Christina Reynolds, a senior vice-president of communications for Emily’s List, the influential political group that backs female candidates who support abortion rights, said Harris has faced all of the obstacles that have long burdened women, and especially women of color, who seek high political office. But she has also helped blaze her own trail, demonstrating leadership as the vice-president.
“She’s had to stack up to the division and hate and lies, while building the plane,” Reynolds said. “I think that when she wins, it will be historic and epic and truly a testament to her and the people around her and the work that they’ve done.”
Support for Harris has slightly fallen as the Trump campaign sharpened its attacks. Looming over a race that appears to be teetering on a razor’s edge is whether Harris can stitch together her own diverse coalition, similar to the one that elevated Biden in 2020, while polls show Trump making inroads with voters of color and young people, especially men.
Democrats are closely watching places such as Dearborn, Michigan, where Democratic emissaries from Barack Obama and the independent senator Bernie Sanders are working to stave off a mass defection of Arab and Muslim American voters furious at the administration over the deadly war in Gaza. At nearly every stop, Harris is heckled by pro-Palestinian protesters, many of whom have said they plan to vote for a third party candidate or not at all.
John Zogby, an author and pollster who studies the Arab American electorate, said the scale of the devastation in Gaza and now Lebanon, and the depth of these voters’ discontent, have reached a “point of almost no return”.
“It really is different this time,” he said.
In the final days, Harris will circle between all seven battleground states, searching for any last wells of support that might tip the balance. Until the end, she is attempting to make the affirmative case for herself, while arguing that Trump’s vilification of his most prominent critics, using increasingly violence rhetoric, “must be disqualifying”.
Election eve will be spent in Pennsylvania, whose 19 electoral college votes are seen as a must-win for Harris. On Tuesday, the Harris campaign will host an election night party at Howard, the historically Black college where the vice-president won her first election: freshman class representative.
While Democrats remain fearful a second Trump presidency will usher in a dark era for American democracy, and of the former president’s pre-emptive efforts to deny an election loss, those on the ground say they see signs that Harris’s “joyful warrior” campaign will prevail. Maxwell Alejandro Frost, the gen Z congressman from Florida, told reporters on Friday: “A bellwether for me in an election is when you’re going to events and you’re seeing people who are not political, who don’t like politics but are there because – sometimes they can’t even articulate it – they’re there because they felt like they needed to be there.
“That’s the difference between a political candidate and a movement candidate. And we have a movement candidate, and this is a movement right now.”

Guardian,Republicans and Democrats search for unicorns in crucial Wisconsin: undecided voters,"On a warm October morning in Madison, Wisconsin, Ty Schanhofer found a unicorn: an undecided voter.
Schanhofer, an organizer with the University of Wisconsin student Democratic party, had unfolded a plastic table on campus and was trying to encourage people to register in the key swing state.
When Arin Mahapatra, a 21-year-old student from Illinois, stopped by, Schanhofer – who takes an English class with Mahapatra – jumped into action, peppering him with questions and offering reasons to support Harris.
“I’m not necessarily [leaning] in a certain direction, I’m just trying to find out who exactly falls in the same line with what I value most,” said Mahapatra, who cited economic issues like the price of gas and cost of student housing as his top concerns.
Truly undecided voters are rare in Wisconsin, where presidential elections hinge on the narrowest of margins.
“I feel like it’s probably 2% of the voters who are undecided,” said Schanhofer. “It’s not many at all.”
Winning the support of young voters like Mahapatra will be crucial for Harris or Trump to pull off a victory in Wisconsin, where students and voters under 30 have turned out in record numbers in recent elections. In 2023, students on college campuses across the state rallied to elect a liberal judge to the Wisconsin supreme court, helping shift the ideological leaning of the bench in hopes that the court would help establish abortion rights in the state.
People like Schanhofer hope that by generating this kind of turnout among young voters, they’ll be able to turn the Wisconsin electorate in Harris’s favor.
The Badger state is considered to be part of the “blue wall” – the states Democrats consistently won in the 1990s and early 2000s.
But vanishingly narrow margins in the state decided the 2016 and 2020 elections, and today Wisconsin is a virtual toss-up in the polls, as are many of the other six swing states.
Trade unions historically helped drive voter turnout for Democrats, but a series of anti-labor laws passed under the Republican-controlled state government in 2011 dealt them a blow. Rural areas have increasingly turned to Republican candidates, leaving cities like Milwaukee – Wisconsin’s most racially diverse – and the liberal stronghold of Madison as Democratic bastions.
This election will probably come down to turnout, with the Trump and Harris campaigns attempting to shear away voters from each other’s respective bases. For Trump, that means drawing in young men, who have increasingly drifted to the right.
On 26 October, some of those voters could be found queueing up around the corner for an event at the Kollege Klub, a bar just blocks from where the campus Democrats have been tabling for Harris.
For hours, the bar was only admitting ticketed attendees, who had spent $150 to see the rightwing Nelk Boys, YouTube pranksters whose podcast has featured the self-proclaimed misogynist Andrew Tate and Trump himself. The Nelk Boys promised to feature Charlie Kirk, the founder of the Maga organizing hub Turning Point USA (TPUSA), as a special guest.
Eric Davis, a 29-year-old who lives and works in Madison, waited in line with his friends for more than two hours in front of the bar. Davis voted for Joe Biden in 2020, but said he’s reversing course this year.
“I switched over to Trump because I just think, honestly, our economy right now is not going the way that it should,” said Davis. “I don’t believe in everything he says, but a majority of the stuff he goes with – I’m with it.”
Davis, who is Black, doesn’t always like how Trump talks about immigrants, thinks the ex-president can be crass and understands why he rubs people the wrong way. But the way Davis sees it, that’s just Trump being Trump.
“I don’t think he’s racist at all,” said Davis.
“My whole family, they’re all liberals,” added Davis, who has not yet told his family how he planned to vote.
Despite the night’s political theme, the actual gathering featured little by way of political mobilization. The Nelk Boys stood on a raised platform in the venue, throwing Trump merchandise into the crowd, but Kirk was nowhere to be seen. A stack of cards with voter registration information sat forgotten on a table crowded with beer bottles.
But for Brandon Maly, the chair of the Republican party of Dane county, the night was a success.
“I’ve never seen a bar in Madison packed with Maga hats, it was just incredible. I love to see it – it’s part of that psychology in Dane county, that people need to be given a permission structure,” said Maly. “You may not think it translates to votes, but it does in the sense that they’re given permission to support Trump.”
Maly has no illusions about turning Dane county red.
But given its status as the second most populous county in the state, he sees the area as a rich source of Republican voters – no matter how marginal their political views may be locally.
His goal, of chipping away at Democratic party margins in liberal hubs, is mirrored in Democrats’ push to fight back Republican party majorities in rural and suburban parts of the state that have historically leaned red.
One of those Democratic party organizers is Deb Dassow, the chair of the Ozaukee county Democratic party, who says she feels she has the shifting political winds at her back. In Ozaukee county, which stretches north of Milwaukee along Lake Michigan, Democrats have begun to make gains in the last several election cycles. In 2012, Barack Obama claimed 34% of the vote. In 2016, Hillary Clinton took 37%, and in 2020 Biden pulled 43% of the vote there.
Since 2019, when the Ozaukee county Democrats opened a permanent office in the county, the local party chapter has poured resources into organizing local Democrats.
“Since April, we’ve knocked 25,000 doors – we knocked 5,000 just last weekend,” said Dassow on 25 October. The local Democrats have facilitated food drives, held parties and hosted beading parties, crafting red, white and blue bracelets emblazoned with the letters K-A-M-A-L-A.
Since jumping into the race in July, the vice-president and her allies have raised more than $1bn to fuel her campaign; much of those funds have poured into a broad campaign to knock on thousands of doors across the country.
And not least, they are trying to turn out young people: according to a source familiar with the Harris-Walz campaign in Wisconsin, the Democratic coordinating campaign hired seven full-time campus organizers across the state and a youth-organizing coordinator before the election.
The Republican party, meanwhile, has farmed off most of its ground game to outside groups – including TPUSA and the tech billionaire Elon Musk’s America Pac. Those groups allied with the Trump campaign have sought to turn out “low-propensity” voters for Trump, in particular, targeting rural would-be Trump voters who might otherwise neglect to cast a ballot at all.
The Trump campaign touts the strategy as innovative, but neither TPUSA nor America PAC boast the kinds of detailed voter lists that parties traditionally maintain to target supporters.
“There’s suspicion as to whether or not this is an actual ground game,” said Brandon Scholz, a former Republican party operative who left the GOP on 7 January 2021 – the day after Trump supporters contesting the 2020 election results stormed the US Capitol. Even as an independent, Scholz maintains close relationships in the party and has followed the 2024 campaigns with keen interest.
“Are these folks really here?” said Scholz. “Are they really beating the hell out of the doors? Are they really identifying and getting ready to turn out voters, or getting them out to vote early, or getting them absentee ballots?”
The answers to these questions – is Trump’s ground strategy as haphazard as it seems in Wisconsin, and is the Harris turnout machine as effective as Democrats claim? – could very well determine the outcome of the election.",2024-11-02
Guardian,Here's how the winner of the 2024 US presidential election did it | Jonathan Freedland,"Here’s one prediction about the US election you can take to the bank. When the result is finally known, there will be a stampede of experts and prognosticators rushing to insist that, in effect, they knew it all along – that, hard though it was to glimpse through the fog of polls and shifting data, the eventual outcome was obvious. Even inevitable.
That will be truer still if, when the voters’ will is finally known, it turns out not to have been so close after all, with one of the two main candidates sweeping most of the swing states to rack up a healthy majority in the electoral college if not the popular vote.
The funny thing is, if that happens – for either candidate – it would not entirely be a surprise. Even now, you can sketch out, in advance, a very plausible case for why Donald Trump could be about to retake the presidency. And you can do the same for why Harris might be on the brink of becoming the first woman to hold the world’s most powerful office. So, much as Boris Johnson drafted two columns on the eve of the Brexit referendum – one advocating leave, the other remain – here, while the US’s verdict is still unknown, is the story of how Trump, or Harris, pulled it off.
Start with the scenario of a victorious Trump. To understand it might require a single number: 28. That’s the percentage of Americans who tell pollsters they believe the country is on the right track. A measly 28%. In that environment, incumbent parties lose. And, for all the drama and buzz of her swift installation as candidate, her positioning as the face of change, Harris is a member of the incumbent party and a senior figure in the current US government. A nation that made clear long ago that it wanted to fire Joe Biden, largely over the cost of living and rising prices, as well as immigration, was bound to seize the chance to do the next best thing – and reject his deputy.
If there was a way to avoid that fate, it would have required Harris to make a cleaner break from Biden than she was willing to. Whether it was personal respect for the man, or fear of rupturing her coalition, she didn’t do what had to be done. In this narrative, a key moment will prove to be her October appearance on The View, when she was asked if, looking back over the past four years, she would have done anything differently from her boss. “Not a thing that comes to mind,” was her answer. At a stroke, she robbed herself of the mantle of change, and confirmed Trump’s core message: vote Harris, get Biden 2.
Should the need arise to explain a Trump win in 2024, incumbency in tough times will be the meat of it. But it won’t be the whole story. Other factors, besides inflation and petrol prices, will have played their part, tied more to culture than politics. Trump’s astonishing lead among men, especially those without a college degree – including some, albeit qualified, evidence of increased support among Black and Hispanic men, previously beyond the reach of the Republican party – points to an element of Trump’s appeal that has endured for nearly a decade. Call it cultural defiance. It sees the wagging finger of all those who sit in judgment – whether that’s the media, the universities, the “woke”, foreign countries, especially European ones, or at its most loosely defined, women, especially educated women – and shows them a big, fat middle finger in response.
This is what Trump’s critics took so long to understand. What, for years, they thought would hurt him – scandal, two impeachments, multiple criminal prosecutions and convictions – only made him stronger, confirming him as an outlaw, a transgressor who crossed the very boundaries so many of his followers, chiefly men, itched to cross with him. That photo of him, bloodstained, seconds after dodging an assassin’s bullet, urging his devotees to “fight, fight, fight!” – how, we may come to ask, did we ever think he could be beaten after that?
After all, Harris was his ideal opponent. A liberal, accomplished, affluent woman from California, an avatar for the very cultural elite he and many millions of others despise. In case that impression of her were not sharp enough, she reinforced it with a parade of A-list stars campaigning for her in the final stretch, repeating the same mistake Hillary Clinton made in 2016.
Finally, given that the US has hardly cured itself of racism or misogyny, it should not be a shock if, in the coming days, we see that a Black woman could not get elected to the White House. It may be 2024, but perhaps the US is still not ready.
So much for a Trump win. How will we explain victory for Harris, if it comes? The answer may boil down to one word: women. Outraged by the supreme court’s Dobbs ruling, overturning abortion rights in 2022, women confounded the pollsters in that year’s midterm elections: there was no Republican red wave, despite soaring inflation, because women came out in big numbers to prevent it. Success in 2024 would mean that, once again, and with an intensity missed by most surveys, women in the US had quietly resolved to do the exact same thing to the man who shaped the supreme court, Dobbs’s ultimate author: Trump.
In that sense, and others, Trump’s fate would have been sealed before the 2024 campaign even began. If he loses, it will surely be because he’d become too toxic a figure to win: witness his place on the losing side of every election cycle after that first, narrow victory in 2016. What’s more, the toxicity has only got worse recently, his authoritarian, fascistic tendencies laid barer than ever, whether in his threats to deploy the US military against “the enemy from within”, meaning his liberal critics, or his reported desire to be surrounded by “the kind of generals that Hitler had”, obedient to his every whim and diktat. For too many Americans, enough might just have been enough.
Trump has torn through so many old-school verities of politics that it’s become tempting to think none of them holds good any more. But on-the-ground organisation still matters. If they win, the Democrats will point to a machine that got their vote out in the critical states, precinct by precinct. Trump outsourced that task to Elon Musk, but there are some things even money cannot buy.
A Trump defeat would further confirm another old rule: no politician can ever fully escape his record. This time, to take one example, he hoped to make inroads with Arab and Muslim Americans, distressed and furious at the plight of Palestinians in Gaza. But that would have required those same, crucial voters to forget what Trump had promised a decade ago: a “Muslim ban”, denying entry to the US to people from a long list of Muslim countries. Amnesia exists in politics, perhaps especially in the US. But there are limits.
All these different elements are real, even if they can be combined into two very different narratives. Who will win the US election? No one knows. But even if we don’t yet know the result, we can already understand it.

Guardian,‘There are images no leader ever wants to be seen’: 33 pivotal US presidential moments captured on camera,"Is it any surprise that “photo op” is a phrase imported into British English from the United States? Of course it came from there, the land where the visual image sits right at the centre of the culture, with politics no exception. It was the Nixon White House that came up with it, specifically a press aide by the name of Bruce Whelihan. According to Washington legend, whenever the president was meeting a visiting dignitary, Richard Nixon’s hardball press secretary, Ron Ziegler, would turn to his underling with an order to summon the snappers. “Get ’em in for a picture,” Ziegler would say. Too polite to put it that way himself, Whelihan would clear his throat and announce to the ladies and gentlemen of the Washington press corps: “There will be a photo opportunity in the Oval Office.” The photo op was born.
But if the term was new, the thing itself had been a part of US politics almost from the start. Just as Roman emperors sought to cast themselves in stone and Tudor kings commissioned the finest artists to capture their likeness, so American presidents moved fast to harness the new technology of the age, in order that the nation might see the men who governed them. The selection of photographs assembled here is made up of a series of striking images, but a couple are extraordinary less for what they show than for the fact that they exist at all.
Behold a portrait of John Quincy Adams, sixth US president and the son of its second. A daguerreotype, it dates to March 1843), when Adams had been out of office for well over a decade, but still: it is the earliest known photograph of a US president, its subject a man born in 1767 and whose father was the successor to George Washington himself. Seeing the face of Abraham Lincoln induces a similar feeling of historical vertigo. If there’s a tendency to divide human events into two broad categories – our own, modern era and everything that went before – then the invention of the photograph can often be the instinctive dividing line between the two. But here are Adams and Lincoln, jumping over the barrier and barging their way into our own times.
As for Nixon himself, he appears in this collection twice. That’s fitting, and not only because of the origin story of the photo op. Nixon learned the hard way that in modern American politics, image is everything. Washington legend holds that in their 1960 presidential debate, Nixon comfortably beat the young Massachusetts senator John F Kennedy among voters who followed the contest on the radio – but, his face darkened by five o’clock shadow, he lost among those who watched on TV. After that, Nixon was ready to put himself in the hands of the image-makers.
One result is the intriguing photograph of the president and the king, Nixon and Elvis, standing improbably together in the White House in 1970. Showing two men both then at the height of their powers, both to fall just a few years later, the picture was long the most requested of all those held by the US National Archives). It fascinates partly because the pair represent polar opposites – a rock legend and a man so uncool he wore a suit on the beach) – and partly because it invites you to guess at the men’s motives: Nixon surely wanted some of Presley’s stardust to land on him, while Elvis was in search of a federal agent’s badge and, it seems, a sense of purpose.
The other Nixon shot is the one that etched his downfall into the public imagination. It shows his parting gesture – an oddly celebratory, double V-for-victory salute – from the presidential helicopter as he made his disgraced exit following the Watergate scandal). Nixon flew off to California and into the history books as the first US president ever to quit.
Between them, Elvis and Watergate, those pictures represent the two categories of presidential photograph: the ones they wanted – the photo ops – and the ones they most emphatically did not. The first category brims with examples and they follow a pattern. They show the occupant of the White House as a heroic, even mythic figure. The exemplar is Teddy Roosevelt on horseback, a hunter and adventurer who engaged in photogenic displays of muscularity and machismo so overt, they’d make Vladimir Putin blush. But that tradition has endured. Indeed, it has turned into an expectation that a US president must not only be competent and wise, but also fit, strong and marked by conspicuous physical courage.
Meeting that demand has been easy for some occupants of America’s highest office. Dwight Eisenhower didn’t have to pretend to be a warrior: he had been the supreme allied commander during the second world war. When he first campaigned for the presidency in 1952, there was no need to stage a photo op: there were images aplenty of him directing the D-day mission) that had turned the war around just eight years earlier. No wonder he won.
But for others, producing images of strength and command has taken some doing. The group portrait of Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin at Yalta ) had to have the so-called the Big Three seated because Roosevelt was paralysed from the waist down and required either a wheelchair or leg braces to get around. He and his aides went to great lengths to keep that fact from the US public and they mostly succeeded, thanks to a compliant press pack who obediently put away their cameras once the chosen image had been secured.
That remained the custom for a while, the snappers keeping a discreet distance even after Eisenhower had both a heart attack and stroke in office, and as Kennedy battled crippling back pain. The images told a different story, including the silhouetted portrait of JFK standing alone at the Resolute desk in the Oval Office, head bowed, a study in the loneliness of ultimate political authority). That photograph may lack the glamour or sparkle of other Camelot-era pictures, but it contributed to the Kennedy mystique – and the mythology of the presidency itself – every bit as much. This was the era of the cold war, of a nuclear standoff between the US and the USSR, and that desk was where the buck stopped. Here was where the button would be pressed – and here was the man who would press it.
Naturally, this iconography of president-as-hero takes different forms, depending on who’s in the job. The image Jimmy Carter treasured from his single term in office cast him as successful peacemaker, bringing together Menachem Begin of Israel and Anwar Sadat of Egypt in the Camp David peace accords. For supporters of Donald Trump, the picture that renders him a hero is the one taken a second after a would-be assassin’s bullet had brushed his ear, when he raised his fistand, with bloodied face, urged them to “Fight, fight, fight!”.
Sometimes, though, the man at the top has struggled to meet that deep public need for an alpha figure in the White House. Carter’s political prospects took a hit when he was photographed “wobbling, moaning and pale with exhaustion” during a six-mile run in 1979). But the most recent, and serious, example is Joe Biden, whose visible frailty drove him from this year’s presidential race. The pictures showing him apparently slack-jawed during a June TV debate with Trump were enough to persuade Democrats that he had to go.
Which brings us to the images no leader ever wanted to be seen. Some were photo ops whose aim was to offer a heroic, presidential figure, which went badly wrong. Michael Dukakis’s handlers wanted to project him as a potential commander-in-chief when they put him in a tank during the 1988 campaign); instead he looked like a hopeless dweeb. George W Bush’s team doubtless thought a Mission Accomplished banner on an aircraft carrier conveyed victorious strength following the invasion of Iraq; instead it came to haunt him as an emblem of hubris and myopia.
But other unwanted images from this collection capture not mistaken bits of stage management, but rather tragedy and disaster. George W Bush reading My Pet Goat to a group of Florida schoolkids as he gets word of the attack on the World Trade Center in 2001 distils the shock of 9/11, even now. The lifeless body of Robert F Kennedy evokes the turbulence and violence of 1968), a time when the US seemed about to tear itself apart.
It’s all here: moments of hope – Barack Obama inspiring a young boy as America’s first Black president – and moments of despair – Lyndon Johnson taking the oath following JFK’s assassination while Jackie Kennedy, in blood-stained clothes, looks on. And yet, no matter how sweeping the range of these photographs, there is something missing from this selection. It would be lacking in any assembly of presidential pictures. Yes, there are Democratic presidents and Republican presidents. Yes, there are old presidents and young presidents. But there is no female president. We see Hillary Clinton, who got close. We see Shirley Chisholm, who was the first Black woman to try but never got near. Otherwise, there is an absence. On 5 November, Americans have a chance to fill that space – and to give the world a picture no one has ever seen before.

Jimmy Carter collapses, 1979
By Phil Stewart
“His face was ashen and his mouth hung open,” is how one reporter described Jimmy Carter in September 1979, when the president dropped out of a six-mile race four miles in. Though he swiftly recovered, this image – two months after his speech blaming US problems on a “crisis of confidence” – was seen as evidence of weakness. He lost to Ronald Reagan the following year.

Richard Nixon bids goodbye, 1974
Photographer unknown
“Once more, there was not a spark of contrition in the man,” commented the Guardian at the time. On 8 August 1974, Richard Nixon earned the dubious honour of being the first (and, to this day, only) president to resign from office.
Two years earlier, five men were caught trying to burgle and bug the offices of the Democratic National Committee at the Watergate complex in Washington DC. The subsequent investigation implicated Nixon, who faced impeachment for his role in covering up the break-in. Yet – as seen in this image of him leaving the White House for the last time – he was never really repentant. As he told David Frost in 1977, “When the president does it, that means it is not illegal.” One month after he resigned, his chosen successor, Gerald Ford, pardoned him. GS
FDR at Yalta, 1945
Photographer unknown
For eight days in February 1945, the “Big Three” – Franklin D Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin – met in the Crimean city of Yalta to discuss allied strategy.
“FDR’s position between the other leaders is significant,” Diana Preston, historian and author of Eight Days at Yalta. “It was appropriate for a man who hoped to reconcile conflicting interests and build a future peace.” The conference was at first deemed a success, but the Soviet leader soon broke his promises to allow free elections in eastern Europe, and the cold war began.

Texts from Hillary Clinton, 2011
By Kevin Lamarque
It was the photograph that launched a thousand memes before becoming a liability at election time. The image of Hillary Clinton texting in sunglasses aboard a military plane to Libya went viral, inspiring a popular blog called “Texts from Hillary”. CBS reported at the time: “Hillary Clinton brings the LOLZ” and Clinton even name-checked the authors of the blog in her first ever tweet, proudly setting the image as her avatar.
By 2015, however, she would distance herself from it, dropping it from her Twitter profile when the FBI announced an investigation into her use of a private email address for government business. As the image became used in articles about the investigation, its meaning began to shift. Many people started to wonder what Clinton might have been writing on that Blackberry. The scandal came to a catastrophic peak just 11 days before the 2016 election, when FBI director James Comey announced that he was reopening the investigation after having closed it in July. FB
Theodore Roosevelt, 1898
Photographer unknown
This image of Roosevelt on a horse encapsulates the rugged masculinity the 26th president – in fact born into an aristocratic family in New York – strove to embody. Once a sickly child, he credited his recovery to exertion and hardship, and argued this approach would lead to triumph for both man and nation. Here he is in Cuba during the Spanish-American war, leading volunteer regiment the Rough Riders. Returning a war hero, he re-entered politics and became president after William McKinley’s assassination in 1901. GS
Hair Like Mine, 2009
By Pete Souza
The symbolic power of the first African American president was cemented in this image of Barack Obama leaning forward so a five-year-old boy could feel his hair. On 8 May 2009, Jacob’s dad, departing national security council staffer Carlton Philadelphia, took his family to the Oval Office for a farewell photo. This snap, by the then chief White House photographer Pete Souza, captures the moment Jacob asked, “Is your hair like mine?” Obama suggested he touch it and see. A framed print of the photo was hung in the White House for the rest of his presidency.
“The whole thing happened so fast, I literally have this one picture,” Souza recalls. “My composition was not perfect, but I think it adds to the spontaneity of the moment.”
Two years ago, Obama called Jacob to congratulate him on his high-school graduation. “Folks who maybe didn’t feel they belonged,” he said of the image, “they’d look at themselves differently – to see a person who looked like them in the Oval Office.”
“That was a highlight of my life,” Jacob said. “If I get to see another Black man at the top, I want to follow that lead.” GS
Assassination attempt on Donald Trump, 2024
By Evan Vucci
This photograph will be remembered as a pivotal moment in this year’s election. On 13 July, a gunman opened fire at a Trump rally in Butler County in Pennsylvania. The former president was only lightly wounded when a bullet grazed his right ear but one crowd member was killed and another two critically injured before the shooter was taken down by a Secret Service sniper. This remarkable image of Trump – his ear and face bloodied, and fist defiantly raised in the air as he is hurried off the stage, an American flag raised behind him – instantly went viral. In an interview soon after, AP photojournalist Evan Vucci recalled his thoughts as he was capturing the scene: “In my head, I just kept saying to myself, slow down, slow down. Compose, compose.” GS
Abraham Lincoln at Gettysburg, 1863
By Mathew B Brady
For almost a century, it was thought that no photographs existed of Abraham Lincoln at Gettysburg on 19 November, the day he delivered his endlessly quoted address at the dedication of the Soldiers’ National Cemetery. That is, until archivist Josephine Cobb undertook some detective work in 1952. Cobb, the first woman to be employed by the National Archives, picked through the work of the 19th-century photographer Mathew Brady, famous for his portraits of the great and good. She came upon a broken glass negative that showed a vast crowd at Gettysburg – she estimated the time to be about noon, a few hours before Lincoln would speak. After repeatedly enlarging, expanding and reprinting the image, she found his unmistakable face in the crowd (bare-headed, left of centre). FB
Ronald and Nancy Reagan kissing in Vanity Fair, 1985
By Harry Benson
“There is in the West,” wrote William F Buckley in 1985, “a tradition against chiefs of state engaging in visible, let alone ostentatious, shows of biological informality.” Ronald and Nancy Reagan, both successful actors before going into politics, bucked tradition by using the White House as a setting for their love story. The media was happy to indulge them, with Buckley writing a fawning ode to the couple in Vanity Fair, to accompany a series of images by Harry Benson of them dancing to Sinatra and locking lips.
Reagan, a year into his final term, could risk a little biological informality – the images were probably more consequential for Vanity Fair. Benson later said that the loss-making publication was facing closure until this issue. The editor Tina Brown, he said, convinced the owner to “wait until the June 1985 cover of the Reagans appeared. The magazine sold off the stands and the magazine was saved.” FB
Richard Nixon with Elvis Presley, 1970
By Oliver F Atkins
One December morning in 1970, Elvis showed up at the White House with a handwritten letter for the president. He wanted to give him a gift (a Colt pistol with silver bullets) and discuss becoming a “federal agent at large”: “I have done an in-depth study of drug abuse and communist brainwashing and I am right in the middle of the whole thing where I can do the most good,” he wrote.
Nixon gave Presley a federal narcotics badge, but not an official role. The bizarre encounter was captured by White House photographer Oliver F Atkins, but the images weren’t made public until the 1980s, after Nixon’s resignation and Presley’s death. GS
John F Kennedy: the loneliest job, 1961
By George Tames
A few weeks into his presidency, JFK stood at his desk before meeting the French ambassador, reading an official paper. Photographer George Tames, shadowing him for the New York Times, took this photograph, which became famous for its intimate portrayal of the pressures of holding office.
It was later reproduced in the opening title of US political drama The West Wing. FB
Bill Clinton hugs Monica Lewinsky, 1996
By Dirck Halstead
It was a moment captured by chance: a hug between Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky in the crowd at a Democratic fundraiser in Washington in October 1996. But when news of the affair between the president and the former White House intern broke in 1998, photojournalist Dirck Halstead, then senior White House photographer at Time magazine, recognised her face. After searching through his archives, he located this image in a box of transparencies. The photo ran on Time’s cover that August, when Lewinsky agreed to testify before a grand jury investigating Clinton’s denials of the affair.
Four months later, Clinton was impeached on charges of obstruction of justice and perjury, but he was eventually acquitted and left office after two terms in 2001 with the highest approval rating of any departing postwar president. Lewinsky, meanwhile, was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, “mainly from the ordeal of having been publicly outed and ostracised back then”, the anti-bullying campaigner wrote in Vanity Fair in 2018. “There has been at least one significant reference in the press to that unfortunate spell in our history every day for the past 20 years.” GS
‘Dewey defeats Truman’, 1948
Photographer unknown
With Harry Truman’s popularity waning, a win for his Republican opponent, Thomas E Dewey, in the 1948 election seemed certain. The Chicago Daily Tribune, forced to go to press early due to a printers’ strike, issued 150,000 copies of this 3 November edition – held up by a gleeful Truman en route to Washington – before it became clear its editors had backed the wrong horse. GS
Dwight D Eisenhower, 1944
Photographer unknown
This image of General Dwight D Eisenhower addressing paratroopers at Greenham Common airfield on 5 June 1944, the day before they would parachute into France, became one of the most widely circulated of the war, durably linking him with D-day’s success and the eventual American victory. Despite the general’s authoritative pose, the soldier closest to him, Lieutenant Wallace Strobel, recalled a lighter conversation. “He asked my name and which state I was from … He then said, ‘Oh yes, Michigan, great fishing there. Been there several times and like it.’”
After the war “Ike”, as he was popularly known, regularly topped polls as America’s most admired man. After years of claiming that it would be inappropriate for a military leader to run for president, he finally went for it in 1952, winning 55% of the popular vote for the Republicans. FB
Harry S Truman and Lauren Bacall on the piano, 1945
Photographer unknown
While playing piano for photographers during a wartime variety show in 1945, vice-president Truman was joined by 20-year-old Lauren Bacall, with the famous actor perched awkwardly above him. “I was just a kid,” shrugged Bacall years later. “My press agent made me do it.”
Truman had only been vice-president for a few weeks, plucked from relative obscurity by Franklin D Roosevelt. This photograph, considered risque at the time, made headlines all around the world and helped to establish his public image – even if they irritated his inner circle, including his wife, Bess. “I don’t think you should play piano in public again,” she said, according to Truman’s grandson. The New York Times recently dubbed it a viral image before its time – it inspired so many other women to climb up on the piano that it eventually broke. FB
Shirley Chisholm’s presidential bid, 1972
By Don Hogan Charles
This is Shirley Chisholm – who four years earlier had become the first Black woman elected to Congress – announcing her presidential bid at the Concord Baptist Church, Brooklyn. She knew that, with its “Unbought and Unbossed” slogan, the campaign was a long shot – she was also the first woman of colour from either major party to run for president. So it was a feat that, despite racism and sexism from her own party as well as the opposition, she made it to the Democratic national convention with the support of 152 delegates – and came fourth. When Kamala Harris launched her first presidential bid in 2020, she paid tribute with campaign colours based on the red and yellow pins Chisholm’s supporters wore. GS
George W Bush’s Mission Accomplished moment, 2003
By Stephen Jaffe
Dan Bartlett, George Bush’s communications director at the time, would later call this photo op “one of the big regrets of my life”. “It did seem premature,” remembers Stephen Jaffe, the press corp photographer covering Bush’s speech on the aircraft carrier that day. “The administration tried to stage everything perfectly – unfortunately it’s not a perfect world.”
As the eight-year occupation of Iraq spiralled and weapons of mass destruction failed to appear, the image of Bush in front of a “Mission Accomplished” banner, just six weeks into an invasion that would kill more than a quarter of a million Iraqi civilians, became a symbol of hubris.
While Bartlett says the banner referred to the mission of the USS Abraham Lincoln, returning from its tour in the Gulf – the ship’s crew requested it, and he “didn’t think twice”
– Jaffe is sceptical and thinks the intended meaning was plain to all on the day. “There was a lot of spin afterwards,” he says. “If the mission had been accomplished, they would have taken credit for it.” FB
George W Bush learns of 9/11, 2001
By Win McNamee
This captures the moment on the morning of 11 September 2001 when George Bush, taking part in a reading session at a primary school in Florida, learned that a second plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. (He’d been informed of the first plane, at the time thought to be an accident, before he entered the classroom.) When his chief of staff, Andy Card, whispered in his ear, “America is under attack,” he decided not to interrupt the reading, instead waiting around seven minutes before leaving.
It would become one of the most scrutinised events of his presidency. In his scathing 2004 film Fahrenheit 9/11, Michael Moore said, “Not knowing what to do, with no one telling him what to do, and no Secret Service rushing in to take him to safety, Mr Bush just sat there.” But several people there that day have since spoken out in his defence. “It was nice he understood we were young kids and would probably have gone crazy if he had told us what had happened,” former student La’Damien Smith told an interviewer in 2011. GS
Situation Room, 2011
By Pete Souza
“It’s not a picture I have hanging on my wall,” Pete Souza says. “It’s not artistic – the lighting in that room sucked.” On 1 May 2011, the chief White House photographer was called to the situation room, a network of rooms below the White House. The atmosphere immediately felt unusual. “I had been there many, many times before to cover discussions about sensitive policy decisions,” Souza says. On this day, however, the decision had already been made: Souza was there to document Barack Obama and his senior team as they watched the operation to kill or capture Osama bin Laden play out in real time.
As everyone packed into a side room to watch a live feed from a drone, Souza squeezed himself in the corner. (Seated, from left to right, is then vice-president Biden, Obama, joint operations command Marshall B Webb, deputy national security adviser Denis McDonough, secretary of state Hillary Clinton and secretary of defense Robert Gates.) While the raid unfolded in Abbottabad, Pakistan, Souza took about 100 images. “It was as tense and anxious a situation as I had ever seen that whole team in,” he recalls. “You could see it on their faces.” He tried to focus on his composition, getting everyone in frame, and on timing his shutter clicks so as not to distract them. Later it was announced that Navy Seals had killed Bin Laden, along with his son, a courier and two of the courier’s relatives.
Of nine pictures released that day, it was this one that went viral, exhaustively analysed and relentlessly memed. Souza, looking back today, believes this was because it occupied some part of the national psyche: “We had this guy that attacked our country, and it took us 10 years to find him, but we found him. It closed the chapter.” FB
John Quincy Adams, 1843
By Philip Haas
Though Adams was not the first president to be photographed (an 1841 picture of William Henry Harrison is now lost), this is the oldest surviving portrait of a US president. Adams had a familiarly vexed relationship with the medium. “All hideous,” he wrote in his diary, after posing for daguerreotypes in the early 1840s. “Too true to the original.” This image of Adams – who served as president in the 1820s – surfaced in 2017, found by the great-great-grandson of a congressman who had received it as a gift from Adams. FB
Michael Dukakis and the tank, 1988
By Michael E Samojeden
Meant to project strength, this unfortunate photo-call crystallised, for critics and voters, something mediocre and uncertain about the Democratic presidential hopeful Michael Dukakis. The Republicans used it relentlessly in attack ads.
Politicians are drawn to tanks: Churchill, Putin, Blair, Hugo Chavez, Liz Truss and Nigel Farage have all been snapped on or in one. Dukakis’s efforts came only a couple of years after Thatcher’s influential contribution to the genre; while she loomed out of the turret with uncanny poise, dressed in her own clothes, he seemed shrunken and overwhelmed, in a helmet that didn’t belong to him.
Widely recognised as one of the most disastrous campaign photos in history, the image would haunt future presidencies. “I sat in countless meetings in which some smartass warned that a stop on the president’s schedule had the makings of a ‘Dukakis in the tank moment,’” recalled former Clinton aide John King to Politico. In 2013, after being handed a naval football helmet, Obama declined to try it on. “You do not put stuff on your head if you’re president,” he joked. FB
JFK in the motorcade, 1963
Photographer unknown
“It was a watershed moment that changed America,” says Fredrik Logevall, historian and biographer of John F Kennedy. “I think there’s something to the notion that America lost its innocence after 22 November 1963.”
More than other images from Kennedy’s assassination – grainy TV coverage of the immediate aftermath, or Lyndon B Johnson being sworn in – this long lens shot of Kennedy smiling just moments before his assassination has come to signify what was lost that day. “In this photograph he’s for ever frozen in our minds,” Logevall says, “the picture of youthful vitality and glamour.”
For Logevall, it captures an era not only less haunted by political violence – open-top motorcades, beloved by Kennedy because he could get “closer to the people”, are a thing of the past – but also less riven by polarisation. “This was a conservative city,” he notes, and yet “hundreds of thousands of people turned up to cheer him on”.
Kennedy was on his way to deliver a speech on political extremism, with lines Logevall believes to be prescient. “America’s leadership must be guided by learning and reason, or else those who confuse rhetoric with reality and the plausible with the possible will gain popular ascendancy, with their seemingly swift and simple solutions to every world problem.” FB
LBJ being sworn in, 1963
By Cecil W Stoughton
On 22 November 1963, shortly after the assassination of John F Kennedy, vice-president Lyndon B Johnson took the oath to become the 36th president of the US, inside a cramped compartment aboard Air Force One, on the runway of Dallas airport. Kennedy’s body had been loaded on to the plane 15 minutes before, and as the compartment filled with people, White House photographer Cecil Stoughton stood on top of a sofa, crammed himself against the curved ceiling and asked everyone to step back.
When Jackie Kennedy arrived, still in her blood- stained suit, she was positioned to LBJ’s left – her haunting, dazed expression lends the image its emotional force. In less than a minute, as Stoughton snapped eight pictures, the ceremony was over. As Air Force One continued on to Washington, Stoughton left the plane to ensure his film was swiftly developed and transmitted to the world’s press, to authenticate the transfer of power to a new president.

Donald Trump mugshot, 2023
By Fulton County Sheriff’s Office
Even before Trump arrived at the Fulton County Sheriff’s Office in Atlanta, Georgia, last August, people were anticipating the release of his mugshot, with fakes spreading around the internet. It was his fourth arrest that year, but the first time he had had a picture taken.
Mugshots are often used to shame public figures who have run-ins with the law. But for Trump, ever the self-publicist, the image became a golden opportunity, adorning mugs, T-shirts and stickers, with the mottos “Never Surrender” or “Not Guilty”. Trump, not long reinstated on X by Elon Musk, tweeted the image himself, raising more than $7m in just a few days. FB
Jimmy Carter at Camp David, 1978
By Karl Schumacher
In September 1978, Jimmy Carter convened a secret 12-day summit with Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian president Anwar Sadat at Camp David. The main focus was a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel after 30 years of intermittent war. The resulting accords led to Israel agreeing to withdraw from the Sinai in exchange for its first official recognition by an Arab state and an end to the state of war. A plan was also laid out for Palestinian self-government in the West Bank and Gaza, but it was never implemented.
Here Begin and Sadat are shown smiling and shaking hands at the presidential retreat in Maryland, as Carter looks on. “The picture makes it look as if the three leaders all got along very well at the summit. That was not at all the case,” recalls William B Quandt, a former national security council staffer who was involved in the negotiations. “The adversaries were very hostile, and on the third day Carter decided not to have any more three-way meetings. We were not at all sure we would get an agreement until the last day.”
Begin and Sadat won the Nobel Peace prize that year, while Carter was awarded it in 2002 for “his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts”. While the Camp David accords are recognised as his greatest presidential achievement, they left crucial issues unresolved and, some argue, helped prevent Palestianian statehood. GS
George HW Bush in bed, 1987
By David Valdez
This photograph, taken in 1987 for Life magazine, captured the then vice- president with his family on holiday in Maine. David Valdez – personal photographer to Bush at the time – was invited by Barbara Bush to come by the house at 6am. “I poked my head in the bedroom door and there were George and Barbara Bush in bed,” he later told NPR. “Then the grandchildren started coming in and I took that snap, and that wound up running two full pages, and it’s taken on a life of its own.” The Washington Post credited the image with launching Bush’s successful campaign for the presidency; Valdez became his official White House photographer.

Lyndon B Johnson watches war protests, 1968
By Yoichi Okamoto
This strikingly intimate shot shows LBJ and his family at his ranch in Texas, watching TV coverage of Vietnam war protests outside the 1968 Democratic national convention in Chicago. This level of access was remarkable: Yoichi Okamoto was the first civilian to be appointed chief photographer for the White House.
Here we can also see a turning point in LBJ’s presidency. Since taking over in 1963, he had sent more than 500,000 troops to what the public increasingly saw as an unjustifiable, unwinnable war. “I know we oughtn’t to be there,” Johnson admitted to a colleague in 1966, “but I can’t get out.” He withdrew from the 1968 election, and Nixon won.

Calvin Coolidge as a cowboy, 1927
Photographer unknown
During his tenure in the 1920s, Calvin Coolidge held the greatest number of press conferences of any president (521 over six years), delivered the first State of the Union address on the radio and was the first to appear in a sound film. The media-savvy president appeared in photos dressed up in workers’ overalls, pitching hay and – as here – wearing a cowboy’s chaps and hat, on a trip to South Dakota. This image caused a stir: while the New York Times claimed “Coolidge as Cowboy Wins West’s Heart”, others called him “a pitiful puppet of publicity”, the first president to make himself a laughing stock. He would not be the last. FB
Bill Clinton on Arsenio Hall, 1992
By Reed Saxon
This may well be what clinched the 1992 election for Bill Clinton. In June, weeks before accepting the Democratic presidential nomination, he appeared on Arsenio Hall’s late-night talkshow and played Heartbreak Hotel on the saxophone. It was a bold move at the time and the image of a cool, confident Clinton on stage with his sax and dark shades is credited with helping him secure the youth vote especially. “It’s nice to see a Democrat blow something besides the election,” Hall quipped on the show. The success of the appearance, the Los Angeles Times wrote, “changed presidential politics – turning pop culture’s hippest TV shows into the contemporary equivalent of campaign whistle-stops”. GS
Lyndon B Johnson with Martin Luther King Jr, 1965
Photographer unknown
“I want to tell you how grateful I am,” Johnson told King on the phone, after becoming president in 1963, “and how worthy I’m going to try to be of all your hopes.” The cautious collaboration between the two reached its peak on 6 August 1965, with the signing of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibited racial discrimination in voting. Johnson is pictured that day, reaching out to pass a smiling King the pen used to sign the act, as Rosa Parks looks on.
How strong this much mythologised moment of unity really was has remained the subject of fierce debate. Mutual distrust haunted their interactions and King faced relentless pressure from J Edgar Hoover’s FBI, with Johnson’s knowledge. King split with the government over Vietnam, and today, voting rights have been rolled back. FB
Ronald Reagan at the Berlin Wall, 1987
By Dirck Halstead
On 12 June 1987, Ronald Reagan delivered probably the most famous sentence of his presidency: “Mr Gorbachev, tear down this wall!” He was standing in front of the Berlin Wall at the Brandenburg Gate, 24 years after JFK gave his famous speech in the city. It was a risky move: the previous day, thousands had gathered to protest against his visit. Even his own advisers had been unsure whether the public address to the Soviet leader was too provocative. But the fall of the Wall two years later, and the collapse of the Soviet Union, seemed to vindicate the decision – though there is debate over whether its importance has been overplayed. Over time, Gorbachev and Reagan, both keen to end the cold war, formed a productive alliance. GS
Joe Biden at the debate, 2024
By Justin Sullivan
“I’ve done 31 debates since I’ve been at Getty,” says photographer Justin Sullivan, “and I’ve never seen anything like that.” The Biden-Trump debate of June 2024 had felt unusual even before it started: press were allowed in only moments before it began and the room was eerily empty. As a “pale and very unstable” Biden gave “incoherent” answers, Sullivan focused on the “strange facial expressions” that damned him as much as his nonsensical responses did. Within weeks, he’d dropped out of the race.
“It was a sad ending to a strong presidency that history will look upon more favourably,” says David Smith, the Guardian’s Washington bureau chief. “He inherited four major crises – the pandemic, the economy, racial justice and climate – and made significant progress on all of them.” FB
Robert F Kennedy’s assassination, 1968
By Bill Eppridge
On 5 June 1968, Robert F Kennedy was in the ballroom of the Ambassador hotel in Los Angeles, giving a victory speech after winning the Democratic California presidential primary – he was shaping up to be the nominee to run against Richard Nixon in the general election. As he exited through the hotel kitchen after midnight, shaking hands with staff, shots rang out. In this photograph by Life magazine photographer Bill Eppridge, Kennedy lies on the floor while a busboy, Juan Romero, crouches down to comfort him. Kennedy died the next day. The gunman was Sirhan Sirhan, a Palestinian-Jordanian man who said he felt betrayed by Kennedy’s support for Israel in the six-day war.
Letters addressed to “the busboy” soon arrived at the hotel. “One even went so far as to say that if he hadn’t stopped to shake my hand, the senator would be alive, so I should be ashamed of myself for being so selfish,” Romero told NPR in 2018. “It’s been a long 50 years.” He visited Kennedy’s grave in 2010, buying his first suit for the occasion.
Alternative accounts of the assassination have since emerged. His son, Robert F Kennedy Jr – a conspiracy theorist who recently suspended his own presidential campaign – is among those who believe there was a second gunman. GS",2024-11-02
Guardian,Can democracy survive now the world’s richest man has it in his sights? | George Monbiot,"This is what happens when successive US governments fail to tackle inequality. While millions of people live in poverty, a handful grow unimaginably rich. Wealth begets wealth, and they acquire political power to match. It was inevitable that one of them – now the richest man on Earth – would launch what looks like a bid for world domination.
A vote for Donald Trump next week is a vote for Elon Musk. Just as Trump is using Musk, Musk could be using Trump as a springboard to perhaps even greater power than the US president can wield. Musk’s secret conversations with Vladimir Putin, reported by the Wall Street Journal last week, and his contacts with other extremist world leaders, suggest a pattern of power-seeking that could be even more alarming than the prospect of a second Trump presidency.
Trump, if he wins, will do to the nation what Musk did to Twitter: the US will be e-Muskulated. What this means is that those with the power to swarm, harass and crush people who do not share their noxious ideology will be unleashed.
Elon Musk claims to be a “free speech absolutist”. But his absolutism seems to extend only to his allies. Since he bought Twitter and renamed it X, the platform has complied with 83% of requests by governments for the censorship or surveillance of accounts. When the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, demanded the censorship of his opponents before the last general election, the platform obliged. When Indian government officials asked it to remove a hostile BBC documentary, X did as they asked, and later deleted the accounts of many critics of the prime minister, Narendra Modi.
Last month, X blocked links to a dossier about Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, and suspended the account of the journalist who revealed it. Musk has sued organisations that criticise him. Because the most vicious and antisocial people – racists, antisemites, misogynists, homophobes, even outright Nazis – have been reinstated and often boosted, millions of other users have been driven from the platform, their own free speech diminished. Musk’s own posts are reportedly amplified a thousandfold by a boutique algorithm. Free speech absolutism? My left foot.
Now he has bent his immense wealth, power and blatant double standards to a frantic effort to get Trump elected. Some of his tactics – cash rewards and cash prizes – look to me like attempts to buy votes and interfere in an election. His lawyers were able to prevent him having to attend court this week for a hearing challenging these tactics: another privilege of wealth. He has used his X account to spread rampant misinformation on Trump’s behalf, giving him many millions of dollars’ worth of advertising. He has poured $118m into his pro-Trump super Pac (political action committee).
What would the world’s richest man gain from the e-Muskulation of US – and perhaps global – politics? He would gain what capital has sought since workers acquired the vote: the truncation of democracy. Democracy is the problem capital keeps trying to solve. Why? Because it ensures that workers have rights and fair wages; that the living world has some (though never enough) protections; that we cannot be ripped off, poisoned and robbed without restraint.
Capitalism has used two powerful tools to try to solve its problem: fascism and neoliberalism. But now, though drawing on both those ideologies, it reverts to an older and cruder mode: oligarchy. Why, the billionaires might wonder, should they rely on intermediaries to wield political power? After all, in every other sphere, the world bows to them, not to their concierges. This, I think, is where Musk and some of his fellow tech authoritarians have been heading.
A Trump victory would allow Musk to escape the regulators with which he is often in conflict. In fact, if he takes up Trump’s offer of running a government efficiency commission, Musk becomes his own regulator, able to erase the rules that make the difference between a good society and barbarism.
But Trump’s election might also permit even greater opportunities. Musk controls key strategic and military assets, such as SpaceX satellite launchers and the Starlink internet system. As Ukraine discovered to its cost last year, he can switch them off at whim. The kind of decision-making powerful states deploy has been privatised. The Kremlin is reported to have asked him to withhold Starlink access from Taiwan, as a favour to the Chinese government. Terrestrial broadband operators claim that Starlink could interfere with and degrade their own systems. Starlink has refuted this. It is not hard to see how his power could grow to the point at which governments feel obliged to do as he demands.
He might not look the part. Villains bent on world domination are meant to be suave, laconic, self-possessed. Musk dresses like an attention-hungry teenager and behaves accordingly. Yet he has been equipped with the means to multiply his power beyond any that a plutocrat has wielded in the democratic era.
For decades now, the centrist pact with capital has worked as follows: we might seek half-heartedly to improve the lives of people at the bottom, but we will do almost nothing to hold down those at the top. As a short-term tactic it worked: Rupert Murdoch and other members of the plutocrats’ trade union struck an uneasy truce with Tony Blair, Bill Clinton and their ilk. But the long-term result is that the ultra-rich became so wealthy that they could present a direct threat to sovereign nations, even to the most powerful nation of all. Some of us have spent decades warning that this was the likely outcome: appeasement makes your opponents more powerful. But our governments claimed they were simply being “pragmatic”: it didn’t matter how rich some people became, as long as the lot of the poor improved.
Decades of studies, some of which were summarised 15 years ago in The Spirit Level by Kate Pickett and Richard Wilkinson, show what nonsense this is. A highly unequal society, whatever its absolute levels of wealth and poverty, is devastating for social outcomes, for wellbeing, cohesion and democracy. But “pragmatism” prevailed, and turned out not to be pragmatic at all. The slippage from democracy to oligarchy should surprise no one.
So now we face a generalised e-Muskulation: of public life, of trust, of kindness, of mutual aid, of a world in which the poor could aspire to something better, and in which all of us could aspire to a healthy living planet. Governments that have not yet fully succumbed must do what should have been done long ago: make the poor richer, and the very rich poorer.

Guardian,Top Georgia official says fake video of voter fraud probably spread by Russia,"A video circulating on social media purporting to show Haitians voting illegally for Kamala Harris is fake, according to the secretary of state in Georgia.
Brad Raffensperger said in a statement that the video had probably been created and spread by Russian government actors trying to interfere in the US election.
“This is obviously fake, and likely it is a production of Russian troll farms,” he wrote. “As Americans we can’t let our enemies use lies to divide us and undermine faith in our institutions – or each other.”
The video shows two people claiming to be from Haiti, saying they came to the US six months previously and have received US citizenship.
“We’re voting Kamala Harris. Yesterday, we voted in Gwinnett county, and today we’re voting in Fulton county,” the man says in the 20-second clip. “We have all our documents, driver’s license. We invite all Haitians to come to America and bring families.”
The video was reported to the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and Raffensperger’s office said it confirmed the hoax after it discovered the driver’s license of one of the alleged “voters” was fake.
Trump and his campaign have made racist comments about Haitian immigrants “eating pets” and, far from apologizing after they were proved false, subsequently doubled down on the claims , leading to a rapid escalation of threats against the Haitian community in Springfield, Ohio, who have the legal right to live in the US.

Raffensberger did not include a link to the video but it has been widely circulated on social media by prominent rightwing accounts – most prominently on X, which is owned by Elon Musk.
In his statement on Thursday, Raffensperger urged Musk to take the video down from X, and called on “leadership of other social media platforms to take it down” as well.
Despite promises when he bought it that he would purge the platform of disinformation, Musk has since done the opposite, not just allowing the spread of false and misleading posts but frequently sharing them himself, even after they have been debunked.
Raffensperger, a Republican, defended the integrity of Georgia’s election results in 2020 after Trump’s false claims that it had been “stolen”. On a call with the secretary of state, Trump asked him to “find” enough votes to change the result in Georgia, which Biden won.
Raffensberger refused, pointing out that there was no fraud. Trump later described him as an “enemy of the people”.
Trump is under federal indictment for his attempt to interfere with the presidential election in Georgia.
Russia, too, has made ongoing attempts to interfere with US elections. A US intelligence report from last year found that Russia is using spy networks, state-run media and social media to undermine public trust in elections, calling it “a global phenomenon”.",2024-11-01

Guardian,Donald Trump repeats anti-immigrant threats at Milwaukee rally,"At a Wisconsin rally on Friday, Donald Trump called Kamala Harris a “low-IQ person” and vowed to save the economy “from total obliteration” in a 1.5 hour-long meandering speech that touched on top campaign issues including the economy and foreign policy – but also featured threats to curb press freedoms and a lengthy discussion of his own rhetorical style.
“I will stop the criminal invasion of this country,” said Trump during his opening remarks, promising to usher in a new “golden age”.
“Can you imagine if Kamala won? You would go down to a 1929 style depression,” said Trump.
On immigration, Trump’s message was characteristically dark. The campaign played a painful video of a mother describing her daughter’s murder and blaming Harris for allowing the accused to enter the US without authorization. Studies overwhelmingly refute Trump’s claim that immigrants are disproportionately responsible for crime in the US, but such claims are a feature of his campaign.
“The day I take office, the migrant invasion ends,” said Trump. He vowed to launch the “largest deportation program in American history” and said cities and towns had been “conquered” by immigrants, whom he referred to as “animals”.
Since his Madison Square Garden rally – which showcased racist and misogynistic comments from a lineup of speakers, including comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” – Trump and his allies have sought to recast the former president and his Maga base as unfairly maligned.
“Kamala has spent the final week of her campaign comparing her political opponents to the most evil mass murderers in history,” said Trump at the Wisconsin rally.
“Vice-president Harris thinks you are Nazis, fascists,” said the Wisconsin senator Ron Johnson, who spoke at the rally.
Johnson praised Trump for bringing into his campaign Robert F Kennedy Jr, who ended his presidential bid as a third party candidate in August; and Tulsi Gabbard, a former Democratic congresswoman who announced she had left the party in 2022. Johnson accused Democrats of “destroying America” and credited Trump with making “the Republican Party the party of the working men and women of America.”
Drawing applause and chants of “Bobby, Bobby, Bobby”, Kennedy addressed the crowd, reminding them that although he has left the race, he will still appear on the ballot and urging them to vote for Trump. “I said a prayer to God that he would put me in a position to end the chronic disease epidemic,” said Kennedy. “God sent me Donald J Trump.”
During his remarks, the Republican congressman Bryan Steil urged the audience to support a state constitutional amendment on the ballot in Wisconsin that would ban non-US citizens from voting in Wisconsin elections – a proposal that seeks to pre-empt municipalities from opening their local elections to non-citizens and comes as Republicans elevate unfounded anxieties about non-US citizens committing voter fraud in federal elections.
“We have an opportunity on Tuesday to vote ‘yes’ on an amendment to say that Wisconsin’s elections and American’s elections are for US citizens only, do you agree?” said Steil. The idea that immigrants threaten US elections has caught fire among Trump’s supporters.
Jason Tyler, a Republican activist who attended the Milwaukee rally, said he was worried about non-citizens voting illegally in the presidential election. Tyler plans to volunteer as a poll observer in Rock county on election day, where he said he will be looking for non-US citizens casting ballots. “My biggest thing I would be looking for is if somebody can’t speak English and start there,” said Tyler, who acknowledged that the bar for challenging a ballot is high enough in Wisconsin that he would not likely succeed in preventing a voter from casting a ballot.
“It’s very difficult – the only thing that I can really do is I can ask for their information, you know, find out who they are, and I can report that, if I felt that there was something weird about it,” said Tyler. “I can’t really tell that person not to vote.”
Tyler added that he’s frustrated with the idea that Trump’s inflammatory comments about immigrants are racist. “It’s ridiculous,” said Tyler, adding that his wife came to the US from the Philippines. “She loves Donald Trump.”",2024-11-02
Guardian,Halloween parade float depicts shackled Harris being dragged,"A Pittsburgh-area Halloween parade’s depiction of Kamala Harris in chains and being dragged by a vehicle displaying Donald Trump’s name is being condemned as racist – and has prompted an apology from the event organizer.
Photos of Wednesday night’s parade in Westmoreland county, Pennsylvania, that circulated widely across social media show a person dressed as the Democratic vice-president shackled and walking behind a golf cart-like vehicle. The vehicle – a float in a Halloween parade organized by the Mount Pleasant volunteer fire department – is decorated with American flags and Trump campaign signs carrying people dressed in what appear to be Secret Service agent costumes, along with a mounted rifle.
Social media was quick to express disgust at the float’s display, which came less than a week before the presidential election between Harris and the Republican former president comes to a head on 5 November.
The NAACP was among those to say the float was racist. A statement from Daylon A Davis, the president of the NAACP’s Pittsburgh branch, said: “This appalling portrayal goes beyond the realm of Halloween satire or free expression; it is a harmful symbol that evokes a painful history of violence, oppression, and racism that Black and Brown communities have long endured here in America.”
Harris is of Jamaican and Indian descent.
Nearly 24 hours after the parade, the Mount Pleasant volunteer fire department issued a statement apologizing on Facebook for allowing the offensive float.
“We do not share in the values represented by those participants, and we understand how it may have hurt or offended members of our community,” the statement said.
The post did not elaborate on the process of getting approved for the parade, leaving questions about how the float was allowed to roll.
On a CBS News segment, Mount Pleasant’s mayor, Diane Bailey, denounced the portrayal of Harris.
“I was appalled, angered, upset,” the Democratic mayor said on Thursday. “This does not belong in this parade or in this town.”
Bailey added that the fire department must change its process for allowing floats.
“They’ve never taken applications in the past,” Bailey said. “They’ve never vetted anyone who wanted to come to the parade.”
Michelle Milan McFall, the chairperson of Westmoreland county’s Democratic party, added that the float in question rolled during what she said may be the US’s “most contentious election”.
On the campaign trail, Trump has repeatedly threatened to imprison his opponents. He has also been targeted by two assassination attempts, according to authorities.
“It’s vile. It’s heartbreaking. It’s concerning. And I think it’s also got an element of danger,” Milan McFall told ABC affiliate WTAE. “Again, we’re living in this climate where people aren’t just thinking about hatred and feeling it in their guts and bones. They’re acting on it.”",2024-11-01
Guardian,"Republicans preparing to reject US election result if Trump loses, warn strategists","Republicans are already laying the ground for rejecting the result of next week’s US presidential election in the event Donald Trump loses, with early lawsuits baselessly alleging fraud and polls from right-leaning groups that analysts say may be exaggerating his popularity and could be used by Trump to claim only cheating prevented him from returning to the White House.
The warnings – from Democrats and anti-Trump Republicans – come as Americans prepare to vote on Tuesday in the most consequential presidential contest in generations. Most polls show Trump running neck and neck with Kamala Harris, the vice-president and Democratic nominee, with the two candidates seemingly evenly matched in seven key swing states.
But suspicions have been voiced over a spate of recent polls, mostly commissioned in battleground states from groups with Republican links, that mainly show Trump leading. The projection of surging Trump support as election day nears has drawn confident predictions from him and his supporters.
“We’re leading big in the polls, all of the polls,” Trump told a rally in New Mexico on Thursday. “I can’t believe it’s a close race,” he told a separate rally in North Carolina, a swing state where polls show he and Harris are in a virtual dead heat.
An internal memo sent to Trump by his chief pollster is confirming that story to him, with Tony Fabrizio declaring the ex-president’s “position nationally and in every single battleground state is SIGNIFICANTLY better today than it was four years ago”.
Pro-Trump influencers, too, have strengthened the impression of inevitable victory with social media posts citing anonymous White House officials predicting Harris’s defeat. “Biden is telling advisers the election is ‘dead and buried’ and called Harris an innate sucker,” the conspiracy theorist Jack Posobiec posted this week.
GOP-aligned polling groups have released 37 polls in the final stretch of the campaign, according to a study by the New York Times, during a period when longstanding pollsters have been curtailing their voter surveys. All but seven showed a lead for Trump, in contrast to the findings of long-established non-partisan pollsters, which have shown a more mixed picture – often with Harris leading, albeit within error margins.
In one illustration, a poll last Tuesday by the Trafalgar Group – an organisation founded by a former Republican consultant – gave Trump a three-point lead over Harris in North Carolina. By contrast, a CNN/SRSS poll two days later in the same state put the vice-president ahead by a single point.
The polling expert Nate Silver – who has said his “gut” favours a Trump win, while simultaneously arguing that people should not trust their gut – cast doubt on the ex-president’s apparent surge in an interview with CNBC. “Anyone who is confident about this election is someone whose opinion you should discount,” he said.
“There’s been certainly some momentum towards Trump in the last couple of weeks. [But] these small changes are swamped by the uncertainty. Any indicator you want to point to, I could point to counter-examples.”
Democrats and some polling experts believe the conservative-commissioned polls are aiming to create a false narrative of unstoppable momentum for Trump – which could then be used to challenge the result if Harris wins.
“Republicans are clearly strategically putting polling into the information environment to try to create perceptions that Trump is stronger. Their incentive is not necessarily to get the answer right,” Joshua Dyck, of the Center for Public Opinion at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell, told the New York Times.
Simon Rosenberg, a Democrat strategist and blogger, said it followed a trend set in the 2022 congressional elections, when a succession of surveys favourable to Republicans created an expectation of a pro-GOP “red wave” that never materialised on polling day.
“These polls were usually two, three, four points more Republican than the independent polls that were being done and they ended up having the effect of pushing the polling averages to the right,” he told MeidasTouch News.
“We cannot be bamboozled by this again. It is vital to Donald Trump’s effort if he tries to cheat and overturn the election results, he needs to have data showing that somehow he was winning the election.
“The reason we have to call this out is that Donald Trump needs to go into election day with some set of data showing him winning, so if he loses, he can say we cheated.”
Trump, who falsely claims that Joe Biden stole the 2020 election, is also paving the way for repeating the accusation via legal means.
He told a rally in Pennsylvania that Democrats were “cheating” in the state, and on Wednesday his campaign took legal action against election officials in Bucks County, where voters waiting to submit early mail-in ballots were turned away because the deadline had expired. A judge later ordered the county to extend early voting by one day. There is no evidence of widespread cheating in elections in Pennsylvania or any other state, and mail-in ballots are in high demand in part because Trump himself has encouraged early voting.
Suing to allege – without evidence – that there has been voting fraud is part of a well-worn pattern of Trump disputing election results that do not go his way. In the aftermath of the 2020 election, his team filed 60 lawsuits disputing the results, all of which were forcefully thrown out in court.
Anti-Trump Republicans have expressed similar concerns to Democrats about Trump’s actions. Michael Steele, a former Republican national committee chair and Trump critic, told the New Republic that the GOP-commissioned polls were gamed to favour Trump.
“You find different ways to weight the participants, and that changes the results you’re going to get,” he said. “They’re gamed on the back end so Maga can make the claim that the election was stolen.”
Stuart Stevens, a former adviser to Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican candidate, and a founder of the anti-Trump Lincoln Project, told the same outlet: “Their gameplan is to make it impossible for states to certify. And these fake polls are a great tool in that, because that’s how you lead people to think the race was stolen.”
Trump-leaning surveys have influenced the polling averages published by sites such as Real Clear Politics, which has incorporated the results into its projected electoral map on election night, forecasting a win for the former president.
Elon Musk, Trump’s wealthiest backer and surrogate, posted the map to his 202 million followers on his own X platform, proclaiming: “The trend will continue.”
Trump and Musk have also promoted online betting platforms, which have bolstered the impression of a surge for the Republican candidate stemming from hefty bets on him winning.
A small number of high-value wagers from four accounts linked to a French national appeared to be responsible for $28m gambled on a Trump victory on the Polymarket platform, the New York Times reported.
Trump referenced the Polymarket activity in a recent speech. “I don’t know what the hell it means, but it means we’re doing pretty well,” he said.",2024-11-01
Guardian,"Yes, Bidenomics is working here in Pennsylvania. But it might not be enough to win the White House | JoJo Burgess","Where I come from, “the economy” isn’t just about lines on a graph or numbers on a screen. It’s about how much money people have in their pockets and how much their groceries cost. It’s about how many shops are shuttered on their high street and whether they can afford to make the rent.
In Pennsylvania, when voters go to the polls next week, the economy will be weighing very heavily on their minds. Our state will probably decide who becomes the next president of the US, and how we vote will also be a test of Joe Biden’s policies. The economy is one of the top issues for voters in our state. Many of them will be asking: am I in a better place now, compared with where I was four years ago?
I come from a family of steelworkers near Pittsburgh. My father was a steelworker in the city, and so is my son. I’m also a rep for United Steelworkers, one of the largest unions in our country. As you can imagine, the most important issue in town right now is the steel deal. The Japanese steelmaker Nippon has been trying to buy US Steel for the past year, and though the company has promised to honour US Steel’s agreement with our union, we have many reasons to be doubtful.
Not only is steel integral to our national security, raising questions about foreign takeovers, but there’s nothing to stop the company from cutting union jobs a few years down the line. The CEO of US Steel stands to walk away with $70m (£54m) if the deal completes. It’s the same pattern that repeats again and again: the money stays at the top, while people at the bottom are forgotten about.
I’m glad that Kamala Harris has committed to blocking the sale. And I’m glad that the Biden administration has questioned the value of takeovers like these. Look at the Chips Act, or the Inflation Reduction Act: both were about spurring investment in our economy and building up productive capacity in the US.
For too long, globalisation has meant a race to the bottom, with firms outsourcing labour and offshoring production to the places where it’s cheapest. Most employees have been working harder but getting paid less: from 1973 to 2013, the hourly wage for a typical worker rose just 9%, while productivity increased by 74%. No wonder so many people are exhausted and struggling to keep their heads above water.
Here’s the thing: Donald Trump says he gets it, but he doesn’t. He talks about inflation killing our country under Biden, but he never says that record corporate profits are one of the drivers of inflation. He talks about the housing crisis, but then he blames the lack of affordable housing on immigrants. He is a master at spinning simple answers to complex problems, but he has no real solutions.
I think most people are smarter than Trump gives them credit for. Most people have a sense that the reason daily life has become so expensive isn’t just because of the war in Ukraine or supply-chain bottlenecks. It’s because corporations got greedy, and started using inflation as cover to raise prices. If I can sell you a cup of water for $10, why would I drop the price to $7? The Democrat Pennsylvania senator Bob Casey has been campaigning explicitly on “greedflation”.
It feels as though the message is cutting through, but I know plenty of steelworkers will still vote Trump, though almost all the unions have backed Harris. Where I live is rust belt territory. It’s a place that once boomed on coal, steel and cars. It’s a place that struggled to reinvent itself after the decline of the manufacturing industries, and lost a lot of jobs.
Since the pandemic, we’ve been suffering. I live in Washington, a town south of Pittsburgh, where I’m also the local mayor. I’ve seen how the shift towards working from home has damaged some of our small businesses, and how our healthcare workers suffered from Covid-19.
But I can also see the positives that “Bidenomics” has brought to our community, and I’m hoping these will cut through. One of the biggest complaints I hear now from residents is: “Why is there so much construction? We can’t cross the road!” Thanks to a huge boost in federal spending, with the Inflation Reduction Act earmarking billions of dollars to support infrastructure projects, there are many more cranes than there used to be.
I always say, that’s infrastructure money working for us. When the Fern Hollow bridge collapsed in Pittsburgh, it was rebuilt in record time. Pennsylvania is particularly well placed to benefit from federal investment because it’s the second largest producer of energy in the US after Texas, and we need that climate spending if we’re going to transition to a clean energy economy. I’m just hoping that other voters feel the same way.

Guardian,Where will abortion be on the ballot in the 2024 US election?,"This November, abortion will be on the ballot in 10 states, including the states that could determine the next president.
In the two years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, abortion has become the kind of issue that decides elections. Outrage over Roe’s demise led Republicans to flounder in the 2022 midterms, and abortion rights supporters have won every post-Roe abortion-related ballot measure, including in red states such as Ohio, Kentucky and Kansas.
This year, most of the ballot measures are seeking to amend states’ constitutions to protect abortion rights up until fetal viability, or about 24 weeks of pregnancy. Because a number of the measures are in states that have outlawed abortion, they could become the first to overturn the post-Roe ban. Others are in states where abortion is legal, but activists say the measures are necessary to cement protections so they can’t be easily overturned if Republicans control the government.
These are the states slated to vote on abortion this election day.
Arizona
Abortion rights supporters in Arizona, a key battleground state in the presidential election, are vying to pass a measure that would enshrine the right to abortion up until viability in the state constitution. A provider could perform an abortion after viability if the procedure is necessary to protect the life or physical or mental health of a patient.
Arizona currently bans abortion past 15 weeks of pregnancy. Earlier this year, the state supreme court reinstated a 19th-century near-total abortion ban, generating nationwide outrage that prompted the state legislature to quickly repeal it in favor of letting the 15-week ban stand.
Colorado
Colorado’s measure would amend the state constitution to block the state government from denying, impeding or discriminating against individuals’ “right to abortion”. This measure also includes a one-of-a-kind provision to bar Colorado from prohibiting healthcare coverage for abortion – which could very well pass in the deep-blue state.
Because Colorado permits abortion throughout pregnancy and neighbors five states with bans – Oklahoma, Texas, Arizona, Utah and Nebraska – the state has become a haven for people fleeing abortion bans, especially those seeking abortions later in pregnancy.
Florida
Once the last stronghold of southern abortion access, Florida in May banned abortion past six weeks of pregnancy, which is before many women know they’re pregnant. Its measure, which needs 60% of the vote to pass, would roll back that ban by adding the right to an abortion up until viability to the state’s constitution. Providers could perform an abortion after viability if one is needed to protect a patient’s health.
Florida Republicans’ tactics in the fight against the measure has alarmed voting rights and civil rights groups. Law enforcement officials have investigated voters who signed petitions to get the measure onto the ballot, while a state health agency has created a webpage attacking the amendment.
Maryland
Legislators, rather than citizens, initiated Maryland’s measure, which would amend the state constitution to confirm individuals’ “right to reproductive freedom, including but not limited to the ability to make and effectuate decisions to prevent, continue, or end the individual’s pregnancy”. Like Colorado, Maryland has become an abortion haven because it permits the procedure throughout pregnancy. It is also relatively close to the deep south, which is blanketed in bans.
Missouri
Abortion opponents went to court to stop Missouri’s measure from appearing on voters’ ballots, but the state supreme court rejected their arguments and agreed to let voters decide whether the Missouri constitution should guarantee the “fundamental right to reproductive freedom, which is the right to make and carry out decisions about all matters relating to reproductive healthcare, including but not limited to prenatal care, childbirth, postpartum care, birth control, abortion care, miscarriage care, and respectful birthing conditions”.
Missouri, which was the first state to ban abortion after Roe fell, only permits the procedure in medical emergencies. If the measure passes, it is expected to roll back that ban and permit abortion until viability.
Montana
In the years since Roe fell, Montana courts and its Republican-dominated legislature have wrestled over abortion restrictions and whether the right to privacy embedded in Montana’s constitution includes the right to abortion. Abortion remains legal until viability in Montana, but the measure would amend the state constitution to explicitly include “a right to make and carry out decisions about one’s own pregnancy, including the right to abortion” up until viability. Providers could perform an abortion after viability to protect a patient’s life or health.
Nebraska
Nebraska, which bans abortion past 12 weeks of pregnancy, is the lone state with two competing ballot measures this November. One of the measures would enshrine the right to abortion up until viability into the state constitution, while the other would enshrine the current ban. If both measures pass, the measure that garners the most votes would take effect.
Nevada
Alongside Arizona, Nevada is one of the most closely watched states in the presidential election. Its measure would amend the state constitution to protect individuals’ right to abortion up until viability, or after viability in cases where a patient’s health or life may be threatened. Nevada already permits abortion up until 26 weeks of pregnancy.
New York
New York state legislators added a measure to the ballot to broaden the state’s anti-discrimination laws by adding, among other things, protections against discrimination on the basis of “sex, including sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive health”.
Although sky-blue New York passed a law protecting reproductive rights in 2019, advocates say this measure could be used to defend abortion rights against future challenges. However, the ballot language before voters will not include the word “abortion”, leading advocates to fear voters will not understand what they are voting on. Democrats pushed to add the word “abortion” to the description of the measure, but a judge rejected the request, ruling that the amendment poses “complex interpretive questions” and its exact impact on abortion rights is unclear.
South Dakota
South Dakota’s measure is less sweeping than other abortion rights measures, because it would only protect the right to abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. Under this measure, South Dakota could regulate access to abortion “only in ways that are reasonably related to the physical health of the pregnant woman” in the second trimester of pregnancy. In the third trimester, the state could ban abortion except in medical emergencies. Right now, South Dakota only allows abortions in such emergencies.
Although this measure will appear on the ballot, there will be a trial over the validity of the signatures that were collected for it. Depending out the outcome of the trial, the measure – and any votes cast for it – could be invalidated.",2024-09-26
Guardian,Sun belt to October surprise: US election terms explained,"On Tuesday 5 November, Americans will vote after one of the most surprising and chilling election campaigns in history. President Joe Biden dropped out of the race to be replaced by his vice-president, Kamala Harris, while the Republican candidate, Donald Trump, survived an assassination attempt and was embroiled in multiple criminal cases.
The outcome in the world’s largest economy will have far-reaching consequences – both inside the US and globally – on the climate crisis, abortion and development.
Here are the terms you need to know.
Ballot measures
It isn’t just a choice between the Democratic ticket (Kamala Harris and Tim Walz) and the Republican one (Donald Trump and JD Vance) that voters will be asked to make in November. US ballots can also include ballot measures: statewide laws, issues or questions.
This year voters in 10 US states could be asked to vote on abortion law or measures. They are Missouri, Florida, Nebraska, Montana, Arizona, Nevada, Maryland, New York, South Dakota and Colorado.
Down-ballot voting
Measures on the ballot other than the vote for US presidential ticket are down-ballot measures, and a third or more of the roughly half of Americans who usually turn up to vote don’t fill out the entire ballot, according to the US Vote Foundation. Voters do not have to vote for any down-ballot measures for their ballots to count.
Electoral college
The electoral college is a group of 538 people, called electors, who officially cast their votes for the US president after citizens have voted. This is a requirement outlined in the US constitution. The electors are chosen by political parties in each of the US’s 50 states ahead of the election.
Different states have different numbers of electoral college votes, with the number decided based on the census. The number of votes is equal to its total congressional delegation: the number of senators plus the number of representatives. While not a state, the District of Columbia – as in Washington DC – is allocated three electoral college votes.
This is why the total is 538: 100 senators plus 435 representatives plus three for DC.
A candidate needs more than half – or at least 270 – of the electoral college votes to win. In most states, all of the electoral college votes from the state go to the same candidate. The exceptions are Maine and Nebraska, which allocate two electoral votes to the state popular vote winner, and then one electoral vote to the popular vote winner in each congressional district.
The party that wins a state has its electors formally vote for its candidate. This happens a few weeks after the November election – and after US states have certified their election results – on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December.
In 2020 Donald Trump tried to remove electors in some states before the electoral college vote but the US supreme court rejected that attempt the week before.
Popular vote
The popular vote is the overall number of qualified voters who voted for a given candidate: in other words, the number of ballots cast for one candidate or another. The main thing to know about the popular vote is that winning it does not mean you win the presidency. The presidency is won by the candidate who gains the majority of electoral college votes. In other words: the US election is decided by races in individual states. In the 2016 election, Donald Trump received fewer votes than Hillary Clinton but still won the presidency and in 2000, George W Bush received fewer votes than Al Gore but also won.
Canvassing and certification
Canvassing is the process of counting ballots and tabulating results. This includes checks to ensure the results are valid, including ensuring every ballot is accounted for, and repeatedly verifying the results.
Canvassing ends with certification, where the canvassing process is signed off on. In short, it is the official confirmation of the results.
County election officials certify the canvass by signing a declaration that results, reported by precincts, are a complete and accurate record of every vote cast.
Certification is mandatory and codified in law, meaning officials cannot refuse to certify a result, though some have refused to do so. Though the certification process has “long been regarded as an administrative afterthought”, according to the Associated Press, there are fears this could happen again in November.
Red state, blue state, swing state
A red state is a one that tends to vote Republican, a blue state one that tends to vote Democrat, and a swing state one that swings between the two major parties from one election to the next.
Swing states, or battleground states, are where campaigns tend to spend the most money trying to win over undecided voters, or voters who they hope might be convinced to switch from supporting the other team to theirs.
Voters in the seven swing states are likely to decide the election this year. The states, and the number of electoral college votes up for grabs, are Arizona (11), Georgia (16), Michigan (15), Nevada (6), North Carolina (16), Pennsylvania (19) and Wisconsin (10). Together they account for 93 electoral college votes, or more than a third of what a candidate needs to win.
Swing states are less commonly referred to as “toss-up” or “purple” states – the latter referring to a mix of blue and red.
Blue wall, red wall
The blue wall refers to 18 US states and the District of Columbia – home to Washington DC – that voted Democrat from 1992 to 2012.
In 2016 Trump won by clinching three blue wall states: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
The red wall is less commonly used as a phrase but once referred to the states running from South Carolina to Idaho. In 2020 Time magazine referred to it as “more like a pink curtain or pink pond” because it had started to break down.
Rust belt
The rust belt is a collection of states in the US north-east and midwest where industries such as manufacturing and coalmining have declined – or “been left to rust”. It is an economic region rather than a geographical one. Michigan, home to Detroit, once the centre of the US automotive industry, is one of these.
It is generally seen as encompassing a large part of the midwest (Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio and Wisconsin) along with Pennsylvania, West Virginia and parts of New York, according to Encyclopeda Britannicato Encyclopedia Britannica.
There are three swing states in the midwestern rust belt – Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin – which is why it is important in any election, including this one.
Winning these states is one of Kamala Harris’s paths to victory – or gaining enough electoral college votes – according to analysts who modelled the pathways based on polling. The other path to victory for Harris and the Democrats is the sun belt (more on what that refers to below). According to the model, Trump would need to capture both groups of states to earn the 270 electoral college votes necessary to secure victory.
The sun belt
The sun belt includes 15 states extending across the southern US, from south-west to south-east, which have a sunnier or milder climate than the northern states.
It includes the four swing states of Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia. The remaining three swing states are in the rust belt.
Bible belt, flyover states
The Bible belt is the American south and tends to be Christian and conservative – and vote Republican. It includes the states of Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Arkansas, South Carolina, Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia and Oklahoma. The city of Tulsa in the state of Oklahoma is known as the “buckle” of the Bible belt.
Flyover states, or flyover country, also known as middle America, are the states at the centre of the country, between the US east and west coasts – the country’s most populous areas. A third of Americans live in just four states: California, Texas, Florida and New York.
Absentee ballots or mail-in voting
These are votes cast by mail, or in person, depending on a state’s rules, before election day. Trump has called for an end to mail-in voting. This is partly because in the 2020 election, many Americans voted by mail because of the Covid pandemic, and more Democrats than Republicans chose this option. Seven million more Democrats than Republicans voted early in the 20 states that compile party data.
Provisional ballots
When a voter’s name does not appear on the voter registration list at the polling place at their precinct on election day, they may be given a provisional ballot, which allows them to vote but means their vote is placed in a separate “secrecy envelope” rather than the ballot box. The registration status of these voters is then determined. If they are registered, their vote is counted.
In 2018 a voter named Crystal Mason was sentenced to five years in prison for casting a provisional ballot in the 2016 election without realising she was ineligible to vote. The case was seen as part of a broader Republican effort to intimidate people from voting. Mason was acquitted in 2024.
Voter suppression
Voter suppression tactics are laws, measures or misinformation designed to prevent people – for example people of colour, more of whom tend to vote Democrat, according to research from Pew – from voting or registering to vote.
Voting advocates in the south told the Guardian in 2023 that they felt they were playing Whac-A-Mole, trying to educate and register voters while also having to work to defeat suppressive legislation that would impose new rules on mail-in voting or limit drop boxes or require proof of citizenship to vote.
The various tactics are too complicated to go into here. But Georgia is a telling example. In 2021 Georgia Republicans enacted SB 202, a bill with sweeping voting restrictions, including a ban on giving out food or water within 150ft (45.7m) of a polling place or within 25ft (7.6m) of any voter standing in a line – which could extend well beyond the 150ft radius. Violating it is a misdemeanour punishable by up to a year in prison and a $1,000 fine.
Georgia had seen long lines to vote and many saw the measure as an obvious attempt to make it harder for Black voters to cast a ballot. The law was darkly ridiculed in an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm.
Path to victory
The path to victory refers to how a candidate wins 270 electoral college votes – rather than, for example, the most votes overall – and therefore wins the election. It involves targeting certain states – swing states and their electoral college votes – with time, money and messaging. It often involves candidates’ chances in and focus on rust belt and sun belt states, which encompass the seven swing states and their all-important electoral college votes.
Surrogates
Campaign surrogates are individuals who speak publicly on behalf of a political candidate, typically to promote them. Think Oprah, Obama and Joe Biden for Harris, or Hulk Hogan and Nikki Haley for Trump.
October surprise
This is the term for a news event that happens just before the election, in other words October – because the election is always held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November – that influences the election’s outcome. For example the Access Hollywood tape, or the John Podesta emails in the 2016 election.",2024-10-10
Guardian,Many Republicans take a tough line on China despite their own business ties to Beijing,"In testimony to Congress last year, David McCormick, now the Republican candidate for US Senate in Pennsylvania, said that as CEO of Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge fund in the world, he “held deep reservations” about “the moral and patriotic hazards of doing business in China”.
As CNN reported, between 2017 and 2021, such qualms did not stop McCormick overseeing an increase in Bridgewater’s Chinese holdings from $1.6m to $1.77bn. Nor, according to Bloomberg, did Bridgewater flinch from significant investments in companies that supply the Chinese military. It has also been reported that McCormick oversaw investment in a Chinese fentanyl producer and, as HuffPost put it, “profited from China trade policies he helped shape” as a deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs under George W Bush.
Denying wrongdoing, McCormick throws claims of hypocrisy back at his opponent, the incumbent Democrat Bob Casey, over his own investment links to companies from China and other countries.
As election day nears, with Senate control up for grabs in such battleground state races, both parties are seeking to emphasize China’s threat to the US economy and national security. But a review of reporting and documentation reveals many other Republicans taking a tough line on China despite their own business and investment links to Beijing.
In Wisconsin, Eric Hovde, a banker, has said that if he was in the Senate, “I’d be very focused on what China is doing and why we are allowing them to come to our communities and buy up our land, especially around military bases.” He has also accused his opponent, Tammy Baldwin, of failing to address a fentanyl addiction crisis fueled by Chinese imports.
According to the Daily Beast, before entering politics, Hovde’s family tried to launch an investment vehicle in China. A spokesperson for Hovde insisted he was not involved.
In Michigan, the former US House intelligence committee chair Mike Rogers says he was “among the first to sound the alarm on the economic and national security danger posed by China” – while the Detroit News reports that Rogers and his wife “have gained hundreds of thousands of dollars in wealth through companies that have partnered with Chinese firms”. Heartland Signal has highlighted Rogers’ ties with Nokia, a Finnish telecoms firm that “has conducted extensive business deals with Chinese tech companies like Huawei”, which is subject to US sanctions.
Rogers denies wrongdoing – and attacks his opponent for a Senate seat, congresswoman Elissa Slotkin, alleging she signed an NDA concerning a planned electric vehicle battery plant in Big Rapids to be built by a company connected to the Chinese Communist party. Slotkin denies that, and says she “worked to bring manufacturing back to the United States” while Rogers “supported trade deal after trade deal – including Nafta – that helped ship jobs to places like China”.
Meanwhile, Montana is no Rust-belt battleground but it is a rare Republican-dominated state represented by a Democrat in a Senate split 51-49. The Republican candidate, the US Navy Seal turned businessperson Tim Sheehy, has called for the US to “get tough” on China while attacking the incumbent, Jon Tester, as “weak” on the issue.
Last December, HuffPost reported that Sheehy “sold off shares in the Chinese tech giant Tencent, earning between $200 and $1,000 in dividends, according to his Senate campaign financial disclosure”. The same report said Sheehy maintained significant investments with financial institutions with “deep ties to China”.
Sheehy responded by attacking Tester for getting “six times richer as a career politician hobnobbing with lobbyists in Washington for nearly two decades”. Sheehy’s own wealth comes from Bridger Aerospace, a company dedicated to fighting forest fires. Heartland Signal reported that Sheehy “endorsed and attempted to utilize Chinese drones built by a company which was sanctioned by two administrations for leaking American data to the Chinese Communist Party”. Sheehy did not comment.
In Ohio, where the Democrat Sherrod Brown is seeking to keep his seat, China is an issue too, if over thousands rather than millions of dollars. The Republican candidate, auto salesperson Bernie Moreno, has claimed to have refused to sell a Chinese-made SUV. Spectrum News showed that Moreno did sell such vehicles. A spokesperson said Moreno stopped selling them after a local plant closed down.
And in Florida, Democrats dream of defeating Rick Scott, the former healthcare executive and governor who won his seat narrowly in 2018. Earlier this year, Mother Jones reported that though Scott has urged voters to “stop buying [Chinese] stuff[,] stop helping them[,] stop investing in China”, because “you don’t do business with your enemies,” he “has a long record of supporting Chinese investment in the United States and personally making money off Chinese commerce”.
The magazine laid out such links. A Scott spokesperson attacked the outlet and said the senator would be “happy to put his record up against” Democrats “pushing [Joe] Biden’s pro-China agenda”.
The Guardian asked the National Republican Senatorial Committee for comment about Republican candidates voicing bellicose campaign rhetoric about China despite reported ties to Beijing. It did not reply.",2024-10-28
Guardian,Kamala Harris will be a president for the labor movement – and for working women | Liz Shuler,"The 6.6 million union women in this country – nearly half of today’s labor movement – know an ally when we see one. We know we have one in Kamala Harris.
As president of the AFL-CIO, representing 60 unions across the United States in every sector of the economy, I’ve crisscrossed the country seeing our union members get out the vote for Harris in this election. So many of us – whether we’re retail workers, caregivers, teachers, nurses, construction workers or in any line of work – see in Vice-President Harris’s story something that mirrors our own.
When I joined my union, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, in Portland, Oregon, I got used to being the only woman in a room full of mostly men. We organized new members, fought against corporate greed and achieved some hard-won gains at the statehouse, which put me on the path to leadership in the labor movement and to becoming the youngest-ever member of the AFL-CIO executive council.
That’s when I crossed paths with Richard Trumka, a true labor legend. In 2009, when he decided to run for president of the AFL-CIO, Rich asked me to join his ticket as secretary-treasurer. Trumka was brilliant, forward-thinking and committed to making way for a new generation of labor leaders. He commanded respect as a Pittsburgh mine worker turned president of the United Mine Workers of America, with labor deep in his bones.
Then, in August 2021, I got a phone call that changed everything. Rich had suffered a heart attack on a camping trip. He passed away suddenly – and my world was shaken. At the same time as I grieved the loss of Rich, I had to unexpectedly prepare to then lead the labor movement.
One of the first people to reach out was Harris. She expressed her condolences, full of the same empathy and compassion that the whole country has now seen in her campaign. We talked about our common bond as women who had come up in male-dominated fields and what it means to her to be able to fight for working women as vice-president.
Three years later, when she found herself in a similar moment that required her to step up, she did so admirably. It wasn’t her plan, but it’s what her love for this country required. Duty called, and Harris answered – and when I spoke to the vice- president again that day, I told her we’d be there for her every step of the way.
She will lead an administration that honors with action the countless contributions of working women, just as she has for her entire career. As attorney general in California, she protected the jobs of nurses across the state and won back millions of dollars for women and workers who had been illegally underpaid by greedy companies. As a senator, she stood with fast-food workers by walking the picket line in our fight for a $15 minimum wage, and fought to end “right to work” laws.
And for the past three-plus years, the vice-president has been a critical part of this historic pro-worker administration – passing massive legislation to create millions of union jobs and protecting millions of workers’ pensions. And when we elect her as president, Harris has outlined her bold vision to finally give care economy workers the pay and protections they deserve, while also lowering prices for all working families.
That’s a stark contrast to the Project 2025 agenda of Donald Trump and JD Vance. They fundamentally disrespect women and devalue what we bring to the table. The men on the Republican ticket call us “childless cat ladies” because name-calling is all they can do in response to the electoral power we wield. They have no plan to support working women and our families – their only aim is to claw back the rights we’ve earned. We know that a second Trump term will bring the destruction of unions and contracts, the end of our rights in the workplace and control over our own bodies. From rolling back women’s economic opportunity to robbing us of reproductive freedom, the Trump–Vance platform would undo a century of progress.
Because so much is at stake for women and all workers, I proudly worked with the affiliated union leaders of the AFL-CIO to present a unanimous endorsement from our federation for Harris, just 24 hours after she announced her candidacy.
The AFL-CIO includes 60 unions of nearly 13 million workers in every sector of the economy – which also makes us the largest working women’s organization in the country. In these past months, I’ve been traveling the country and talking with them directly. I can assure you: we are ready to meet this moment. Our polling shows union women’s support for Harris – a margin of 32 points over support for Trump – is nearly three times the support of women overall.
When you smash through a glass ceiling, you’re bound to suffer some wounds. Donald Trump shows his misogyny every day, but the vice-president dismisses these attacks as what we have all come to expect from him – and her focus is locked on our future. Kamala Harris is in the business of uplifting working women. In contrast, a second Trump term would mean catastrophe for the precious liberties that our foremothers have pried from the hands of men just like him.
When working people need Harris’s help, she always answers the call. And working women have her back to make sure she continues to deliver the policies and support we need to create a just and equal society for women across the country.

Guardian,Cardi B says Harris inspired her to vote as candidates hold dueling Wisconsin rallies – as it happened,"Supreme court rejects Republican argument on Pennsylvania ballot counting: AP
The supreme court on Friday rejected an emergency appeal from Republicans that could have led to thousands of provisional ballots not being counted in Pennsylvania, the Associated Press reports.
The justices left in place a state supreme court ruling that elections officials must count provisional ballots cast by voters whose mail-in ballots were rejected.
As of Thursday, about 9,000 ballots out of more than 1.6 million returned have arrived at elections offices around Pennsylvania lacking a secrecy envelope, a signature or a date, according to state records.
Pennsylvania is the biggest presidential election battleground this year, with 19 electoral votes. Donald Trump won the state in 2016, then lost it in 2020.
Donald Trump and Kamala Harris campaigned in midwest swing states today, ending with dueling rallies in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, seen as a crucial state to win. Here are some of today’s key updates from myself and my colleagues:
Cardi B spoke at Harris’ Milwaukee rally, saying that she had not been planning to vote in this presidential election, but that Harris convinced her to do so. She called Harris an “underdog” whose accomplishments as a woman have been repeatedly demeaned and underestimated.
Despite facing criticism over saying yesterday that his prominent Republican critic Liz Cheney should have rifles shooting at her, Trump revisited his remarks about Cheney and her father Dick Cheney, calling her a war hawk and a coward. Harris had called Trump’s rhetoric about Cheney “disqualifying”.
The supreme court rejected an emergency appeal from Republicans that could have led to thousands of provisional ballots not being counted in Pennsylvania, and left in place a state supreme court ruling that election officials must count provisional ballots cast by voters whose mail-in ballots were rejected.
Trump visited Dearborn, Michigan, to tout his support among Arab Americans and Muslim Americans who are angry with the Biden Harris administration over their support for Israel and the human death toll in Gaza and Lebanon. While key Arab American leaders chose not to meet with Trump, some called his in-person visit important, and criticized Harris and the Democratic party.
Dearborn’s Democratic mayor, Abdullah Hammoud, posted on X, “The architect of the Muslim Ban is making a campaign stop in Dearborn…To the Dems - your unwillingness to stop funding & enabling a genocide created the space for Trump to infiltrate our communities. Remember that.”
The prominent vaccine skeptic Robert F Kennedy Jr campaigned for Trump in Michigan and Wisconsin, earning big cheers from Trump supporters as the former third-party candidate reportedly is aiming for a major healthcare role in Trump’s White House.
A federal judge on Friday denied an attempt by America Pac – the political action committee founded by Elon Musk to support Donald Trump’s campaign for a second presidency – to move to federal court a civil suit brought by the Philadelphia district attorney over a daily $1m prize draw for registered voters. A hearing was scheduled in Pennsylvania state court on Monday, the day before the election.
Arizona’s attorney general has launched an investigation into whether Donald Trump violated state law through his violent rhetoric against Liz Cheney. In a statement to 12News on Friday, attorney general Kris Mayes said: “I have already asked my criminal division chief to start looking at that statement, analyzing it for whether it qualifies as a death threat under Arizona’s laws.”
The justice department announced on Friday it is deploying election monitors in 86 jurisdictions in 27 states for the general election on 5 November. “The Justice Department enforces federal voting rights laws that protect the rights of all eligible citizens to access the ballot,” an official statement said. “The department regularly deploys its staff to monitor for compliance with federal civil rights laws in elections in communities all across the country.”
Despite the late hour, the crowd in Milwaukee rose to its feet to give him a standing ovation as Donald Trump listed off the actions he would take against migrants who commit crimes, the Associated Press reports.
Trump has centered his campaign on hardline tactics to stop illegal immigration, including the death penalty for migrants who are in the country illegally and kill an American citizen.
We are counting down to just three days and a few hours before the 2024 election, and Donald Trump is still riffing to a crowd of supporters in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as Kamala Harris has already arrived at her hotel for the night, according to the White House pool reporter.
Harris’ Milwaukee speech tonight was short, peppy, and relentlessly on message. Trump, as is his style, is rambling, hitting his attack lines on the economy and immigration, but also making extraneous attacks, such as criticizing the hair of ABC anchor David Muir, saying 60 Minutes should be shut down, and complaining that he is not allowed to call the Democratic governor of Illinois fat. (Again, he is in Wisconsin.)
“Is there a chance she would resign before the election? Three days?” Trump asks of his Democratic competitor, Kamala Harris. It’s not clear why Trump is airing this idea, other than as part of his claim that Harris looks “rattled”.
“I actually think they should have left Joe, he would have done just as well, maybe better,” Trump says.
Now Trump, speaking in Wisconsin, is attacking the Democratic governor of Illinois, JB Pritzker.
“I am not allowed to use the fat word. That’s the other word you cannot use,” Trump says, to some laughter from the crowd. “You are not allowed to use the fat word so I will not do it, but that guy is disgusting.”
“I took a lot of heat about two months ago because I said, ‘I think women like me, I do, I think the suburban housewives like me,” Trump said. There are high-pitched cheers from the audience.
“I think they like me because they know I’m going to protect them,” Trump says.
Talking about his plans for mass deportation of migrants, and expediting deportation of gang members, Trump says that he will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, and said that it’s “incredible” that “we had to go back so far” to find the law he needed.
“That’s when we ran a tough country,” he says, of the year 1798.
It is past 10pm in Milwaukee and Donald Trump is still talking. He is riffing freely, criticizing journalist David Muir’s hair, and revisiting what he saw as the unfairness of his debate against Kamala Harris, which Muir moderated.
“You were a very difficult state,” Trump says of Wisconsin,talking about how hard the state was for him to win in 2016, and then falsely claiming that he actually won the state again in 2020. (He did not.)
The AP has a fact check of Trump’s comments just now on the economy, and what his comments leave out: two major hurricanes as well as big strikes.
Donald Trump is saying that the US jobs report today, which showed that employers added 12,000 jobs in October, showed that the Biden-Harris administration is failing on the economy. Last month’s hiring gain was down significantly from the 223,000 jobs that were added in September.
“This is like a depression,” Trump said of the numbers as he heaped insults on Harris.
Economists estimate that Hurricanes Helene and Milton, combined with strikes at Boeing and elsewhere, pushed down net job growth by tens of thousands of jobs in October.
Kamala Harris appears to be wrapping up her speech, urging her supporters to remind everyone they know to vote, and to reach out to people through text and conversation.
“Let’s please be intentional about building community,” she adds. “There’s something intentional about this whole Trump era. It’s been powered by this idea that Americans should be pointing fingers at each other, and to make people feel alone and to make people feel small, when we all know we have so much more in common than what separates us.”
“I love Gen Z. I really do,” Kamala Harris laughs, talking about “all the younger leaders I see who are voting for the very first time.”
“Here’s what I love about you guys. You are rightly impatient for change. I love that about you. You are determined to live free from gun violence. You are going to take on the climate crisis. You are going to shape the world you inherit. I know that. I know that.”
“And here’s the thing about our young leaders. None of this is theoretical for them. None of this is political for them. It’s their lived experience. It’s your lived experience, and I see your power, I see your power, and I am so proud of you.”
The crowd at Trump’s rally has been frustrated with the sound levels in the Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee, even chanting earlier, “Fix the mic!” the Associated Press reports.
Trump eventually got the message and ripped the microphone from the podium to hold it closer to his mouth. “I think this mic stinks,” Trump said.
Trump has been jumping from topic to topic, mentioning that this is his third campaign rally today, then referencing his rally at New York’s Madison Square Garden nearly a week ago, and then hurling insults at his Democratic rival.
In two different venues across Milwaukee and its suburbs, both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris’ Wisconsin crowds have been waiting hours to hear the candidates speak, and both crowds sound fired up and enthusiastic.
“When I win … you are four days away from the best jobs, the biggest paychecks, and the brightest economic future the world has ever seen,” Trump tells his Milwaukee crowd, to big cheers.
He said that if Harris wins, the country will sink into a “1929-style depression.”",2024-11-02
Guardian,Harris and Cheney pitch Republican voters – as it happened,"Harris and Cheney blast Trump over election lies as they make pitch to Republican voters in Wisconsin
Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris held a campaign event with former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney, and Republican royalty, in the swing state – and birth of the Republican party – Wisconsin.
Cheney focused her speech on Trump’s actions on 6 January and his refusal to accept the 2020 election results.
“The most conservative of conservative values is fidelity to our constitution,” she said. “I have never voted for a Democrat, but this year I am proudly casting my vote for President Kamala Harris.”
“Vice-President Harris is standing in the breach at a critical moment in our history,” Cheney said.
Any person who would do these things can never be trusted with power again,” Cheney said. “We must defeat Trump on November 5.”
Harris, too, focused her speech on Trump, rather than her policies as the Democratic candidate. The speech was pitched as encouraging voters to cast their ballots for Harris to prevent Trump from taking power, regardless of whether they identified as Republicans.
Harris said she has never wavered from upholding her oath to the American people and democracy unlike Trump. “Donald Trump lost the 2020 election,” Harris said. “And as you have heard and know, he refused to accept the will of the people and the results of an election that was free and fair.”
The candidates spoke with large protective glass barriers on either side of them.
Liz Cheney, one of Donald Trump’s most prominent conservative critics, appealed to the millions of undecided Americans who could decide the outcome of the 2024 election, asking them to “reject the depraved cruelty” of the former president.
A former representative from Wyoming, Cheney cast the stakes in November as nothing less than the future of American democracy as she appeared alongside Kamala Harris in Ripon, Wisconsin, on Thursday, the symbolic birthplace of the modern Republican party.
The daughter of Dick Cheney, the Republican former vice-president, said she had never voted for a Democrat before, but would do so “proudly” to ensure Trump never holds a position of public trust again. Her father will join her in casting his ballot for Harris.
“I know that the most conservative of conservative values is fidelity to our constitution,” Cheney said, speaking from a podium adorned with the vice presidential seal. The crowd broke into a chant: “Thank you, Liz!” A large sign looming over them declared: “Country over Party.”
Harris praised Cheney’s “courage” for being willing to cross party lines to endorse – and campaign alongside – the Democratic nominee. During the event, a remarkable joint appearance that would have been unimaginable in the pre-Trump era, Cheney pitched Harris as a unifying leader who will safeguard American institutions.
Cheney and Harris agree on little politically – only that Trump should not be allowed to serve a second term. But their union is part of an effort by the Harris campaign to win over Republican voters who, like Cheney, believe in “limited government” and “low taxes” but are repelled by Trump and his Maga movement.
“No matter your political party, there is a place for you with us and in this campaign,” Harris said. “I take seriously my pledge to be a president for all Americans.”
Chain Bridge Bancorp, a lender popular among Republicans since its inception, priced its US initial public offering at $22 per share on Thursday to raise $40.7m, Reuters reports.
The bank sold 1.85m shares in the IPO, which valued it at about $141m. It had initially aimed for a sale of 1.85 million shares priced between $24 and $26 each.
Chain Bridge has worked with the campaign of every Republican Party presidential nominee since John McCain in 2008.
The bank, with just one branch and 84 employees, has beaten bigger financial rivals to become a must-have partner for political work.
Its fortunes are closely tied to the Republican Party. It warned in its paperwork that “any event that negatively impacts the Republican Party could lead to significant deposit outflows.”
Still, the bank’s strong credit quality might appeal to investors. While worries about bad loans have battered many industry players, Chain Bridge has had no non-performing loans in the last 12 years.
The 5 November election between Harris and Republican Trump is expected to be tight, especially in battleground states like Michigan, home to a large Muslim American population. The US continues to back Israel as it targets Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Though Emgage has endorsed Harris, other Muslim groups have urged supporters not to back her in the election, especially after Democrats rejected requests for a Palestinian speaker at the party convention in August.
Harris has offered no substantive policy differences on Israel from Biden, who stepped aside as presidential candidate in July.
Trump has said he would reinstate a “travel ban” he imposed as president restricting the entry into the United States of people from a list of largely Muslim-dominant countries. Biden rolled back the ban shortly after taking office in 2021.
“The scale of death and destruction in Gaza is staggering and devastating,” Walz said. Harris is working to ensure “the suffering in Gaza ends now, and the Palestinian people realize the right to dignity, freedom and self determination.”
The Israeli military offensive in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children.
Israel’s bombardment of Gaza and limiting of aid have caused a humanitarian crisis, displacing nearly all of its 2 million people and causing children to die from starvation.
Here is more from Tim Walz’s event with Muslim voters earlier:
Walz promised Muslim Americans an equal role in their administration should they win the election, as Democrats scramble to win back Muslim backing that has eroded over US support for Israel.
Vice-president Harris and Walz, the governor of Minnesota, are trying to woo Muslim voters furious over President Joe Biden’s administration’s staunch backing of Israel during its year-old war in Gaza against Hamas.
Harris has pledged continued support for Israel while emphasizing her push for a ceasefire, words Walz echoed on Thursday, while promising a role for Muslims.
“Vice-president Harris and I are committed that this White House … will continue to condemn in all forms anti-Islam, anti-Arab sentiments being led by Donald Trump, but more importantly, a commitment that Muslims will be engaged in this administration and serve side by side,” Walz said during an online meeting organised by Emgage Action, a Muslim American advocacy group that recently endorsed Harris.
According to the filing, Trump’s day on 6 January started at 1am, with a tweet pressuring Pence to obstruct the certification of the results. Seven hours later, at 8.17am, Trump tweeted about it again. Shortly before his speech at the Ellipse, Trump called Pence and again pressured him to “induce him to act unlawfully in the upcoming session”, where Pence would be certifying the election results. Pence refused.
At this point, according to the filing, Trump “decided to re-insert into his campaign speech at the Ellipse remarks targeting Pence for his refusal to misuse his role in the certification”.
Trump gave his speech, and at 1pm, the certification process began at the Capitol.
Trump, meanwhile, “settled in the dining room off of the Oval Office. He spent the afternoon there reviewing Twitter on his phone, while the dining room television played Fox News’ contemporaneous coverage of events at the Capitol.”
It was from the dining room that Trump watched a crowd of his supporters march towards the Capitol. He had been there less than an hour when, at “approximately 2.24pm, Fox News reported that a police officer may have been injured and that ‘protestors ... have made their way inside the Capitol.’
“At 2.24pm, Trump tweeted, writing, ‘Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our country and our constitution, giving states a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify. USA demands the truth!’”
The filing reads: “The content of the 2.24pm tweet was not a message sent to address a matter of public concern and ease unrest; it was the message of an angry candidate upon the realization that he would lose power.”
A minute later, the Secret Service evacuated Pence to a secure location.
As it seeks to make the case that Trump was acting in a private capacity, the filing looks back to election day for Trump’s use of private advisers: “As election day turned to November 4, the contest was too close to project a winner, and in discussions about what the defendant should say publicly regarding the election, senior advisors suggested that the defendant should show restraint while counting continued. Two private advisors, however, advocated a different course: [name redacted] and [name redacted] suggested that the defendant just declare victory. And at about 2.20am, the defendant gave televised remarks to a crowd of his campaign supporters in which he falsely claimed, without evidence or specificity, that there had been fraud in the election and that he had won.”
On 4 January, the filing says, a White House counsel was excluded from a meeting during which Trump sought to pressure Pence to help overturn the election result. Only a private attorney was present, the filing says: “It is hard to imagine stronger evidence” than this that Trump’s conduct was private.
In a court filing unsealed on Wednesday, federal prosecutors argue that Donald Trump is not immune from prosecution over the January 6 riots because he acted in a private capacity, and took advice from private advisers.
The indictment seeks to make this case – that Trump acted in his private capacity, rather than his official one – because of a US supreme court ruling in July that former presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution for official actions taken as president.
It also reveals further details about Trump’s alleged mood and actions (or lack of action) on the day, building on evidence that was provided in earlier briefs.
In response to the new filing, the Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung called the brief “falsehood-ridden” and “unconstitutional”. On Truth Social, Trump, writing in all-caps, called it “complete and total election interference.”
Let’s look at some key points made in the filing:
The filing alleges that Trump’s plan that day was “fundamentally a private one”, and therefore not related to his duties as president but instead as a candidate for office.
It reads: “The defendant asserts that he is immune from prosecution for his criminal scheme to overturn the 2020 presidential election because, he claims, it entailed official conduct. Not so. Although the defendant was the incumbent president during the charged conspiracies, his scheme was fundamentally a private one.
“He extensively used private actors and his campaign infrastructure to attempt to overturn the election results and operated in a private capacity as a candidate for office.”
The US ports strike that shut down shipping on the east and Gulf coasts for three days came to an end on Thursday after dock workers struck a tentative deal with port operators.
The International Longshoremen’s Association announced that the union had reached anagreement with the United States Maritime Alliance on wages,suspending their walkout until January. Work would resume immediately, the union said.
The strike – which involved 45,000 workers across 36 ports, from Texas to Maine – was the first to hit the east and Gulf coast ports of the US since 1977.
The tentative agreement is for a wage hike of about 62%, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Both sides said in a statement that they would return to the bargaining table to negotiate all outstanding issues.
The launch of a strike so soon to the election prompted scrutiny of key figures’ political views. ILA president Harold Daggett faced questions about his relationship with Donald Trump, while the Guardian uncovered social media posts by David Adam, chair and CEO of USMX, that were staunchly critical of Democrats.
More from what singer Bruce Springsteen said in his endorsement of Harris:
“Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are committed to a vision of this country that respects and includes everyone, regardless of class, religion, race, your political point of view or sexual identity.
“And they want to grow our economy in a way that benefits all, not just a few like me on top.
“That’s the vision of America I’ve been consistently writing about for 55 years.”
Springsteen joined other famous faces, including Taylor Swift, who have endorsed the Democratic nominees.
“Donald Trump is the most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime,” Springsteen continued.
“We are shortly coming upon one of the most consequential elections in our nation’s history.
“Perhaps not since the Civil War has this great country felt as politically, spiritually and emotionally divided as it does then at this moment.
“It doesn’t have to be this way. The common values, the shared stories that make us a great and united nation are waiting to be rediscovered and retold once again.
“Now that will take time, hard work, intelligence, faith, and women and men with the national good guiding their hearts.
“America is the most powerful nation on earth, not just because of her overwhelming military strength or economic power, but because of what she stands for, what she means, what she believes in.
“Freedom, social justice, equal opportunity, the right to be and love who you want. These are the things that make America great.”
Trump has promised to make Michigan the “car capital of the world again” as he told a rally in the bellwether county of Saginaw that he will bring back thousands of jobs lost when General Motors moved more than a dozen factories to Mexico.
However, the former president made similar promises to Rust belt states before he was elected in 2016, with little result.
Trump, speaking at Saginaw Valley State University campus with groups of students and union workers in Teamsters for Trump T-shirts behind him, directly addressed the huge loss of industrial jobs in Michigan, a key swing state, over the past three decades.
The speech was Trump’s 11th in the key swing state of Michigan during this election. Kamala Harris is targeting Michigan, alongside the other Rust belt states of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, as her clearest path to victory.
The state remains up for grabs, with opinion polls giving Harris a slight edge. Saginaw county is widely regarded as a bellwether of which way the election is going in Michigan.
Trump beat Hillary Clinton in the county by just 1.1% of the vote in 2016. Four years later, he lost Saginaw to Joe Biden by 303 votes.
Trump dismissed recent polls that have shown Harris leading by small margins in most of the swing states saying she got a boost after she became the candidate in July, but that is now waning.
“We’re up in every state. They had a honeymoon period,” he said.
'Our hearts are broken': Walz addresses Muslim voters during virtual event
Melissa Hellmann
Here is our report from the Walz event with Muslim voters.
“As-salaam alaikum (peace be unto you) everyone and good evening,” vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz greeted Muslim voters in Arabic during a virtual event Thursday evening. In a final push to engage Muslim voters ahead of the election, Walz joined Muslim advocacy group Emgage Action’s “Million Muslim Votes: A Way Forward” summit the day after the vice-presidential debate.
“Here in Minnesota, I’ve got the privilege to represent an incredible and vibrant Muslim community,” Walz said as light streamed through a large window behind him. He shared that he and his wife, Gwen, held the first iftar, the fast-breaking evening meal during Ramadan, at the Minnesota governor’s residence in 2019. And last year, Walz also passed interest-free down payment assistance for first-generation homebuyers to increase home ownership among Muslim Americans.
During his speech, Walz also acknowledged a collective pain among Muslim and Arab American communities due to Israel’s war on Gaza, where more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed since 7 October. “Our hearts are broken,” Walz said. “The scale of death and destruction in Gaza is staggering and devastating. Tens of thousands of innocent civilians killed, families fleeing for safety over and over again.”
“We all know on here, this war must end and it must end now. The vice-president’s working every day to ensure that, to make sure Israel is secure, the hostages are home, the suffering in Gaza ends now. And the Palestinian people realize the right to dignity, freedom, and self determination.”
The virtual event came shortly after Emgage Action endorsed Kamala Harris and Tim Walz as President and Vice-President.
Harris and Cheney blast Trump over election lies as they make pitch to Republican voters in Wisconsin
Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris held a campaign event with former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney, and Republican royalty, in the swing state – and birth of the Republican party – Wisconsin.
Cheney focused her speech on Trump’s actions on 6 January and his refusal to accept the 2020 election results.
“The most conservative of conservative values is fidelity to our constitution,” she said. “I have never voted for a Democrat, but this year I am proudly casting my vote for President Kamala Harris.”
“Vice-President Harris is standing in the breach at a critical moment in our history,” Cheney said.
Any person who would do these things can never be trusted with power again,” Cheney said. “We must defeat Trump on November 5.”
Harris, too, focused her speech on Trump, rather than her policies as the Democratic candidate. The speech was pitched as encouraging voters to cast their ballots for Harris to prevent Trump from taking power, regardless of whether they identified as Republicans.
Harris said she has never wavered from upholding her oath to the American people and democracy unlike Trump. “Donald Trump lost the 2020 election,” Harris said. “And as you have heard and know, he refused to accept the will of the people and the results of an election that was free and fair.”
The candidates spoke with large protective glass barriers on either side of them.
The Boss has chosen: US singer Bruce Springsteen has endorsed Kamala Harris for president, calling Donald Trump “the most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime”.
The 75-year-old rocker said Harris and her running mate Tim Walz have pledged a vision of the country which “respects and includes everyone”, while Mr Trump “doesn’t understand the meaning of this country”.
“His disdain for the sanctity of our constitution, the sanctity of democracy, the sanctity of the rule of law and the sanctity of the peaceful transfer of power should disqualify him from the office of president ever again,” The Boss said in a video on Instagram.
Walz added, “The Vice President’s working every day to ensure [an end to the war]. To make sure Israel secure, the hostages are home, the suffering in Gaza ends now, and the Palestinian people realize the right to dignity, freedom and self determination.”",2024-10-04
Guardian,Shock US jobs data could not have come at worse time for Kamala Harris,"With only four days to go until Tuesday’s presidential election, the poor jobs figures could not have come at a worse time for Kamala Harris.
To be sure, there were special factors that explained why the world’s biggest economy added only 12,000 new jobs in October.
Last month two severe hurricanes – Helene and Milton – hit the US. The temporary lay-offs caused by the disruption led to an estimated 20,000 to 50,000 drop in payrolled employees. Manufacturing employment fell by 46,000 – with most of the drop the result of a strike at the aerospace giant Boeing.
But that will come as little comfort to the Harris camp in a knife-edge race for the White House.
Even allowing for the hurricanes and the Boeing strike, the employment data was weak. The consensus among analysts – who knew in advance about the special factors – was for jobs growth to ease from September’s 254,000 to 113,000 in October.
Bradley Saunders, from the consultancy Capital Economics, said: “All things considered, we suspect the upper limit for the disruptions hit was around 90,000, which means stripping them out, payrolls would only have increased by an underwhelming 102,000.”
Jobs growth for August and September was revised down by a combined 112,000 across the two months. That suggests demand for labour has eased at a crucial time.
Those with long enough memories will recall something similar happening in the UK during the 1970 election, when the mood in the last few days of the campaign was affected by poor monthly trade figures.
As with the US payrolls data, there were reasons why Britain’s trade deficit suddenly widened – the arrival in the UK of two of Boeing’s new jumbo jets pushed up the value of imports.
The Conservatives seized on the data as evidence of an underperforming economy and won an election most polls had showed them on course to lose. Poor trade figures made voters question Labour’s message: that the economy was back on course after the devaluation of the pound in 1967.
Harris can now expect Donald Trump to weaponise the jobs figures in the last few days of campaigning. Despite being by far the best-performing G7 economy since the pandemic, many American voters feel worse off as a result of increases in the cost of living. Special factors or not, the weak jobs figures will do nothing to counter that impression.",2024-11-01
Guardian,Trump may become president again – but he’s already a useful idiot to the mega rich | Marina Hyde,"During his term as US president, there was an established routine to Donald Trump’s evenings in public service. When he got into bed at 6.30pm with the big cheeseburger and the bucket of Diet Coke – boudoir TVs set to “channels talking about me” – Trump liked nothing more than yakking on the phone to this billionaire or that. He whined, he bitched, he divulged, and when they finally ended the call, whichever billionaire had been on the other end of the line promptly called one of the other billionaires to laugh about it all behind his back.
“What a fucking idiot,” Rupert Murdoch once remarked after getting off a call with Trump in which Murdoch had had to explain that actually, the Silicon Valley elite did not “need” Trump’s help, as he imagined, having just enjoyed eight years where they “practically ran” the Obama administration. Obviously, Murdoch’s a notorious bitch; almost the Regina George of it all. But – also obviously – he was one of the special guys officially given “cleared caller” status in Trump’s White House, meaning they could get through to him any time. Plastics gotta plastic.
So yes – much as I am enjoying all the miles of complex in-depth coverage wondering what it is the current crop of Trump-backing billionaires want from him, I can’t help being reminded of a remark by the tech billionaire in Succession who is attempting to buy into American power and is attending a pre-election party. “I thought these people would be very complicated,” he reflects. “But they’re not. It’s basically just money and gossip.” “Oh yeah, that’s all there is,” comes the reply. “Money and gossip.”
Kamala Harris has more billionaires backing her, we keep hearing in news I think is supposed to be a matter of accomplishment for the vice-president. But the particular billionaires pulling for Trump stand on the potential threshold of huge money-and-gossip times. Among the mogul class’s truths-universally-acknowledged is the idea that money is best obtained via deregulation and tax cuts – and, in the case of, say, Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, ever-more lucrative government contracts. As for how gossip is obtained … People say showbiz is mean and gossipy, but there really is no business as mean and gossipy as “mogul”. Money does not buy you happiness but it totally buys you a better quality of gossip, with the likes of Murdoch, Bezos, Steve Wynn, Stephen Schwarzman and all the others operating at an absolute weapons-grade level.
The gossip-money continuum is sort of everything to these guys, and most of them see Trump as their useful idiot. Or useful fucking idiot, in Murdoch’s case. Consider Nelson Peltz, the infamous activist investor (who British people may know as the father-in-law of would-be hot sauce mogul Brooklyn Beckham). Three years ago, Nelson was telling everyone that Trump would carry the disgrace of the 6 January insurrection for ever. “We had people shooting at each other in Congress,” Peltz fumed. “I mean, it’s beyond belief. And how could you say that is anything but his legacy?” Oh but you could, it turns out. In fact, by early this year, Nelson could be found throwing wildly lucrative fundraisers for Trump at his home. And why not? All manner of things could be in it for him. Peltz spent a chunk of Trump’s first term covertly trying to push him to launch an antitrust investigation into Amazon on account of its effect on the US Postal Service. Trump didn’t go that far that time, but he did launch a number of aggressive tweets about it. And rest assured, meanwhile, that the Amazon founder, Bezos, will have bitched a lot on the phone about that. Everybody’s always talking about everybody, in the in-crowd.
Why would you ever want to cast yourself out of this high-rollers circle jerk by appearing to have a principle or – even worse – allowing the help at one of your most junior businesses to appear to have one? In fact, speaking of Bezos, take his insistence last week that his Washington Post forego its traditional candidate endorsement editorial, a decision which has thus far seen members of its editorial board resign and caused a reported 250,000 readers to cancel their subscriptions.
Or take Howard Lutnick, the Cantor Fitzgerald CEO, who is moonlighting as a senior official on Trump’s campaign, and who recently floated the idea that all government appointees to any pending Trump administration would have to prove “fidelity and loyalty” to him. Hey – Howard’s just saying whatever needs to be said to stay in the loopy-loop. It’s not like government workers are going to be making any of the decisions anyway.
The only billionaire who doesn’t quite fit in the gang is Elon Musk. My gut says the other billionaires are not at all sure about Musk. At the Allen & Co Sun Valley conference, that annual retreat for the point-nought-nought-nought-nought-nought per cent, you suspect none of them would like to get stuck in the barefoot yurt with Elon. He’s weird, he’s creepy (but not in the Monty Burns way they’ve all legitimised), and – this is the worst part – he comes off like he might somehow take their money. Not clear how, just … vibes. His billionaire vibes are off. I would kill to hear what they say about him in the mogul phone call circle. At the very least I expect Elon to one day make an aggressive attempt to acquire WhatsApp off Mark Zuckerberg, purely so he can read all their messages slagging him off.
In the meantime, as the election bears down on the US and the wider world, we must while away our time wondering why these extremely transactional mega-rich men back this other extremely transactional mega-rich man. It would be lovely, come Wednesday morning, not to have to put one’s finger on it.

Guardian,Indiana prosecutors claim man confessed to killing two teens on hiking trail in 2017,"Prosecutors in the trial of Richard Allen, who is accused of killing two teenage girls in Indiana, continued this week to build their case with testimony from a prison psychologist and law enforcement officials who lent credence to the allegation that Allen confessed to the murders while in prison in 2023.
Allen’s alleged admissions came after investigators struggled for years to find the person who killed Liberty “Libby” German, 14, and Abigail “Abby” Williams, 13, in 2017 on a hiking trail outside the small town of Delphi.
Due to a gag order issued by the judge in the case from almost two years ago, attorneys, law enforcement officials, and the victims’ relatives, among others, were prevented from making public comments on the case, according to the Indianapolis Star.
That meant that the public did not, until this week, learn about some of the evidence in the case. The revelations have since generated national attention because the brutal murders went unsolved for years.
In court over the last several days, a number of the witnesses spoke about Allen’s admissions to murdering Abby and Libby as well as his mental state while incarcerated.
Investigators hadn’t made much progress in finding a suspect until 2022, when a volunteer clerk found a document concerning a police interview with Allen three days after the teens disappeared. In that interview, Allen said he was on the trail the day the girls were killed.
“I thought there could be a correlation,” Kathy Shank, a retired government employee who wanted to help investigators in the case, testified last week, the Star reported.
Police, who cleared Allen after the 2017 interview, arrested him about a month after Shank’s discovery.
The Carroll county prosecutor, Nicholas McLeland, argued at the opening of the trial that Allen, who faces two counts of murder and two counts of murder while kidnapping, held a gun and forced Abby and Libby down a hill near the trail and then killed them. The next day, a search party found their bodies with their throats slit in the woods near a creek.
Allen, who worked at a CVS, then “hid in plain sight”, McLeland said.
“For five years, he lived in this community,” he told jurors. “He worked in his community.”
The defense attorney Andrew Baldwin countered that Allen was “truly innocent”; that the investigation “was messed up from the beginning”; that critical pieces of evidence were destroyed; and that Allen had not been on the trail at the same time as Abby and Libby, according to the Star.
“There is reasonable doubt in this case,” Baldwin said.
After becoming a suspect, Allen maintained his innocence for months, but then, according to people who worked at Westville correctional facility in Indiana, he started confessing in March 2023.
A correctional officer testified that Allen said he intended to rape Abby and Libby but became scared so he killed them instead, the Star reported.
Allen, who was held in solitary confinement for 13 months, had started to exhibit abnormal behavior around the time he allegedly started to confess, according to testimony from Dr Monica Wala, a prison psychologist.
In a report, Wala wrote that Allen was clapping and banging on something in his cell. The following day, she wrote that he defecated on himself and was consuming his own feces.
The doctor said that she believed that Allen was acting in a bizarre way to get a visit from his wife and a transfer to another facility. Wala also pointed out that inmates are only supposed to be in solitary confinement for 30 days and that being there for more than a year might have affected his mental health. He was frequently on suicide watch.
A state trooper also testified this week that the voice in a video that Libby recorded on her phone as she was being abducted – where a man is heard saying “Go down the hill” – matched the voice he heard in phone calls that Allen made to his family from prison. Allen repeatedly confessed to his wife during those calls, the Star reported.
“Honey, I did it. I killed Abby and Libby,” Allen said during an April 2023 call to his wife, WTHR, an NBC affiliate, reported. Kathy Allen urged him not to say that.
During a call about a month later, Allen told her: “I think I’ve lost my mind.”
In a cross-examination, the defense focused on Wala’s interest in true crime stories, which included visiting the crime scene and following Allen’s case on podcasts, YouTube and Facebook, ABC7 reported.
On Friday, the defense started to call witnesses, including Dr Deanna Dwenger, executive director of mental health services for the Indiana department of correction. She testified that she though it was “unusual” for Wala to visit a crime scene related to someone she was working with but that the trip occurred before Wala started treating Allen.
Dwenger also testified that Allen was not diagnosed with serious mental illness when he first entered the prison but became mentally ill around the time he started confessing to the murders. He also noted that the mental health staff had diagnosed Allen as “gravely disabled”, the Star reported.
A juror asked how a psychiatrist can tell if someone is feigning psychosis.
Dwenger said the clinician listens to body language and the chain of the story; if it’s organized, the person is probably faking psychosis, ABC7 reported.
If it is disorganized and out of chronological order, then it’s more likely the person is psychotic or delusional, Dwenger said.",2024-11-02
Guardian,"US adds only 12,000 jobs in October in final report before election","The US added just 12,000 jobs in October, the last snapshot of the employment market before election day, in a report heavily affected by the strike at Boeing and two recent hurricanes.
The unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.1%.
The closely watched jobs report is the last piece of economic news before next week’s election. Many polls report that the economy is the top issue for voters.
Economists had expected the temporary impacts from Hurricane Helene, Hurricane Milton and the ongoing strike by 33,000 Boeing workers in the Pacific north-west to reduce job growth numbers in October. But the number of jobs created was far lower than their estimate of 120,000 jobs for the month.
The US jobs market has been cooling after years of robust growth. October’s figure was the weakest since December 2020.
Donald Trump’s campaign seized on the weak growth figures. “This jobs report is a catastrophe and definitively reveals how badly Kamala Harris broke our economy,” the Republican presidential campaign said in a statement.
The White House’s council of economic advisers moved to downplay the poor jobs growth figures blaming the “distortionary factors” of the hurricanes and Boeing strike. The number of people not at work due to bad weather rose by 460,000 in October, it said. “When the data signal gets jammed, look to the underlying trend,” the council added in a blogpost.
In a statement, Joe Biden blamed the October reading on storm “devastation” and strikes. “Job growth is expected to rebound in November as our hurricane recovery and rebuilding efforts continue,” the US president said.
The US economy “remains strong, with 16 million jobs created since I took office”, Biden added. “There’s more work to do. We are working every day to lower costs for working families on rent, prescription drugs, health insurance, and child care.”
Job creation accelerated unexpectedly in September as the US added a revised 223,000 jobs, in the strongest month of jobs growth since March 2024. Until October the average number of jobs gained per month in 2024 has been about 200,000.
Manufacturing jobs fell by 46,000 in October, probably led by the strike at Boeing – which may end next week when workers vote on a new deal. Leisure and hospitality – usually a major source of new jobs – dropped 4,000 positions. The latest report from the labor department also shaved a combined 112,000 jobs off August and September’s hiring totals.
“It is likely that payroll employment estimates in some industries were affected by the hurricanes; however, it is not possible to quantify the net effect on the over-the-month change in national employment, hours, or earnings estimates because the establishment survey is not designed to isolate effects from extreme weather events,” the labor department reported.
The continuing strength of the jobs market has surprised some economists who expected job losses as the Federal Reserve increased interest rates to tackle inflation.
The US now seems to be heading towards a “soft landing” with interest rates falling, the rate of inflation slowing and employers still hiring.
Inflation in the US hit a three-year low in August 2024, falling to its lowest level since February 2021, with the consumer price index annual rate at 2.5% ahead of the Federal Reserve’s first cut to interest rates since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Polling, however, shows that Americans are deeply unhappy with the state of the economy and the cumulative price rises that they have experienced thanks to three years of high inflation.
And while economic indicators have shown a resilient, strong economy, Republican elected officials and Trump have sought to portray the economy negatively.
Trump has falsely claimed the US currently has “the worst economy ever”. Last month, Biden pushed back on Republican claims that the last jobs report was fake, stating, “anything the Maga Republicans don’t like, they call ‘fake’. Anything. The job numbers are what the job numbers are.”",2024-11-01
Guardian,Elon Musk’s canvassing operation sued in California for alleged labor law violations,"Elon Musk’s troubled canvassing operation on behalf of Donald Trump and the Republican party is now facing a lawsuit in southern California filed by two women who say they were cheated out of wages and expenses as they knocked on doors for an embattled Republican congresswoman.
The suit accuses Musk’s America PAC, which has poured more than $100m into this year’s election campaign, of “willful violations of the California labor code” by paying the plaintiffs less than it promised and refusing to make up the difference.
The women, Tamiko Anderson and Patricia Kelly, say they were hired last month and promised an hourly wage – about $25, according to their lead lawyer – to help turn out votes for Michelle Steel, who represents a closely contested swing district in Orange county, south of Los Angeles.
It was only once the women started working, the suit alleges, that they found out they were being paid instead by the number of houses they visited. The suit further alleges that they were not reimbursed for work-related expenses, including the use of personal cellphones to track their movements along their designated routes.
Musk’s ground-game operation has come under repeated scrutiny in recent days following a report in the Guardian that canvassers may have skipped as many as a quarter of the houses they claimed to have visited in Arizona and Nevada, and a second report in Wired that revealed hired canvassers in Michigan were not told which campaign they were working for until they had already signed on.
The Orange county lawsuit, also first reported by Wired, did not specify how much less the women had earned than they were expecting, or how much they had unsuccessfully claimed in expenses. The lead plaintiff’s lawyer, Larry Lee, said that they did not have a signed contract for their work, only a “sheet of paper” detailing the hourly wage they should expect.
These, however, were not reasons to consider the suit some kind of political stunt days before the 5 November election, according to a prominent national labor lawyer, Ryan Hancock of Willig, Williams and Davidson in Philadelphia. He said it was common for such suits to be light on details when first filed, and amended and fleshed out later. “This appears to be a legitimate lawsuit based on an employer failing to pay compensation owed under state and federal law,” Hancock said.
Musk’s Pac is one of several named defendants in the suit, along with a hiring and payroll company, Liberty Staffing Services; a national canvassing company, the Blair Group; and Representative Michelle Steel’s re-election campaign.
The campaign, however, was quick to disavow any association with the canvassing operation. “The Steel campaign has no knowledge of these individuals,” a spokesperson said. “They did not and do not work for the Steel campaign.”
Pac like Musk’s usually operate independently of candidates’ campaigns, under rules that make it illegal to coordinate activities. When asked why he had named Steel’s campaign among the defendants, Lee, the plaintiff’s lawyer, said: “I’m not going to comment.”",2024-11-02
Guardian,"When is the 2024 US election, what time do polls close and when will we know the results? An armchair guide for Australia","The 2024 US election is shaping up to be one of the closest races in living memory, with much of the world, including Australia, watching with great anticipation. In fact, since the emergence of Donald Trump as a presidential force, it can sometimes feel as though US politics gets as much media coverage in Australia as our own leaders.
This means the 2024 election is easy to follow, with live TV and rolling online news coverage. There will also be in-person election watch parties across Australia.
Here’s everything you need to know the election if you’re in Australia.
When is the US election in Australian time?
The presidential election will be held on Tuesday 5 November in the US, which means most of the action will occur on Wednesday 6 November in Australia.
What time and date will it be in Australia when polls close?
Polls begin to close in eastern states from 6pm US Eastern Time on Tuesday. In Australia, this will be on Wednesday – from 10am Australian Eastern Daylight Time, 9am in Queensland, 9.30am in South Australia and 7am in Western Australia.
By 8pm US ET, polls will have fully closed in more than 20 states, including the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania. In Australia it will be Wednesday noon AEDT, 11am in Queensland, 11.30am in SA and 9am in WA.
Polls will close in Michigan and Wisconsin – two other crucial states – by 9pm US ET, which in Australia will be Wednesday 1pm AEDT, 12pm in Queensland, 12.30pm in SA and 10am in WA.
Hawaii and Alaska, the western-most states, will close their polls at 12am US ET, which in Australia will be Wednesday 4pm AEDT, 3pm in Queensland, 3.30pm in SA and 1pm in WA.
When will the election results be announced?
We should have a good sense of who will probably be president by the time polls close in Hawaii and Alaska, which is several hours after vote counting in some key eastern states will have begun.
The world may have to wait a bit longer to hear a final call, especially given how tightly contested some polling has indicated the vote will be.
In 2020 the Associated Press did not declare Joe Biden as the winner of the presidential election until 7 November at 11.26am US ET – four days after the first polls closed. And in 2016 it took until 2.29am US ET the morning after election day to declare Trump the winner.
If a winner is to be declared in a similar timeframe to 2016, that would fall around Wednesday evening in Australia, about 7PM AEDT, 6pm in Queensland, 6.30pm in SA and 4pm in WA.
What TV channels in Australia will have live coverage?
All free-to-air TV stations will have rolling coverage. The ABC, Channel 10, Nine and SBS’s coverage all begins at or shortly after 10am AEDT on Wednesday. Channel Seven’s coverage will begin at 11.30am.
The SBS broadcast will include coverage from the US outlet PBS.
Coverage will continue throughout the day, with Australian channels breaking for local news bulletins and evening programs at different points.
What about online news coverage?
The Guardian has you sorted, with our extensive bureaux across the US as well as newsrooms around the world.
We will be running a live blog covering the election throughout the day, in addition to our continued extensive US election coverage, which will include a live results tracker.

Guardian,Man upset by Chinese spy balloon found guilty of threatening Kevin McCarthy,"A Montana man was convicted on Wednesday of threatening to assault the former House speaker Kevin McCarthy after becoming upset that the government had not shot down a Chinese spy balloon that floated over his home city.
Richard Rogers, 45, of Billings, delivered the threat to a McCarthy staffer during a series of more than 100 calls to the Republican speaker’s office in just 75 minutes on 3 February 2023, prosecutors said. That was one day after the Pentagon acknowledged it was tracking the spy balloon, which was later shot down off the Atlantic coast.
The 12-person federal jury also found Rogers guilty on two counts of making harassing telephone calls: the ones to McCarthy’s office plus 150 calls he made to an FBI tip line in 2021 and 2022.
Rogers routinely made vulgar and obscene comments in those calls.
Sentencing was set for 31 January. He faces up to six years in prison and a $250,000 fine for threatening to harm a member of Congress, and a maximum penalty of two years and a $250,000 fine on the harassment counts.
The US district judge Susan Watters allowed Rogers to remain free of custody pending sentencing.
Threats against public officials in the US have risen sharply in recent years, including against members of Congress and their spouses, election workers and local elected officials. Rogers’ case was among more than 8,000 threats to lawmakers investigated by the US Capitol police in 2023, and officials expect another surge with the 2024 election.
During a three-day trial, Rogers testified that his outraged calls to the FBI and McCarthy’s office were a form of “civil disobedience”.
He and his attorneys argued that using obscenities with FBI operators and congressional staff was protected as free speech under the first amendment, which establishes the right “to petition the government for a redress of grievances”.
But prosecutors said Rogers crossed the line with a threat on McCarthy’s life and by hurling abusive and sexual verbal tirades against the lawmaker’s staffers and FBI operators.
In the dozens of calls that were played for jurors, Rogers was heard asking for investigations of various alleged conspiracies involving the FBI and the administration of Joe Biden. He was polite at times, but would quickly become angry and shout obscenities until the calls were disconnected.
“You can’t talk to people that way. It’s common sense,” the assistant US attorney Thomas Godfrey said. “He’s calling not out of political protest; he’s calling because he gets enjoyment out of it.”
The prosecutor told the jury there was no exception in federal law that says government employees can be subjected to harassment.
“‘Petitioning the government’ – baloney,” Godfrey said. “Kevin McCarthy was the speaker of the House. It’s not his job to shoot down spy balloons.”
Rogers, a former telephone customer service representative, testified that he took care to “edit” his comments on the phone to avoid any threats because he did not want to go to prison.
He added that he never tried hide his actions and frequently offered his name and phone number when calling the FBI.
“They were disrespectful to me, so I was disrespectful to them,” Rogers said.
The defense attorney Ed Werner said Rogers “just wanted to be heard”.
Following the guilty verdict, Rogers repeated his contention that he never threatened anyone. He also said he was dissatisfied with his defense attorneys for not adequately presenting his case.
Rogers wore shirts depicting Captain America and other superheroes throughout the trial, including one on Wednesday with the letters “Maga” on the front, a reference to Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. A supporter of the former president, he said he was in Washington DC during the 6 January 2021 attack on the Capitol.
Godfrey said the case was not about politics but rather illegal harassment.
Earlier this year, a 30-year-old Billings man was sentenced to two and a half years in federal prison after leaving voicemail messages threatening to kill the Montana Democratic senator Jon Tester and his family. Another Montana man, from Kalispell, was sentenced to two and a half years in prison last year, also for making threats against Tester.",2024-10-03
Guardian,Kamala Harris will be a president for the labor movement – and for working women | Liz Shuler,"The 6.6 million union women in this country – nearly half of today’s labor movement – know an ally when we see one. We know we have one in Kamala Harris.
As president of the AFL-CIO, representing 60 unions across the United States in every sector of the economy, I’ve crisscrossed the country seeing our union members get out the vote for Harris in this election. So many of us – whether we’re retail workers, caregivers, teachers, nurses, construction workers or in any line of work – see in Vice-President Harris’s story something that mirrors our own.
When I joined my union, the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, in Portland, Oregon, I got used to being the only woman in a room full of mostly men. We organized new members, fought against corporate greed and achieved some hard-won gains at the statehouse, which put me on the path to leadership in the labor movement and to becoming the youngest-ever member of the AFL-CIO executive council.
That’s when I crossed paths with Richard Trumka, a true labor legend. In 2009, when he decided to run for president of the AFL-CIO, Rich asked me to join his ticket as secretary-treasurer. Trumka was brilliant, forward-thinking and committed to making way for a new generation of labor leaders. He commanded respect as a Pittsburgh mine worker turned president of the United Mine Workers of America, with labor deep in his bones.
Then, in August 2021, I got a phone call that changed everything. Rich had suffered a heart attack on a camping trip. He passed away suddenly – and my world was shaken. At the same time as I grieved the loss of Rich, I had to unexpectedly prepare to then lead the labor movement.
One of the first people to reach out was Harris. She expressed her condolences, full of the same empathy and compassion that the whole country has now seen in her campaign. We talked about our common bond as women who had come up in male-dominated fields and what it means to her to be able to fight for working women as vice-president.
Three years later, when she found herself in a similar moment that required her to step up, she did so admirably. It wasn’t her plan, but it’s what her love for this country required. Duty called, and Harris answered – and when I spoke to the vice- president again that day, I told her we’d be there for her every step of the way.
She will lead an administration that honors with action the countless contributions of working women, just as she has for her entire career. As attorney general in California, she protected the jobs of nurses across the state and won back millions of dollars for women and workers who had been illegally underpaid by greedy companies. As a senator, she stood with fast-food workers by walking the picket line in our fight for a $15 minimum wage, and fought to end “right to work” laws.
And for the past three-plus years, the vice-president has been a critical part of this historic pro-worker administration – passing massive legislation to create millions of union jobs and protecting millions of workers’ pensions. And when we elect her as president, Harris has outlined her bold vision to finally give care economy workers the pay and protections they deserve, while also lowering prices for all working families.
That’s a stark contrast to the Project 2025 agenda of Donald Trump and JD Vance. They fundamentally disrespect women and devalue what we bring to the table. The men on the Republican ticket call us “childless cat ladies” because name-calling is all they can do in response to the electoral power we wield. They have no plan to support working women and our families – their only aim is to claw back the rights we’ve earned. We know that a second Trump term will bring the destruction of unions and contracts, the end of our rights in the workplace and control over our own bodies. From rolling back women’s economic opportunity to robbing us of reproductive freedom, the Trump–Vance platform would undo a century of progress.
Because so much is at stake for women and all workers, I proudly worked with the affiliated union leaders of the AFL-CIO to present a unanimous endorsement from our federation for Harris, just 24 hours after she announced her candidacy.
The AFL-CIO includes 60 unions of nearly 13 million workers in every sector of the economy – which also makes us the largest working women’s organization in the country. In these past months, I’ve been traveling the country and talking with them directly. I can assure you: we are ready to meet this moment. Our polling shows union women’s support for Harris – a margin of 32 points over support for Trump – is nearly three times the support of women overall.
When you smash through a glass ceiling, you’re bound to suffer some wounds. Donald Trump shows his misogyny every day, but the vice-president dismisses these attacks as what we have all come to expect from him – and her focus is locked on our future. Kamala Harris is in the business of uplifting working women. In contrast, a second Trump term would mean catastrophe for the precious liberties that our foremothers have pried from the hands of men just like him.
When working people need Harris’s help, she always answers the call. And working women have her back to make sure she continues to deliver the policies and support we need to create a just and equal society for women across the country.

Guardian,Marjorie Taylor Greene condemned over Helene weather conspiracy theory,"Far-right congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene is facing condemnation following several conspiratorial comments amid the devastation of Hurricane Helene that seemed to suggest she believed the US government can control the weather.
In a post last week shared with her 1.2 million X followers, the US House representative from Georgia wrote: “Yes they can control the weather. It’s ridiculous for anyone to lie and say it can’t be done.”
Greene does not specify to whom “they” is referring, but she has a history of promoting conspiracy theories around the federal government and other groups.
She appeared to double down on these comments with a post on Saturday, sharing a clip from a 2013 CBS News broadcast about experimental efforts to induce rain and lightning using lasers. “CBS, nine years ago, talked about lasers controlling the weather,” Greene wrote, apparently mistaking the year of the broadcast.
Greene, who is no stranger to misinformation including once raising the idea of Jewish space lasers being behind wildfire outbreaks, was met with a wave of criticism for her blatantly false statements.
The US government’s top disaster relief official condemned on Sunday false claims made about Helene and its relief efforts, stating that such conspiracy theories, including those made by Donald Trump as he seeks a second presidency, are causing fear in people who need assistance and “demoralizing” the workers who are providing assistance.
“It’s frankly ridiculous, and just plain false. This kind of rhetoric is not helpful to people,” said Deanne Criswell, who leads the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “It’s really a shame that we’re putting politics ahead of helping people, and that’s what we’re here to do.”
Shawn Harris, who is running for Greene’s congressional seat, condemned the incumbent’s comments.
“Marjorie Taylor Greene’s conspiracy theories are sickening, but she does it to distract from her failed effort to block crucial funding for Fema as Hurricane Helene was making landfall,” Harris wrote in a post on X.
Ryan Maue, a meteorologist and popular internet personality, seemed to poke fun at Greene’s comments while also factchecking her false claims.
He suggested on X that some conspiracy theories turn out to be true – but added: “I can assure you that the Hurricane Helene weather modification theory is not one of them.
“I would know, too.”
In an email to his supporters, the Republican US senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina also seemed to condemn conspiracy theories about Hurricane Helene, though he did not specify the rightwing source of the theories.
“The destruction caused by Helene is incomprehensible and has left many communities in western North Carolina absolutely devastated. The last thing that the victims of Helene need right now is political posturing, finger-pointing, or conspiracy theories that only hurt the response effort,” the email stated.
In an opinion piece on Saturday by its editorial board, North Carolina’s Charlotte Observer criticized Trump because of his falsehoods over the government response to Helene, saying the state’s affected parts were “not a political football” and “not a campaign opportunity”.
Criticism of Greene’s conspiracy theories even made it to the sports world, with the tennis legend Martina Navratilova using her platform to call out not only Greene as well as Trump’s running mate in November’s election, JD Vance. Vance had praised Greene at a rally just hours after she posted her conspiracies.
“Marj is even more stupid than we thought possible,” Navratilova wrote on X. “And Vance is not stupid – he is just a cowardly sycophant. Which is actually worse.”
Greene is also facing criticism for her hypocrisy of peddling conspiracy theories about Hurricane Helene while she was photographed in attendance at the University of Alabama’s home football game against the University of Georgia with Trump on 28 September. She reportedly left her state of Georgia to attend the game in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, while Helene devastated communities across the state she was elected to represent.",2024-10-07
Guardian,US Republican sparks outrage for racist post attacking Haitian immigrants,"A Republican congressman provoked a hail of outrage after posting a racist attack on Haitian immigrants on social media, which he subsequently deleted amid calls for him to be censured.
Clay Higgins used his congressional X account to repeat debunked accusations – spread by Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee – about Haitians eating pets and broadened the attack to call them “thugs” and brand Haiti as “the nastiest country in the Western hemisphere”.
“These Haitians are wild. Eating pets, vudu, nastiest country in the western hemisphere, cults, slapstick gangsters,” the Louisiana representative posted, purportedly in response to a legal action filed against Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, by a non-profit group representing Haitians in Springfield, Ohio.
“But damned if they don’t feel all sophisticated now, filing charges against our President and VP. All these thugs better get their mind right and their ass out of our country before January 20th.”
The vitriolic post followed a pledge by Trump – who has doubled down on his baseless pet-eating allegations, which he first voiced at this month’s debate with Kamala Harris – to get Haitians “the hell out of Springfield”, even though most members of the community in the city are in the US legally.
It drew widespread condemnation from House Democrats, with the party’s Congressional Black caucus tabling a motion to censure Higgins.
“Rep. Clay Higgins’ vile & hateful remarks abt Haitians are unacceptable. Today, it is Haitians, but who will it be tomorrow?” the caucus posted on its X account.
Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic House minority leader, called Higgins’s post “disgusting … vile, racist and beneath the dignity of the United States House of Representatives.
Higgins was “an election-denying, conspiracy-peddling racial arsonist who is a disgrace to the people’s House” who “must be held accountable for dishonorable conduct that is unbecoming to a member of Congress”, Jeffries wrote.
Higgins deleted the post after being approached by Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker and a fellow Louisianian. But the congressman did not apologise and later told CNN that he stood by it.
Johnson – who has appointed Higgins to a taskforce investigating attempts to assassinate Trump – told journalists that after speaking with him, Higgins “prayed about it and he regretted it and he pulled the post down.
“That’s what you want the gentleman to do,” Johnson added.
The GOP House majority leader, Steve Scalise, rejected the censure motion, arguing it was unnecessary because the post had been deleted.
A former captain in a Louisiana sheriff’s office, Higgins was forced to resign in 2016 after he described members of a predominantly Black gang as “animals” in a video that went viral. He won his House seat months later.
A Washington Post report at the time called him a “God-fearing man of the law with a deep southern drawl” whose no-nonsense, tough-talking approach had earned him folk-hero status.",2024-09-26

Guardian,"Perry Baker might be the best American rugby player of all time – right now, he just needs a job","Perry Baker is a three-time Olympian and two-time World Rugby Men’s Sevens Player of the Year, second for all-time tries scored on the sevens circuit. He has a live claim to be not just the greatest American sevens player of all time but one of the greatest rugby players of all time – from any country, in any form of the game.
Right now, though, he just needs a full-time job.
“I’m enjoying retirement a lot,” Baker says, not long after confirming his decision to stop playing at 38. “Being around the kids more, being at home more.”
Baker has three sons, aged two to 20. His two-year-old buzzes around as we speak.
“But I’m also enjoying the role of trying to be an assistant coach … it’s a time to give back, to shape the next generation.”
Baker is assisting Simon Amor, the new USA men’s sevens coach, at the Olympic training center at Chula Vista near San Diego. But “it’s just until January. I’m praying to God that I can land something that’s permanent.”
It seems remarkable that such a talent – tall and rangy like the wide receiver he was, briefly signed by the Philadelphia Eagles, fast as the wind, trickier than Bill McLaren’s proverbial bag of weasels – should be left looking for work. But in the US, where rugby’s roots are shallow and coaching and media gigs few, so it often goes.
Baker thought about playing on, for at least another year on the sevens circuit. But the end of the Olympic cycle brought changes – Amor replacing another Englishman, Mike Friday, as coach, players changing too – and Baker could “see it’s just time to move on. Just knowing your time is over.
“I enjoy playing, and I will still play sevens at some point, but on an international level, doing that day in day out, and traveling, it just came to be a lot on the body. Now I think I’m ready to transition for something else and find happiness somewhere else. I thought about playing 15s. Like, if things don’t go as well as I want being an assistant coach at the national level, then I’ll definitely consider pursuing the MLR.”
Major League Rugby, the US professional men’s 15s competition, will play its eighth season next year. The league is experiencing its usual ferment – the Dallas Jackals will not compete in 2025 – but Baker would bring serious star power.
“I know that my age is a factor for a lot of people,” he says, “but I’m not old on playing rugby body-wise.”
Baker found rugby young, in Florida with the imperishably named Daytona Beach Coconuts, but only took to it full-time at 27, in 2013 with Tiger Rugby in Ohio. He was soon a USA regular and though a decade on the sevens world circuit would test anyone physically, Baker is a wing, not a forward constantly taking and dealing hits, and he hasn’t done too badly for injuries. Tom Brady won a seventh Super Bowl at 43. Aaron Rodgers is seeking a second at 40. Baker could surely shine in MLR.
“It’s an IQ issue for me. I’m smart enough, I know how to play the game, understand the game, I read the field different, I’m still athletic enough to play, I can still jump, I can still definitely run and do those good things. So I definitely wouldn’t mind to go to 15s for a little while, just to have that under my belt as well, and maybe even help bring exposure on that end too. Because being on a national level, playing sevens for so long, I think I have a fanbase.”
He does. He continues to light up the internet, particularly with what World Rugby called “a try from the gods”, a 100-meter special against Fiji in Las Vegas in 2018, a flurry of steps and swerves to beat four men in no space before a racehorse dash for the line.
Baker’s Eagles won that tournament, beating Samoa, Australia, Spain, England, Fiji and Argentina. They won other titles too but when it came to the Olympics, Rio 2016, Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024, they fell short each time.
Olympic glory wasn’t always the plan. As Baker says, that “was to finish college [Fairmont State, in West Virginia], go to the NFL, and play in the NFL for like eight to 10 years, and then be retired by the time I’m 32 years old.” A knee injury, detected after he signed for Philadelphia, scotched that. There were a couple of seasons of arena football, then Baker switched to rugby. “So it’s like, OK, now I go to the Olympic Games. I’ll be 28, I’ll play for a couple years, do a World Cup [Sevens], I’ll be done by the time I’m 32. Didn’t work that way either.”
Asked about high points of his sevens career, Baker offers a hymn to squad spirit.
“Stuff with the boys, that’s what I miss the most, to be honest. The good times with the boys. I was with those guys so much and it’s like, now everyone’s just gone, doing their own thing. People are married now. People have kids now. You talk about it so much, but you don’t realize until you’re not in it anymore. Watching this new group that’s in, it’s like, man … ”
Asked for low points, Baker goes to a similarly wistful place. And keeps going.
“It’s just not doing what we set out to do – not finishing the job at the Olympic Games. The first one [Rio] was like the unknown kind of deal. Tokyo was the one that we knew we could win, and we didn’t get the job done. And then I was the same on the last one, [in Paris] for sure, but the medal wasn’t for me.
“At the end of the day, I felt like I’ve let so many people down who supported me over these 10 years. And why I say that is, like, I have nothing for them, nothing for those people whose support has been behind us, who believed in us. I played this thing for 10 years. My wife sacrificed so much for 10 years for me, and I just wanted to let her hold up a freaking medal from the Olympic Games. To have my kids brag about it. Like, my two-year-old, I don’t even know if they still do show and tell at school, but it’d be something cool he could take. To give to my family, my parents, the supporters, my mate who introduced me to rugby, let him put the medal around his neck and hold it, just to see their reactions.
“That’s why this last one, I wanted it the most … Oh, man. It’s just … I don’t know. Like, something I feel I will never get over. When you look at sports, you’ll always have highs and lows. But I feel the Olympics is the pinnacle of it all, and that was the main reason why I chose to come play rugby, was to be an Olympian, was to chase a gold medal, and to do it three times is not easy.”
Baker chased a dream, and missed. It’s a stark contrast to the sheer joy of the USA women’s team after they won bronze in Paris with a last-second defeat of Australia. As Baker speaks, Ilona Maher, the women’s star player, is shining on Dancing with the Stars on ABC, Olympic success stoking internet fame. Baker salutes the women’s achievement … and watches, wistful for what might have been.
If the women’s success is not to be a blip, if American rugby is to flourish before hosting 15s World Cups in 2031 (men) and 2033 (women), there is work to do. Players must be found and funneled into the national teams, as Baker was himself.
To that end, Baker has partnered with Dallen Stanford, a sevens Eagle turned commentator, and Steve Lewis, a mainstay of the sevens game based in New York, to launch FlagX: a US iteration of a touch rugby organization born in Australia that provides competition for men and women, emphasizing attacking skills and fitness, the better to boost tackle teams in sevens and 15s all the way to national level.
Baker has already run Perry Baker Rugby Camps, “because I want to introduce rugby and get rugby to grow. If you think about rugby in America, one of the biggest things is our skill level, our rugby IQ level, is so low. You can watch a million videos and start to process it but you are not practicing skills at all, and so we’re always behind the top 10 nations. So with [FlagX] we’re going to take a step further. It’s a way of introducing a sport to newcomers who are afraid of the contact. So you get rid of the contact, you have flags, and then you’re still implementing the skill levels. But not only that, now it can be a fundraising tool. You’re raising money, and it’s staying in the club, so now your club can be sustainable.”
The idea is to make FlagX “kinda like CrossFit” – a franchise model, clubs posting scores and competing virtually, a community committed to its game as well as having fun and keeping in shape. The effort will keep Baker busy. But as he says more than once, he’s still trying to figure out precisely what the rest of his working life will hold.
“Heck, I’m all over the place. I’m trying to laugh. My main thing I want to do is be an assistant coach and also do my FlagX rugby. Those are my two things I really want to do.” But he also harbors a vivid dream of a complete career switch – to law enforcement.
Years ago, Baker interned with the New York Police Department. Now he says: “I don’t want to be a police officer. What I want to do? I want to become a homicide detective. I don’t know, I feel like my calling is about helping others. If you can and you’re in a position to help others, that’s life.
“So for me, being a homicide detective is about solving cases, giving people closure and things like that, just trying to bring some type of peace to a family. Because I remember being a kid and one of my best friends [Dimitric Moore] was murdered. The case was never solved, but I just remember the detective being so close to my grandma, being there for us, my little close group of friends. He was so cool, and it was just a little bit of peace. He brought happiness around. He almost became like family to us. And I just feel like that’s me, where I am with my life, where I’ve always wanted to be was just helping others, giving back.
“Rugby changed my life. I can’t tell you. I never thought I would be in freaking Hong Kong. I’d be in China. I’ve been in Japan. I never thought of being able to do that without rugby. My mom used to be like, ‘Why you don’t send pictures?’ I said, ‘You know why, mom? Because I want you to experience it for yourself.’ My mom has been over there now. She’s been to Hong Kong, you know. My mom came to a few stops. That’s what I wanted her to experience for herself.
“I’m forever grateful to rugby. I want to give that back to other kids. Man, rugby is such a cool sport. The values that rugby offers, just being able to play and throw this footy around and have fun and enjoyment? Like, dope, man. I love it.”
Alas, for now, it’s over. So is our time. Laughing, Baker says: “Put a PS message in there too. Tell them I need a six-figure job.”",2024-11-02

Guardian,US politics live: ‘improbably tight’ polls questioned by experts as Trump reportedly grows anxious in final days of race,"Are the polls 'improbably tight'? Some experts think so
Robert Tait
The US presidential election campaign enters its final weekend with polls showing Donald Trump and Kamala Harris in seemingly permanent deadlock and few clues as to which of them will prevail on Tuesday.
At the end of another unruly week that began with Trump’s racially charged rally in New York’s Madison Square Garden and was punctuated by celebrity endorsements, misogynistic comments and insults about “garbage” being levelled left and right, the Guardian’s 10-day polling average tracker showed little change from seven days earlier, with voter loyalty to their chosen candidate appearing relatively impervious to campaign events, however seismic.
Nationally, Harris, the Democratic nominee, has a one-point advantage, 48% to 47%, over her Republican opponent, virtually identical to last week. Such an advantage is well with the margin of error of most polls.
The battleground states, too, remain in a dead heat. The candidates are evenly tied at 48% in Pennsylvania, often seen as the most important swing state because it has the most electoral votes (19). Harris has single-point leads in the two other blue-wall states, Michigan and Wisconsin, while Trump is marginally ahead in the Sun belt: up by 1% in North Carolina and 2% in Georgia and Arizona. In Nevada, his average advantage in the polls is less than a percentage point.
Writing on NBC’s website, Josh Clinton, a politics professor at Vanderbilt University, and John Lapinski, the network’s director of elections, pondered whether the tied race reflected not the sentiments of the voters, but rather risk-averse decision-making by pollsters. Some, they suggested, may be wary of findings indicating unusually large leads for one candidate and introduce corrective weighting.
Of the last 321 polls in the battlegrounds, 124 – nearly 40% – showed margins of a single point or less, the pair wrote. Pennsylvania was the most “troubling” case, with 20 out of 59 polls showing an exact tie, while another 26 showed margins of less than 1%.
This indicated “not just an astonishingly tight race, but also an improbably tight race”, according to Clinton and Lapinski.
Trump addresses North Carolina as Harris prepares to take stage in Atlanta
Director Spike Lee and senator Jon Ossoff have begun speaking at Kamala Harris’s rally in Atlanta, as Donald Trump addresses supporters at a rally in Gastonia, North Carolina .
Tapping into current fears that there will be voter suppression in this election, Ossoff told attendees in Atlanta, ""[Trump] tried to throw out your votes. You all remember the phone call.”
“You know what has been given for the struggle for voting rights in the state of Georgia, and across the American South,” Ossoff added.
Meanwhile, Trump is speaking about the support he’s received from customs and border patrol agents (saying agents have told him “he’s the greatest president in the history of our country”), the economy and the election (“We’re just three days away from the greatest political victory in world history”).
JD Vance is expected to begin speaking soon in Las Vegas, Nevada and Joe Biden will be addressing a carpenters union in his hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania.
The Harris campaign has released a new closing ad titled “Brighter Future” that will air tomorrow afternoon during NFL games on CBS and Fox. In the two-minute ad, Harris pledges to be “a president for all Americans” and promises to “build a brighter future for our nation” as her campaign seeks to draw out the differences between the vice-president and her opponent in the final days of the election cycle.
Michigan congresswoman Rashida Tlaib declined to endorse Kamala Harris at a United Auto Workers union rally yesterday. The only Palestinian American in Congress, Tlaib has criticized the Biden-Harris administration’s handling of the war in Gaza. Her non-endorsement comes as a voter survey published on Friday suggested that 43% of Muslim American voters support the Green party candidate, Jill Stein.
As election day approaches, state and federal officials are preparing for social unrest and political upheaval that could suppress votes. Yesterday, the justice department announced it will send election monitors to 86 jurisdictions, the most in two decades. Meanwhile, Washington state governor Jay Inslee announced that the state will put national guard members on standby this week to support law enforcement and protect key infrastructure in the event of social unrest. The Washington state announcement comes just days after someone set fire to a ballot drop box there and in neighboring Portland, Oregon, damaging hundreds of ballots.
Trump campaign struggled to balance chaos and discipline - report
A deep dive inside Donald Trump’s campaign published today in the Atlantic shows how the ex-president has struggled to balance his chaotic tendencies with running a disciplined campaign. The report notes that after Kamala Harris replaced Joe Biden on the Democratic ticket, Trump’s advisers encouraged him to stick to planned criticism of the Biden-Harris administration while the ex-president instead longed to attack Harris personally. As a result, Trump began communicating with two of his 2016 campaign managers, Kellyanne Conway and Corey Lewandowski, citing fears that he was being overly “managed” by his current advisors.
The report includes two other notable asides: Trump wanted to start calling the current president “Retarded Joe Biden” but was dissuaded by current aides, and broke ties with far-right activist Laura Loomer when he learned she’d had significant plastic surgery.
Donald Trump’s campaign has filed a complaint against the Washington Post with the Federal Election Commission, alleging that the paper made illegal in-kind contributions to the Harris-Walz campaign through its advertising, the Post reports.
A copy of the complaint released by the Trump campaign cites a Semafor article that suggests the Post purchased ads to increase readership of articles it had published that were critical of the ex-president – after the newspaper’s announcement that it would not endorse a candidate sparked backlash and a wave of unsubscriptions.
In the complaint, the Trump campaign calls the advertising a “dark money corporate campaign in opposition to President Donald Trump”. In response, a Washington Post spokesperson said the allegations were “without merit” and that “promoted posts across social media platforms reflect high-performing content across all verticals and subjects”.
A rally for Kamala Harris is filling Atlanta Civic Center on Saturday, “three days before we remind the world that the south has something to say”, said US representative Nikema Williams, quoting the iconic Atlanta hip-hop group OutKast.
“This election is too important to sit out,” she said. “This is battleground Georgia.”
Just over 4 million Georgia voters have already cast a ballot, about 80% of the 2020 figure and 55.3% of registered voters in the state, according to the Georgia secretary of state’s office. Fulton and DeKalb counties, the two counties with the largest number of Democratic voters in Georgia, are slightly ahead of state averages for early turnout, but the election remains too close to call judging by early voting turnout. Errors in polling models are likely to be larger than the ultimate margin.
Harris is expected to appear at 1pm. Donald Trump today announced a rally in Macon for Sunday.
Morehouse College graduate Spike Lee and recording artist Pastor Troy opened the rally, with Troy performing Vice Versa.
A record number of wealthy Americans are planning to leave the country as election day approaches, NBC News reports, citing fears that the election could spur political and social unrest regardless of its outcome.
Immigration attorneys at high-powered firms such as Lesperance and Associates and Henley & Partners told NBC that they’re seeing greater demand for services regarding possible moves overseas than ever before.
“A survey by Arton Capital, which advises the wealthy on immigration programs, found that 53% of American millionaires say they’re more likely to leave the US after the election, no matter who wins,” the outlet added.
President Biden is set to land in Scranton, the city where he was born, for a visit shortly and I spotted this truck parked on Biden street downtown.
Scranton is a key piece in Democratic hopes to win Pennsylvania, a key battleground state this election. Hillary Clinton lost tremendous ground here in 2016 when she lost the state, but Joe Biden improved on that in 2020. Democrats are hoping to build even further on those gain this year, or at least not lose ground.
In the final days before the 2024 election, Donald Trump is growing increasingly anxious, Axios reports. Although the former president’s campaign is projecting confidence, a campaign official close to Trump tells Axios that the ex-president is asking more questions about polling and demanding more work from his aides in late-night and early morning calls.
Before heading to North Carolina today, Kamala Harris will rally voters in Atlanta alongside director Spike Lee, rapper Monica and singer Victoria Monét. The vice-president will also be joined by senators Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, and will be introduced by a first-time voter, according to the campaign.
Then Harris will head to Charlotte, North Carolina – a state that both she and Donald Trump are visiting today. It’s the fourth day in a row that both candidates will appear in the same state on the same day, as they attempt to swing through the most important battleground states one last time before Tuesday.
At Harris’s rally in Charlotte, her campaign says, Harris will be joined by actor Kerry Washington and again introduced by a first-time voter. The event will also feature performances by Brittney Spencer, Jon Bon Jovi, Khalid and the War and Treaty.",2024-11-02

Guardian,Ex-aide to George W Bush calls on former president to endorse Kamala Harris,"A former top aide has called on George W Bush to endorse Kamala Harris, becoming the latest of his circle to up the pressure on the ex-president to make a public stand and join a long list of Republicans now backing the Democratic candidate.
Nicolle Wallace, who served as the communications director in the Bush White House, called on the former president to have a “change of heart” and take a position against Donald Trump.
Wallace told MSNBC that Trump’s threatening language about Harris-supporting Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney – the daughter of Bush’s vice-president, Dick Cheney – had informed her appeal.
“These are the comments we’re talking about right now in the United States of America from someone running to hold the job he had,” Wallace told the outlet.
Trump last week suggested that Cheney would not be a “radical war hawk” if she was on a battlefield “with nine barrels shooting at her” and had guns “trained on her face”.
Democrats claimed Trump’s words amounted to a personal threat. The Harris campaign denounced Trump’s words as “violent rhetoric”. “This is how dictators destroy free nations,” the former Wyoming congresswoman responded.
The Trump campaign rejected the criticism, calling Cheney a warmonger and that they were making a point abut her hawkish foreign policy views.
But Bush has indicated he does not plan to take a position on the election, despite other members of his circle choosing to back Harris. Cheney’s father has come out for Harris. “In our nation’s 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,” Dick Cheney said in a statement. “He can never be trusted with power again.”
Bush’s daughter Barbara Pierce Bush has also said she was backing Harris and, according to the Harris campaign, has been stumping for the Democrat in Bucks county, Pennsylvania, a must-win area north of Philadelphia.
Wallace said she still hoped that the former president could be prevailed upon. “We have a right to hope that those who have stood for freedom and celebrated those who have protected it might have a last-minute change of heart in the closing hours of this campaign.”
Bush spokesperson Freddy Ford told the New York Times last month that the Republican two-term president “retired from presidential politics many years ago”.
Bush – whose two terms as president in the 2000s saw the US invade Afghanistan and Iraq, triggering wars that cost millions of lives and lasted for years – has largely avoided the public spotlight since he left office.
He attended Trump’s inauguration in 2017, sitting near Bill and Hillary Clinton as well as Barack and Michelle Obama. According to a report by New York magazine, three people at the event said they heard Bush say “That was some weird shit” after the ceremony concluded and Trump’s time in office officially began.",2024-11-02
Guardian,New York authorities euthanize social media star Peanut the squirrel,"An orphaned squirrel that became a social media star called Peanut was euthanized after New York authorities seized the beloved pet during a raid on his caretaker’s home, authorities said.
After anonymous complaints, officers from the state’s department of environmental conservation (DEC) took the squirrel and a raccoon named Fred from Mark Longo’s home near the Pennsylvania border in rural Pine City on Wednesday, Longo said.
On Friday, the DEC and Chemung county department of health confirmed both animals’ fate.
“On Oct 30, DEC seized a raccoon and squirrel sharing a residence with humans, creating the potential for human exposure to rabies. In addition, a person involved with the investigation was bitten by the squirrel. To test for rabies, both animals were euthanized,” the agencies said in a statement, CBS News in New York reported. “The animals are being tested for rabies and anyone who has been in contact with these animals is strongly encouraged to consult their physician.”
Neither agency responded to the Associated Press’s requests for comment.
Peanut amassed tens of thousands of followers on Instagram, TikTok and other platforms during the seven years since Longo, who runs an animal sanctuary, said he took him in after seeing his mother get hit by a car in New York City.
Peanut’s Instagram account shows the squirrel leaping on to Longo’s shoulder, jumping through a hoop, holding and eating waffles and wearing miniature hats.
“It is with profound sorrow that we share the heartbreaking news: on October 30th, the DEC made the devastating decision to euthanize our beloved Peanut the squirrel and Fred the raccoon. Despite our passionate outcry for compassion, the agency chose to ignore our pleas, leaving us in deep shock and grief,” an Instagram post said Friday, accompanied by a video montage of the animals interacting with their smiling caretakers.
Longo and his wife, Daniela, opened P’Nuts Freedom Farm Animal Sanctuary in April 2023. It now houses about 300 animals including horses, goats and alpacas, Longo said. He said he was in the process of filing paperwork to get Peanut certified as an educational animal when the squirrel was seized.",2024-11-02
Guardian,"Threats, racism, misogyny: Trump’s disturbing final week of campaigning","There was racism and misogyny by the bucketload. There was a firing squad death threat to a former congresswoman. And there was the extraordinary sight of a Republican candidate for president of the United States playing dress-up as a sanitation worker in the cab of a garbage truck.
Donald Trump’s final full week on the campaign trail was as unedifying as it was bizarre.
With his vitriolic rants and threats of violent revenge against political enemies increasing in intensity, it was hard to set aside Democratic rival Kamala Harris’s closing argument that the former president is “unstable and unhinged”.
The former president’s extremist promise to unleash the military against those he considers “the enemy from within” – he named leading Democrats including ex-speaker Nancy Pelosi and Congressman Adam Schiff among them – was unprecedented.
And yet it was swiftly eclipsed by this week’s other developments.
It will be up to voters next week to decide whether any of it ultimately matters, at least in terms of who occupies the White House for the next four years. But history will record the waning days of the 2024 presidential campaign to be like no previous election, with one candidate leaning so heavily into an agenda of hate and menace, and his acolytes attempting variously to deny, distract from or clean up his remarks.
The carousel began spinning on Sunday when Trump hosted a rally at New York’s Madison Square Garden, where 85 years earlier American Nazis wearing swastikas had gathered months ahead of the outbreak of the second world war. Before Trump even took the stage there was controversy when a comedian, Tony Hinchcliffe, delivered a line that was to become the dominant theme of the following days.
“There’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it’s called Puerto Rico,” he said, failing to elicit laughs from an audience of 20,000.
The backlash was immediate and ferocious. Republicans joined Democrats in condemning the racist “joke”, while Trump embarked on a mission to try to turn the situation to his advantage.
There was no apology, of course. Though, at a rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday, Trump insisted “nobody loves our Latino community and our Puerto Rican community more than I do”, and that the Madison Square Garden event, notable for its deluge of anger, profanity and racism directed at immigrants and Democrats by a succession of speakers, was “a love fest”, and that “the love was unbelievable”.
Pennsylvania’s 472,000 Puerto Ricans, many of whom recall Trump withholding disaster relief funds and patronizingly tossing paper towels at desperate citizens after Hurricane Maria devastated the island in 2017, saw it differently.
“This is not the first time that our Puerto Rican community feels disrespected,” Philadelphia voter Yemele Ayala, told the Guardian. “We’re not taking that lightly.”
Joe Biden became caught in the maelstrom the same day when a comment he made about “garbage” was construed by the Trump camp as an attack on their candidate’s supporters. What the president intended to say was still under scrutiny on Friday as it emerged the White House had altered the official transcript of his remarks.
But the episode also gave rise to the stunt that would provide the defining image of the week, and probably its most ludicrous: Trump in a DayGlo safety vest, demanding of reporters, “Do you like my garbage truck?” before the vehicle emblazoned with his campaign logo was driven in circles around a Wisconsin parking lot in an apparent attempt to show it would be its passenger “taking out the trash” on 5 November, and not his Democratic opponent.
Other examples of Trump’s bitter disdain for those who stand up to him, as well as his flagrant misogyny, came to the fore as the week wore on.
In Green Bay, Wisconsin, on Wednesday night, addressing reproductive rights, he attempted to portray himself as a “protector” of women, despite dozens of claims of sexual assault against him, and a judge’s ruling adjudicating him a rapist.
“Well, I’m going to do it, whether the women like it or not. I’m going to protect them,” he said, drawing an instant rebuke from Harris.
The vice-president, meanwhile, became Trump’s target in an interview with Tucker Carlson, the rightwing extremist and disgraced former Fox News host, in Glendale, Arizona, on Thursday night. Harris, he insisted, was “a low-IQ individual”, and “dumb as a rock”, as he repeated previous slurs against his opponent.
The biggest talking point from the Carlson interview, however, was Trump declaring the Republican former congresswoman Liz Cheney a “radical war hawk” and saying he would like to see multiple guns pointed at her.
“Let’s put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, OK? Let’s see how she feels about it. You know, when the guns are trained on her face,” Trump said of a politician who has campaigned with and for Harris. Arizona’s Democratic attorney general, Kris Mayes, said on Friday she was investigating the comments to see if they amounted to a death threat.
In response to Trump, Cheney warned the public of the dangers of a dictatorship and said he “wants to be a tyrant”. Not for the first time this week, his representatives spent much of the day insisting to the media that Trump’s meaning was different from what he said.
Trump’s post to his Truth Social network later in the day repeated the same criticisms of Cheney but, conspicuously, omitted any reference to weapons being pointed at her.
Harris will make her own closing pitches over the weekend, but left no doubt about her position on Trump’s behavior as she addressed reporters in Madison, Wisconsin, on Friday afternoon.
“Anyone who uses that kind of violent rhetoric is clearly disqualified and unqualified to be president,” she said.
“Donald Trump is someone who considers his political opponents the enemy, is permanently out for revenge, and is increasingly unstable and unhinged.”",2024-11-01
Guardian,Californians want controls on AI. Why did Gavin Newsom veto an AI safety bill? | Garrison Lovely,"Governor Gavin Newsom of California recently killed SB1047, a first-of-its-kind artificial intelligence safety bill, arguing that its focus on only the largest AI models leaves out smaller ones that can also be risky. Instead, he says, we should pass comprehensive regulations on the technology.
If this doesn’t sound quite right to you, you’re not alone.
Despite claims by prominent opponents of the bill that “literally no one wants this”, SB1047 was popular – really popular. It passed the California legislature with an average of two-thirds of each chamber voting in favor. Six statewide polls that presented pro and con arguments for the bill show strong majorities in support, which rose over time. A September national poll found 80% of Americans thought Newsom should sign the bill. It was also endorsed by the two most-cited AI researchers alive, along with more than 110 current and former staff of the top-five AI companies.
The core of SB1047 would have established liability for creators of AI models in the event they cause a catastrophe and the developer didn’t take appropriate safety measures.
These provisions received support from at least 80% of California voters in an August poll.
So how do we make sense of this divide?
The aforementioned surveys were all commissioned or conducted by SB1047-sympathetic groups, prompting opponents to dismiss them as biased.
But even when a bill-sympathetic polling shop collaborated with an opponent to test “con” arguments in September, 62% of Californians were in favor.
Moreover, these results don’t surprise me at all. I’m writing a book on the economics and politics of AI and have analyzed years of nationwide polling on the topic. The findings are pretty consistent: people worry about risks from AI, favor regulations, and don’t trust companies to police themselves. Incredibly, these findings tend to hold true for both Republicans and Democrats.
So why would Newsom buck the popular bill?
Well, the bill was fiercely resisted by most of the AI industry, including Google, Meta and OpenAI. The US has let the industry self-regulate, and these companies desperately don’t want that to change – whatever sounds their leaders make to the contrary.
AI investors such as the venture fund Andreessen Horowitz, also known as a16z, mounted a smear campaign against the bill, saying anything they thought would kill the bill and hiring lobbyists with close ties to Newsom.
AI “godmother” and Stanford professor Fei-Fei Li parroted Andreessen Horowitz’s misleading talking points about the bill in the pages of Fortune – never disclosing that she runs a billion-dollar AI startup backed by the firm.
Then, eight congressional Democrats from California asked Newsom for a veto in an open letter, which was first published by an Andreessen Horowitz partner.
The top three names on the congressional letter – Zoe Lofgren, Anna Eshoo, and Ro Khanna – have collectively taken more than $4m in political contributions from the industry, accounting for nearly half of their lifetime top-20 contributors. Google was their biggest donor by far, with nearly $1m in total.
The death knell probably came from the former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, who published her own statement against the bill, citing the congressional letter and Li’s Fortune op-ed.
In 2021, reporters discovered that Lofgren’s daughter is a lawyer for Google, which prompted a watchdog to ask Pelosi to negotiate her recusal from antitrust oversight roles.
Who came to Lofgren’s defense? Eshoo and Khanna.
Three years later, Lofgren remains in these roles, which have helped her block efforts to rein in big tech – against the will of even her Silicon Valley constituents.
Pelosi’s 2023 financial disclosure shows that her husband owned between $16m and $80m in stocks and options in Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Nvidia.
When I asked if these investments pose a conflict of interest, Pelosi’s spokesperson replied: “Speaker Pelosi does not own any stocks, and she has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions.”
SB1047’s primary author, California state senator Scott Wiener, is widely expected to run for Pelosi’s congressional seat upon her retirement. His likely opponent? Christine Pelosi, the former speaker’s daughter, fueling speculation that Pelosi may be trying to clear the field.
In Silicon Valley, AI is the hot thing and a perceived ticket to fortune and power. In Congress, AI is something to regulate … later, so as to not upset one of the wealthiest industries in the country.
But the reality on the ground is that AI is more a source of fear and resentment. California’s state legislators, who are more down-to-earth than high-flying national Democrats, appear to be genuinely reflecting – or even moderating – the will of their constituents.
Sunny Gandhi of the youth tech advocacy group Encode Justice, which co-sponsored the bill, told me: “When you tell the average person that tech giants are creating the most powerful tools in human history but resist simple measures to prevent catastrophic harm, their reaction isn’t just disbelief – it’s outrage. This isn’t just a policy disagreement; it’s a moral chasm between Silicon Valley and Main Street.”
Newsom just told us which of these he values more.

Guardian,Democrats hope to rally female voters after misogynistic Republican remarks,"Republicans have made a series of offensive and misogynistic comments only five days before the vote, boosting Democratic hopes of turning out women on election day in a contest where the rights of women have been a central issue for the Kamala Harris campaign.
With a large gender gap appearing to define the election race – women disproportionately breaking for Kamala Harris and men for Donald Trump – both campaigns have been seeking to shore up their bases in their final-pitch remarks.
On Thursday, the former US president, discussing his claims that the US did not become involved in any new foreign conflicts during his administration, attacked former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney, daughter of George W Bush’s vice-president, Dick Cheney, for being a “radical war hawk”, saying guns should be pointed at her to “see how she feels about it”.
The violent imagery of this broadside against a prominent female politician was just the latest in a string of dark comments coming from Republicans that the Harris campaign has seized on as evidence that a Trump victory would be a disaster for women’s freedoms.
Calling Cheney “a very dumb individual”, Trump said, “Let’s put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, OK? Let’s see how she feels about it. You know, when the guns are trained on her face.”
Ian Sams, a senior adviser for Harris’s campaign, called out Trump for “dangerous, violent rhetoric”. “You have Donald Trump, who’s talking about sending a prominent Republican to the firing squad. And you have Vice-President Harris talking about sending one to her cabinet,” Sams told MSNBC on Friday.
Meanwhile, Harris described as “very offensive” a pledge by Trump the day before to “protect” women “whether the women like it or not”.
The Democratic campaign also aired a new ad, narrated by Julia Roberts, showing a woman going into a voting booth and apparently secretly voting for Harris. “In the one place in America where women still have a right to choose, you can vote any way you want. And no one will ever know,” the ad says, as the woman gives another a knowing look across the voting booth partitions.
As she emerges after voting for Harris, a man asks her if made “the right choice”. “Sure did, honey,” she says with a smile.
The Fox News primetime host Jesse Watters, responding to the ad, said on air that if his wife votes for Harris, “that’s the same thing as an affair” and that he would divorce her. “That, to me, violates the sanctity of our marriage. What else is she keeping from me? What else has she been lying about?”
The remark was followed by Charlie Kirk, whose rightwing organisation Turning Point Action has a key role in Trump’s get-out-the-vote efforts, saying the man in the ad “probably works his tail off to make sure that [the wife] can go and have a nice life”, adding: “And she lies to him saying ‘I’m going to vote for Trump’, then she votes for Kamala Harris as her little secret in the voting booth.”

And the pro-Trump pastor Dale Partridge declared on Tuesday that “in a Christian marriage, a wife should vote according to her husband’s direction”.
The Trump campaign has attempted to hit back, accusing the Democrat-supporting billionaire Mark Cuban of talking down to female Trump supporters by saying that Trump was too “intimidated” to surround himself with “strong, intelligent women”.
Kristi Noem, the Republican South Dakota governor, directly challenged Cuban. “Game on, buddy. I’ll take you on any day in a debate or maybe even arm wrestling.”
But a promise by Trump on Thursday that he would give Robert F Kennedy Jr a prominent role in his administration working on “women’s health” attracted further criticism.
Trump has attempted to court women with the dubious suggestion that they would not have to worry about reproductive rights – Trump claims credit for overturning the federal right to abortion – if they have already been killed by an undocumented migrant.
“I’m going to protect them from migrants coming in,” Trump said. “I’m going to protect them from foreign countries that want to hit us with missiles and lots of other things.’”
The Harris campaign, meanwhile, is hoping that his comments are a useful political wedge coming from a man who has been found liable for sexual abuse, with a judge calling an accusation of “rape” against Trump “substantially true”.
Another accusation of sexual assault was levelled against Trump last week by the model Stacey Williams, who revealed to the Guardian that, she says, Trump groped her in a “twisted game” with the convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.
Trump’s first presidential campaign was jeopardized by leaked audio in which Trump boasted about sexually assaulting women by grabbing women by their genitals, and he was found guilty of 34 felony counts after trying to buy the silence of the adult film star Stormy Daniels, thereby interfering unlawfully with the 2016 election.
“This is the same man who said women should be punished for their choices,” Harris said on Thursday at an event in Phoenix.
“He simply does not respect the freedom of women or the intelligence of women to know what’s in their own best interest and make decisions accordingly. But we trust women.”",2024-11-01
Guardian,"Bomb threats, ballot-box arson: a timeline of US election violence","In the last week, the US saw numerous attacks on the voting process and threats of violence, and extremism experts are bracing for what comes after voting has ended.
The goal of people committing these acts is often to create fear and distrust around voting or to sabotage the functioning of democracy. Still, election officials stress that voting is safe, and voters should not be deterred from voting because of any threats to the process, which are rare.
Here is a timeline of the political violence seen so far during the voting period in the US.
Arizona mass casualty planned
Jeffrey Michael Kelly was arrested in Arizona on 23 October after a series of violent incidents. Authorities say Kelly had amassed an arsenal of weapons and ammunition and was believed to be “preparing to commit an act of mass casualty”.
Kelly is alleged to have shot a Democratic party campaign office three times since September, once with a BB gun and twice with a firearm, resulting in the closure of the office. He had also allegedly put signs outside his home affixed withrazor blades and baggies of an unspecified white powder.
Maga-hat fight
A man voting early at a San Antonio polling place on 24 October allegedly assaulted a poll worker after he was told twice to remove a Make America Great Again hat because political clothing is not allowed at the polls in Texas.
A 69-year-old poll worker asked 63-year-old Jesse Lutzenberger to take off the Maga hat as he entered the polling place, which he did initially, Votebeat reported. But he allegedly put it back on inside, leading the poll worker to tell him again it was not allowed. At that point, Lutzenberger allegedly tangled with the poll worker and “threw several punches right at the face of the victim”, a sheriff’s report said.
Pennsylvania bomb threat
Edward Cieri Jr of Philadelphia was charged on 30 October for threatening to blow up a Republican office in Montgomery county, Pennsylvania.
Police allege he called the office on 26 October and spoke to a worker there. After the worker said he was a Republican, Cieri called him a name, then the worker mocked Cieri, according to the NBC affiliate in Philadelphia.
Cieri, upset, allegedly told the worker that he would “put one in your head,” “shoot up the place” and “blow it up”.
Ballot box arson
The person behind burning hundreds of ballots with incendiary devices in two ballot dropboxes in Oregon and Washington is suspected to be a metalworker who could be planning more attacks. The devices used were marked with the words “free Gaza”, but it’s not yet clear to authorities if the person who set the devices has grievances related to the Gaza war or if it was a tactic to sow confusion, 12 News Now reported.
A fire in a dropbox in Vancouver, Washington, on 28 October set ablaze hundreds of ballots, which election workers have tried to recover. The fire in the Portland dropbox was put out quickly because of a fire suppression system inside the box, leaving just a few ballots damaged.
A previous fire at a US Postal Service box in Phoenix, Arizona, also damaged ballots, though the suspect arrested in that instance said he did not set the fire for any political purposes and instead was trying to be arrested.
Machete at the polls
An 18-year-old in Neptune Beach, Florida, allegedly waved a machete at voters at an early voting location on 29 October.
Police said a group of young men were at the polling place protesting with Trump flags, and one of them had a machete, according to Action News Jax. An older woman said that the man had the machete raised above his head when he approached her, creating fear.
“The group arrived to protest and antagonize the opposing political side,” Neptune Beach police chief Michael J Key Jr said in a news conference.
‘Let’s Go Brandon’ hat
A man wearing a hat emblazoned with “Let’s Go Brandon”, a conservative dog-whistle, to the polls in South Carolina on 30 October was captured in video posted on social media swearing at the poll workers who told him political paraphernalia was not allowed inside voting locations.
In the video, he appears to call a poll worker a “fucking bitch” and said “this is my motherfucking right” to wear the hat, so they should “shut the hell up and let me vote”.
Police say a poll worker struck the man during the altercation, causing“visible swelling beneath the man’s bloodied left eye”, the Post and Courier reported.",2024-11-02
Guardian,"Better, faster, stronger? Tech titans’ obsession with turbocharged computer power could be our downfall | John Naughton","In 2001 I interviewed the late Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Intel. He was in Cambridge to attend the opening of a new library that he and his wife, Betty, had endowed. We met in the university library – the central library of the university – and had an agreeable chat about the history of the tech industry and the role that he had played in it. As ever, he was wearing a tacky digital watch that served as a cue for a party trick he used to play on people. He would ask them what they thought it had cost, and most people would suggest a trivial sum – $10, say. Nope, he’d reply. The actual cost was $15m: because that was what it had cost Intel to get into – and out of – the market for digital watches. And one of the lessons he learned from that was that his company should stay away from selling consumer goods.
Moore was world famous because of an observation he had made in the early days of the semiconductor industry that Intel once dominated. He had noticed that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit (or chip) had been doubling every year since 1965, and this was likely to continue for several decades. Inevitably, this became known as “Moore’s law”, as if it were a law of physics rather than just an empirical observation and an extrapolation into the future.
Even so, it turned out to be an accurate prediction of how the business of making silicon chips would evolve. Since transistor density is correlated with processing power, what it meant was that computing power doubled every year until about 2010, after which it began to level off somewhat, largely because of the physical limits on the density of transistors that could be fitted on to a tiny rectangle. (Although it hasn’t prevented Apple from getting 19bn of them on the A17 chip inside my iPhone.)
But although Moore’s “law” was bound to run out of steam eventually, it shaped an entire industry and – more importantly – changed the way we thought about computing. In particular, it fostered a hubristic mindset: confidence that if a problem could be solved by computing, if today’s machines weren’t powerful enough, Moore’s law guaranteed that it would be soluble really soon.
As the ancient Greeks knew only too well, after hubris comes nemesis. In the computing world it came in the computational needs of machine learning, which were orders of magnitude greater than those of more conventional serial processing – computing in sequence, one thing at a time (albeit at astonishing speeds). In one of those happy accidents, there was a part of the computer industry – gaming, which needed processors that could do several calculations simultaneously, or “in parallel” – to ensure that fast-changing scenes could be rendered realistically. And one particular company, Nvidia, was a prominent caterer to this esoteric requirement by providing what became known as graphics processing units (GPUs).
At some point, Jensen Huang, a smart cookie who is the founder and chief executive of Nvidia, realised that his company had the technology that the burgeoning new field of machine learning (afterwards rebranded AI) needed, and he pivoted his entire company to focus on it. The rest, as they say, is history. Irrational exuberance about AI took over the tech industry, fuelling a gold rush in which Huang was the premier supplier of picks and shovels, and his company is now the second most valuable corporation on the planet, just behind Apple.
In 2018 Huang started brooding on the rate at which the computational power of GPUs was increasing. He noted that Nvidia GPUs were “25 times faster than five years ago” whereas Moore’s law would have expected only a tenfold increase. GPU performance was more than tripling every two years, significantly more than Moore would have estimated.
Inevitably, this empirical observation has now become “Huang’s law”. The comparison with Moore’s law is misleading, though, because Moore was referring just to chips – CPUs – whereas Nvidia GPUs are dense clusters of numerous components with associated software which makes them more like miniature supercomputers.
If, as seems likely, GPUs do become the basic building blocks of next-generation computers, then Huang’s prediction of another exponential acceleration in computing power – Moore’s law on steroids – will fuel a new wave of hubristic conviction that there is nothing that cannot be done with technology. Except of course the things that are really worth doing if humans are to survive into the next millennium. Those whom the gods wish to destroy, they first make complacent.

Guardian,Must-win Pennsylvania still bafflingly close as Harris and Trump fight for edge,"Kamala Harris stood before a cheering crowd of hundreds of her supporters in Philadelphia and promised that she would deliver in Pennsylvania, a battleground state considered a must-win in the electoral college.
“Nine days left in one of the most consequential elections of our lifetime, and we know this is going to be a tight race until the very end,” the vice-president told supporters in Philadelphia last weekend. “And make no mistake: we will win.”
And yet, just a day earlier at a rally in State College, Donald Trump declared: “We’re going to pull this off. It’ll be the greatest victory in the history of our country for all of us – not for me, for all of us.”
The contradictory comments reflect a neck-and-neck race in Pennsylvania that is hurtling toward the finish line with no clear frontrunner. The victor of Pennsylvania and its 19 electoral votes, the most of any battleground state, will probably win the electoral college and determine the trajectory of the country for the next four years.
Joe Biden won Pennsylvania by just 1.2 points in 2020, four years after Trump carried the state by 0.7 points. According to the Guardian’s polling tracker, Trump currently holds a lead of less than one point over Harris in the state.
Conversations with voters in Pennsylvania underscore how close the election is, often to the bafflement of both Democrats and Republicans. And the outcome could perhaps shift with an unexpected turns of events, such as Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden in New York last weekend. It was there that a comedian took the stage before Trump and insulted Puerto Rico, calling it an “island of garbage”. As pundits were quick to note afterwards, Pennsylvania is home to more than 470,000 Puerto Ricans.
For Democrats, the focus is on firing up voters in Pennsylvania cities such as Philadelphia and Scranton and their immediate suburbs, home to many women and college-educated voters they view as amenable to their message of protecting democracy and abortion. Republicans are more focused on winning white working-class voters and a growing number of young men of color, by attacking Harris over the president’s immigration policies and the high inflation of his early presidency.
This dynamic is exemplified by Lackawanna county, which includes Scranton. Hillary Clinton won it in 2016 by 3.4 points, but she decisively lost most of its neighboring counties, as white working-class voters flocked to Trump.
Four years later, Biden won Lackawanna county by 8.4 points, though Trump’s persistent strength with working-class voters in the neighboring counties helped him keep the race in Pennsylvania close.
The outcome here will depend, as it always does, on turnout, and Democrats are counting on a robust ground game to help them deliver a win. The culinary union Unite Here, for instance endorsed Harris in August and has knocked on more than 1m doors in Pennsylvania this election cycle, with a goal of surpassing 1.25m by 5 November.
Jaime Hunt, a 22-year-old organizer with Unite Here, walked through South Philadelphia on a recent sunny Saturday, asking voters whether they planned to vote by mail, and encouraging them to fill out their ballots on the spot if they had already received them.
The canvassing efforts of Unite Here and other pro-Harris groups could make a critical difference in Pennsylvania. In 2020, Biden narrowly defeated Trump in the state by roughly 80,000 votes, in part by maximizing his advantage in Philadelphia and its surrounding suburbs. This year, based on her many conversations with voters, Hunt is confident in Harris’s chances.
“There is also a lot of – a good number – of Republicans who are voting for her. A lot of people are switching,” Hunt said. “I think it’s going to be her who wins.”
Daniel Levin, a regional organizing director for the youth voting group NextGen America, has spent months on Philadelphia’s college campuses getting thousands of students registered to vote, and now helping them make a plan to vote for Harris and other Democrats.
Despite concerns over whether young voters will support Harris, particularly because of widespread outrage over the Biden administration’s response to the war in Gaza, Levin predicted high youth turnout in Philadelphia. On a recent Friday, he convinced a young voter at Temple University to support Harris after explaining how her policies could benefit low-income residents of the city.
“This is the place to be optimistic that we’re going to get a huge turnout,” Levin said. “And I think we will this year. I really think we will in Philadelphia, and we need to to carry [Pennsylvania].”
In contrast to the broad network of pro-Harris groups working to turn out left-leaning voters, the Trump campaign’s comparatively meager ground operation in battleground states such as Pennsylvania has stoked concern among his allies. Trump and the Republican National Committee have instead directed more of their attention to combating alleged voter fraud, most recently highlighting concerns about potentially fraudulent registrations in Lancaster county.
Despite Trump’s inattention to his turnout operation, he has managed to keep the race in Pennsylvania highly competitive, and his most ardent supporters seem as motivated as ever to cast their ballots for him.
“I’ve never in my life seen a movement like this,” said John Spatig Jr, 46, who attended a rally by Trump in Allentown and lives in Northampton county, one of the biggest bellwethers in the state. He said the top issue for him was the government response for the Covid-19 pandemic and vaccine mandates.
“How is the government going to guarantee me that there will never be a lockdown?” he said.
Marilynn Raymond, 77, a retired bookkeeper from Reading, said at Trump’s rally in Allentown on Tuesday that she didn’t believe the polls showing a close race.
“All the crowds that Trump has done through the whole election far outweigh Kamala,” she said. “I think he’s way ahead.”
As this campaigning season nears its close, Pennsylvania voters seem to be approaching election day with a mix of fatigue, excitement and fear.
The fatigue was on display as Hunt made her rounds through South Philadelphia, with one resident responding to her knock by yelling through the door: “No one is home!”
Both parties have already poured hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of campaign ads into Pennsylvania, and Philadelphia especially. The Philadelphia-based ABC affiliate WPVI completely sold out of ad inventory through election day by 24 October.
Alex Pearlman, a comedian from the Philadelphia suburbs with a large following on TikTok, met with Tim Walz before a rally in Scranton, and he said he urged the Democratic vice-presidential nominee to keep voters energized for the final stretch.
“Everybody’s tired,” Pearlman said. “Everyone’s been pretty set, the entire time. I think most people were holding their breath just to see who the candidates were going to be after the primaries. So now that we’re at this point, almost everyone has kind of made up their mind.”
That dynamic has forced Harris and Trump to fight over an ever-diminishing number of undecided voters as they race toward election day. According to an Emerson College survey conducted in late October, only 3% of likely Pennsylvania voters were still undecided. And yet, that 3% could make all the difference, given that the state has been decided by roughly one point in the past two presidential elections.
The narrow margins have triggered frustration and confusion among Democrats and Republicans in Pennsylvania. How, they ask, could the race for president still be this close?
“[Harris] is going to win it, but I don’t believe the polls. I can’t believe that we’re 50-50 tied,” said Kathy Andrews, a 64-year-old voter from Philadelphia who attended Harris’s rally there. “I am giving a lot of credit to the American people, that everyone has a modicum of common sense.”
Morgan Pastner Jaffe, a 32-year-old voter from West Chester, said the possibility of Trump’s victory makes her feel “very scared for the future – for women, for people of color and all different religions as well”.
“She has to win or we’re screwed,” Jaffe said at Harris’s rally.
With the race still a toss-up, the Trump campaign, wary of alienating a critical voting bloc, has tried to distance itself from the comedian who made the comment about Puerto Rico at Madison Square Garden.
Rich Patti, 71, said at Trump’s Allentown rally that he didn’t think those remarks would hurt Trump’s chances with Latino voters.
“They’re the backbone of our country and the backbones are hurting right now,” he said. “They work hard, they want the same thing. They want to be able to pay their bills, live well.”
People of Puerto Rican descent in the state have suggested otherwise. “I was absolutely frustrated, I was angry – but I was not surprised,” Philadelphia councilmember Quetcy Lozada told the Guardian.
The high stakes of the election are on display throughout Pennsylvania. Of the many signs adorning lawns and lamp-posts in Philadelphia, some eschew the traditional “Harris-Walz 2024” for slogans such as: “Defend Choice!” and “Defend Democracy!”
“I don’t think you can walk around the city of Philadelphia and not know how important it is to people,” said Shane Ringressy, Pennsylvania organizing director for NextGen. “So I will say that Philadelphia itself, including all the young people in the city, definitely seem like they’re ready to fight and do their part.”",2024-11-01
Guardian,"Better, faster, stronger? Tech titans’ obsession with turbocharged computer power could be our downfall | John Naughton","In 2001 I interviewed the late Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Intel. He was in Cambridge to attend the opening of a new library that he and his wife, Betty, had endowed. We met in the university library – the central library of the university – and had an agreeable chat about the history of the tech industry and the role that he had played in it. As ever, he was wearing a tacky digital watch that served as a cue for a party trick he used to play on people. He would ask them what they thought it had cost, and most people would suggest a trivial sum – $10, say. Nope, he’d reply. The actual cost was $15m: because that was what it had cost Intel to get into – and out of – the market for digital watches. And one of the lessons he learned from that was that his company should stay away from selling consumer goods.
Moore was world famous because of an observation he had made in the early days of the semiconductor industry that Intel once dominated. He had noticed that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit (or chip) had been doubling every year since 1965, and this was likely to continue for several decades. Inevitably, this became known as “Moore’s law”, as if it were a law of physics rather than just an empirical observation and an extrapolation into the future.
Even so, it turned out to be an accurate prediction of how the business of making silicon chips would evolve. Since transistor density is correlated with processing power, what it meant was that computing power doubled every year until about 2010, after which it began to level off somewhat, largely because of the physical limits on the density of transistors that could be fitted on to a tiny rectangle. (Although it hasn’t prevented Apple from getting 19bn of them on the A17 chip inside my iPhone.)
But although Moore’s “law” was bound to run out of steam eventually, it shaped an entire industry and – more importantly – changed the way we thought about computing. In particular, it fostered a hubristic mindset: confidence that if a problem could be solved by computing, if today’s machines weren’t powerful enough, Moore’s law guaranteed that it would be soluble really soon.
As the ancient Greeks knew only too well, after hubris comes nemesis. In the computing world it came in the computational needs of machine learning, which were orders of magnitude greater than those of more conventional serial processing – computing in sequence, one thing at a time (albeit at astonishing speeds). In one of those happy accidents, there was a part of the computer industry – gaming, which needed processors that could do several calculations simultaneously, or “in parallel” – to ensure that fast-changing scenes could be rendered realistically. And one particular company, Nvidia, was a prominent caterer to this esoteric requirement by providing what became known as graphics processing units (GPUs).
At some point, Jensen Huang, a smart cookie who is the founder and chief executive of Nvidia, realised that his company had the technology that the burgeoning new field of machine learning (afterwards rebranded AI) needed, and he pivoted his entire company to focus on it. The rest, as they say, is history. Irrational exuberance about AI took over the tech industry, fuelling a gold rush in which Huang was the premier supplier of picks and shovels, and his company is now the second most valuable corporation on the planet, just behind Apple.
In 2018 Huang started brooding on the rate at which the computational power of GPUs was increasing. He noted that Nvidia GPUs were “25 times faster than five years ago” whereas Moore’s law would have expected only a tenfold increase. GPU performance was more than tripling every two years, significantly more than Moore would have estimated.
Inevitably, this empirical observation has now become “Huang’s law”. The comparison with Moore’s law is misleading, though, because Moore was referring just to chips – CPUs – whereas Nvidia GPUs are dense clusters of numerous components with associated software which makes them more like miniature supercomputers.
If, as seems likely, GPUs do become the basic building blocks of next-generation computers, then Huang’s prediction of another exponential acceleration in computing power – Moore’s law on steroids – will fuel a new wave of hubristic conviction that there is nothing that cannot be done with technology. Except of course the things that are really worth doing if humans are to survive into the next millennium. Those whom the gods wish to destroy, they first make complacent.

Guardian,Jamaica welcomes US move to clamp down on gun trafficking to Caribbean,"Jamaica’s deputy prime minister has welcomed a campaign by the New York attorney general, Letitia James, to push through new measures and legislation to tackle gun trafficking from the US to the Caribbean.
Horace Chang, who is also Jamaica’s minister of security, praised a coalition of 14 US attorneys general, led by James, that is backing the passing of the Caribbean Arms Trafficking Causes Harm Act. Introduced in both houses of the US Congress earlier this year, the act aims to help curb illicit arms trafficking from the United States to the Caribbean.
In a letter to Congress, the attorneys general outlined actions that need to be taken, including improving resources for US port inspectors and increasing funding for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).
The letter highlights Jamaica’s alarming homicide rate of 53.3 per 100,000, pointing out that it is “currently the highest rate of countries with reliable statistics”. It also flags that, according to Jamaican government estimates, at least 200 guns are trafficked into the country from the US every month, adding that these guns are fueling violent crime and enabling drug smuggling networks that traffic drugs to the US.
“It is not an exaggeration to say that overdoses in American communities are made possible in part by the trafficking of firearms from the United States to the Caribbean,” the letter argues.
Chang said that Jamaica already had an “extremely good relationship” with US law enforcement agencies, particularly the ATF, but admitted that the flow of guns was still a big problem.
He hoped the AGs’ campaign would support Jamaica’s efforts to combat gun crime, which he said include improving border control and creating new legislation.
He said: “It’s good to hear the American attorneys general asking for [legislative changes] because the source of the firearms that are killing Jamaican citizens in very large numbers is largely from the United States, so we are happy to hear them taking strong actions to prevent the flow of guns to Jamaica.
“We brought in the most aggressive firearms act in the region, and it will impact the issue in short order and penalise all aspects of the illegal firearm trade … We have taken a lot of steps to protect our borders and to identify and find the firearms and to implement strong punishment to the individuals involved.”
Dr Diana Thorburn, from the thinktank Caribbean Policy Research Institute, said that the US taking some of the responsibility for this issue was a step in the right direction, but added that, while tackling gun trafficking was critical, it was important to recognise that it did not get to the root of the problem.
She said: “80% of Jamaica’s murder rate is directly or indirectly related to gangs, and if you take that 80% out, Jamaica’s murder rate is below the world average.
“The problem of gun trafficking exists because of the demand for guns in the Caribbean, just as drug trafficking to the US exists because of the high demand for drugs in the US. In Jamaica, the demand for guns exists because of the gangs, and they are the ones responsible for the high murder rate. If they weren’t getting guns from the US, they’d get them from somewhere else because, though most of the guns recovered in Jamaica are from the US, not all are. There are other sources.”",2024-10-03
Guardian,Blow for Republicans as supreme court rejects appeal over Pennsylvania ballots,"Pennsylvania voters will be able to cast a provisional vote if they make an error and forget to put their mail-in vote in a required secrecy envelope, the US supreme court ruled on Friday, a decision that could lead to thousands more votes being counted in a key battleground state where the presidential race is extremely tight.
The supreme court announced its decision on Friday on its emergency docket, giving no reasoning for its ruling, which is customary in emergency cases.
Republicans had asked the court to intervene after the Pennsylvania supreme court ruled 4-3 earlier this week that voters should not be disenfranchised if they forget the secrecy envelope. Voters in Pennsylvania must place their ballots in two envelopes: an inner envelope that ensures its secrecy, and an outer envelope that they mail.
Pennsylvania law does not allow for a voter to cast a provisional ballot – an emergency vote at the polls – if they have cast a timely mail-in vote. But a majority of justices on the state supreme court said that a ballot that was rejected because it lacked a secrecy envelope did not count as a cast ballot. “Because electors failed to comply with the mandatory secrecy envelope requirement, they failed to cast a ballot,” the state supreme court wrote.
The scope of the ruling is not immediately clear. As of Thursday, nearly 9,000 out of 1.6m mail-in ballots returned had arrived without a secrecy envelope, the Associated Press reported. The NBC News decision desk estimated that thousands of votes could be affected in a state that could come down to extremely fine margins.
“In Pennsylvania and across the country, Trump and his allies are trying to make it harder for your vote to count, but our institutions are stronger than his shameful attacks. Today’s decision confirms that, for every eligible voter, the right to vote means the right to have your vote counted,” read a joint statement from Kamala Harris’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee.
Pennsylvania adopted a law in 2019 that allows all voters to cast a mail-in ballot. But the law is not clear when it comes to whether officials should be required to notify the voter of technical errors on their ballots – a missing secrecy envelope, signature, or date – and help them fix them.
Thirty-eight counties in the state notify voters of errors and give them the opportunity to fix it, according to an analysis by Votebeat. But the court’s decision on Friday means that any voter in Pennsylvania who has a ballot rejected on a technicality will have the chance to cast a provisional ballot on election day to be counted.
The dispute stemmed from a special election earlier this year in which two voters in Butler county, near Pittsburgh, had their mail-in ballots rejected, were invited to cast a provisional ballot, and then had their provisional ballots rejected.
Justice Samuel Alito wrote on Friday that the case before the court was relatively narrow, and that the court’s intervention at this stage would not prohibit any other Pennsylvania county from prohibit provisional voting. Still, he expressed openness to the argument from Republicans that the state supreme court may have exceeded its authority.
Alito’s statement, joined by Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, was significant because he seemed to suggest that the court could use the case to revisit the question of how far state supreme courts can go in policing election laws.
The supreme court said last year that state courts can police election rules, but that sometimes they can go too far. It has declined to clarify the ambiguity of its ruling.
Pennsylvania is the biggest presidential election battleground this year, with 19 electoral votes. Donald Trump won the state in 2016, then lost it in 2020.
A judge in Erie county, in Pennsylvania’s north-western corner, ruled on Friday in a lawsuit brought by the Democratic party that about 15,000 people who applied for a mail ballot but did not receive it may go to the county elections office and get a replacement through Monday.
The deadline to apply for a mail-in ballot has passed in Pennsylvania, the biggest presidential battleground this year and a state that has hosted far more visits by Trump and Kamala Harris, his Democratic rival, than any other.
The ruling means that Erie county’s elections office will be open every day through Monday for voters to go in, cancel the mail-in ballot they did not receive in the mail, and get another one over the counter, said Cliff Levine, a lawyer for the state Democratic party.
In suburban Philadelphia’s Bucks county, a court set a deadline of 5pm for voters there to apply for and receive a mail-in ballot.
Lines outside the elections office in Doylestown were long throughout the day – snaking down the sidewalk – with the process taking about two hours by Friday afternoon.
A Bucks county judge had ordered the three-day extension in response to a Trump campaign lawsuit alleging voters faced disenfranchisement when they were turned away by county application-processing offices that had struggled to keep up with demand, leading to frustration and anger among voters.
The Trump campaign lawsuit said people who were in line by Tuesday’s 5pm deadline to apply in person for a mail ballot should have been allowed to get a ballot, even after the deadline. However, Bucks county’s election office denied voters that right and ordered them to leave, the lawsuit said.
Bucks county judge Jeffrey Trauger ruled that the board of elections violated the state election code and ordered an extension through Friday.
Unlike other states, Pennsylvania does not have true early in-person voting. Voters can apply early for mail ballots online or in person at county election buildings.
Doing so in person can take about 12 minutes and requires applying for a mail ballot, waiting for a bar-coded envelope to be printed and then, if voters wish, they can cast the ballot on the spot. Or they can put it in a drop box or a mailbox. Election offices must receive the ballots by 8pm on Tuesday.",2024-11-02

Guardian,US election answers the question: how do you spend a billion dollars?,"It was one of the most striking images of the final full week of the presidential election campaign: a giant projection of Kamala Harris’s face on the 516ft-wide, 366ft-tall Las Vegas Sphere.
At a reported $450,000 a day for what is believed to be the first political ad to appear on the futuristic new attraction, it was also one of the most expensive. But even at those rates, it barely made a dent in the staggering election war chest of almost $1bn that Harris has built since replacing Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket this summer.
What the Vegas investment did answer, in part at least, was the question of how a campaign spends $1bn – an amount larger than the gross domestic product of at least 14 countries, according to the World Bank – in a single election season.
Cash-hungry stunts such as this one in battleground Nevada are often targeted at undecided voters in specific swing states and regions; and Republicans and Democrats alike have shown a penchant for splashing out on costly endeavors to try to reach those who are still persuadable, and therefore the most high-value. Bang for the buck, in other words.
As another example, the campaigns of Harris and Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, booked pricey prime-time spots during games involving Pennsylvania’s two professional NFL teams – the Philadelphia Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers – on Sunday and Monday nights.
Pennsylvania’s 19 electoral college votes could tip the election one way or the other, and with polling showing the state on a knife edge, Democrats in particular have made younger, male voters – a demographic they see as politically less engaged – a priority. Earlier this month, the New York Times reported, the Democratic National Committee paid “a six-figure sum” to fly pro-Harris banners over four NFL games involving teams from six of the seven key swing states, Pennsylvania among them.
“It is an extraordinary amount of money that the candidates are raising, and there’s no shortage of places to spend it,” said Steve Caplan, a professor who teaches a course on political advertising at the University of Southern California’s Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism.
“Back in the stone age before the explosion of digital media, there were four TV networks in the US, and even after cable there was only so much what we would call inventory, or space, to get your message out.
“Now, because of an explosion of channels and media outlets, there’s countless ways to spend that money, to slice and dice it by audience and by demographic, whether it’s on digital advertising, YouTube, Facebook and other social media. Interestingly, Snapchat has become a really big channel for Kamala Harris. It’s very cost-efficient and can reach younger voters.”
Caplan said campaigns had invested in honing their digital content creation, from videos to podcasts, into a powerful and effective messaging tool.
“There’s an entire infrastructure of producers, writers, editors and ad makers who just crank these things out for every conceivable audience, almost 24 hours a day for weeks and weeks,” he said.
“We’ve also seen massive changes in the last few years where more consumers are cutting the cord: you get a smart TV and can stream through your provider. Those sort of platforms were really in their early stages just four years ago, and now they’ve become massive and very important. Hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars are now being spent on these platforms in swing states. It was virtually zero in 2020.”
Other expenses that campaigns must cover include staff costs, printed materials and advertising, staging rallies and transportation. But broadcast advertising, especially television, remains king.
The analytics company AdImpact says Democrats have spent $1.1bn on aired ads and future reservations alone since Harris became the candidate in July, $400m more than Republicans. Jointly, the two presidential campaigns have spent an eye-watering $2.1bn since March.
For the entire election cycle, including Senate, House and partisan down-ballot races, plus ballot initiatives in many states, political advertising is expected to reach a record $10.7bn, a 19% increase from 2020, AdImpact says.
Democrats have significantly out-raised and outspent Republicans in this cycle, disclosures to the Federal Election Commission (FEC) show, in both campaign funding and money raised by and for political action committees (Pac), which are allied with the presidential candidates but, by law, are set up and run independently of them.
Up to 16 October, the most recent date for which returns were available, Democrats hauled in $1.05bn and spent $883m, leaving almost $120m in hand. Republicans, by contrast, raised $565m and spent all but $52.6m of it.
When Pac money is included, however, the figures swell exponentially. While individual contributors are limited to $3,300 donations directly to the presidential candidates, there are no such limits for Pacs, which raised $13.5bn between January 2023 and the end of last month, according to the FEC.
The rules, framed by the 2010 Citizens United v FEC supreme court ruling, allow corporations, special interest groups and wealthy individuals – such as the billionaire Elon Musk through his controversial Trump-aligned America Pac – to make eye-popping and almost unrestricted contributions, and to buy oversized influence in elections and their aftermath.
“Citizens United, and subsequent other cases, opened the door for corporate contributions to related entities to campaigns, and allowed for what are commonly referred to as dark-money groups to spend money on politics without disclosing who that money came from,” said the attorney Noah Bookbinder, president and chief executive of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew).
“Wealthy people have always been a political force, but a small group of billionaires have become just a huge part of the machine, fueling political campaigns now, both in terms of giving to dark-money organizations and giving to Super Pacs. In the case of Elon Musk, his Super Pac is essentially operating as an unchecked piece of the Trump campaign apparatus.
“It’s troubling because we don’t want this country to slide into being the kind of oligarchy you see in a place like Russia where a small number of very wealthy individuals have outsize influence over the people in charge.”
Musk’s self-funded Pac reported $130m in receipts, the latest FEC disclosure showed. Democratic-aligned Pacs ActBlue, the Harris Victory Fund and the DNC, filled three of the top four places with receipts of more than $5bn. The leading Republican Pac, WinRed, reported $1.4bn.
A new report from Americans for Tax Fairness (ATF), meanwhile, shows Musk in third place among individual donors, behind the banking and oil magnate Tim Mellon ($172m) and the Las Vegas-based Adelson family of hoteliers ($137m). All three donated to Republicans.
In all, the ATF said, 150 billionaire families have so far contributed $1.9bn among them to Pacs supporting presidential and congressional candidates in the 2024 cycle, a 60% rise from the 2020 total given by more than 600 individual billionaires.
“Billionaire campaign spending on this scale drowns out the voices and concerns of ordinary Americans,” said David Kass, ATF’s executive director.
Bradley Smith, professor at Capital University law school and FEC chair during the administration of George W Bush, said it was wrong to blame Citizens United for the cash swishing around in Harris’s, or Trump’s, coffers.
“The vast majority of the money is coming from individuals subject to campaign finance limits. All the money Kamala Harris has raised directly in her campaign comes from individuals in amounts of $3,300 or less,” he said.
“The law has played a part but more than that, it’s maybe a little bit of a cultural zeitgeist. People seem to really feel there’s a lot at stake in this election and one of the few ways people can participate in a campaign beyond voting is by giving money.
“Most people don’t have time to go knock on doors, and a lot of it has been supercharged by the internet, which makes it really easy and low-cost to get small donors to contribute: ‘Click on this button, send us $20.’ Some of these people do that 30, 40, 50 times, and all of a sudden you’re talking real money.”",2024-11-01
Guardian,Some Maga men seem to think women don’t have rights – starting with their wives | Rebecca Solnit,"This week, the fundamentalist Christian pastor Dale Partridge argued in a series of tweets that “in a Christian marriage, a wife should vote according to her husband’s direction”. In other words, he pits his version of the religion against the constitution, which, since the 19th amendment passed a century ago, guarantees adult citizens the right to vote regardless of sex. He argues that in marriage, the husband annexes and owns his wife’s voice and rights, so that he in effect gets two votes and she gets none. The far-right preacher is not alone in this argument that women should not have the right to participate in public life and act on their views and values.
Jesse Watters, the Fox News personality, has argued that if he found out his wife “was going into the voting booth and pulling the lever for Harris, that’s the same thing as having an affair”. It violates “the sanctity of our marriage; what else is she keeping from me?” Rightwing agitator Charlie Kirk also got upset about the idea that women might vote according to their agenda and not their husband’s.
These men are offering warnings about what awaits women who marry men like them. Maybe it’s worth noting here that the rightwing opposition to marriage equality as same-sex marriage is in part because they’re opposed to marriage equality within heterosexual marriage. They want marriage to be an inherently unequal relationship with a subordinate wife and an entitled husband, a cozy little authoritarian regime at home.
One of the things the 2024 US presidential election is about is whether or not women should be free and equal full citizens of this republic. Right now too many women are not – women in conservative states are denied reproductive rights, meaning jurisdiction over their own bodies and in some cases survival if an abortion or pregnancy becomes a medical emergency.
But there’s another way that women are not free and equal which a few videos, a lot of tweets and reportedly some Post-It notes in women’s bathrooms have addressed – when women are afraid to vote for their chosen candidate, when their husbands or boyfriends are Trump supporters and they are Harris supporters. I just wrote a Guardian piece about the fact that so many women apparently are bullied over their political beliefs, despite assurances that there are ways to vote without being tyrannized, is troubling. It suggests that there’s a whole other kind of voting suppression and coercion that deserves investigation and raises questions about voting at home.
The responses cited above confirm that a lot of women have good reason to fear their partners and hide their choices (and attention to the videos may be making Maga husbands even more angry and controlling). These Maga men don’t think that wives and girlfriends should be free to vote as they choose, nor that wives and girlfriends have the right to privacy in their political choices. They, in other words, do not believe she should have a choice. Which boils down to not believing she has rights, and if they don’t believe women have rights here, they don’t believe they have them in a lot of arenas.
This aligns with the Republican party’s enthusiasm for ending reproductive rights and birth control and no-fault divorce and with Vance’s suggestion that women should stay in violent marriages. Vance’s campaign has said his remarks were taken out of context. It fits in with Trump’s ominous campaign speech on Tuesday in which he declared, “I want to protect the women of our country … I’m going to do it whether the women like it or not.”
Those are alarming words from an adjudicated rapist who’s facing new sexual assault charges from both former model Stacey Williams and beauty pageant contestant Beatrice Keul. Or not facing, since neither of these stories have garnered much attention, Trump’s long history of adjudicated or alleged sexual abuse apparently being acceptable, denied, or both with his supporters.
This election is about a lot of things, and whether women are endowed with certain inalienable rights is one of them.",2024-11-01
Guardian,‘Take these attacks seriously’: journalist Imara Jones on the dangerous rise of anti-trans political ads,"Imara Jones was filming a documentary on a road trip in California when she took a break to scroll the news. A story about state lawmakers in Idaho banning transgender girls from playing on female sports teams at public schools caught her attention; it was the second anti-trans legislation that Jones had seen passed in 2020. She turned to her producer and told her that they needed to look into “this anti-trans stuff”. Dozens of similar bills were introduced in statehouses throughout the nation soon after.
A year later, Jones launched her podcast The Anti-Trans Hate Machine: A Plot Against Equality to look into the religious extremists, conservative political groups and billionaires pushing an anti-trans agenda.
Since then, the urgency of her work has only grown. Republicans have spent more than $65m on anti-trans television ads in recent months, according to the New York Times, despite the negative impact that they have on trans people’s safety and wellbeing, and scant evidence of its effectiveness in swaying voters. And in 2023 and 2024, more than 500 anti-LGBTQ bills were introduced each year.
On her podcast, Jones – a Black trans journalist and founder of the platform TransLash Media – investigates the anti-trans industry with a conversational tone, all while centering the voices and experiences of trans people. “I have a belief that when you see the same thing happening in different parts of the country at the same time, that that’s something to look into,” Jones said. “I think that coincidence is always great as a fertile ground for journalism and for looking under the hood about what’s going on.”
In the first episode of this year’s season, Jones looks at how the paramilitary group Proud Boys uses anti-trans rhetoric to stoke political upheaval. Far-right militia groups have grown at unprecedented numbers in recent years, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), while political violence in general has also increased.
For trans people, such rhetoric can lead to increased violence against them, as well as suicidal ideation. A recent report from the LGBTQ+ advocacy group The Trevor Project found that suicide attempts among trans and nonbinary youth increased by up to 72% in states that enacted anti-trans laws.
“We know that trans people overall have been facing more violence since there’s been an uptick in anti-trans rhetoric in terms of hate crimes,” Jones said. “So we know that there is an impact on people’s safety and wellbeing solely because of the [public] conversation.”
Jones hopes that through her work, that the press and political leaders will begin to see anti-trans rhetoric as a serious threat to democracy and community safety.
“The biggest solution is to take these attacks seriously,” Jones said, “to understand the way in which they are being deployed for paramilitary violence, for political violence, to destabilize communities, to undermine democratic conversations politically, to take votes away”.
A ‘trans moral panic’
Anti-trans ads are being deployed by the Republican party now due to the tightness of the presidential election, according to Jones. During their September debate, for instance, Trump attacked Kamala Harris’s 2019 comments about her support of gender-affirming surgery for imcarcerated trans people. “Anti-trans issues work the best in really tight elections where the margins are really close and you’re just trying to convert one or two votes per precinct, and that’s enough to help you win,” Jones said.
Another reason why anti-trans ads are particularly salient now is because the GOP is using them to court voters who supported the Republican candidate Nikki Haley, who ran on an anti-trans platform, she added. Many of those voters are suburban women who lean Republican, but sometimes vote Democrat in local elections. Both parties are now vying for their votes. “Harris is making a play for the Nikki Haley voter, and there’s some indication that she is gaining enough ground to maybe get her over the top,” said Jones. “That’s exactly the type of population that would be receptive to anti-trans messages.”
Christian nationalists and rightwing politicians view trans people as collateral damage as they strive for political wins, according to Jones. And bundled in with anti-trans rhetoric is opposition to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies. A “trans moral panic” among the far-right has led to an uptick in legislation that bans both DEI policies and trans protections, said Emerson Hodges, a research analyst for the intelligence project at the SPLC. At the Intelligence Project, Hodges tracks hate and extremism through in-person and online monitoring.
“Anti-LGBT groups that are in alliances with trans-exclusionary groups also push what they call ‘viewpoint diversity’ to roll back DEI protections in state houses and in corporations,” said Hodges. Billed as the inclusion of various perspectives in an argument, viewpoint diversity is problematic because it promotes this false narrative that DEI is a threat to white Christian men,” he said, “and they utilize that to push these anti-trans, anti-LGBT bills”.
Along with an increase in suicide attempts among trans and nonbinary people, anti-trans legislation can lead to violence against trans people of color, said Hodges. Twenty-seven trans people have been killed this year, according to HRC, with 74% of them being people of color and 48% being Black. “When we look at these trends of violence towards trans people,” Hodges said, “it’s important to remember that those trends of violence are affected by legislation and the politicization of trans affirmation.”
While Jones began her podcast in 2019 to highlight the dangers of anti-trans legislation, she hopes to one day celebrate the lives of trans people. But first, political leaders must work toward creating a society where trans and gender nonconforming people can live without the fear of violence.
“We would love to focus on telling all of the good news and the positive stories that surround trans people from all walks of life and all backgrounds,” Jones said. “But the world’s gonna have to cooperate a little bit to allow us to do that.”",2024-11-02
Guardian,Californians want controls on AI. Why did Gavin Newsom veto an AI safety bill? | Garrison Lovely,"Governor Gavin Newsom of California recently killed SB1047, a first-of-its-kind artificial intelligence safety bill, arguing that its focus on only the largest AI models leaves out smaller ones that can also be risky. Instead, he says, we should pass comprehensive regulations on the technology.
If this doesn’t sound quite right to you, you’re not alone.
Despite claims by prominent opponents of the bill that “literally no one wants this”, SB1047 was popular – really popular. It passed the California legislature with an average of two-thirds of each chamber voting in favor. Six statewide polls that presented pro and con arguments for the bill show strong majorities in support, which rose over time. A September national poll found 80% of Americans thought Newsom should sign the bill. It was also endorsed by the two most-cited AI researchers alive, along with more than 110 current and former staff of the top-five AI companies.
The core of SB1047 would have established liability for creators of AI models in the event they cause a catastrophe and the developer didn’t take appropriate safety measures.
These provisions received support from at least 80% of California voters in an August poll.
So how do we make sense of this divide?
The aforementioned surveys were all commissioned or conducted by SB1047-sympathetic groups, prompting opponents to dismiss them as biased.
But even when a bill-sympathetic polling shop collaborated with an opponent to test “con” arguments in September, 62% of Californians were in favor.
Moreover, these results don’t surprise me at all. I’m writing a book on the economics and politics of AI and have analyzed years of nationwide polling on the topic. The findings are pretty consistent: people worry about risks from AI, favor regulations, and don’t trust companies to police themselves. Incredibly, these findings tend to hold true for both Republicans and Democrats.
So why would Newsom buck the popular bill?
Well, the bill was fiercely resisted by most of the AI industry, including Google, Meta and OpenAI. The US has let the industry self-regulate, and these companies desperately don’t want that to change – whatever sounds their leaders make to the contrary.
AI investors such as the venture fund Andreessen Horowitz, also known as a16z, mounted a smear campaign against the bill, saying anything they thought would kill the bill and hiring lobbyists with close ties to Newsom.
AI “godmother” and Stanford professor Fei-Fei Li parroted Andreessen Horowitz’s misleading talking points about the bill in the pages of Fortune – never disclosing that she runs a billion-dollar AI startup backed by the firm.
Then, eight congressional Democrats from California asked Newsom for a veto in an open letter, which was first published by an Andreessen Horowitz partner.
The top three names on the congressional letter – Zoe Lofgren, Anna Eshoo, and Ro Khanna – have collectively taken more than $4m in political contributions from the industry, accounting for nearly half of their lifetime top-20 contributors. Google was their biggest donor by far, with nearly $1m in total.
The death knell probably came from the former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, who published her own statement against the bill, citing the congressional letter and Li’s Fortune op-ed.
In 2021, reporters discovered that Lofgren’s daughter is a lawyer for Google, which prompted a watchdog to ask Pelosi to negotiate her recusal from antitrust oversight roles.
Who came to Lofgren’s defense? Eshoo and Khanna.
Three years later, Lofgren remains in these roles, which have helped her block efforts to rein in big tech – against the will of even her Silicon Valley constituents.
Pelosi’s 2023 financial disclosure shows that her husband owned between $16m and $80m in stocks and options in Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Nvidia.
When I asked if these investments pose a conflict of interest, Pelosi’s spokesperson replied: “Speaker Pelosi does not own any stocks, and she has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions.”
SB1047’s primary author, California state senator Scott Wiener, is widely expected to run for Pelosi’s congressional seat upon her retirement. His likely opponent? Christine Pelosi, the former speaker’s daughter, fueling speculation that Pelosi may be trying to clear the field.
In Silicon Valley, AI is the hot thing and a perceived ticket to fortune and power. In Congress, AI is something to regulate … later, so as to not upset one of the wealthiest industries in the country.
But the reality on the ground is that AI is more a source of fear and resentment. California’s state legislators, who are more down-to-earth than high-flying national Democrats, appear to be genuinely reflecting – or even moderating – the will of their constituents.
Sunny Gandhi of the youth tech advocacy group Encode Justice, which co-sponsored the bill, told me: “When you tell the average person that tech giants are creating the most powerful tools in human history but resist simple measures to prevent catastrophic harm, their reaction isn’t just disbelief – it’s outrage. This isn’t just a policy disagreement; it’s a moral chasm between Silicon Valley and Main Street.”
Newsom just told us which of these he values more.

Guardian,Restaurant chain TGI Fridays files for bankruptcy protection,"Restaurant chain TGI Fridays filed for bankruptcy protection Saturday, saying it is looking for ways to “ensure the long-term viability” of the casual dining brand after closing many of its branches this year.
The Dallas-based company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in a Texas federal court.
TGI Fridays executive chair Rohit Manocha in a statement said the “primary driver of our financial challenges resulted from COVID-19 and our capital structure”.
Sit-down chain restaurants have more broadly faced challenges in recent years as diners choose to get food delivered or visit more upscale fast food chains such as Chipotle and Shake Shack.
A US bankruptcy judge in September approved a reorganization plan for seafood chain Red Lobster after years of mounting losses and dwindling customers.
Founded in 1965, the popularity of TGI Fridays peaked in 2008 with 601 restaurants in the US and a $2bn business, according to Kevin Schimpf, director of industry research at Technomic. Its sales in the US were $728m in 2023, down 15% from the prior year, according to Technomic.
It now counts 163 restaurants in the US, down from 269 last year. It closed 36 in January and dozens more in the past week.
TGI Fridays Inc said it only owns and operates 39 restaurants in the US, which is just a fraction of the 461 TGI Fridays-branded restaurants around the world. A separate entity, TGI Fridays Franchisor, owns the intellectual property and has franchised the brand to 56 independent owners in 41 countries. Those remain open.",2024-11-02
Guardian,US presidential election updates: Kamala Harris and Donald Trump swing through Wisconsin,"Kamala Harris and Donald Trump held duelling rallies within miles of each other in swing state Wisconsin’s largest city, Milwaukee, on Friday night. Milwaukee is home to the most Democratic votes in Wisconsin, but its conservative Republican suburbs are a critical area for Trump as he tries to reclaim the state he narrowly won in 2016 but lost in 2020.
Earlier, Trump continued to attack Liz Cheney at a rally in Warren, Michigan, where he also lamented the state of his hair. “It looks not so good today … not a good hair day for me, ay ay ay.” After his campaign rhetoric earlier tipped over from hateful to violent – when he suggested Cheney should be shot at with “nine barrels” and the guns “trained on her face” – the attorney general’s office in Arizona, where Trump made the remark, opened a “death threat investigation”.
In Pennsylvania, a neck-and-neck race is hurtling toward the finish line of the 2024 election with no clear frontrunner. The victor of Pennsylvania and its 19 electoral votes, the most of any battleground state, will probably win the electoral college and determine the trajectory of the country for the next four years.
Here’s what else happened on Friday:
Kamala Harris election news and updates
-
Harris told her crowd at the Wisconsin State Fair Park Exposition Center that with four days to go, there was still work to do, but “we like hard work”. Minutes beforehand, during a raucous warmup, the rapper Cardi B referred to Trump as “Donnie Dunk” and told the crowd: “Trump says he’s going to protect women whether they like it or not. Well, if his definition of protection is not the freedom of choice, if his definition of protection is making sure our daughters have fewer rights than our mothers, then I don’t want it! I don’t want it! I don’t want it!”
-
Earlier, Harris said Trump’s violent rhetoric about Cheney “must be disqualifying” as far as his suitability for the presidency is concerned. “Representative Cheney is a true patriot who has shown extraordinary courage in putting country above party.” Cheney for her part warned the public against dictatorship and a presidential candidate who “wants to be a tyrant”.
-
Republicans’ latest offensive and misogynistic comments have boosted Democratic hopes of turning out women on election day in a contest where the rights of women have been a central issue for the Harris campaign.
Donald Trump election news and updates
-
At his Milwaukee rally on Friday, Trump called Harris a “low-IQ person” and vowed to save the economy “from total obliteration” in a 1.5-hour-long meandering speech that touched on the economy and foreign policy but also featured threats to curb press freedoms and a lengthy discussion of his own rhetorical style. “I will stop the criminal invasion of this country,” said Trump, promising to usher in a new “golden age”. “Can you imagine if Kamala won? You would go down to a 1929-style depression.”
-
Trump’s supporters are laying the ground for rejecting the result of the election if he loses, according to warnings from Democrats as well as anti-Maga Republicans. As well as baseless and/or failed lawsuits, suspicions have been voiced over partisan polls run by groups with Republican links in battleground states that mainly show Trump leading – the idea being that if Trump loses, the polls can be proferred as “evidence” that he was cheated out of the win.
-
The New York author and journalist Michael Wolff has released audio tapes that appear to detail how Trump had a close social relationship with the late sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein that he has long denied. Wolff says the recordings were made during a 2017 discussion with Epstein about writing his biography. Epstein died by suicide while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges two years later. Trump’s campaign said the claims, made on Wolff’s podcast Fire and Fury, amounted to “outlandish false smears”.
Elsewhere on the campaign trail
-
A federal judge rejected an attempt by Elon Musk’s America Pac to have charges of running an illegal lottery heard in federal court, instead of the courts of Pennsylvania, where Musk is running the sweepstakes to help Trump get re-elected. The case has been sent back to the Pennsylvania state court for a further hearing on Monday.
-
Racism and misogyny; a firing squad death threat to a former congresswoman; the Republican candidate for president dressing up as a sanitation worker in the cab of a garbage truck. Donald Trump’s final full week on the campaign trail was as unedifying as it was bizarre – Richard Luscombe sums it up.
-
A valuable Republican voting bloc in Arizona is seeing a shift of its members towards Harris in numbers that Democrats believe could make the difference for them in an election where the latest polls have Trump slightly ahead. That bloc is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints – the Mormons.

Guardian,Memoir contradicts Republican Senate candidate’s ‘below the poverty line’ tale,"At a recent campaign event in Whitehall, Montana, the Republican US Senate candidate Tim Sheehy told voters that a decade ago, when he set up the aerial firefighting company through which he made his fortune, he and his wife were living “below the poverty line”.
“My wife and I homeschool our kids,” Sheehy said. “We made that decision several years ago. She’s a Marine, naval academy graduate, she could have a great job and even when our company was tiny, and we … were below the poverty line and making no money, we said: ‘No … the most important job in the world is being a mother.’ And she’s doing that every day.”
A little more than a month from election day, in a race that could decide control of the Senate, such hardscrabble tales are helping Sheehy lead the Democratic incumbent, Jon Tester, a longtime Montana farmer. The two men are due to debate in Missoula on Monday night.
But Sheehy’s claim about living in poverty while building his company, Bridger Aerospace, is contradicted by his own memoir.
In that book, Mudslingers, published last year, the former navy Seal writes that when he and his wife contemplated leaving the military, in 2013, they “weren’t wealthy, but … did have resources”.
This, he writes, was in part thanks to having “lived quite frugally during our time in the military, spending a lot of time deployed, accumulating savings, taking advantage of base housing and meals, and of course spending almost nothing while on deployment.
“So, we had amassed a nest egg of close to $300,000. I also had some money that my parents had been putting away for me since I was a kid. All told, we had roughly $400,000 to allocate toward building a business and establishing a new life.”
In 2014, as Sheehy got his company going, the US health department defined the poverty guideline for a family of three in Montana as $19,790. The poverty threshold, as defined by the US Census Bureau, was $19,055.
By his own account, Sheehy set out to build Bridger Aerospace with 20 times that – a sum he calls “not exactly chump change”.
Sheehy has also regularly claimed to have “bootstrapped” his company, a term the Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines as “to promote or develop by initiative and effort with little or no assistance”.
Yet in his book, Sheehy describes both receiving the $100,000 his parents had saved for him and asking his father and brother to help him pay $500,000 to buy necessary planes. His father, he writes, “backed me, financially and emotionally, without expecting anything in return”, while his brother was given an “equity stake in the business”.
Sheehy also describes how in 2017 his brother helped secure investment from Blackstone Group, the New York private equity behemoth led by Stephen Schwartzman, a top Republican donor, in order to pull off a $200m aircraft order.
Sheehy grew up in Minnesota and attended the US Naval Academy in Maryland. Describing his early days in Montana, he has often told of how he, his wife and their first child started out living in a tent. That might boost his claim of living below the poverty line, but Sheehy has also described how living under canvas was a choice.
Having purchased “60 undeveloped acres”, Sheehy writes in his book, “the simple and probably sane thing to do would have been to rent an apartment in town while we got the business off the ground”. But they chose to build a house, and to camp while the structure went up.
Sheehy’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment. News of Sheehy’s book contradicting his own claim about living in poverty, however, follows similar reporting regarding his claims about his background.
The Montana Free Press was among outlets to report that though Sheehy has said he grew up in “rural Minnesota … surrounded by farmland”, he in fact “grew up in a multimillion-dollar lake house, learned to fly under the tutelage of a neighbour, [and] attended a private high school”.
In May, the Daily Beast reported that Sheehy’s campaign trail claims about how he left the US military do not match those in his book. Sheehy’s campaign responded angrily, claiming an attack on his patriotism and service. Then, this month, the Guardian reported documents seemingly showing Sheehy did not follow Department of Defense protocol for clearing sections of Mudslingers that deal with military subjects, including deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. The campaign did not respond.
Regardless, Sheehy seems well-placed to secure a Senate seat, holding seven- and eight-point leads over Tester, a three-term moderate Democrat.
Federal figures regarding poverty in Montana in 2014 do back up one claim in Sheehy’s book. Describing how he hired his first employees, he says he paid just $1,500 a month, amounting to $18,000 a year, to his first chief pilot, Tim Cherwin.
Cherwin brought with him “the chain-smoking desert rat Steve Taylor, who would become our director of maintenance”. Sheehy, who says he started the business with $400,000, says both men were “earning wages below the poverty line”.",2024-09-30
Guardian,Ukrainians ask what I'm hearing about our country on the US campaign trail. The truth? We're all but forgotten | Nataliya Gumenyuk,"Around a month before the US elections, in the Kharkiv region, I sat down with a group of Ukrainian infantry soldiers together with the American historian Timothy Snyder. I suggested they ask questions of him not only as an American historian, but also as an American citizen.
The servicemen were curious about the upcoming election, but mainly the chances of receiving significant military aid any time soon. They expressed pity that many Americans still don’t understand that the Ukrainian fight is not just about us. It’s in the world’s interests to support the fight against blatant breaches of the international order.
The anxiety of the American elections is felt more strongly in Kyiv among Ukrainian officials and civil society leaders because Ukraine has become a partisan issue, and part of US domestic politics. These groups have been trying for years to be on good terms with both Democrats and Republicans in the US. This was especially true during the long delays in Congress over the vote for security assistance to Ukraine. But engaging with the Maga camp has become difficult. This only got worse when it was revealed what Donald Trump’s vice-presidential candidate, JD Vance, said in 2022: “I gotta be honest with you, I don’t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another.” During the race, Vance has characterised Vladimir Putin as an “adversary” and “competitor”, rather than an enemy, and has generally argued that the US should be focusing on China, not Russia.
Then there are the claims from Trump that he could end the war in “24 hours”, presumably with a phone call to Putin. To be honest, these sort of statements don’t worry Ukrainians that much since they don’t sound remotely realistic. There are no signs the Russian president is changing his goal to destroy Ukraine as a state. What people are really worried about is the slowing down, or even stopping, of US military assistance.
In Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, one of the most important battleground states, I had a chance to talk to various Ukrainian Americans, including those from the older, more conservative diaspora, who have traditionally voted Republican. They shared strong anti-communist sentiment in the past but today are more united around ideas of faith and family values. Some of them told me they were worried by Vance’s remarks. Still, their arguments would alight elsewhere: it was the Democrat Barack Obama who didn’t firmly react to the Russian occupation of Crimea in 2014 and refused to provide military aid. Some of those narratives can be heard among conservative Ukrainians back home, too.
Ukrainians often ask me what exactly the candidates are saying about our country on the campaign trail. I had to reply that, honestly, Ukraine wasn’t being explicitly mentioned at the rallies, at least the ones I attended. In Saginaw, Michigan, a manufacturing town, Vance didn’t mention Ukraine even once, mainly warning about the risks of local workers losing their jobs because of Chinese electric vehicles. Kamala Harris, at a campaign rally in the university town of Ann Arbor, spoke of Trump’s fascination with authoritarian leaders like Putin.
Trump himself, speaking in Pennsylvania, did say at least three times that he wouldn’t spend taxpayers’ money on wars “in countries you have never heard of and don’t want to hear of”. The audience loudly cheered.
After Joe Biden dropped out of the race, some people in Kyiv hoped that he could now afford to be less cautious and use his remaining time in office to accelerate support for Ukraine. The speculation was that he would want a positive foreign policy legacy to leave behind, amid the retreat from Afghanistan and tragedy unfolding in the Middle East. By October, it became clear that the current US administration wasn’t planning on doing anything big before the election.
Some measures were taken. On 23 October, Washington finalised its $20bn portion of a $50bn loan to Ukraine backed by frozen Russian assets. This will be placed alongside a separate $20bn EU commitment and $10bn split between Britain, Japan and Canada. It is supposed to be repaid with the earnings from the more than $300bn in sovereign Russian assets that were immobilised in February 2022 and are mostly held in Europe.
But in the long run, the lives of Ukrainian soldiers depend not just on the funds for military aid but on specific types of weapons. President Zelenskyy has spent recent months lobbying in the west for his “victory plan”, which would involve the US providing long-range missiles to Ukraine, which could strike deep inside Russia – something western powers have been reluctant to approve. His argument is that this may not just turn the tide on the battlefield, but take away the burden from those suffering the most – Ukrainian infantry. Without that, the Ukrainian army is left to rely on exhausted footsoldiers. Whether or not this plan has any chance of progressing will depend in large part on who wins next week.
Right after landing in New York, a US colleague asked me if “it was all over for Ukraine if it didn’t receive US assistance after the elections”. I was puzzled by the way the question was asked. I explained that it might be extremely difficult to preserve the lives of Ukrainians if, say, Trump is elected, but it wouldn’t mean the Ukrainian army will stop trying to defend its fellow citizens or simply give up.
Travelling from one swing state to another, I detected an extreme sense of anxiety among many Americans. It was so palpable, I felt the need to comfort them. Whatever happens, on the morning of 6 November, life in Ukraine will go on. The same will be true in the US. But it doesn’t mean things will be easy. Ukrainians have learned in recent years that worrying can be a luxury; the best option is to commit yourself to working hard to avoid the worst-case scenario, and fighting for what’s right.

Guardian,Can ex-governor’s anti-Trump stance swing key Senate seat for Republicans?,"At a conservative thinktank on 14th Street in Washington DC, awaiting Larry Hogan, the Republican candidate for US Senate in Maryland, one staffer turned to another. “It’s nice having something to vote for, for a change,” the staffer wryly said. Shortly after, the former governor arrived for his speech at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (Jinsa), part of his campaign to win in a state that hasn’t elected a Republican senator since 1980.
When he left the executive mansion in Annapolis last year, Hogan told his friendly audience, he had governed for eight years as a popular moderate but had not been looking for another job – “And frankly, I didn’t yearn to be a part of the divisiveness and dysfunction in Washington,” he said.
“But when I saw a bipartisan package to secure our border and to support Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan and other American allies fail because people were told [by Donald Trump] to vote against a critical [immigration] bill that they claimed to be for, it made me frustrated enough that I knew I had to step up and try to do something about the mess in Washington.”
Washington is not Maryland but the Old Line State is just a few miles up 14th from Jinsa. There, Hogan faces the Prince George’s county executive, Angela Alsobrooks, for an open seat in November – a race in which the Democrat, who if she wins will be only the third Black woman ever elected to the US Senate, enjoys significant polling leads.
The race has become potentially decisive in determining Senate control, and a test of anti-Trump sentiment on the right. Significant spending and endorsements are pouring in. Highly regarded as a local leader and “tough on crime” Democrat, Alsobrooks defeated a DC establishment candidate, the congressman David Trone, in her primary and is now piling on praise from party grandees. She recently released an ad featuring Barack Obama and secured support from the Washington Post.
On Thursday night, the two candidates will meet for a high-stakes debate.
In practical terms, it takes 51 votes – or 50 if your party holds the presidency – to control the Senate. Democrats currently hold it 51-49 but face tough contests to hold seats in Republican-leaning states such as Montana and Ohio. It means Maryland counts this year, and Hogan’s toughest challenge may lie in persuading enough Democratic voters they can trust him should Republicans retake the chamber with him as the 51st vote. In turn, Democrats know that if they cannot hold so deep blue a state as Maryland, they will in all likelihood lose control of the Senate.
Hogan is therefore seeking to depict himself as an antidote to Trump – and his rival as too far left. At Jinsa, talking foreign policy, he criticized Trump but he also knocked Alsobrooks, including for “repeatedly demand[ing] that Israel enact an immediate and unilateral ceasefire, and [for calling] for cutting off critical military aid”.
As popular as Hogan is – he stepped down as governor with a 77% approval rating – polling suggests that message is not landing. According to 538, since one tied poll in August, Alsobrooks’s lead has ranged from five to 17 points.
Hogan begged to differ. “I think it’s a very close race,” he said. “I’ve always been an underdog in every one of my races.
“There are people out there that we’ve still got to convince,” he added, “and we’ve got [then] 34 more days to do it, and I feel confident we’re going to win the race. It’s tough, though. I mean, we’re a very blue state, and we’re overcoming a huge deficit at the top of the ticket.”
Trump has been called many things, but “huge deficit” may be a new one. Hogan has said he won’t vote for Trump (or Kamala Harris), but must nonetheless fend off persistent questions about the man who rules his party. One recent ad from Hogan’s campaign deplored the “horror” of January 6. And yet, as Republicans from Trump and the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, on down know, sometimes a candidate must be allowed away from the party line.
In Maryland, Hogan is free to be Hogan. That’s to his advantage. To his disadvantage, Democrats from the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, to Alsobrooks on down know Hogan has a bigger problem.
In June 2022, in the case Dobbs v Jackson, the US supreme court to which Trump appointed three hardliners removed the federal right to abortion. Two years on, Hogan insists he will not let his party go further.
“[Alsobrooks’s campaign] want[s] to focus on making it a cookie-cutter Democratic talking points race but it’s not, because I have a different position than most Republicans,” he said at the Jinsa event. “And so, you know, I’ve promised to be a sponsor to codify Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling that previously safeguarded abortion rights, so that nobody comes between a woman and her doctor in any state in America, and to sponsor a bill to protect IVF.”
He also insisted that “most people are concerned about the economy. They’re concerned about affordability, inflation, they’re concerned about crime in their communities, and they’re concerned about securing the border and fixing [the] broken immigration system.”
Among Democratic rejoinders: while a member of the executive committee of the Republican Governors Association, Hogan worked to elect allies in states that now have stringent abortion bans. In his own state, in 2022, he vetoed a bill to expand abortion access. The same year, he said Trump “nominated incredible justices to the supreme court”, a comment Democrats have brought back to haunt him. Hogan says he was not referring to Dobbs but Alsobrooks is happy to keep the spotlight on the issue. As she recently said: “I think my opponent’s record is very clear where abortion care is concerned.”
Many Americans fear a national abortion ban, should Trump be president again. Hogan said he had been against that for decades “and I’ll be the one of the ones standing up, regardless of who the president is or who’s in control of Senate”. But he also said he would not support reform to the filibuster, the Senate rule that requires 60 votes for most legislation, in order to codify Roe.
“I think it’s a terrible idea, because it’s actually something that … my opponent and Donald Trump both agree on. They want to be able to jam things through on a 51-vote [majority].
”Right now, [the Senate is] a deliberative body where we actually have to find bipartisan cooperation and common sense and kind of common ground for the common good. That’s what I did in Maryland with a 70% Democratic legislature. We got things done.”
A few days after Hogan’s event at Jinsa, about 40 miles (65km) north-east in Baltimore, Democrats gathered at a canvassing hub. Once a wedding venue, the Majestic Hall of Events was surrounded by less-than-majestic auto shops and down-at-heel churches. Inside, Alsobrooks addressed a crowd organized by D4 Women in Action, linked to Delta Sigma Theta, one of the Divine Nine Black women’s sororities, to which Alsobrooks belongs.
In her speech, Alsobrooks spoke about her links to Baltimore and “the number one issue across our state, and the thing that people most desire to have: economic opportunity”. She also took shots at her opponent. “What did he do [as governor] when he had the opportunity to stand up for all of our families in Baltimore? He sent back $900m to the federal government.”
That was a reference to a 2015 decision to scrap a light rail project, a call that attracted lawsuits. But Alsobrooks also looked to the national stage, and the issue she wants foremost in voters’ minds.
“This race is bigger than both of us,” Alsobrooks told the Guardian. “Bigger than Larry Hogan the person. It’s bigger than Angela the person. It’s about issues and about the future. It is about reproductive freedom.”
Alsobrooks listed other policy priorities – “sensible gun legislation … economic opportunity” – as part of a platform “that really does favor hard-working people, middle-class families, and that is about preserving freedoms and democracy”. But protecting abortion rights was a theme to which she returned.
At Jinsa, Hogan said Democrats were trying to turn a state race into a national contest. Alsobrooks embraced the charge: “The former governor thinks he’s running to go back to Annapolis. We’re actually running to go to Washington DC, and we would represent Marylanders there.”
She added: “This [Republican Senate] caucus is led by people like Ted Cruz, Lindsey Graham, Rick Scott, Mitch McConnell, and they … have really proclaimed war on the reproductive freedoms of women. They have very clear records, and [Hogan has] aligned himself with the party whose policies do not align with the average Marylander.”
Much has been made of the warm relationship Hogan and Alsobrooks enjoyed when Hogan was governor. Asked about an unearthed Hogan comment – that Alsobrooks was a better Prince George’s county executive than his own father, the late congressman Lawrence Hogan – Alsobrooks said: “He has become, in a lot of ways, the kind of politician he says he despises, one who’s very disingenuous.
“But I think that people see through it. Marylanders are very savvy and they have seen how he has changed … and I think they will see through the disingenuous nature of his campaign, and will again vote to keep Maryland Democratic.”
Keeping Maryland Democratic will require turning out the vote. At the canvassing hub, one phone-banker wearily said: “Put in two shifts this morning.” A friend smiled back: “Only a hundred more to go.”
The same Jinsa staffer who earlier had said it was “nice to have something to vote for” with Hogan also said that he hadn’t felt so good about a Senate race since 2006 – which was still a defeat – in which “getting more than 40% felt like a moral victory”.
Back then, Ben Cardin, the Democrat retiring this year, beat Michael Steele, a Hogan-esque GOP moderate. Steele went on to chair the Republican National Committee, then became an MSNBC host and Never Trumper. Asked for his view of the current Maryland race, Steele was not as convinced of an Alsobrooks win as many other observers.
“This race was not a competitive race until Larry got into it,” Steele said. “He is a popular two-term governor who left, I think, an important mark on how politics play out in Maryland for Republicans and made this very competitive out of the gate, largely because people had come to trust his style of governance.
“It’s open, it’s compassionate, it’s concerned … I think a lot of people remember that.”
Steele said Hogan had a good chance of attracting split-ticket voters – rare beasts, precious to any campaign, in this case prepared to back Harris for president but Hogan for Senate.
It all added up to a warning for anyone expecting a comfortable Democratic win.
“I think the latest polling has Alsobrooks up by 11,” Steele said. “I don’t believe that, largely because when I’m out in neighborhoods talking to people, and from everything I can piece together, this race is a lot tighter than the traditionalists who look at Maryland think it to be.”

Guardian,White House blasts false claims about Hurricane Helene and relief aid,"The White House moved Saturday to quash claims that government officials control the weather, including a far-fetched rumor circulating on social media that Hurricane Helene was an engineered storm to allow corporations to mine regional lithium deposits.
“We have seen a large increase in false information circulating online related to the federal response to Hurricane Helene,” a statement said, pointing to a “number of scam artists, bad-faith actors, and others who want to sow chaos because they think it helps their political interests are promoting disinformation about the recovery effort.”
The White House said the rumors, which include claims that emergency disaster money had been spent housing immigrants and that relief funds would be limited to $750 per claim, were “wrong, dangerous” and said “it must stop immediately”.
The warning, which speaks to the intense political environment Helene figuratively crashed into, came hours after Biden told lawmakers to refill the coffers of disaster relief programs as the projected recovery and rebuilding costs related to Hurricane Helene are estimated to be as much as $200bn over 10 years.
In a letter sent to congressional leaders, the president said while the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) and the Department of Defense are able to meet “critical life-saving and life-sustaining missions and will continue to do so within present funding levels”, they will need additional funding.
“My administration has provided robust and well-coordinated federal support for the ongoing response and recovery efforts,” Biden wrote.
“As with other catastrophic disasters, it will take some time to assess the full requirements for response and recovery efforts, and I fully expect that the Congress will do its part to provide the funding needed.”
Biden said that a comprehensive disaster relief package would be necessary when Congress returns on 12 November – but said action on individual programs could be needed before then. But there are currently no plans for Congress to reconvene before the election.
The request comes as Kamala Harris cut short a campaign swing through the western states to visit western North Carolina in the southern Appalachian mountains where entire towns were washed away.
Biden viewed the damage and cleanup efforts in the Carolinas by air on Wednesday, and again in Florida and Georgia on Thursday. He said the work to rebuild will cost “billions of dollars” and additional disaster relief funding “can’t wait … people need help now”.
At least 225 people have been confirmed dead from Helene, and officials say they expect the death toll to continue to rise as recovery efforts continue. A police department spokesperson in Asheville, North Carolina, told CBS News in an email late on Friday that it is “actively working 75 cases of missing persons”. Nearly 1 million people remain without power.
In his letter to lawmakers, Biden said that funding through the Small Business Administration (SBA) “will run out of funding in a matter of weeks and well before the Congress is planning to reconvene”.
The SBA is designed to help small business owners and homeowners recoup property and equipment through the disaster relief loan program. Administration officials told CNN that the program needs $1.6bn in additional funding to meet about 3,000 Hurricane Helene-related applications it is receiving daily.
Last month, before Helene hit, the White House warned that the low funding levels could lead to the SBA “effectively ceasing operations” after paying out for weather-related costs and accidents, including the Key Bridge collapse in Baltimore, the continued recovery after Maui’s wildfires and tornado damage in the midwest.
The damage caused by Helene could cost upwards of $34bn, according to early estimates from Moody’s Analytics. The private forecaster AccuWeather put the cost of damages at $225bn to $250bn, with very little covered by private insurance.
The issue of Helene costs is already deeply political. The Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, has said lawmakers would assess the post-Helene needs in full after the election.
Former president Trump has accused Democrats of spending over $640m in Fema funds on housing migrants, a claim the White House calls “bold-faced lies”.
On Friday, in Georgia, Trump said: “A lot of the money that was supposed to go to Georgia and supposed to go to North Carolina and all of the others is going and has gone already.
“It’s been gone for people that came into the country illegally, and nobody has ever seen anything like that. That’s a shame.”
Officials say those funds, authorized by Congress, was part of an entirely different program run by Fema unconnected to disaster relief but to provide housing to immigrants applying for US citizenship.
The disaster agency responded to Trump’s claim with a fact-check page. “This is false,” Fema said in a statement. “No money is being diverted from disaster response needs.” A week after the hurricane hit, more than $45m has been dispersed to communities affected by the storm.",2024-10-05
Guardian,Walz asks America to ‘stand up’ for democracy – as it happened,"Here are some of the key lines from the debate between the Democratic and Republican vice-presidential candidates, Tim Walz and JD Vance:
On the Middle East:
Both candidates were asked whether they would support a pre-emptive strike by Israel on Iran. Walz said: “Israel’s ability to defend itself is absolutely fundamental” after the Hamas attacks on 7 October. He said Trump’s own national security advisers have said it’s dangerous for Trump to be in charge. “When our allies see Donald Trump turn towards Vladimir Putin, turn towards North Korea, when we start to see that type of fickleness about holding the coalitions together – we will stay committed,” Walz said.
Vance said it was up to Israel to decide what it needs to do. He said Trump “consistently made the world more secure”.
On the climate crisis:
Vance said he and Trump “support clean air, clean water” when asked what responsibility the Trump administration would have to reduce the impact of climate change. “If we actually care about getting cleaner air and cleaner water, the best thing to do is to double down and invest in American workers and the American people,” he said. He did not answer when asked whether he agreed with Trump that climate change is a hoax.
Walz praised the Biden administration for the Inflation Reduction Act, and criticized Trump for calling climate change a “hoax”. “My farmers know climate change is real,” he said.
On immigration:
Walz criticized Trump for derailing a legislative package that he described as “the fairest and the toughest bill on immigration that this nation’s seen”.
Walz accused Vance of having “vilified a large number of people who worked legally in the community of Springfield”, adding that those immigrants had been “dehumanized”. “This is what happens when you don’t want to solve it,” he said. “You demonize it.”
Vance said the people he was most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, “are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris’s open border”.
At one point, CBS News muted the microphones for both candidates as the moderators tried to turn the debate to the economy.
On the economy:
Walz said presidents should seek advice from advisers around them. “If you’re going to be president, you don’t have all the answers. Donald Trump believes he does,” he said. “My pro-tip is this: if you need heart surgery, listen to the people at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, not Donald Trump.”
On abortion:
Vance said he “never supported a national ban”. He said that Ohio had passed an amendment protecting the right to an abortion, and that it taught him that his Republican party “have got to do a better job of winning back people’s trust”.
Walz rejected Trump’s claim that he supports abortion in the ninth month of pregnancy, saying the accusation “wasn’t true”. He said that under Project 2025, there would a “registry of pregnancies” and that it would “get more difficult, if not impossible, to get contraception and limit access, if not eliminate access, to infertility treatments”.
On mass shootings:
Walz said his 17-year-old son had witnessed a shooting at a community center. He referred to his record in Minnesota, where there are enhanced background checks and red-flag laws in place. “We understand that the second amendment is there, but our first responsibility is to our kids to figure this out,” he said.
Vance said that the country needs to buckle down on border security, and strengthen safety in schools. “We have to make the doors lock better, we have to make the doors stronger,” he said.
On the candidates’ previous comments:
Walz stumbled when asked about his misleading claims that he made about being in Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen protests. “I’ve not been perfect, and I’m a knucklehead at times,” he initially said. When pushed for an answer, he conceded that he “misspoke”.
Vance said he was “wrong about Donald Trump” when asked about his previous criticisms of his running mate. He accused the media of spreading false stories about Trump that he believed, and said he supports Trump because he “delivered for the American people”.
On healthcare:
Vance, when asked how a Trump administration would protect Americans with pre-existing conditions who were able to secure health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act, said there were laws and regulations on the books that should be kept in place. He said the functionality of the health insurance marketplace also needed to be improved.
On paid family leave:
Walz did not give a definitive answer when asked how long employers should be required to pay workers for parental leave. He said paid family leave is beneficial for families because it “gets the child off to a better start”.
Vance said the nation should “have a family care model that makes choice possible”. He said the issue was important to him because he is married to a “beautiful woman” and “incredible mother” who is also a “very brilliant corporate litigator”.
On the January 6 attack on the Capitol:
Walz said democracy is “bigger than winning an election”, and that a “president’s words matter”. He said the January 6 attack “was a threat to our democracy in a way that we have not seen” and that it manifested itself because of Trump’s inability to accept that he had lost the 2020 election.
Vance claimed that Trump wanted protesters to remain peaceful on January 6. He said he believes the biggest threat to democracy is “the threat of censorship”.
Walz directly asked Vance whether Trump lost the 2020 election. Vance declined to answer, instead saying that he was “focused on the future”. “That is a damning non-answer,” Walz said.
Closing remarks:
Walz said he was as “surprised as anybody” at the broad coalition of support that Harris had built, including progressives like Bernie Sanders and Republicans like Dick Cheney. He said Vance had made it clear that he would stand with Trump’s agenda, adding that Harris is “bringing us a politics of joy”.
Vance said that Harris’s polices were to blame for key needs like heat, housing and food being harder to afford. Harris has proposed a lot of things that she wants to accomplish on day one, Vance said, but he noted that Harris has been vice-president for three-and-a-half years and that “day one was 1,400 days ago”.
As the Middle East spiraled towards full-scale war, the US vice presidential debate focused largely on domestic issues, like school shootings and the cost of housing, healthcare, and childcare.
The CBS News debate moderators largely declined to fact-check JD Vance or Tim Walz, asking them instead to respond to each other.
Here are some key takeaways from the debate between the Republican senator from Ohio who wrote a bestselling memoir about poverty in Appalachia and the Democratic football-coach-turned-governor of Minnesota:
The topics of abortion and the likelihood of Trump accepting this year’s result if he loses led to the most interesting moments during the debate.
Walz demanded that Vance agree to abide by the results of the election and commit to a peaceful transfer of power. And he asked Vance whether Trump lost the 2020 election.
“Tim, I’m focused on the future,” Vance replied.
“That is a damning non-answer,” Walz shot back.
Walz noted that Vance was only on the stage because Trump cut ties with his former vice-president, Mike Pence, for certifying the results of the last election.
Vance did not answer the question about whether Trump, who continues to falsely claim the 2020 election was marred by widespread fraud, lost four years ago. The exchange served as a reminder of one of Trump’s biggest vulnerabilities heading into the election, one that the Harris campaign will continue to highlight in the coming weeks.
Reuters has this interesting bit of analysis of Vance’s performance tonight, writing that the Vance on stage was the one the Trump campaign had in mind when Trump selected him as his number two in July.”
The idea then was that the 40-year-old first-term senator and best-selling author of “Hillbilly Elegy” could serve as an articulate and rational voice for Trump’s Make American Great Again movement as well as perhaps one day become a generational torchbearer.
But instead Vance had a rocky rollout on the campaign trail, becoming the target of online scorn and mockery while most often serving as Trump’s attack dog. The headlines were mostly negative, and his approval ratings suffered.
On Tuesday, Vance largely kept his message positive, while taking every opportunity to advocate for Trump.
Vance seemed to be succeeding at a vice-presidential running mate’s primary task: Making the candidate at the top of the ticket more palatable to the viewers at home.
It was clear as the evening progressed, that it was this, rather than trying to smear Walz, that was the goal of the Trump campaign in this debate.
When Harris was considering Walz as her vice-presidential candidate, he reportedly told her that he was a bad debater, and at the outset Vance, wearing a sharp blue suit, a pink tie, plenty of make-up and hair gel, looked the more polished performer. Walz, a former high school teacher and football coach, cut a more bustling figure in a loose black suit.
Vance, the Ohio senator who has been a regular on rightwing news channels for years, was polished from the off, comfortably dodging a question about whether he believes the climate crisis is a “hoax” to lament how much money has been spent on solar panels.
Walz rose to the vice-presidential nomination, in part, through his confident appearances on cable news – it was from there that his famous “weird” characterization of Vance and Trump was born – but appeared initially nervous, and did not reprise his searing critique of his opponents.
Tim Walz and JD Vance took to the stage on Tuesday night for a vice-presidential debate that served up less drama than September’s presidential debate, but offered revealing differences on abortion, school shootings, and immigration.
Three weeks ago Kamala Harris and Donald Trump had endured a contentious hour-and-a-half, with an emotional Trump being goaded into ranting about the number of people who attend his rallies and declaring the vice-president to be a “Marxist”, before reportedly threatening to sue one of the debate moderators. Harris enjoyed a brief polling uptick from that performance.
But on Tuesday, Walz and Vance largely avoided attacks on each other, and instead concentrated their fire on each other’s running mates. It was a more policy-driven discussion than that of their running mates’, but one with a few gaffes that might overshadow some of the substance in coming days.
In a key exchange over abortion, Walz, the governor of Minnesota, followed Harris’s lead in using personal stories.
Trump “brags about how great it was that he put the judges in and overturned Roe v Wade”, Walz said. He noted the case of Amanda Zurawski, who was denied an abortion in Texas despite serious health complications during pregnancy – Zurawski is now part of a group of women suing the state of Texas – and a girl in Kentucky who as a child was raped by her stepfather and became pregnant.
“If you don’t know [women like this], you soon will. Their Project 2025 is going to have a registry of pregnancies,” Walz said, which Vance refuted.
Both candidates were seen more favourably after the debate than before it, according to CNN:
Following the debate, 59% of debate watchers said they had a favorable view of Walz, with just 22% viewing him unfavorably – an improvement from his already positive numbers among the same voters pre-debate (46% favorable, 32% unfavorable).
Debate watchers came away with roughly net neutral views of Vance following the debate: 41% rated him favorably and 44% unfavorably. That’s also an improvement from their image of Vance pre-debate, when his ratings among this group were deeply underwater (30% favorable, 52% unfavorable).
CNN’s snap poll has viewers split over who won the debate – but Vance narrowly wins.
The poll of 574 registered voters saw 51% say that Vance won the debate, with 49% choosing Walz.
Polled before the debate, 54% of voters thought Walz was likelier to win.
CNN adds this caveat: “The poll’s results reflect opinions of the debate only among those voters who tuned in and aren’t representative of the views of the full voting public. Debate watchers in the poll were 3 points likelier to be Democratic-aligned than Republican-aligned, making for an audience that’s about 5 percentage points more Democratic-leaning than all registered voters nationally.”",2024-10-02

Guardian,Contested state supreme court seats are site of hidden battle for abortion access,"Abortion will be on the ballot in 10 states on Tuesday, and it’s one of the top issues in the presidential contest between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. But it is also key to less publicized but increasingly contested races for seats on state supreme courts, which often have the last word on whether a state will ban or protect access to the procedure.
This year, voters in 33 states have the chance to decide who sits on their state supreme courts. Judges will be on the ballot in Arizona and Florida, where supreme courts have recently ruled to uphold abortion bans. They are also up for election in Montana, where the supreme court has backed abortion rights in the face of a deeply abortion-hostile state legislature.
In addition, supreme court judges are on the ballot in Maryland, Nebraska and Nevada – all of which are holding votes on measures that could enshrine access to abortion in their state constitutions. Should those measures pass, state supreme courts will almost certainly determine how to interpret them.
Indeed, anti-abortion groups are already gearing up for lawsuits.
“We’re all going to end up in court, because they’re going to take vague language from these ballot initiatives to ask for specific things like funding for all abortions, abortion for minors without parental consent,” said Kristi Hamrick, chief media and policy strategist for the powerful anti-abortion group Students for Life of America, which is currently campaigning around state supreme court races in Arizona and Oklahoma. “Judges have become a very big, important step in how abortion law is actually realized.”
In Michigan and Ohio, which voted in 2022 and 2023 respectively to amend their state constitution to include abortion rights, advocates are still fighting in court over whether those amendments can be used to strike down abortion restrictions. Come November, however, the ideological makeup of both courts may flip.
Spending in state supreme court races has surged since Roe fell. In the 2021-2022 election cycle, candidates, interest groups and political parties spent more than $100m, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. After adjusting for inflation, that’s almost double the amount spent in any previous midterm cycle.
In 2023, a race for a single seat on the Wisconsin supreme court alone cost $51m – and hinged on abortion rights, as the liberal-leaning candidate talked up her support for the procedure. (As in many other – but not all – state supreme court races, the candidates in Wisconsin were technically non-partisan.) After that election, liberals assumed a 4-3 majority on the Wisconsin supreme court. The court is now set to hear a case involving the state’s 19th-century abortion ban, which is not currently being enforced but is still on the books.
It’s too early to tally up the money that has been dumped into these races this year, especially because much of it is usually spent in the final days of the election. But the spending is all but guaranteed to shatter records.
In May, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee and Planned Parenthood Votes announced that they were teaming up this cycle to devote $5m to ads, canvassing and get-out-the-vote efforts in supreme court races in Arizona, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas. Meanwhile, the ACLU and its Pac, the ACLU Voter Education Fund, has this year spent $5.4m on non-partisan advertising and door-knocking efforts in supreme court races in Michigan, Montana, North Carolina and Ohio. The scale of these investments was unprecedented for both Planned Parenthood and the ACLU, according to Douglas Keith, a senior counsel in the Brennan Center for Justice’s Judiciary Program who tracks supreme court races.

“For a long time, judicial campaign ads often were just judges saying that they were fair and independent and had family values, and that was about it. Now, you’re seeing judges talk about abortion rights or voting rights or environmental rights in their campaign ads,” Keith said.
By contrast, rightwing judicial candidates are largely avoiding talk of abortion, Keith said, as the issue has become ballot box poison for Republicans in the years since Roe fell. Still, the Judicial Fairness Initiative, the court-focused arm of the Republican State Leadership Committee, announced in August that it would make a “seven-figure investment” in judicial races in Arizona, Michigan, Montana, North Carolina, Ohio and Texas.
Balancing the federal bench
Abortion is far from the only issue over which state courts hold enormous sway. They also play a key role in redistricting, LGBTQ+ rights, voting rights and more. And with the US Congress so gridlocked, state-level legislation and its legality has only grown in importance.
For years, conservative operatives have focused on remaking the federal judiciary in their ideological image – an effort that culminated in Donald Trump’s appointments of three US supreme court justices and has made federal courts generally more hostile to progressive causes. Now, the ACLU hopes to make state supreme courts into what Deirdre Schifeling, its chief political and advocacy officer, calls a “counterbalance” to this federal bench.
“We have a plan through 2030 to work to build a more representative court,” said Schifeling, who has a spreadsheet of the supreme court races that will take place across eight states for years to come. (As a non-partisan organization, the ACLU focuses on voter education and candidates’ “civil rights and civil liberties” records.) This cycle, the organization’s messaging has centered on abortion.
“Nationally, you’re seeing polling that shows the top thing that voters are voting on is the economy. But these judges don’t really influence the economy,” Schifeling said. “Of the issues that they can actually influence and have power over, reproductive rights is by far the most important to voters.”
Abortion rights supporters are testing out this strategy even in some of the United States’ most anti-abortion states. In Texas, where ProPublica this week reported two women died after being denied emergency care due to the state’s abortion ban, former US air force undersecretary Gina Ortiz Jones has launched the Find Out Pac, which aims to unseat three state supreme court justices.
Justices Jane Bland, Jimmy Blacklock and John Devine, the Pac has declared, “fucked around with our reproductive freedom” in cases upholding Texas’s abortion restrictions. Now, Jones wants them out.
“Why would we not try to hold some folks accountable?” Jones said. “This is the most direct way in which Texas voters can have their voices heard on this issue.” (There is no way for citizens to initiate a ballot measure in Texas.) The Pac has been running digital ads statewide on how the Texas ban has imperiled access to medically necessary care.
However, since state supreme court races have long languished in relative obscurity, voters don’t always know much about them and may very well default to voting on party lines in the seven states where the ballots list the affiliations of nominees for the bench. Although the majority of Texans believe abortions should be legal in all or some cases, nearly half of Texans don’t recall seeing or hearing anything about their supreme court in the last year, according to Find Out Pac’s own polling.
“This conversation that we’re having in Texas, around the importance of judicial races, is new for us as Democrats,” Jones said. “It’s not for the Republicans.”",2024-11-02

Guardian,"US inflation falls to 2.1%, almost hitting Federal Reserve target","A closely watched measure of US inflation has slipped to its lowest level since 2021, within striking distance of policymakers’ target, after the Federal Reserve scrambled to bring down price growth from its highest level in a generation.
The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose at an annual rate of 2.1% last month, down from 2.2% in August and in line with economists’ expectations.
The progress was underlined by official data released five days before the US presidential election.
The state of the world’s largest economy – and the cost of living in it – has played a central role in the contest between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump to succeed Joe Biden.
Inflation surged three years ago, peaking at its highest level in four decades as the impact of Covid-19 continued to roil the global economy.
Officials at the Fed, having initially insisted that an acceleration in price growth would be “transitory”, later engineered an extraordinary U-turn and embarked upon an aggressive campaign to tackle it. The Fed would go on to lift interest rates to a two-decade high – and only started to cut them last month.
The central bank’s effort was designed to bring inflation down to its target of 2%.
The so-called “core” PCE index – which strips out volatile food and energy costs – rose 2.7% in September, in line with recent months, but slightly above economists’ expectations of 2.6%.
While inflation has fallen dramatically, years of price increases continue to take their toll on many Americans. The economy has remained remarkably resilient – and continued to grow at a robust pace in the third quarter, according to data released on Wednesday – but almost half of voters wrongly believe the US is in recession, according to a Harris Poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian last month.
Such polling frustrated Biden. When the president withdrew from the election this summer, making way for Harris, his vice-president was more willing to acknowledge that the cost of living remained “just too high” for many.
As Trump has argued that America is in economic decline, the White House has sought to underline positive economic figures in recent months. Hiring unexpectedly accelerated in September, and data for October will be released on Friday.",2024-10-31
Guardian,Donald Trump is a superspreader for a craziness that has split America in two | Simon Tisdall,"Is Donald Trump going mad? It depends how you define the word. But since he’s hoping to be elected US president on Tuesday, it would be handy to know. Democrats describe him as “weird” and “unhinged”. His rival, Kamala Harris, raised the “M” question again last week. “This is someone who is “unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power,” she warned.
Harris, to her credit, was being relatively polite, though goodness knows why, given the way he disses and demeans her. So let’s pose the question in more colloquial, idiomatic terms. Has stark raving Trump finally lost his marbles? Are there bats in the belfry? If he’s off his rocker, not playing with a full deck and away with the fairies, the world and the voters have a right to know.
Harris’s assessment is obviously not an objective medical diagnosis of mental disorder. It’s a normal person’s reaction to the abnormal things Trump says and does. Crazy-strange campaign speeches by him and his supporters, notably at Madison Square Garden last weekend – a gathering akin to a Nazi Nuremberg rally – are reviving the debate about his sanity that began during his first term.
In The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump, published in 2017, a group of 27 psychiatrists, psychologists, and other mental health professionals raised numerous red flags. One contributor suggested he was clearly off his chump: “Trump is now the most powerful head of state in the world, and one of the most impulsive, arrogant, ignorant, disorganised, chaotic, nihilistic, self-contradictory, self-important, and self-serving.”
That professional opinion, made seven years ago, still rings true. Yet is the madness of “King” Trump, like the madness of King George (whose tyrannical rule Trump seeks to emulate), getting worse?
By one measure – his wild, deranged language – the deterioration is marked. “His speeches have grown coarser and coarser,” wrote veteran White House watcher Peter Baker, who dubs him “the profanity president”.
“Counting tamer four-letter words like ‘damn’ and ‘hell,’ he has cursed in public at least 1,787 times in 2024,” Baker wrote. His analysis shows Trump is using such language 69% more often than when he ran in 2016. It’s shocking, even by today’s tawdry standards. Trump calls Harris a “shit vice-president” who is “mentally impaired”. Doubtless he knows of what he speaks.
Vulgarity, however gross, is not proof of madness. But it may be symptomatic. The Merriam-Webster dictionary, America’s oldest, defines a mad person as one “completely unrestrained by reason and judgment; unable to think in a clear or sensible way”. Trump aces this definition every time he opens his mouth. It fits him to a tee. Exhibit A: his oddball musings about golfer Arnold Palmer’s penis.
Bizarre Trump traits, such as compulsive, blatant lying, meet another dictionary definition of madness – behaviour that is “incapable of being explained or accounted for”.
A third definition, rooted in US rather than British usage, suggests that Trump is indisputably bananas, in the sense that he is constantly “intensely angry or displeased”. Always feeling furious, feeling “mad as hell”, must be exhausting. It’s enough to drive anyone round the bend. Older people often get irritable, of course; and screw-loose Trump is 78. So is incipient senility, or cognitive decline, another cause of his exceptional looney-ness?
Trump stumbles, mispronounces words, forgets where he is and loses his train of thought. Just like Joe Biden, in fact. But Biden is merely old. Trump is nuts.
Trump has refused to take credible mental acuity tests or release his medical records. Last month, more than 230 healthcare specialists urged him to be more transparent. “As we all age, we lose sharpness and revert to base instincts,” they noted. “We are seeing that from Trump as he uses his rallies… to crudely lash out.”
It may go back to childhood. One theory is that Trump, bullied and bullier, was driven up the wall by maternal love denied. Another theory is that he suffers from “disinhibition”. This is when people become less restrained, the older they get.
But the Atlantic journalist McKay Coppins, who interviewed Trump 10 years ago, says he’s always been this way. His “depthless vanity, his brittle ego, his tragic craving for elite approval” haven’t changed one bit, Coppins wrote.
Narcissism, hedonism, obsession, a need to provoke, scare, shock and scandalise, and chronic, paranoid feelings of victimhood are all indicators of worsening mental imbalance, if not early-onset imbecility. Recent Trump lunacies include claims that flies are buzzing round his head for “suspicious” reasons, North Korea is trying to kill him, the 6 January riot was a “lovefest”, pet-eating migrants are akin to Hannibal Lecter, and that God saved him in the assassination attempt on his life.
If Trump were to go mad on his own time, no problem. Unfortunately, by publicly projecting and displaying mental dysfunction daily on a national stage, he is driving America nuts, too – fans and foes alike. He brings out the worst in everyone, right and left. It could be termed national derangement syndrome (NDS).
The poisonous effect of NDS was on show at Madison Square Garden, where “comedians” amplified Trump’s sexist, racist, hate-filled messages. This superspreader craziness destroys reasoned debate, splits the country into opposing camps (hence the dead-heat opinion polls) and sends blood pressure soaring. Many Americans fear civil violence. That’s bonkers.
This collective madness, akin to mass hysteria, is all-consuming and universally destructive. Like much that happens in America, it reverberates around the globe. Trump’s fascistic Mad Hatter world is also the world of sicko revanchist dictators like Russia’s Putin, Europe’s far-right ultra-nationalist fruitcases, Iran’s manic mullahs and off-their-heads Israeli génocidaires.
It’s a mad, mad, mad, mad world – to hijack the title of Stanley Kramer’s 1963 comedy classic – but it’s no laughing matter. It may be about to get madder still.",2024-11-02
Guardian,US couples: did you vote for a different candidate than your partner in the 2024 election?,"All signs point to a gender gap playing a pivotal role in the 2024 election. Men are overwhelmingly supporting Trump, while women are overwhelmingly voting for Harris, according to multiple polls. This dynamic is playing out in relationships across the United States: wives and girlfriends voting against husband and boyfriends, partners “canceling out” each other’s ballots.
Sometimes, partisan couples are open about their voting choices. Other times, those votes are kept secret. In fact, in the week leading up to election day, the Harris campaign and its allies reminded women that their votes were private – if they wanted to break rank and vote for Democrats, their Republican husbands would never have to know.
Did you vote for a different candidate than your partner in the 2024 election? Did you discuss your vote with your partner?",2024-11-01
Guardian,What to know about early voting and mail-in ballots,"The US election is under way across the country, and so far more than 68.3 million people have voted early, according to the University of Florida’s election lab.
In numerous states, the push to vote before election day, whether by mail or in-person, has amounted to an unprecedented wave of early voting.
More than 97,000 voted on Wisconsin’s first day of early, in-person voting – an “unheard of” level of turnout, wrote the state elections commissioner, Ann Jacobs, on Twitter/X. On 15 October, Georgia’s first day of early voting, the state “shattered records”, according to the secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger. By 23 October, more than 1.9 million people had cast a ballot there in-person or by mail. And in North Carolina, which had been devastated by Hurricane Helene just weeks earlier, more than 353,000 voters turned out to cast a ballot early on 18 October – another state record. By 23 October, more than 1.7 million had voted in the election.
Voting early in-person or absentee allows voters some flexibility in their schedule – by casting a ballot early, they can avoid contending with bad weather, long lines or unexpected scheduling conflicts on election day.
What is early voting? States – with the exception of Mississippi, New Hampshire and Alabama – offer all voters the opportunity to cast a ballot in person at a polling place ahead of election day, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
In those places, registered voters can head to their polling location within the early voting time frame and cast a ballot early. Most states begin counting those ballots on election day, and some require officials to wait until polls are closed to begin counting.
Some states offer a version of early voting called “in-person absentee” voting, in which a voter can obtain and submit an absentee ballot in person at a polling place before election day.
What about absentee voting? Most states allow for some form of absentee voting, in which a voter requests a ballot ahead of time, which officials then send to them in the mail to fill out and return by mail. Some jurisdictions offer voters the option of returning absentee ballots to a secured dropbox. Fourteen states require an excuse for voters to cast a ballot by mail, such as an illness or work scheduling conflict. Eight states practice “all-mail” elections – in those places, all registered voters receive a ballot in the mail, whether or not they plan to use it.
Federal law requires states to send absentee ballots to military voters and voters overseas.
States regulate the “processing” and counting of absentee ballots; most states allow officials to immediately process ballots, which typically entails verifying the signature on the ballot with the voter’s signature from when they registered to vote. Other states require officials to wait until election day to begin processing ballots – which can slow the release of election results.
When does early and absentee voting start this year, and how do I do it? The first ballots of the general election have already been sent to voters in states including Wisconsin and Maryland, and to some eligible voters in Alabama. Mail voting has stalled in North Carolina, where a legal battle over whether or not Robert F Kennedy Jr can appear on the ballot has slowed the process. By 21 September, election officials in many states will have begun sending out absentee ballots.
The specific dates, locations and rules surrounding early and absentee voting vary by state, county and even municipality. First confirm that you are registered to vote and then contact your local election office or check their website for details about early and absentee voting.
A cartogram of US states with bright colors Who votes early and by mail, and does it benefit one party over the other? Research suggests that before 2020, implementing voting by mail did not benefit one party more than another. But in 2020, with the pandemic raging, Democrats urged people to vote by mail to avoid exposure to Covid, and fought legal battles to expand absentee voting in states where the practice had not already been widely adopted. Meanwhile, in the months ahead of the election, Donald Trump claimed falsely that the process was rife with fraud, probably scaring Republican voters away from the remote option.
In the end, Democrats saw gains during the 2020 general election in counties that used mail-in voting, according to data from the Guardian and ProPublica.
In the wake of the 2022 midterm elections, when Democrats outperformed expectations and maintained control of the Senate, Republicans began to reverse course on voting early – and have continued to advocate for voters to embrace the process since then. The reversal appears to have had an impact: in the swing states of Arizona and Nevada, Republicans had outpaced Democrats slightly in early voting turnout by 23 October, according to data collected by the Associated Press .
A purple line chart that is progressively moving upwards over time Is it safe to vote by mail? Mail voting is considered extremely secure in the US, and instances of fraud in mail voting are vanishingly rare. In a 2020 column, the elections expert Rick Hasen noted that between 2000 and 2012, there were fewer than 500 examples of vote-by-mail fraud, out of billions of votes cast. (As the Brennan Center for Justice notes, this makes mail-in voting fraud less likely than being struck by lightning).
While mail-in voting fraud is extremely rare, election officials across the country have raised concerns about postal delays that could result in eligible voters’ ballots reaching election clerks after the deadline to count their ballots.",2024-11-01
Guardian,"In Michigan, attack ads are inescapable. Are they changing any minds?","There is almost no escape. One minute, you’re watching the spin of a wheel on a game show and a few seconds later, Jeffrey Epstein is staring out of the screen with a youthful Donald Trump at his side.
What follows is yet another of the election ads bombarding viewers in Saginaw, Michigan, or any other place likely to decide the outcome of next week’s presidential election. The attack ad goes on to remind viewers that Epstein was accused of sex trafficking and abusing girls as young as 14 years old, and that Trump spent a lot of time in his company.
“1992, Trump was there. 93, Trump was there. 97, Trump was there. 2000, Trump was there. He was there. Still trust him?” the voiceover asks.
When it’s not Epstein to darken the mood, the ads flit from pictures of people said to have been murdered by immigrants to clips of Trump promising to make the rich richer. Alongside them run sinister spots with white-supremacist overtones and stark warnings that your family will know whether you don’t vote and Trump wins.
The only way to escape is to turn the television off or switch to the Cartoon Network. But then there are the ad-laden radio stations and the constant political flyers pouring through the mailbox.
Voters in Saginaw – and Michigan as a whole – have endured months of relentless election ads attempting to land a punch in a matter of seconds with simplistic, and often distorted or outright false, claims. But none is a knockout blow and so the ads punch time and again – Kamala Harris is selling out American workers to China, Trump will stop workers being paid overtime – in an attempt to send voters reeling from one candidate to the other. Or at least get them out to vote.
Most of the year, television news bulletins are bookended by ads for prescription drugs aimed at the older demographic that still sits down to watch the nightly news. But with the election only days away, the promotion of medicines and cheap mattresses has been pushed aside by the torrent of political advertising. They’re everywhere. In the middle of movies, during reruns of Family Ties, even on the weather channels.
Occasionally, the ads illuminate. Some of the Harris spots focus on how she intends to help people buy their first homes or get a small business off the ground. But mostly, they stoke fears and prejudices.
Trump-supporting ads repeatedly attempt to pin responsibility for the “immigration crisis” on Harris as the Biden administration’s “border tsar”, even though administration of the frontier was not her job and there are few immigrants in places like Saginaw.
The screen fills with crime victims and a caption denouncing “Kamala’s open border agenda” as a voice intones that “they were bludgeoned, raped, strangled, stabbed, shot, murdered”.
“More American lives will be lost if she isn’t stopped. Kamala Harris created the border crisis. She won’t fix it now,” it said.
Much of this is not paid for by the campaigns themselves but political action committees (Pacs) permitted to raise and spend millions in support of a candidate provided they do not directly coordinate with the campaigns. But the source of the money is often shadowy.
Neither are some ads what they seem. One focused on the Detroit area proclaimed: “Kamala Harris stands with Israel.”
But the ad, funded by a Trump-supporting Pac, was intended to undercut support for Harris within Michigan’s sizeable Arab American community over Israel killing more than 43,000 Palestinians in Gaza, the majority of them women and children.
The same group, FC Pac, was also behind a message emphasising that the vice-president’s husband in Jewish, and another featuring Harris and Elissa Slotkin, a Democratic member of Congress who is running for a Michigan seat in the US Senate.
“When protesters went after Israel, Harris and Slotkin didn’t back down. Harris and Slotkin are the pro-Israel team we can trust!” one message said.
In response, Harris has been running spots in Arabic denouncing Trump over the supreme court striking down the constitutional right to an abortion and his plans to cut social security.
There is occasional relief with an attempt to raise a smile.
Kristen McDonald Rivet, the Democratic candidate for Congress for the seat that includes Saginaw county, recorded an ad in a bar affirming broader Michigander loyalties.
“I root for the Lions. I hate Ohio. And I think most politicians are full of shit,” she said, with the “shit” half bleeped out, before grabbing a pint of beer sliding down the bar.
In an earlier ad, McDonald Rivet’s husband dived out of a moving car to escape her endless talk about cutting taxes.
In an altogether more sinister vein, Duty to America, which has spent $23m on ads attacking Harris, is broadcasting one that shows a series of photographs of white people who are said to have been “left behind”.
“Even if we do everything right, Harris and the Democrats find new ways to make us pay. For what? No matter what we do, Democrats are against us. So this November, we’re against them,” it said.
Even when viewers get a break from the onslaught, there are still echoes. One pro-Trump ad gave way to a local college promoting its training course in medical billing, a reminder of the US’s politically contentious private healthcare system.
It’s not clear how many minds the ads are changing, if any. But the election in bellwether Saginaw, and swing state Michigan, is highly likely to be decided by turnout. Trump won both in 2016 when Democratic voters stayed away but lost four years later, even though he increased his vote tally, because Democrats turned out in much larger numbers to remove him from power.
With that in mind, a liberal group, Future Forward USA Action, which has spent more than $370m in support of Democrats during this election cycle, has taken a different tack.
The screen fills with black letters on a grey screen telling those who do not vote that they will have helped put Trump back in the White House if he wins, and their families will blame them.
“Who you vote for is private, but if you vote is public information. After this election, your voting record will be updated. And your friends and family will be able to look up how often you vote. So vote,” it said.",2024-10-31
Guardian,"‘He could go to jail’: for Donald Trump, election day is also judgment day","Losing an election for the highest office is a crushing blow that no candidate forgets. But when the American electorate delivers its verdict next week, the personal stakes for Donald Trump will be uniquely high. His fate will hover between the presidency and the threat of prison.
If he claims victory, Trump will be the first convicted criminal to win the White House and gain access to the nuclear codes. If he falls short, the 78-year-old faces more humiliating courtroom trials and potentially even time behind bars. It would be the end of a charmed life in which he has somehow always managed to outrun the law and duck accountability.
For Trump, Tuesday is judgment day.
“He branded himself as the guy who gets away with it,” said Gwenda Blair, a Trump biographer, adding that, should he lose, “he is facing a lot of moments of reckoning. He could go to jail. He could end up considerably less wealthy than he is. No matter what happens, and no matter whether he wins or loses, there will be a reckoning over his health. Death, ill health, dementia – those are things even he can’t escape.”
The property developer and reality TV star has spent his career pushing ethical and legal boundaries to the limit, facing countless investigations, court battles and hefty fines. Worthy of a novel, his has been a life of scandal on a gargantuan scale.
In the 1970s Trump and his father were sued by the justice department for racial discrimination after refusing to rent apartments to Black people in predominantly white buildings. His property and casino businesses, including the Taj Mahal and Trump Plaza, filed for bankruptcy several times in the 1990s and early 2000s.
Trump University, a business offering property training courses, faced multiple lawsuits for fraud, misleading marketing and false claims about the quality of its programmes. In 2016 Trump settled for $25m without admitting wrongdoing.
The Donald J Trump Foundation, a charitable organisation, was investigated and sued for allegedly using charitable funds for personal and business expenses. Trump eventually agreed to dissolve the foundation with remaining funds going to charity.
Trump and his company were ordered to pay more than $350m in a New York civil fraud trial for artificially inflating his net worth to secure favourable loan terms. He is also known to have paid little to no federal income taxes in specific years which, although technically legal, was seen by some as bordering on unethical.
But Trump became a fixture of the New York tabloids and hosted his own reality TV show, The Apprentice. Blair added: “His early realisation was that if you get famous, if you get large, people will get out of the way. He spent the first part of his career as a real estate developer, making himself seem the embodiment of enormous tycoon-level success even though, in fact, many things he did weren’t successful and his father kept bailing him out.
“But he put across that impression and he rode that fame express that he had created for himself over a remarkable number of obstacles all the way to The Apprentice, which set him up permanently as the image of this unstoppable always-on-top tycoon and people are in awe of that. All of which could be described as branding.”
Trump’s private life is no more savoury. Trump has reportedly cheated on all three of his wives. More than two dozen women have come forward with accusations of sexual misconduct against him, most recently the former model Stacey Williams, who told the Guardian that Trump groped her in 1993 as Jeffrey Epstein watched in what felt like a “twisted game” between the two men.
During the 2016 election campaign, an Access Hollywood tape emerged in which Trump could be heard bragging about grabbing women by their private parts. “When you’re a star, they let you do it,” he said. “Grab ’em by the pussy. You can do anything.” Then last year a jury found Trump liable for sexually abusing the columnist E Jean Carroll in 1996, awarding her $5m.
Trump’s presidency and its aftermath were no less morally compromised. He made more than 30,000 false or misleading claims over four years, according to a count by the Washington Post newspaper, spanning everything from the crowd size at his inauguration to the result of the 2020 election.
He became the first president to be impeached twice, first for withholding military aid to pressure Ukraine’s government to investigate his political opponents, then for instigating a coup on 6 January 2021 following his defeat. He also became the subject of not one but four criminal cases, any one of which would have been enough to scuttle the chances of any other White House hopeful.
In May Trump was found guilty of 34 counts of falsifying business records relating to a hush-money payment to the adult film performer Stormy Daniels, making him the first former president to be convicted of felony crimes. Sentencing is scheduled for 26 November (the judge delayed it from 18 September after the Republican nominee asked that it wait until after the election).
What was billed as the trial of the century has already begun to fade from public consciousness and played a relatively modest role in the election campaign. Jonathan Alter, a presidential biographer who was in court for every day of the trial, recalled: “I’ve covered some big stories over the years but there was nothing like the drama of watching the jury foreperson say, ‘Guilty, guilty, guilty’ 34 times and Donald Trump looking like he was punched in the gut.”
Alter, who describes the experience in his new book, American Reckoning, reflects on how Trump has been able to act with impunity for so long. “It’s a combination of luck, galvanised defiance and the credulousness of a large chunk of the American people,” he said. “Demagoguery works. Playing on people’s fears works. It doesn’t work all the time but we can look throughout human history to political figures and how demagoguery and scapegoating ‘the other’ works.”
Alter, who covered the trial for Washington Monthly magazine, added: “We’ve had plenty of demagogues, scoundrels and conmen in politics below the level of president. Trump has been lucky to escape accountability but the United States has been lucky that we haven’t had something like this before. The founders were very worried about it. They felt we would face something like this for sure.”
The US’s system of checks and balances has been racing to keep up. Trump was charged by the special counsel Jack Smith with conspiring to overturn the results of his election loss to Joe Biden in the run-up to the January 6 riot at the US Capitol. The former president and 18 others were also charged by the Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, with taking part in a scheme to overturn his narrow loss in Georgia.
Trump was charged again by Smith with illegally retaining classified documents that included nuclear secrets, taken with him from the White House to his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida after he left office in January 2021, and then obstructing government demands to give them back.
With a such a caseload, it was widely assumed that Trump would spend this election shuttling between rallies one day and trials the next. But the courtroom campaign never really happened since, true to past form, he found ways to throw sand in the gears of the legal system and put off his moment of reckoning.
Or he simply got lucky. In Georgia, it emerged that Willis had a romantic relationship with the special prosecutor Nathan Wade, prompting demands that she be removed. Smith’s federal election case was thrown off track for months by a supreme court ruling that presidents have immunity for official actions taken in office. The classified documents case was thrown out by Judge Aileen Cannon, a Trump appointee, although Smith is appealing and the charges could be reinstated.
Such delays have made it easier to forget just how much of an outlier Trump is. Past presidential brushes with the law consisted of Ulysses S Grant being fined for speeding his horse-drawn carriage in Washington and Harry Truman receiving a ticket for driving his car too slowly on the Pennsylvania Turnpike in 1953. Richard Nixon resigned before he could be impeached over the Watergate scandal and was subsequently pardoned by his successor, Gerald Ford.
Meanwhile the standard for presidential aspirants has been high. Joe Biden’s first run for the White House fell apart amid allegations that he had plagiarised a speech by Britain’s Labour leader Neil Kinnock. During the 2000 campaign, a last-minute revelation that Republican candidate George W Bush had a drunk driving conviction that he concealed for 24 years generated huge headlines and was seen as a possible gamechanger. Hillary Clinton still blames her 2016 defeat on an FBI investigation into her email server that produced no charges.
Trump, by contrast, once memorably boasted that he could shoot someone on New York’s Fifth Avenue and not lose any votes. He has done everything but yet still finds himself within touching distance of a second presidency.
Indeed, he has repeatedly flipped the script, citing the cases against him as evidence that he is a martyr of sinister deep state forces. In this version it is Democrats, not Trump, who are the threat to democracy. Claiming solidarity with others who feel a sense a grievance, he often says: “They’re not coming after me, they’re coming after you, and I’m just standing in the way.”
The Georgia case produced the indelible image of Trump’s mugshot, with the former president staring defiantly at the camera. Within hours it had been transformed from a badge of shame into a literal badge for sale, along with posters, T-shirts and other merchandise that is still sported by his fans at rallies with slogans such as “Convicted felon” or “Never surrender”.
John Bolton, a former national security adviser to Trump, said: “For reasons that I don’t understand, every time he gets indicted his poll numbers have gone up. The reason is people have very negative attitudes about Biden and they think he has weaponised the justice system – which I don’t think he’s done – but Trump has convinced people he’s a victim.
“Every time he gets indicted again, he just uses it as more proof that he’s oppressed. It’s ridiculous but he has turned it. Like a good conman, he’s taken a seemingly impossible argument and made it worth a lot to him.”
This judo move, turning the opponent’s weight against them, might explain why Democrats have not emphasised Trump’s criminal record to the degree that might once have been expected.
Early on, the Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris, did shine a light on Trump’s misdemeanours, drawing a contrast with her past as a courtroom prosecutor by stating: “I took on perpetrators of all kinds: predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say I know Donald Trump’s type.”
The line drew cheers but was absent from her closing argument in Washington on Tuesday night, which focused instead on likening Trump to a “petty tyrant” who would sow chaos and division. Indeed, some have taken the view that even criminal convictions pale in significance compared with the threat of a would-be fascist.
But Moe Vela, a lawyer and a former senior adviser to Biden when he was vice-president, said he wishes that Trump’s criminal past had been given greater emphasis by the Harris campaign. “I am extremely surprised we have not heard about that more,” he said. “He is a convicted felon. I thought it should have been said more often in the litany of grievances about him because I thought it was like low-hanging fruit.”
Can Trump’s luck hold one more time? He has waged another White House campaign riven with extremism and racism, divisiveness and violent language, earning comparisons with fascists from the past. If elected, he is expected to use all the levers of power at his disposal to squash the outstanding cases against him; last week he boasted that he would fire his nemesis Smith “within two seconds” of becoming president. But if Trump is defeated by Harris, his legal perils will again gather like a dark cloud.
Vela added: “If he loses this election, I pray to God that she does not in any way pardon him. I hope that our judicial system functions effectively and properly in taking all of these cases through to fruition. Some of them may come out where he is not convicted, but if conviction is the result, he should be punished just like anybody else. No one in this country is above the law.”
That point was illustrated by the New York case, in which even a former president stood trial and was held to account. The system worked. Alter reflected: “That was very inspiring, the wisdom of the judge and jury, who took their responsibilities very seriously. It gave me a lump in my throat. It made me realise we’re not done.”",2024-11-02
Guardian,‘There are images no leader ever wants to be seen’: 33 pivotal US presidential moments captured on camera,"Is it any surprise that “photo op” is a phrase imported into British English from the United States? Of course it came from there, the land where the visual image sits right at the centre of the culture, with politics no exception. It was the Nixon White House that came up with it, specifically a press aide by the name of Bruce Whelihan. According to Washington legend, whenever the president was meeting a visiting dignitary, Richard Nixon’s hardball press secretary, Ron Ziegler, would turn to his underling with an order to summon the snappers. “Get ’em in for a picture,” Ziegler would say. Too polite to put it that way himself, Whelihan would clear his throat and announce to the ladies and gentlemen of the Washington press corps: “There will be a photo opportunity in the Oval Office.” The photo op was born.
But if the term was new, the thing itself had been a part of US politics almost from the start. Just as Roman emperors sought to cast themselves in stone and Tudor kings commissioned the finest artists to capture their likeness, so American presidents moved fast to harness the new technology of the age, in order that the nation might see the men who governed them. The selection of photographs assembled here is made up of a series of striking images, but a couple are extraordinary less for what they show than for the fact that they exist at all.
Behold a portrait of John Quincy Adams, sixth US president and the son of its second. A daguerreotype, it dates to March 1843), when Adams had been out of office for well over a decade, but still: it is the earliest known photograph of a US president, its subject a man born in 1767 and whose father was the successor to George Washington himself. Seeing the face of Abraham Lincoln induces a similar feeling of historical vertigo. If there’s a tendency to divide human events into two broad categories – our own, modern era and everything that went before – then the invention of the photograph can often be the instinctive dividing line between the two. But here are Adams and Lincoln, jumping over the barrier and barging their way into our own times.
As for Nixon himself, he appears in this collection twice. That’s fitting, and not only because of the origin story of the photo op. Nixon learned the hard way that in modern American politics, image is everything. Washington legend holds that in their 1960 presidential debate, Nixon comfortably beat the young Massachusetts senator John F Kennedy among voters who followed the contest on the radio – but, his face darkened by five o’clock shadow, he lost among those who watched on TV. After that, Nixon was ready to put himself in the hands of the image-makers.
One result is the intriguing photograph of the president and the king, Nixon and Elvis, standing improbably together in the White House in 1970. Showing two men both then at the height of their powers, both to fall just a few years later, the picture was long the most requested of all those held by the US National Archives). It fascinates partly because the pair represent polar opposites – a rock legend and a man so uncool he wore a suit on the beach) – and partly because it invites you to guess at the men’s motives: Nixon surely wanted some of Presley’s stardust to land on him, while Elvis was in search of a federal agent’s badge and, it seems, a sense of purpose.
The other Nixon shot is the one that etched his downfall into the public imagination. It shows his parting gesture – an oddly celebratory, double V-for-victory salute – from the presidential helicopter as he made his disgraced exit following the Watergate scandal). Nixon flew off to California and into the history books as the first US president ever to quit.
Between them, Elvis and Watergate, those pictures represent the two categories of presidential photograph: the ones they wanted – the photo ops – and the ones they most emphatically did not. The first category brims with examples and they follow a pattern. They show the occupant of the White House as a heroic, even mythic figure. The exemplar is Teddy Roosevelt on horseback, a hunter and adventurer who engaged in photogenic displays of muscularity and machismo so overt, they’d make Vladimir Putin blush. But that tradition has endured. Indeed, it has turned into an expectation that a US president must not only be competent and wise, but also fit, strong and marked by conspicuous physical courage.
Meeting that demand has been easy for some occupants of America’s highest office. Dwight Eisenhower didn’t have to pretend to be a warrior: he had been the supreme allied commander during the second world war. When he first campaigned for the presidency in 1952, there was no need to stage a photo op: there were images aplenty of him directing the D-day mission) that had turned the war around just eight years earlier. No wonder he won.
But for others, producing images of strength and command has taken some doing. The group portrait of Franklin Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin at Yalta ) had to have the so-called the Big Three seated because Roosevelt was paralysed from the waist down and required either a wheelchair or leg braces to get around. He and his aides went to great lengths to keep that fact from the US public and they mostly succeeded, thanks to a compliant press pack who obediently put away their cameras once the chosen image had been secured.
That remained the custom for a while, the snappers keeping a discreet distance even after Eisenhower had both a heart attack and stroke in office, and as Kennedy battled crippling back pain. The images told a different story, including the silhouetted portrait of JFK standing alone at the Resolute desk in the Oval Office, head bowed, a study in the loneliness of ultimate political authority). That photograph may lack the glamour or sparkle of other Camelot-era pictures, but it contributed to the Kennedy mystique – and the mythology of the presidency itself – every bit as much. This was the era of the cold war, of a nuclear standoff between the US and the USSR, and that desk was where the buck stopped. Here was where the button would be pressed – and here was the man who would press it.
Naturally, this iconography of president-as-hero takes different forms, depending on who’s in the job. The image Jimmy Carter treasured from his single term in office cast him as successful peacemaker, bringing together Menachem Begin of Israel and Anwar Sadat of Egypt in the Camp David peace accords. For supporters of Donald Trump, the picture that renders him a hero is the one taken a second after a would-be assassin’s bullet had brushed his ear, when he raised his fistand, with bloodied face, urged them to “Fight, fight, fight!”.
Sometimes, though, the man at the top has struggled to meet that deep public need for an alpha figure in the White House. Carter’s political prospects took a hit when he was photographed “wobbling, moaning and pale with exhaustion” during a six-mile run in 1979). But the most recent, and serious, example is Joe Biden, whose visible frailty drove him from this year’s presidential race. The pictures showing him apparently slack-jawed during a June TV debate with Trump were enough to persuade Democrats that he had to go.
Which brings us to the images no leader ever wanted to be seen. Some were photo ops whose aim was to offer a heroic, presidential figure, which went badly wrong. Michael Dukakis’s handlers wanted to project him as a potential commander-in-chief when they put him in a tank during the 1988 campaign); instead he looked like a hopeless dweeb. George W Bush’s team doubtless thought a Mission Accomplished banner on an aircraft carrier conveyed victorious strength following the invasion of Iraq; instead it came to haunt him as an emblem of hubris and myopia.
But other unwanted images from this collection capture not mistaken bits of stage management, but rather tragedy and disaster. George W Bush reading My Pet Goat to a group of Florida schoolkids as he gets word of the attack on the World Trade Center in 2001 distils the shock of 9/11, even now. The lifeless body of Robert F Kennedy evokes the turbulence and violence of 1968), a time when the US seemed about to tear itself apart.
It’s all here: moments of hope – Barack Obama inspiring a young boy as America’s first Black president – and moments of despair – Lyndon Johnson taking the oath following JFK’s assassination while Jackie Kennedy, in blood-stained clothes, looks on. And yet, no matter how sweeping the range of these photographs, there is something missing from this selection. It would be lacking in any assembly of presidential pictures. Yes, there are Democratic presidents and Republican presidents. Yes, there are old presidents and young presidents. But there is no female president. We see Hillary Clinton, who got close. We see Shirley Chisholm, who was the first Black woman to try but never got near. Otherwise, there is an absence. On 5 November, Americans have a chance to fill that space – and to give the world a picture no one has ever seen before.

Jimmy Carter collapses, 1979
By Phil Stewart
“His face was ashen and his mouth hung open,” is how one reporter described Jimmy Carter in September 1979, when the president dropped out of a six-mile race four miles in. Though he swiftly recovered, this image – two months after his speech blaming US problems on a “crisis of confidence” – was seen as evidence of weakness. He lost to Ronald Reagan the following year.

Richard Nixon bids goodbye, 1974
Photographer unknown
“Once more, there was not a spark of contrition in the man,” commented the Guardian at the time. On 8 August 1974, Richard Nixon earned the dubious honour of being the first (and, to this day, only) president to resign from office.
Two years earlier, five men were caught trying to burgle and bug the offices of the Democratic National Committee at the Watergate complex in Washington DC. The subsequent investigation implicated Nixon, who faced impeachment for his role in covering up the break-in. Yet – as seen in this image of him leaving the White House for the last time – he was never really repentant. As he told David Frost in 1977, “When the president does it, that means it is not illegal.” One month after he resigned, his chosen successor, Gerald Ford, pardoned him. GS
FDR at Yalta, 1945

For eight days in February 1945, the “Big Three” – Franklin D Roosevelt, Winston Churchill and Joseph Stalin – met in the Crimean city of Yalta to discuss allied strategy.
“FDR’s position between the other leaders is significant,” Diana Preston, historian and author of Eight Days at Yalta. “It was appropriate for a man who hoped to reconcile conflicting interests and build a future peace.” The conference was at first deemed a success, but the Soviet leader soon broke his promises to allow free elections in eastern Europe, and the cold war began.

Texts from Hillary Clinton, 2011
By Kevin Lamarque
It was the photograph that launched a thousand memes before becoming a liability at election time. The image of Hillary Clinton texting in sunglasses aboard a military plane to Libya went viral, inspiring a popular blog called “Texts from Hillary”. CBS reported at the time: “Hillary Clinton brings the LOLZ” and Clinton even name-checked the authors of the blog in her first ever tweet, proudly setting the image as her avatar.
By 2015, however, she would distance herself from it, dropping it from her Twitter profile when the FBI announced an investigation into her use of a private email address for government business. As the image became used in articles about the investigation, its meaning began to shift. Many people started to wonder what Clinton might have been writing on that Blackberry. The scandal came to a catastrophic peak just 11 days before the 2016 election, when FBI director James Comey announced that he was reopening the investigation after having closed it in July. FB
Theodore Roosevelt, 1898
Photographer unknown
This image of Roosevelt on a horse encapsulates the rugged masculinity the 26th president – in fact born into an aristocratic family in New York – strove to embody. Once a sickly child, he credited his recovery to exertion and hardship, and argued this approach would lead to triumph for both man and nation. Here he is in Cuba during the Spanish-American war, leading volunteer regiment the Rough Riders. Returning a war hero, he re-entered politics and became president after William McKinley’s assassination in 1901. GS
Hair Like Mine, 2009
By Pete Souza
The symbolic power of the first African American president was cemented in this image of Barack Obama leaning forward so a five-year-old boy could feel his hair. On 8 May 2009, Jacob’s dad, departing national security council staffer Carlton Philadelphia, took his family to the Oval Office for a farewell photo. This snap, by the then chief White House photographer Pete Souza, captures the moment Jacob asked, “Is your hair like mine?” Obama suggested he touch it and see. A framed print of the photo was hung in the White House for the rest of his presidency.
“The whole thing happened so fast, I literally have this one picture,” Souza recalls. “My composition was not perfect, but I think it adds to the spontaneity of the moment.”
Two years ago, Obama called Jacob to congratulate him on his high-school graduation. “Folks who maybe didn’t feel they belonged,” he said of the image, “they’d look at themselves differently – to see a person who looked like them in the Oval Office.”
“That was a highlight of my life,” Jacob said. “If I get to see another Black man at the top, I want to follow that lead.” GS
Assassination attempt on Donald Trump, 2024
By Evan Vucci
This photograph will be remembered as a pivotal moment in this year’s election. On 13 July, a gunman opened fire at a Trump rally in Butler County in Pennsylvania. The former president was only lightly wounded when a bullet grazed his right ear but one crowd member was killed and another two critically injured before the shooter was taken down by a Secret Service sniper. This remarkable image of Trump – his ear and face bloodied, and fist defiantly raised in the air as he is hurried off the stage, an American flag raised behind him – instantly went viral. In an interview soon after, AP photojournalist Evan Vucci recalled his thoughts as he was capturing the scene: “In my head, I just kept saying to myself, slow down, slow down. Compose, compose.” GS
Abraham Lincoln at Gettysburg, 1863
By Mathew B Brady
For almost a century, it was thought that no photographs existed of Abraham Lincoln at Gettysburg on 19 November, the day he delivered his endlessly quoted address at the dedication of the Soldiers’ National Cemetery. That is, until archivist Josephine Cobb undertook some detective work in 1952. Cobb, the first woman to be employed by the National Archives, picked through the work of the 19th-century photographer Mathew Brady, famous for his portraits of the great and good. She came upon a broken glass negative that showed a vast crowd at Gettysburg – she estimated the time to be about noon, a few hours before Lincoln would speak. After repeatedly enlarging, expanding and reprinting the image, she found his unmistakable face in the crowd (bare-headed, left of centre). FB
Ronald and Nancy Reagan kissing in Vanity Fair, 1985
By Harry Benson
“There is in the West,” wrote William F Buckley in 1985, “a tradition against chiefs of state engaging in visible, let alone ostentatious, shows of biological informality.” Ronald and Nancy Reagan, both successful actors before going into politics, bucked tradition by using the White House as a setting for their love story. The media was happy to indulge them, with Buckley writing a fawning ode to the couple in Vanity Fair, to accompany a series of images by Harry Benson of them dancing to Sinatra and locking lips.
Reagan, a year into his final term, could risk a little biological informality – the images were probably more consequential for Vanity Fair. Benson later said that the loss-making publication was facing closure until this issue. The editor Tina Brown, he said, convinced the owner to “wait until the June 1985 cover of the Reagans appeared. The magazine sold off the stands and the magazine was saved.” FB
Richard Nixon with Elvis Presley, 1970
By Oliver F Atkins
One December morning in 1970, Elvis showed up at the White House with a handwritten letter for the president. He wanted to give him a gift (a Colt pistol with silver bullets) and discuss becoming a “federal agent at large”: “I have done an in-depth study of drug abuse and communist brainwashing and I am right in the middle of the whole thing where I can do the most good,” he wrote.
Nixon gave Presley a federal narcotics badge, but not an official role. The bizarre encounter was captured by White House photographer Oliver F Atkins, but the images weren’t made public until the 1980s, after Nixon’s resignation and Presley’s death. GS
John F Kennedy: the loneliest job, 1961
By George Tames
A few weeks into his presidency, JFK stood at his desk before meeting the French ambassador, reading an official paper. Photographer George Tames, shadowing him for the New York Times, took this photograph, which became famous for its intimate portrayal of the pressures of holding office.
It was later reproduced in the opening title of US political drama The West Wing. FB
Bill Clinton hugs Monica Lewinsky, 1996
By Dirck Halstead
It was a moment captured by chance: a hug between Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky in the crowd at a Democratic fundraiser in Washington in October 1996. But when news of the affair between the president and the former White House intern broke in 1998, photojournalist Dirck Halstead, then senior White House photographer at Time magazine, recognised her face. After searching through his archives, he located this image in a box of transparencies. The photo ran on Time’s cover that August, when Lewinsky agreed to testify before a grand jury investigating Clinton’s denials of the affair.
Four months later, Clinton was impeached on charges of obstruction of justice and perjury, but he was eventually acquitted and left office after two terms in 2001 with the highest approval rating of any departing postwar president. Lewinsky, meanwhile, was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, “mainly from the ordeal of having been publicly outed and ostracised back then”, the anti-bullying campaigner wrote in Vanity Fair in 2018. “There has been at least one significant reference in the press to that unfortunate spell in our history every day for the past 20 years.” GS
‘Dewey defeats Truman’, 1948
Photographer unknown
With Harry Truman’s popularity waning, a win for his Republican opponent, Thomas E Dewey, in the 1948 election seemed certain. The Chicago Daily Tribune, forced to go to press early due to a printers’ strike, issued 150,000 copies of this 3 November edition – held up by a gleeful Truman en route to Washington – before it became clear its editors had backed the wrong horse. GS
Dwight D Eisenhower, 1944
Photographer unknown
This image of General Dwight D Eisenhower addressing paratroopers at Greenham Common airfield on 5 June 1944, the day before they would parachute into France, became one of the most widely circulated of the war, durably linking him with D-day’s success and the eventual American victory. Despite the general’s authoritative pose, the soldier closest to him, Lieutenant Wallace Strobel, recalled a lighter conversation. “He asked my name and which state I was from … He then said, ‘Oh yes, Michigan, great fishing there. Been there several times and like it.’”
After the war “Ike”, as he was popularly known, regularly topped polls as America’s most admired man. After years of claiming that it would be inappropriate for a military leader to run for president, he finally went for it in 1952, winning 55% of the popular vote for the Republicans. FB
Harry S Truman and Lauren Bacall on the piano, 1945
Photographer unknown
While playing piano for photographers during a wartime variety show in 1945, vice-president Truman was joined by 20-year-old Lauren Bacall, with the famous actor perched awkwardly above him. “I was just a kid,” shrugged Bacall years later. “My press agent made me do it.”
Truman had only been vice-president for a few weeks, plucked from relative obscurity by Franklin D Roosevelt. This photograph, considered risque at the time, made headlines all around the world and helped to establish his public image – even if they irritated his inner circle, including his wife, Bess. “I don’t think you should play piano in public again,” she said, according to Truman’s grandson. The New York Times recently dubbed it a viral image before its time – it inspired so many other women to climb up on the piano that it eventually broke. FB
Shirley Chisholm’s presidential bid, 1972
By Don Hogan Charles
This is Shirley Chisholm – who four years earlier had become the first Black woman elected to Congress – announcing her presidential bid at the Concord Baptist Church, Brooklyn. She knew that, with its “Unbought and Unbossed” slogan, the campaign was a long shot – she was also the first woman of colour from either major party to run for president. So it was a feat that, despite racism and sexism from her own party as well as the opposition, she made it to the Democratic national convention with the support of 152 delegates – and came fourth. When Kamala Harris launched her first presidential bid in 2020, she paid tribute with campaign colours based on the red and yellow pins Chisholm’s supporters wore. GS
George W Bush’s Mission Accomplished moment, 2003
By Stephen Jaffe
Dan Bartlett, George Bush’s communications director at the time, would later call this photo op “one of the big regrets of my life”. “It did seem premature,” remembers Stephen Jaffe, the press corp photographer covering Bush’s speech on the aircraft carrier that day. “The administration tried to stage everything perfectly – unfortunately it’s not a perfect world.”
As the eight-year occupation of Iraq spiralled and weapons of mass destruction failed to appear, the image of Bush in front of a “Mission Accomplished” banner, just six weeks into an invasion that would kill more than a quarter of a million Iraqi civilians, became a symbol of hubris.
While Bartlett says the banner referred to the mission of the USS Abraham Lincoln, returning from its tour in the Gulf – the ship’s crew requested it, and he “didn’t think twice”
– Jaffe is sceptical and thinks the intended meaning was plain to all on the day. “There was a lot of spin afterwards,” he says. “If the mission had been accomplished, they would have taken credit for it.” FB
George W Bush learns of 9/11, 2001
By Win McNamee
This captures the moment on the morning of 11 September 2001 when George Bush, taking part in a reading session at a primary school in Florida, learned that a second plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. (He’d been informed of the first plane, at the time thought to be an accident, before he entered the classroom.) When his chief of staff, Andy Card, whispered in his ear, “America is under attack,” he decided not to interrupt the reading, instead waiting around seven minutes before leaving.
It would become one of the most scrutinised events of his presidency. In his scathing 2004 film Fahrenheit 9/11, Michael Moore said, “Not knowing what to do, with no one telling him what to do, and no Secret Service rushing in to take him to safety, Mr Bush just sat there.” But several people there that day have since spoken out in his defence. “It was nice he understood we were young kids and would probably have gone crazy if he had told us what had happened,” former student La’Damien Smith told an interviewer in 2011.

Situation Room, 2011
By Pete Souza
“It’s not a picture I have hanging on my wall,” Pete Souza says. “It’s not artistic – the lighting in that room sucked.” On 1 May 2011, the chief White House photographer was called to the situation room, a network of rooms below the White House. The atmosphere immediately felt unusual. “I had been there many, many times before to cover discussions about sensitive policy decisions,” Souza says. On this day, however, the decision had already been made: Souza was there to document Barack Obama and his senior team as they watched the operation to kill or capture Osama bin Laden play out in real time.
As everyone packed into a side room to watch a live feed from a drone, Souza squeezed himself in the corner. (Seated, from left to right, is then vice-president Biden, Obama, joint operations command Marshall B Webb, deputy national security adviser Denis McDonough, secretary of state Hillary Clinton and secretary of defense Robert Gates.) While the raid unfolded in Abbottabad, Pakistan, Souza took about 100 images. “It was as tense and anxious a situation as I had ever seen that whole team in,” he recalls. “You could see it on their faces.” He tried to focus on his composition, getting everyone in frame, and on timing his shutter clicks so as not to distract them. Later it was announced that Navy Seals had killed Bin Laden, along with his son, a courier and two of the courier’s relatives.
Of nine pictures released that day, it was this one that went viral, exhaustively analysed and relentlessly memed. Souza, looking back today, believes this was because it occupied some part of the national psyche: “We had this guy that attacked our country, and it took us 10 years to find him, but we found him. It closed the chapter.” FB
John Quincy Adams, 1843
By Philip Haas
Though Adams was not the first president to be photographed (an 1841 picture of William Henry Harrison is now lost), this is the oldest surviving portrait of a US president. Adams had a familiarly vexed relationship with the medium. “All hideous,” he wrote in his diary, after posing for daguerreotypes in the early 1840s. “Too true to the original.” This image of Adams – who served as president in the 1820s – surfaced in 2017, found by the great-great-grandson of a congressman who had received it as a gift from Adams. FB
Michael Dukakis and the tank, 1988
By Michael E Samojeden
Meant to project strength, this unfortunate photo-call crystallised, for critics and voters, something mediocre and uncertain about the Democratic presidential hopeful Michael Dukakis. The Republicans used it relentlessly in attack ads.
Politicians are drawn to tanks: Churchill, Putin, Blair, Hugo Chavez, Liz Truss and Nigel Farage have all been snapped on or in one. Dukakis’s efforts came only a couple of years after Thatcher’s influential contribution to the genre; while she loomed out of the turret with uncanny poise, dressed in her own clothes, he seemed shrunken and overwhelmed, in a helmet that didn’t belong to him.
Widely recognised as one of the most disastrous campaign photos in history, the image would haunt future presidencies. “I sat in countless meetings in which some smartass warned that a stop on the president’s schedule had the makings of a ‘Dukakis in the tank moment,’” recalled former Clinton aide John King to Politico. In 2013, after being handed a naval football helmet, Obama declined to try it on. “You do not put stuff on your head if you’re president,” he joked. FB
JFK in the motorcade, 1963
Photographer unknown
“It was a watershed moment that changed America,” says Fredrik Logevall, historian and biographer of John F Kennedy. “I think there’s something to the notion that America lost its innocence after 22 November 1963.”
More than other images from Kennedy’s assassination – grainy TV coverage of the immediate aftermath, or Lyndon B Johnson being sworn in – this long lens shot of Kennedy smiling just moments before his assassination has come to signify what was lost that day. “In this photograph he’s for ever frozen in our minds,” Logevall says, “the picture of youthful vitality and glamour.”
For Logevall, it captures an era not only less haunted by political violence – open-top motorcades, beloved by Kennedy because he could get “closer to the people”, are a thing of the past – but also less riven by polarisation. “This was a conservative city,” he notes, and yet “hundreds of thousands of people turned up to cheer him on”.
Kennedy was on his way to deliver a speech on political extremism, with lines Logevall believes to be prescient. “America’s leadership must be guided by learning and reason, or else those who confuse rhetoric with reality and the plausible with the possible will gain popular ascendancy, with their seemingly swift and simple solutions to every world problem.” FB
LBJ being sworn in, 1963
By Cecil W Stoughton
On 22 November 1963, shortly after the assassination of John F Kennedy, vice-president Lyndon B Johnson took the oath to become the 36th president of the US, inside a cramped compartment aboard Air Force One, on the runway of Dallas airport. Kennedy’s body had been loaded on to the plane 15 minutes before, and as the compartment filled with people, White House photographer Cecil Stoughton stood on top of a sofa, crammed himself against the curved ceiling and asked everyone to step back.
When Jackie Kennedy arrived, still in her blood- stained suit, she was positioned to LBJ’s left – her haunting, dazed expression lends the image its emotional force. In less than a minute, as Stoughton snapped eight pictures, the ceremony was over. As Air Force One continued on to Washington, Stoughton left the plane to ensure his film was swiftly developed and transmitted to the world’s press, to authenticate the transfer of power to a new president.

Donald Trump mugshot, 2023
By Fulton County Sheriff’s Office
Even before Trump arrived at the Fulton County Sheriff’s Office in Atlanta, Georgia, last August, people were anticipating the release of his mugshot, with fakes spreading around the internet. It was his fourth arrest that year, but the first time he had had a picture taken.
Mugshots are often used to shame public figures who have run-ins with the law. But for Trump, ever the self-publicist, the image became a golden opportunity, adorning mugs, T-shirts and stickers, with the mottos “Never Surrender” or “Not Guilty”. Trump, not long reinstated on X by Elon Musk, tweeted the image himself, raising more than $7m in just a few days. FB
Jimmy Carter at Camp David, 1978
By Karl Schumacher
In September 1978, Jimmy Carter convened a secret 12-day summit with Israeli prime minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian president Anwar Sadat at Camp David. The main focus was a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel after 30 years of intermittent war. The resulting accords led to Israel agreeing to withdraw from the Sinai in exchange for its first official recognition by an Arab state and an end to the state of war. A plan was also laid out for Palestinian self-government in the West Bank and Gaza, but it was never implemented.
Here Begin and Sadat are shown smiling and shaking hands at the presidential retreat in Maryland, as Carter looks on. “The picture makes it look as if the three leaders all got along very well at the summit. That was not at all the case,” recalls William B Quandt, a former national security council staffer who was involved in the negotiations. “The adversaries were very hostile, and on the third day Carter decided not to have any more three-way meetings. We were not at all sure we would get an agreement until the last day.”
Begin and Sadat won the Nobel Peace prize that year, while Carter was awarded it in 2002 for “his decades of untiring effort to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts”. While the Camp David accords are recognised as his greatest presidential achievement, they left crucial issues unresolved and, some argue, helped prevent Palestianian statehood. GS
George HW Bush in bed, 1987
By David Valdez
This photograph, taken in 1987 for Life magazine, captured the then vice- president with his family on holiday in Maine. David Valdez – personal photographer to Bush at the time – was invited by Barbara Bush to come by the house at 6am. “I poked my head in the bedroom door and there were George and Barbara Bush in bed,” he later told NPR. “Then the grandchildren started coming in and I took that snap, and that wound up running two full pages, and it’s taken on a life of its own.” The Washington Post credited the image with launching Bush’s successful campaign for the presidency; Valdez became his official White House photographer.

Lyndon B Johnson watches war protests, 1968
By Yoichi Okamoto
This strikingly intimate shot shows LBJ and his family at his ranch in Texas, watching TV coverage of Vietnam war protests outside the 1968 Democratic national convention in Chicago. This level of access was remarkable: Yoichi Okamoto was the first civilian to be appointed chief photographer for the White House.
Here we can also see a turning point in LBJ’s presidency. Since taking over in 1963, he had sent more than 500,000 troops to what the public increasingly saw as an unjustifiable, unwinnable war. “I know we oughtn’t to be there,” Johnson admitted to a colleague in 1966, “but I can’t get out.” He withdrew from the 1968 election, and Nixon won.

Calvin Coolidge as a cowboy, 1927
Photographer unknown
During his tenure in the 1920s, Calvin Coolidge held the greatest number of press conferences of any president (521 over six years), delivered the first State of the Union address on the radio and was the first to appear in a sound film. The media-savvy president appeared in photos dressed up in workers’ overalls, pitching hay and – as here – wearing a cowboy’s chaps and hat, on a trip to South Dakota. This image caused a stir: while the New York Times claimed “Coolidge as Cowboy Wins West’s Heart”, others called him “a pitiful puppet of publicity”, the first president to make himself a laughing stock. He would not be the last. FB
Bill Clinton on Arsenio Hall, 1992
By Reed Saxon
This may well be what clinched the 1992 election for Bill Clinton. In June, weeks before accepting the Democratic presidential nomination, he appeared on Arsenio Hall’s late-night talkshow and played Heartbreak Hotel on the saxophone. It was a bold move at the time and the image of a cool, confident Clinton on stage with his sax and dark shades is credited with helping him secure the youth vote especially. “It’s nice to see a Democrat blow something besides the election,” Hall quipped on the show. The success of the appearance, the Los Angeles Times wrote, “changed presidential politics – turning pop culture’s hippest TV shows into the contemporary equivalent of campaign whistle-stops”. GS
Lyndon B Johnson with Martin Luther King Jr, 1965
Photographer unknown
“I want to tell you how grateful I am,” Johnson told King on the phone, after becoming president in 1963, “and how worthy I’m going to try to be of all your hopes.” The cautious collaboration between the two reached its peak on 6 August 1965, with the signing of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibited racial discrimination in voting. Johnson is pictured that day, reaching out to pass a smiling King the pen used to sign the act, as Rosa Parks looks on.
How strong this much mythologised moment of unity really was has remained the subject of fierce debate. Mutual distrust haunted their interactions and King faced relentless pressure from J Edgar Hoover’s FBI, with Johnson’s knowledge. King split with the government over Vietnam, and today, voting rights have been rolled back. FB
Ronald Reagan at the Berlin Wall, 1987
By Dirck Halstead
On 12 June 1987, Ronald Reagan delivered probably the most famous sentence of his presidency: “Mr Gorbachev, tear down this wall!” He was standing in front of the Berlin Wall at the Brandenburg Gate, 24 years after JFK gave his famous speech in the city. It was a risky move: the previous day, thousands had gathered to protest against his visit. Even his own advisers had been unsure whether the public address to the Soviet leader was too provocative. But the fall of the Wall two years later, and the collapse of the Soviet Union, seemed to vindicate the decision – though there is debate over whether its importance has been overplayed. Over time, Gorbachev and Reagan, both keen to end the cold war, formed a productive alliance. GS
Joe Biden at the debate, 2024
By Justin Sullivan
“I’ve done 31 debates since I’ve been at Getty,” says photographer Justin Sullivan, “and I’ve never seen anything like that.” The Biden-Trump debate of June 2024 had felt unusual even before it started: press were allowed in only moments before it began and the room was eerily empty. As a “pale and very unstable” Biden gave “incoherent” answers, Sullivan focused on the “strange facial expressions” that damned him as much as his nonsensical responses did. Within weeks, he’d dropped out of the race.
“It was a sad ending to a strong presidency that history will look upon more favourably,” says David Smith, the Guardian’s Washington bureau chief. “He inherited four major crises – the pandemic, the economy, racial justice and climate – and made significant progress on all of them.” FB
Robert F Kennedy’s assassination, 1968
By Bill Eppridge
On 5 June 1968, Robert F Kennedy was in the ballroom of the Ambassador hotel in Los Angeles, giving a victory speech after winning the Democratic California presidential primary – he was shaping up to be the nominee to run against Richard Nixon in the general election. As he exited through the hotel kitchen after midnight, shaking hands with staff, shots rang out. In this photograph by Life magazine photographer Bill Eppridge, Kennedy lies on the floor while a busboy, Juan Romero, crouches down to comfort him. Kennedy died the next day. The gunman was Sirhan Sirhan, a Palestinian-Jordanian man who said he felt betrayed by Kennedy’s support for Israel in the six-day war.
Letters addressed to “the busboy” soon arrived at the hotel. “One even went so far as to say that if he hadn’t stopped to shake my hand, the senator would be alive, so I should be ashamed of myself for being so selfish,” Romero told NPR in 2018. “It’s been a long 50 years.” He visited Kennedy’s grave in 2010, buying his first suit for the occasion.
Alternative accounts of the assassination have since emerged. His son, Robert F Kennedy Jr – a conspiracy theorist who recently suspended his own presidential campaign – is among those who believe there was a second gunman. GS",2024-11-02

Live, rolling coverage of business, economics and financial markets as non-farm payrolls numbers deliver economic surprise days before presidential election
Hurricanes and the enormous strike at Boeing were always going to be temporary factors in the US economy, but there are nevertheless signs of a “slowing trend”, according to economists.
Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, a consultancy, said the data “bolsters the case” for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates at both its November and December meetings. After that, it depends on what happens on Tuesday...
Tombs said:
The muted rise in October payrolls is not merely due to strikes and the recent hurricanes.
A further slowing in the trend looks likely given that hiring intentions of small businesses remain depressed, large businesses still face a rise in their borrowing costs as low-rate corporate bonds mature, and job openings in the health and education sector have fallen.
August and September job gains were revised down by 112,000 jobs, and growth in job numbers slowed.
Preston Caldwell, chief US economist at Morningstar, said:
Even setting aside the October data, where the impact of temporary distortions is unknown, today’s jobs report was a bit bearish.
The data does point to an ongoing downtrend in job growth. […] There is nothing in the overall assemblage of labour market data to dissuade the Fed from cutting in next week’s November meeting and to loosen policy further over the next year.
The data overall points to a job market that has shed all of its post-pandemic tightness and excesses, and the data suggests enough downside risk to warrant nipping in the bud with monetary easing.
HSBC chairman Mark Tucker gave his support to Rachel Reeves’s budget.
The UK manufacturing industryfell into contraction in October as companies paused investments ahead of the budget, according to the closely followed purchasing managers’ index (PMI).
Rating agencies gave their UK budget verdicts. Moody’s said the UK government’s increased borrowing will give an “additional challenge” to the public finances, while S&P Global said the UK government will be “constrained” by its debt load.
UK house price growthslowed in October ahead of Wednesday’s budget, surprising economists who had expected faster increases, according to one of the key measures collected by a lender.

The response from the business lobby to the UK budget was fairly negative, but criticism of the Labour government has not been universal.
Chancellor Rachel Reeves has gained the backing of some senior bankers – perhaps cognisant that Labour is likely to be in power for at least five years.
Mark Tucker, chairman of HSBC, said:
This is a budget which lays the foundations for necessary investment within a framework of clear fiscal rules. The overall package strikes a balance between tax, spending and borrowing to finance public services, alongside a focus on delivering economic growth.
Patrick Thomson, JP Morgan’s chief executive of asset management in EMEA, said:
The market reaction compared to the Truss mini-budget has been relatively muted and should count as a success considering the ambition of the Budget. It was helpful that there were few surprises, given that it was so well telegraphed ahead of time.
Having raised taxes for much-needed investment in public infrastructure and services, the market will be waiting to see that the money is spent wisely in actually fixing any underlying problems in the economy to have long term impact. Ultimately, we all want to see how this translates into growth, and so the City will look to the forthcoming Mansion House speech for further detail on the proposed investments.
British banks with big motor finance arms have had a dire week on stock markets since a court ruling that could cost them billions of pounds.
The latest lender to join the procession of warnings was Secure Trust Bank. It had already said that it was looking at the ruling, but on Friday it worried the market further with a profit warning.
Its share price is down by 17% today, adding to a dire run that has driven its valuation to its lowest since floating in 2012. The share price dropped from above £8 a week ago to £4.70 today.
The bank said that it was taking longer than expected to recover money from people who had defaulted on loans, meaning that profit before tax would “fall materially below market expectations by between £10m and £15m”.
David McCreadie, Secure Trust Bank’s chief executive, said:
We are disappointed that it will take longer than expected to recover value from the excess level of defaulted vehicle finance balances, and the recent court of appeal decisions have added additional uncertainty on the benefits to be realised in 2024.
US stocks are all up by more than 1%, after weak jobs data appeared to remove any lingering chance of the Federal Reserve leaving interest rates on hold next week.
The S&P 500, the Nasdaq and the Dow Jones industrial average indices are all up by more than 1% in morning trading in New York.
What have we learned from the US jobs numbers? It’s tricky to say.
Lara Castleton, US head of portfolio construction and strategy at Janus Henderson Investors, said it was “an underwhelming and muddying jobs report just five days before an election”. There was no clear signal because of the hurricanes.
There will likely not be much influence from this report on the results of next week nor on the Fed’s interest rate decision later in the month, which will likely be 25-basis-points cut amidst this backdrop.
James Knightley, chief international economist for the US at ING, an investment bank, said the number was “depressed by strike action and hurricane disruption”.
Nonetheless, the trend in hiring is obviously slowing and with the inflation backdrop looking less threatening, the Federal Reserve clearly has scope to move policy closer to neutral.
Given the inflation backdrop is less threatening and the Fed is putting more emphasis on jobs, today’s report cements expectations for a 25bp Fed rate cut next week. We expect that to be followed up by another 25bp rate cut in December.
Wall Street has opened higher. Share prices were likely helped by expectations of looser monetary policy from the Federal Reserve after surprisingly weak jobs numbers.

London tube engineer strikes called off after improved pay offer
Back in the UK, the RMT union has suspended tube strikes due to start today after what it called a “significantly improved offer” from Transport for London.
Engineering staff represented by RMT were due to stop work for 24 hours from 6pm today.
However, the separate Aslef union has not called off its action. Train operators and managerial employees are due to strike on 7 and 12 November.
An RMT spokesperson said:
Following intense negotiations with London Underground management and a significantly improved offer, we have suspended the strikes scheduled to start this evening.
London Underground have sensibly abandoned their proposed changes to pay structures which now means all our members will receive the same value in any pay award.
Further discussions will take place next week regarding the pay offer but progress has been made which would not have been possible without the fortitude and industrial strength of our 10,000 members on London Underground.
*This post has been updated to reflect the fact that Aslef has not called off its strike action.
The jobs numbers prompted a rapid fall in the yield on US Treasury bonds. The yield on the 10-year benchmark dropped 10 basis points (0.1 percentage points) in the immediate aftermath of the data.
Perceptions of a weaker US economy will make the Federal Reserve more likely to lower interest rates next week. That would boost the relative value of bonds. (Yields dropping means prices are rising.)
It’s something of a side issue given the context of the US election, but the drop in yields has also affected UK debt. The yield on 10-year gilts has dropped below 4.4% – wiping out all of Thursday’s post-budget move.
The US dollar has weakened after the shock drop in non-farm payrolls.
The dollar is down by 0.3% against a trade-weighted basket of currencies after initially climbing over the course of today. The pound is now up 0.5% today against the greenback, while the euro is up 0.1%.
You can see the immediate reaction on this chart showing the performance of the dollar basket today:
Economics professor Justin Wolfers of University of Michigan says that the underlying trend is of slower growth in jobs, but not a signal of a disastrous economic situation.
But the headline is nevertheless still a long way below any recent readings thanks to the strikes and hurricanes.
The US unemployment rate remained steady at 4.1%, but it is the non-farm payrolls number that will take up all the attention.
Only 12,000 jobs were added – which will surely be seized on by Donald Trump in the last few days of campaigning ahead of the presidential election. A miss in the forecasts of that magnitude – more than 100,000 jobs – is rare.
The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) added the important caveat that the jobs reading is the first since Hurricanes Helene and Milton hit the US. The BLS said:
It is likely that payroll employment estimates in some industries were affected by the hurricanes; however, it is not possible to quantify the net effect on the over-the-month change in national employment, hours, or earnings estimates because the establishment survey is not designed to isolate effects from extreme weather events. There was no discernible effect on the national unemployment rate from the household survey.
US economy added only 12,000 jobs in October according to shock numbers
The US economy added far fewer jobs than expected in October, in a shock reading that will raise questions about its momentum days before the presidential election.
Only 12,000 jobs were added in the month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, far below economists expectations of 113,000, and the 254,000 in September.
Tens of millions of Americans have already voted, but we will shortly receive the last big economic update before the US presidential election next Tuesday: non-farm payrolls.
The jobs numbers are a key measure of the US economy, but this month they could be affected by the huge strike at Boeing and the effects of a hurricane hitting Florida.
Whatever the noise, the figures will help to set the narrative for the next day or two as the election campaign enters its most frantic stage.
Bob Savage, head of markets strategy and insights at BNY Mellon, a US investment bank, said:
US October non-farm payrolls expected 110,000 after 254,000 with hurricane and strike noise. The unemployment rate expected steady at 4.1% and the average hourly earnings flat at 4% year-on-year.
Reuters’s poll of economists suggests that the reading will be 113,000, down from 254,000 in September.
A quick check-in on gilt markets: the Labour government will have been eyeing developments nervously after some movement this week, but so far on Friday things have been fairly steady.
The yield on the UK 10-year bond has dropped to 4.42%, down from a high of 4.51% during London trading hours and two basis points (0.02 percentage points) below yesterday’s close. Yields move inversely to prices, so falling yields is a sign of investors buying bonds, after Thursday’s selloff.
The 30-year yield has also dropped by a basis point, while the short-term two-year gilt is down four basis points in today’s trading.
The pound is up by 0.2% against the US dollar, and 0.3% against the euro.
Shreyas Gopal, a strategist at Deutsche Bank, said that the budget should be net positive for the pound, because it will likely make the Bank of England more hawkish – more likely to keep interest rates higher for longer.
Our economist’s base case for next week is that the BoE now retains its language around cuts being “gradual.”
Higher policy rates for longer, driven by a demand stimulus that lifts growth and inflation, ought to be positive for the pound in the current market environment.
America’s two oil giants reported combined profits of more than $13bn (£10bn) for the third quarter as higher production volumes made up for weaker prices.
ExxonMobil made $8.6bn, while Chevron made $4.5bn. Both beat analyst forecasts.
ExxonMobil said it had produced the most oil for a quarter in over 40 years, at 3.2m barrels per day. Chevron said its oil output rose 7% compared with last year thanks to record production in the US, including the West Texas Permian Basin.
Slower global economies have dragged down oil prices in recent months – despite the turmoil in the Middle East and Ukraine. That has hit oil company profits this year, but there is little sign of them slowing down.
Both companies and their rivals have expanded production in the face of warnings from forecasters such as the International Energy Agency that exploration for new oil and gas wells must cease if the world is to hit climate targets to limit global heating to 2 degrees Celsius.",2024-11-01
Guardian,Candidates try to divine trends as nearly 70m Americans have cast early votes,"Almost 70 million Americans have already voted in the historic US election which comes to a head on Tuesday, prompting furious arguments over what early voting trends might mean as Donald Trump and Kamala Harris prepare for their final showdown.
As both candidates and their top surrogates crisscrossed the country in a furious bout of last-minute campaigning, the race remains in a virtual dead heat – both in the head-to-head national polls and in the crucial seven battleground states that will actually decide the race for the White House.
But as Trump and Harris made their pitches for what must now be a vanishingly small number of still undecided voters, tens of millions of Americans have already cast their ballots in the election through the various processes in the US that allow early voting.
With so much at stake in the election, that huge number has triggered intense speculation as to what it might that mean with both Republicans and Democrats attempting to glean information that shows their side might already have the edge as voting day nears.
Harris’s campaign is latching on to some key information from the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania. The giant state – which stretches from New Jersey in the east to Ohio in the west – is a part of the “rust belt” dominated by former manufacturing cities that is seen as probably the most crucial region in the election.
Nearly all the most likely paths to victory for both candidates involve picking up rust belt states with Pennsylvania as the biggest prize.
In that state, voters over the age of 65 have cast nearly half of the early ballots and registered Democrats account for about 58% of votes cast by seniors, compared with 35% for Republicans. That is a big lead in a demographic that usually trends towards Trump.
At the same time, women have a 10-point gap over men when it comes to the early vote in Pennsylvania, according to analysis by the Politico website, using data from the University of Florida’s United States Election Project. Another analysis, by NBC, showed an even larger gap in favor of women in the state of 13 points.
Harris and her team are hoping for a large showing of women in the election as they have made the loss of reproductive rights central to their campaign after the supreme court overturned federal abortion rights. Women have trended strongly Democratic in the election, while men have leaned more Republican and thus any signs of a strong turnout by women is potentially good news for the vice-president.
“The gender gap is a key reason for hope among Democrats and concern among Republicans, especially when many states have abortion rights amendments on their ballots in the 2024 election,” Thomas Miller, a data scientist at Northwestern University, told Newsweek.
But Republicans too are seeing signs of hope in the early voting trends – a sign that America’s divisive election is still proving impossible to predict even after almost two years of furious campaigning by both parties.
In Arizona, a crucial swing state in the so-called “sun belt” on electoral battlegrounds, male voters have been turning out in increased numbers – a sign that Republican strategies of turning out men who have not voted before might be working. In Arizona last week, the number of new voters in Arizona was 86,000 – far more than the tiny margin by which Joe Biden beat Trump in the state in 2020 – and the biggest share of those new voters were male Republicans.
Overall, Republicans have traditionally been outnumbered in early voting with more Democrats choosing to go to the polls. In part, that has been because Trump and some of his allies have assailed early voting with baseless claims of fraud and conspiracy, despite Republican professional campaigners exhorting their supporters to get to the polls before election day.
In 2024, there are signs that Republicans are indeed heading to the polls early in large numbers.
In Georgia – another key sun belt battleground in the deep south – there are strong signs of a significant early Republican turnout. More than 700,000 people who voted already in 2024 did not vote at all in 2020, according to Georgia Votes, and that is seen as a sign that many of them might be Republicans as the campaign has focused on that demographic. At the same time, the top three counties for voter turnout rates in Georgia are rural areas won easily by Trump in 2020.
“We’ve got a lot of voters that voted in 2016 but didn’t vote in 2020 … What makes me believe that they are Trump voters is that most of them are … from parts of the state that are pretty strong Republican strongholds,” Georgia’s lieutenant governor, Burt Jones, told Fox News.
Of course, as voting patterns shift for both sides, it could also be that an advantage in early voting for either Democrats or Republicans is quickly overwhelmed on election day itself when tens of millions of voters go to the polls in person.
In the end, the 2024 race remains entirely unpredictable. The Guardian’s 10-day polling average tracker has shown little change over the past week, after a slight erosion in Harris support over October, Harris retains a one-point advantage in national polls of 48% to Trump’s 47%, virtually identical to last week and well with the margin of error of most polls.
The battleground states, too, remain in a dead heat. The candidates are evenly tied at 48% in Pennsylvania while Harris has single-point leads in the two other rust belt states of Michigan and Wisconsin. Meanwhile, Trump is marginally ahead in the sun belt, where he is up by 1% in North Carolina, 2% in Georgia and Arizona, and ahead in Nevada by less than a percentage point.
But one wildcard for both campaigns is the Muslim vote, angered by US support for Israel in its attacks on Gaza and Lebanon. A poll released on Friday by the Council on American-Islamic Relations showed that 42% of the country’s 2.5 million Muslim voters favor Green party nominee Jill Stein for president while 41% favor Harris. Trump registered 10% support.
In theory, those margins of support for Stein, as in 2016, could swing some key swing states, such as Michigan, to Trump if the contest there is very close.",2024-11-02
Guardian,Union urges striking Boeing workers to back improved pay offer,"Striking Boeing staff have been urged by their union to vote for an improved contract offer that includes a 38% pay rise over four years, raising hopes of an end to the stoppage after more than seven weeks.
The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) that represents the 33,000 workers has endorsed the new deal, which also includes a bigger bonus for signing up, and will ballot members on Monday in a vote that could end the dispute.
Workers who produce Boeing’s strongest-selling 737 Max commercial jet and other planes have been on strike since 13 September and have rejected two earlier offers.
Boeing’s latest proposal includes a $12,000 (£9,304) ratification bonus and the reinstatement of an annual bonus scheme that was not included in a previous offer.
Workers have been pushing for a 40% wage increase and the return of a defined-benefit pension that they lost a decade ago. The 38% deal compares with the 25% first offered by Boeing at the start of the dispute.
Last week, about 64% of the company’s US west coast factory workers rejected an offer of a 35% general wage increase over four years that was not endorsed by the union.
A statement from the IAM on social media after the latest offer said: “It is time for our members to lock in these gains and confidently declare victory.
“We believe asking members to stay on strike longer wouldn’t be right as we have achieved so much success.”
Boeing shares rose 2.5% in after-hours trading following the announcement of the offer after an exclusive report by Reuters. Shares had closed down 3.2% earlier on Thursday.
An end to the dispute will mark a positive moment in what has been a difficult year for Boeing as it has faced a number of expensive safety problems.
In January a door panel blew out in mid-air from one of its 737 Max 9s shortly after it took off from Portland, Oregon. The Federal Aviation Administration then enforced a cap on the production of the Max jets. In July it pleaded guilty to a US criminal fraud charge stemming from the crashes of two 737 Max jetliners in 2018 and 2019, which killed 346 people, and agreed to pay a fine of almost $250m.
The company disclosed this month that it was seeking to raise up to $25bn to shore up its finances to help it deal with production delays caused by the strike, alongside other financial pressures. According to Reuters, the strike was estimated to have cost the company up to $1bn, as of 15 October.
The company previously said it plans to shed 17,000 jobs, about a tenth of its workforce, as part of a cost-cutting drive.",2024-11-01
Guardian,US elections 2024: seven key House races to watch,"Much attention has been paid to the rematch between Joe Biden and Donald Trump in November, but the results of down-ballot elections will determine whether the victor in the presidential race will actually be able to implement his legislative agenda next year.
With Republicans defending a narrow majority in the House of Representatives, Democrats only need to flip a handful of seats to wrest back control of the lower chamber, and both parties are going all out to secure a majority.
Here are seven House races to watch this year:
Arizona’s first congressional district
Republican incumbent David Schweikert is running for re-election in this toss-up district, which covers north-east Phoenix and Scottsdale. As one of 17 House Republicans representing districts that Biden won in 2020, Schweikert is vulnerable, and Democrats have identified the seat as one of its top targets this year.
Redistricting after the 2020 census moved this district to the left, and several Democrats have jumped into the 30 July primary in the hopes of unseating Schweikert. The race is expected to be closely contested, as Schweikert won his 2022 election by less than one point.
California’s 47th congressional district
Democratic congresswoman Katie Porter chose not to run for re-election in this battleground district, instead launching an ultimately unsuccessful Senate campaign. Her departure has created a key pickup opportunity for House Republicans, and Democrats will likely need to heavily invest in the district to defend this Orange county-based seat.
In the 5 March primary, former Republican state assemblyman Scott Baugh, who lost to Porter by just three points in 2022, advanced to the general election alongside Democratic state senator Dave Min.
Min emerged from a brutal primary fight against Democratic activist and attorney Joanna Weiss, who attacked her opponent over his arrest for drunk driving last year. Republicans will likely launch similar attacks against Min ahead of the general election, but Democrats are still favored to hold the left-leaning district.
Maine’s second congressional district
Democratic incumbent Jared Golden is running for a fourth term in this perpetual swing district that Republicans have repeatedly tried and failed to flip. Golden defeated former Republican congressman Bruce Poliquin by six points in 2022, even though Trump carried the district by six points two years earlier, according to data compiled by Daily Kos.
But this time around, Republicans believe they have a strong candidate in Austin Theriault, a state representative and former professional race car driver who will face off against fellow state representative Michael Soboleski in a primary on 11 June. Republicans also suspect that some independent voters may turn against Golden after he announced support for an assault weapons ban in response to the mass shooting in Lewiston, Maine, last year, which claimed 18 lives.
Golden has proven politically resilient in this right-leaning district, so a loss could point to broader electoral problems for Democrats in November.
Michigan’s seventh congressional district
Democratic congresswoman Elissa Slotkin’s decision to run for Senate has created an opening in this battleground district, which both parties have identified as a key target this year.
Former Republican state senator Tom Barrett has filed to run again after losing the 2022 election to Slotkin by six points, and he is expected to face former Democratic state senator Curtis Hertel.
The Cook Political Report has described the district as “the most competitive open seat in the country”, and the high stakes will likely make for a very expensive race.
North Carolina’s first congressional district
Freshman Democratic congressman Don Davis is running for re-election in this north-eastern North Carolina district, which shifted to the right after the latest round of redistricting.
Much to the relief of Republican strategists, Laurie Buckhout won the congressional nomination over Sandy Smith, who lost to Davis by five points in 2022. Smith’s electoral prospects had been hampered by her controversial record; she was previously accused of domestic abuse, and she was at the Capitol on 6 January 2021, when a group of Trump supporters stormed the building to disrupt the certification of Biden’s victory in the 2020 election.
Republicans are hopeful that Buckhout’s impressive résumé as an army veteran and founder of her own consulting firm, combined with the more favorable district lines, will be enough to unseat Davis.
New York’s 17th congressional district
Mike Lawler made headlines when he defeated incumbent Sean Patrick Maloney, then the chair of House Democrats’ campaign arm, by less than one point in 2022. This year, Maloney is expected to face off against former Democratic congressman Mondaire Jones in this Hudson valley district that went for Biden in 2020.
Lawler did not get dealt the worst hand from New York’s redistricting process; that distinction goes to fellow Republican freshman Brandon Williams, whose Syracuse-area seat went from Biden +7 to Biden +11, according to the Cook Political Report.
All the same, Lawler will face stiff competition in a race that will be closely watched for broader electoral trends in November. If he cannot hold on to the seat, it could spell trouble for Republicans up and down the ballot.
Pennsylvania’s eighth congressional district
Along with Golden, Cartwright is one of just five House Democrats who represent districts won by Trump in 2020, and Republicans are gunning for his Scranton-area seat.
But Cartwright has repeatedly defied political gravity in this right-leaning district, most recently winning re-election by roughly two points in 2022. This time around, Cartwright will face local businessman Rob Bresnahan, who could pose a serious threat to the six-term incumbent.
Cartwright has to hope he can pull off another upset to hold on to this toss-up seat.",2024-06-11
Guardian,Michigan congresswoman Rashida Tlaib declines to endorse Kamala Harris,"Michigan congresswoman Rashida Tlaib declined to endorse Kamala Harris at a union rally in Detroit, where the war in Gaza is the top issue for the largest block of Arab American voters in the country.
Tlaib, the first Palestinian American woman to serve in Congress, is the only one of the so-called leftist “Squad” that has not endorsed the Democrat candidate. The other three members – Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York – endorsed Harris in July.
“Don’t underestimate the power you all have,” Tlaib told a get-out-the-vote United Auto Workers rallygoers. “More than those ads, those lawn signs, those billboards, you all have more power to turn out people that understand we’ve got to fight back against corporate greed in our country.”
Tlaib’s non-endorsement of Harris comes as a voter survey published on Friday suggested that 43% of Muslim American voters support the Green party candidate, Jill Stein.
After Hillary Clinton’s loss to Donald Trump in 2016, Democrats blamed Stein voters for the loss of Michigan and Wisconsin to the Republican candidate. Some Democrats fear that the same scenario could play out again next week.
Earlier this year, during the presidential primary campaigns, about 100,000 Michigan voters marked their ballots “uncommitted” as a mark of protest against the Biden administration’s support of Israel’s invasion of Gaza after the cross -border Hamas attack in October last year that killed 1,200 people and took more than 200 hostages, mostly civilians.
Israel’s attack on Gaza has since killed more than 40,000 people, with many of them women and children. In Lebanon, where Israel has now invaded to fight with Iran-backed Hezbollah, more than 2,897 people have been killed and 13,150 wounded, the country’s health ministry reports. A quarter of those killed were women and children.
The US has been a staunch ally of Israel during the fighting, continuing to send arms to the country and limiting its public criticism of Israeli actions.
Tlaib has been critical of the Democratic party’s position on the growing and bloody conflict, saying it was “hard not to feel invisible” after the party did not include a Palestinian American speaker at its convention in Chicago in August.
In an interview with Zeteo, the news organization founded by former MSNBC host (and Guardian contributor) Mehdi Hasan, Tlaib said the omission “made it clear with their speakers that they value Israeli children more than Palestinian children”.
“Our trauma and pain feel unseen and ignored by both parties,” she added. “One party uses our identity as a slur, and the other refuses to hear from us. Where is the shared humanity? Ignoring us won’t stop the genocide.”
Harris has faced continued protests on the trail, as demonstrators call for her to break with President Joe Biden and support an arms embargo on Israel. Harris has said Israel “has right to defend itself”, and that Palestinians need “dignity, security”.
Confronted by a protester in Wisconsin two weeks ago who accused the Jewish state of genocide, Harris said: “I know what you’re speaking of. I want a ceasefire. I want the hostage deal done. I want the war to end.”
At a rally in Dearborn earlier on Friday, Tlaib the criticized Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, who has been endorsed by the Muslim mayors of Dearborn Heights and Hamtramck.
“Trump is a proud Islamophobe + serial liar who doesn’t stand for peace,” Tlaib posted on X. “The reality is that the Biden admin’s unconditional support for genocide is what got us here. This should be a wake-up call for those who continue to support genocide. This election didn’t have to be close.”",2024-11-02
Guardian,Donald Trump says he will meet Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday – as it happened,"Donald Trump said he would meet with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday morning at Trump Tower.
Yesterday, the former president attacked Zlenskyy directly and accused him of “refusing” to negotiate a peace deal with Russia’s Vladimir Putin. “The president of Ukraine is in our country. He is making little nasty aspersions toward your favourite president, me,” Trump said. “We continue to give billions of dollars to a man who refuses to make a deal: Zelenskyy.”
A fued between Trump and Zelenskyy has escalated in recent days, as my colleague Andrew Roth reports:
Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Joe Biden at the White House, and with Kamala Harris. The Ukrainian leader is also expected to meet with Donald Trump tomorrow – amid an escalating feud between the two. Trump has suggested that Ukraine should have made concessions to Russia before it invaded, and accused Zelenskyy of making “aspersions” toward him.
Here’s what else is going on:
As part of the US’s “surge” in security assistance to Ukraine, Biden has directed the defense department to allocate all of its remaining security assistance funding that has been appropriated for Ukraine by the end of his term.
Biden and Harris introduced a new executive order to tackle gun violence, creating a task force to investigate the threats of machine-gun conversion devices and 3D-printed guns, and instructing the federal government to create guidelines on school active shooter drills, which can be traumatizing to students.
New York City mayor Eric Adams was charged in a 57-page federal indictment with crimes relating to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, federal program bribery and receiving campaign contributions by foreign nationals, wire fraud, solicitation of a contribution by a foreign national and bribery. He has maintained his innocence.
Federal prosecutors called Adams’s alleged misconduct a grave breach of public trust. The US attorney for the southern district of New York, Damian Williams , strongly criticized the mayor at a press conference. Charges against Adams also include acceptance of illegal foreign campaign contributions including from Turkish government officials. Williams said the mayor “kept the public in the dark”.
The voting machine company Smartmatic and the conservative outlet Newsmax have settled a closely watched defamation lawsuit days before it was scheduled to go to trial in Delaware.
In a characteristically rambling news conference, Trump ripped into Harris for planning a visit to the US border – and unleashed a slew of fiction and fear-mongering about the border and immigrants.
Meanwhile, back at the White House, Joe Biden outlined the grave necessity of programs to address gun violence.
His new executive order entails:
The creation of federal taskforce to evaluate the threats posed by machine gun conversion devices, which can alter handguns or other semi-automatic firearms to match the rate of fire of military machine guns. The taskforce will also investigate further the threats posed by 3D-printed firearms that are impossible to trace.
Orders to develop new guidelines for schools, colleges and universities on how to conduct active shooter drills. Most schools conduct these drills, but evidence suggests they can be traumatic to students.
US and European officials have noted with varying levels of alarm the potential for a Trump administration to sharply reduce US aid to Ukraine in order to force Zelenskyy to accept terms for a ceasefire.
Asked if the Democrats wanted to “Trump-proof” aid to Ukraine before a potential Trump presidency, a senior state department official said: “I don’t ever talk in those terms” but that the primary goal was to make sure Ukraine “has all the equipment it needs to keep fighting and manpower and other things”.
“At the end of the year, regardless of who wins our election in December, as at the end of this fighting season, Zelenskyy and Putin need to look at the battlefield and say, here’s what we think next year will look like,” the official said.
“And the primary factor there is, do I think the other side has all the equipment it needs to keep fighting and manpower and other things?”
On Wednesday, the House speaker, Mike Johnson, a Republican, accused Zelenskyy of election interference and demanded he fire his ambassador to Washington DC over a visit to an ammunitions factory in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. Johnson claimed the Ukrainian ambassador had failed to invite any Republicans to the event and called it a “partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats”.
Zelenskyy sought to reduce tensions on Thursday as he thanked the US for the new arms package and praised political leaders’ “strong bipartisan support” in “Ukraine’s just cause of defeating Russian aggression”.
“I am grateful to Joe Biden, [the] US Congress and both parties, Republicans and Democrats, as well as the entire American people for today’s announcement of major US defence assistance for Ukraine, totalling $7.9bn and sanctions against Russia,” Zelenskyy wrote.
Donald Trump said he would meet with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday morning at Trump Tower.
Yesterday, the former president attacked Zlenskyy directly and accused him of “refusing” to negotiate a peace deal with Russia’s Vladimir Putin. “The president of Ukraine is in our country. He is making little nasty aspersions toward your favourite president, me,” Trump said. “We continue to give billions of dollars to a man who refuses to make a deal: Zelenskyy.”
A fued between Trump and Zelenskyy has escalated in recent days, as my colleague Andrew Roth reports:
The joint appearance of Biden and Harris today highlights Harris’s role overseeing the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention.
“Over the years, I’ve held the hands of far too many mothers and fathers to try and comfort them after their child was killed by gun violence. And let us all agree, it does not have to be this way,” Harris said. “We know how to stop these tragedies, and it is a false choice to suggest you are either in favor of the second amendment or you want to take everyone’s guns away.”
The president today is marking the roll-out of an executive order that includes several gun-related measures, including the creation of a task force to assess the threat of machine gun conversion devices.
Joe Biden took the podium to chants of “Thank you Joe.”
The audience at the White House is full of survivors and the families of those killed by gun violence. Biden was also introduced by Birmingham mayor Randall Woodfin, whose city was rocked by gun violence on Saturday in the Five Points entertainment district. Four people were killed and 17 injured.
“I know the scream of a mother when her child is killed. I know that because I heard it from the voice of my own mother when my brother was killed by gun violence,” Woodfin said. “I heard that scream again this past Saturday.”
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris deliver remarks on addressing gun violence
The president and vice-president are speaking from the White House, and were introduced by a student who was 15 when a gunman opened fire on students and staff at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school.
In a characteristically rambling news conference, Donald Trump ripped into Kamala Harris for visiting the border – and unleashed a slew of fiction and fear-mongering about the border and immigrants.
Among his claims was that the CBP One app, which people arriving at the US southern border must use to schedule appointment for an asylum screening, was being used by “virtually unlimited numbers of illegals to press a button schedule their illegal immigration appointment at our ports of entry”.
Using the app to schedule an asylum screening, is, of course one way to legally immigrate to the US. Seeking asylum is legal.
Trump also repeated his fictitious claim about migrants contributing to increased crime, and that crime overall was “up” – dividing ABC’s presidential debate moderators for fact-checking his claims.
Murder dropped by more than 11% from 2022 to 2023, the largest single-year decline in two decades, according to FBI data released on Monday.
Meanwhile, the broader category of violent crime nationwide decreased about 3%, said the data, which is audited and confirms earlier reporting from unaudited statistics.
Monday’s release of audited data contradicts a talking point that Donald Trump has made on the campaign trail as the Republican presidential nominee seeks a return to the White House during the 5 November election: that crime has been rampant and out of control without him in power.
In its annual Crime in the Nation summary, the FBI said rape decreased by an estimated 9.4%, property crime dropped 2.4% and burglary fell by an estimated 7.6%.
After the 2020 election, Newsmax aired several false claims about the company, whose voting machines were only used in Los Angeles county in 2020. The network repeatedly aired false claims from Trump allies that the software was widely used across the country and that it had been hacked to change votes.
Smartmatic sued Newsmax, Fox, One America News Network (OANN) and others for broadcasting their false claims. It settled the case with OANN earlier this year and the Fox case is still pending in New York.
Smartmatic said in a statement: “We are very pleased to have secured the completion of the case against Newsmax. We are now looking forward to our court day against Fox Corp and Fox News for their disinformation campaign. Lying to the American people has consequences. Smartmatic will not stop until the perpetrators are held accountable.”
First amendment scholars were closely watching the case and several others like it to see whether libel law can be used as an effective tool to police misinformation.
The case was set to be a kind of sequel to the defamation litigation between Dominion, another voting machine company, and Fox over 2020 election lies. That case settled just before the trial was set to begin, with Fox agreeing to pay Dominion $747.5m. Eric Davis, the judge who oversaw the Fox case, also was overseeing the Newsmax case.
The voting machine company Smartmatic and the conservative outlet Newsmax have settled a closely watched defamation lawsuit days before it was scheduled to go to trial in Delaware.
A spokesperson for the Delaware courts said the case had settled on Thursday. He did not offer additional details.
Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Kamala Harris made an appearance together after meeting.
Harris emphasized: “Nothing about the end of this war can be decided without Ukraine.”
She also referenced, without explicitly mentioning, Donald Trump, who has said that Ukraine should have made concessions to Russian president Vladimir Putin before Russia’s attack:
“There are some in my country who would instead force Ukraine to give up large parts of its sovereign territory,” she said. “These proposals are the same as those of Putin. Let us be be clear. They are not proposals for peace. Instead, they are proposals for surrender.”
New York City mayor Eric Adams was charged in a 57-page federal indictment with crimes relating to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, federal program bribery and receiving campaign contributions by foreign nationals, wire fraud, solicitation of a contribution by a foreign national and bribery. He has maintained his innocence.
Federal prosecutors called Adams’s alleged misconduct a grave breach of public trust. The US attorney for the southern district of New York Damian Williams strongly criticized the mayor at a press conference a little earlier.
Williams vowed to continue to investigate the mayor’s case and to “hold more people accountable”. Charges against Adams include bribery, wire fraud and acceptance of illegal foreign campaign contributions including from Turkish government officials. Williams said the mayor “kept the public in the dark”.
The indictment against Adams includes many luxury trips that were not put in annual disclosure forms, prosecutors say. Trips cost many thousands of dollars and included visiting Turkey and flying via Turkey while visiting countries such as China, India, France, Hungary and Ghana.
Federal agents raided Adams’s official residence, Gracie Mansion, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in the early hours today, as reports emerged of the mayor being hit with a federal indictment. The raid reportedly included a group of nearly a dozen people in suits entering the property, with several carrying briefcases, backpacks or duffel bags.

Before the meeting, Zelenskyy thanked the US president for his support, saying:“Your determination is incredibly important for us to prevail … We must restore normal life, and we greatly value your leadership.”
Before their meeting, Biden released a statement, saying: “I am proud to welcome President Zelenskyy back to the White House today.”As part of the US’s “surge” in security assistance to Ukraine, Biden has directed the defense department to allocate all of its remaining security assistance funding that has been appropriated for Ukraine by the end of his term.",2024-09-26
Guardian,Middle East crisis live: ‘apocalyptic’ north Gaza hit again by deadly Israeli strikes,"Deadly Israeli strikes on 'apocalyptic' north Gaza
Israel on Saturday again carried out deadly airstrikes on north Gaza, where the UN calls conditions “apocalyptic”, as Lebanon’s Hezbollah intensified rocket fire near Israel’s commercial hub of Tel Aviv.
Since 6 October Israeli forces have carried out a major air and ground assault on north Gaza, centred on the Jabalia area, vowing to stop attempts by Hamas militants from regrouping.
“The situation unfolding in north Gaza is apocalyptic,” said a joint statement by UN agency heads, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).
“The area has been under siege for almost a month, denied basic aid and life-saving supplies while bombardment and other attacks continue,” the heads of the humanitarian, health and other agencies said.
The entire Palestinian population in north Gaza is at imminent risk of dying from disease, famine and violence.”
Witnesses told AFP that Israeli warplanes twice hit Beit Lahia, adjacent to Jabalia, overnight.
Israel’s military on Saturday said dozens of militants were killed around Jabalia “in aerial and ground activity”.
Egypt is hosting meetings between Fatah and Hamas in regards to forming a committee to run Gaza following Israel’s war on the strip, Reuters reports, citing a senior Egyptian security source speaking to Egypt’s state-affiliated Al Qahera News.
According to the source, Hamas insists that the discussions should lead to a comprehensive agreement on ending the war, as well a deal to release the hostages and Palestinians detained across Israeli prisons.
UNRWA, the main UN relief aid agency in Gaza, as well as the World Health Organization and the UN Children’s Fund has resumed the polio vaccination campaign in northern Gaza amid Israeli blockages on aid and food.
“This polio campaign is critical, but while we protect children with vaccines, they will continue to die & suffer each day until there is a comprehensive & lasting ceasefire, which is needed more urgently than ever,” the agencies said.
An Israeli airstrike has hit the border post of Joussieh, Syria, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said.
In a tweet on X, Filippo Grandi wrote:
A new Israeli airstrike hit the border post of Joussieh, where many Lebanese and Syrians cross from Lebanon to Syria. Humanitarian structures were also struck. Even fleeing (and taking care of those who flee) are becoming difficult and dangerous as the war continues to spreads.
It has just gone 5.30pm in Gaza City, Tel Aviv and Beirut. Here is a summary of the latest developments:
Israel on Saturday again carried out deadly airstrikes on north Gaza, where the UN calls conditions “apocalyptic”, as Lebanon’s Hezbollah intensified rocket fire near Israel’s commercial hub of Tel Aviv. “The situation unfolding in north Gaza is apocalyptic,” said a joint statement by UN agency heads. Witnesses told Agence France-Presse (AFP) that Israeli warplanes twice hit Beit Lahia, adjacent to Jabalia, overnight. Israel’s military on Saturday said dozens of militants were killed around Jabalia “in aerial and ground activity”.
Iran’s supreme leader on Saturday threatened Israel and the US with “a crushing response” over attacks on Iran and its allies. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei spoke as Iranian officials are increasingly threatening to launch yet another strike against Israel after its 26 October attack that targeted military bases and other locations and killed at least five people.
Troops were also operating in central Gaza and Rafah in the territory’s far south, the Israeli military said, while witnesses told AFP that Israeli drones and boats opened fire on al-Mawasi in south Gaza.
Israeli airstrikes on Friday killed at least 52 people and injured scores more, the Lebanese health ministry said. In Lebanon’s north-eastern Bekaa valley, rescuers searched for survivors after airstrikes killed nine people and brought down a building that had housed 20 people in the town of Younine. Israeli strikes also killed 12 people in the town of Amhaz and 31 others across at least a dozen villages, bringing the total death toll to 52, the health ministry said. The bombardment left 72 people injured, the ministry added. There was no immediate comment from Israel on the strikes.
Israeli police said 19 people were injured before dawn on Saturday in the central town of Tira. Three projectiles crossed into Israel from Lebanon, Israel’s military said, and some were intercepted. The Magen David Adom ambulance service said two of those injured were in moderate condition from the attack, and the others had lesser injuries. A photo the service released showed damage to what appeared to be an apartment building.
Medics and Gaza’s civil defence rescuers on Saturday reported three people killed in a strike on Nuseirat, in central Gaza, a day after AFP images showed the blood-stained shrouds of several people killed there in an Israeli strike.
A strike in Israel’s Sharon area north of Tel Aviv injured 19 people, police said early on Saturday, after the army reported three projectiles fired from Lebanon into central Israel. Four of the injured were “in moderate condition”, the Israeli police said.
Hezbollah said it had again launched rockets at Israel’s Glilot intelligence base near Tel Aviv. At 2.30am (12.30am GMT) militants “fired a salvo of rockets at the Glilot base of the 8200 military intelligence unit in the suburbs of Tel Aviv” the group said in a statement.
Israel’s military said a strike around the southern Lebanese city of Tyre on Friday killed two fighters “responsible for firing over 400 projectiles at Israel over the last month alone”.
Lebanon’s health ministry said 11 people were injured on Saturday in an Israeli strike on Hezbollah’s south Beirut stronghold. The ministry announcement came as the official National News Agency said the “Israeli enemy launched a raid near Karout mall... in the southern suburbs of Beirut”. The strike was not preceded by an Israeli evacuation warning, reported AFP.
Hezbollah said on Saturday it carried out a rocket attack against Israeli “military industries” in Zvulun, near the northern city of Haifa, after a drone attack on a base south of Tel Aviv. Twice on Saturday, “salvoes of rockets” were fired at “the Zvulun base for military industries north of the city of Haifa”, the group said in a statement. Earlier, it said it had launched drones at the Palmachim airbase south of Tel Aviv.
On Saturday the Israeli military said it had intercepted three drones over the Red Sea, after late Friday reporting seven drones had been launched from “several fronts”.
A coalition of pro-Iran groups in Iraq said it carried out four drone attacks on the Israeli resort of Eilat on Saturday, after Israel said it intercepted three drones approaching from the east. In a statement, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq said it was behind the attacks on what it called “four vital targets” in the resort on Israel’s Red Sea coast, all conducted within one hour.
A suspected Israeli naval force landed in the northern Lebanese coastal town of Batroun early on Saturday and captured one person, a security source said, while another source confirmed the incident but did not say who was responsible, reported Reuters. There was no immediate comment from Israeli and Lebanese authorities. Pro-Hezbollah journalist Hassan Illaik shared CCTV footage on X that appeared to show soldiers walking in a street, two of them holding a person. Lebanese transport minister Ali Hamiye, who represents Hezbollah in Lebanon’s government, said the video was accurate but did not provide further details.
Axios has reported that Israeli naval forces captured a senior Hezbollah official, Imad Amhaz, in an operation in northern Lebanon. Barak Ravid wrote the news on X, citing an Israeli official.
Unicef has warned that the ongoing conflict in Lebanon is “massively impacting children’s mental health”. In its post on X on Saturday, Unicef wrote: “True healing can only begin when this war on childhood ends. Ceasefire now.”
At least 43,314 Palestinians have been killed and 102,019 injured in Israel’s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October 2023, Gaza’s health ministry said on Saturday. The toll includes 55 deaths in the previous 24 hours, according to the ministry. It does not distinguish between combatants and non-combatants.
Israel’s military says 37 soldiers have been killed in Lebanon since it began ground operations on 30 September. According to Israeli figures, at least 63 people have been killed on the Israeli side since October last year.
Two Microsoft employees who were fired last week after organising a vigil for Palestinians killed in Gaza say the company retaliated against them for their pro-Palestinian activism. The two, Abdo Mohamed, a researcher and data scientist, and Hossam Nasr, a software engineer, organised the event outside Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington, on 24 October. They were fired later that evening.
A Lebanese military source said on Saturday that unidentified naval commandos abducted a trainee mariner in the coastal city of Batroun, in an operation a judicial official said was likely carried out by Israel.
“A naval commando force kidnapped a civilian,” the military source told Agence France-Presse (AFP) on condition of anonymity, adding an investigation was under way to determine whether the operation was carried out by Israel.
A Lebanese judicial official said Israel was likely behind the “kidnapping operation”, the first of its kind since the Israel-Hezbollah war erupted in September.
Speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive matters, the official told AFP there was a “90% chance” that Israel was responsible.
Contacted by AFP, the Israeli military said they were checking reports of the incident.
Lebanon’s official National News agency (NNA) said an “unidentified military force” carried out a “sea landing” on the shore of Batroun, south of Tripoli, at dawn on Friday.
The force “went with all its weapons and equipment to a chalet near the beach, kidnapping a Lebanese man … and sailing away into the open sea on a speedboat,” the NNA said.
An acquaintance of the abductee identified him as a student at the Maritime Sciences and Technology Institute (MARSATI) in Batroun, reports AFP.
He was taken from student housing near the Batroun institute, but was a resident of the town of Qmatiyeh farther south, said the acquaintance who spoke on the condition of anonymity for security concerns.
He was completing courses to become a sea captain, the source told AFP, adding that the man was in his 30s and was well known by the teaching staff at the centre.
Lebanon’s health ministry said 11 people were injured on Saturday in an Israeli strike on Hezbollah’s south Beirut stronghold, which has been hard hit by the Israel-Hezbollah war, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).
The ministry announcement came as the official National News Agency said the “Israeli enemy launched a raid near Karout mall... in the southern suburbs of Beirut”. The strike was not preceded by an Israeli evacuation warning, reports AFP.
Two Microsoft employees who were fired last week after organising a vigil for Palestinians killed in Gaza say the company retaliated against them for their pro-Palestinian activism.
The two, Abdo Mohamed, a researcher and data scientist, and Hossam Nasr, a software engineer, organised the event outside Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington, on 24 October. They were fired later that evening.
“Microsoft really crumbled under pressure, internally and externally, to fire me and to shut down and retaliate against our event, not because of policy violations, simply because we were daring to humanize Palestinians, and simply because we were daring to say that Microsoft should not be complicit with an army that is plausibly accused of genocide,” said Nasr, who has been criticized on social media and in internal Microsoft employee communication groups over his support for Palestine.
Both employees were members of No Azure for Apartheid, a group of Microsoft workers protesting the company’s sale of its cloud computing technology to Israel.
The group demands Microsoft sever all Azure contracts and partnerships with the Israeli military and government, disclose all ties with Israel, call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in the conflict in Gaza, and protect and uphold the free speech of employees.
A suspected Israeli naval force landed in the northern Lebanese coastal town of Batroun early on Saturday and captured one person, a security source said, while another source confirmed the incident but did not say who was responsible, reports Reuters.
There was no immediate comment from Israeli and Lebanese authorities.
According to Reuters, the pro-Hezbollah journalist Hassan Illaik said in a post on X that a large group of Israeli troops made a landing in the resort town and captured the man, before departing on speed boats.
He reportedly shared CCTV footage appearing to show soldiers walking in a street, two of them holding a person.
Lebanese transport minister Ali Hamiye, who represents Hezbollah in Lebanon’s government, said the video was accurate but did not provide further details, reports Reuters.

Guardian,Newcastle United 1-0 Arsenal: Premier League – as it happened,"Eddie Howe’s turn on TNT. “I’m tired, actually … I need a lie down … it was intense … maybe not for the neutral an entertaining game, but fascinating if you were involved in it … a lack of goalmouth action but that’s down to the tactical set-up of both sides … a massive win against a really good team … once we scored, Arsenal played well … we were then content to defend well … we had to … they have threats all over the pitch … I’m really pleased with our defensive performance … heroic blocking … if you can’t play brilliant attacking football every week, you need to find different ways to win … to beat Arsenal shows our qualities.”
Mikel Arteta speaks to TNT. “We started really well … dominant … we don’t defend the box well enough … credit to them, they put an unbelievable header and delivery into the box … from there the game changes … from the moment they go ahead, you have to play a different game … adapt to that … we didn’t well enough … we didn’t find enough answers … at the end, I am very frustrated … we got dragged into a game they were looking for constantly … we did not have enough consistency to get out of that … credit to them … it is time to do it on the pitch … we are not going to find the right words today … we have to be at our best in every department.”
Player of the matchAlan BennettLewis Hall speaks to TNT Sports. “It was a really really good performance from us … working hard together … Bukayo is an amazing player … if I kept him as quiet as possible, I think I did my job well … every block, tackle and throw-in we win get the crowd going … I absolutely love my time at Newcastle … I’m just proud I can wear the shirt … there are not many left-backs in the England squad, so I’d be lying if I said I hadn’t noticed that … but I’m just concentrating on playing for Newcastle … I can’t thank Eddie Howe enough for what he’s done for me so far … we’re playing good football and getting results and it’s something we can build on.”
Post-match mailbag. “Excellent victory, iconic goal and while Russell E was getting the excuses ready, I’d already jinxed Mikel Merino’s performance in pre-match mailbag. My work here is done. Can’t wait to buy myself a retro jacket from the club store to celebrate (RRP £199)” – Chris Paraskevas
“This whole season and parts of last season as well, Arsenal have used every dark art found in the Mourinho playbook. So I’m not sure whether Arsenal are complaining about Newcastle’s antics due to unacceptable Newcastle play or deflecting away from their own team’s dull performance. We need Emo Arteta from Squires for confirmation” – Yash Gupta
Newcastle’s goalscoring hero Alexander Isak speaks to TNT. “That was massive … a big game against a big team … it means a lot … a bit of a statement … heading is not my strongest quality so it feels good to score … it’s special … our fans are amazing, every game, win or lose … it gives you an extra boost … I’ve been successful here and hopefully I can keep going … that cross was amazing … it felt like I just had to jump and put my head on the ball, and the rest would fix itself … credit to [Anthony Gordon] as well … Arsenal have a strong defence … it was a difficult task … I am happy we could score and keep a clean sheet … we’ve had a bad spell but hopefully this win will be an ice-breaker for us … one game at a time.”
That’s a huge win for Newcastle. They scored a world-class goal, Alexander Isak elegantly converting Anthony Gordon’s on-a-plate cross, and defended resolutely afterwards. St James’ Park erupts in celebration, and the home team receives the ovation their efforts deserve. The victory ends a five-game sequence without a Premier League win, and they rise to eighth in the table, where they’ll stay tonight unless Bournemouth pull a surprise against Manchester City. Arsenal will certainly hope the Cherries can do something sensational later this afternoon, because another blunt display has seen them lose further ground on the leaders, and that’s now just one point from the last nine available. They were creatively lacking today, with Declan Rice’s late miss their only real gilt-edged chance of the entire match. Martin Odegaard can’t return quickly enough for the title-chasing Gunners.
90 min +4: … so having said that, Saka skins Hall down the right and crosses deep. Rice, six yards out at the far post, somehow heads wide left when it was surely easier to score. What a chance for Arsenal to salvage a point!
90 min +3: On TNT, Lucy Ward names Lewis Hall as her player of the match for his work in keeping Bukayo Saka quiet. Speaking of Hall … “Surely David Hockney?” wonders Simon Reeves.
90 min +2: Rice comes through the back of Tonali, and it’s another excuse for Newcastle to run some clock down. Daft from Rice, who shakes his head with annoyance.
90 min +1: Nwaneri, who has been quiet since coming into the game and being immediately whacked, has a go from distance. It’s a wild effort that easily clears the bar, and flies wide too. Pope takes his sweet time over the restart.
90 min: Hall thumps clear with White threatening down the inside-right channel. There will be five additional minutes. Nerves a-clanking for both teams.
87 min: Barnes crosses from the right. Joelinton wins a header, but not powerfully, and it’s an easy pluck for Raya. The tension around St James’ Park palpable.
85 min: Zinchenko crosses deep from the right. Jesus takes it down on the left-hand corner of the six-yard box, and prepares to shoot … only for Gordon to arrive on the scene and nick the ball away. That had to be timed perfectly, for it would have otherwise been a penalty.
84 min: That stoppage for Newcastle’s keeper, then. Here’s Russell E again: “The Guardian’s very own Louise Taylor said yesterday: ‘Players are sometimes awarded mini-rests when Newcastle indulge in the dark arts, principally time-wasting tactics to protect leads. Watch out for Nick Pope going down, apparently injured.’ And here we are.”
81 min: Another Arsenal free kick comes to nought, as Rice’s delivery from the right is no good. Newcastle attempt to counter, and Gordon, dribbling down the right has options in the middle, but he dillies and dallies and eventually Gabriel arrives from behind to whip the ball off his toe.
77 min: After a dousing down with the magic sponge, Pope is good to continue. “No vital insight on the action, but is it just me or does Lewis Hall - if you imagine him with glasses on - bear an uncanny resemblance to a young Alan Bennett?” asks Rob Knap. “Once you’ve seen it, etc. (Admittedly this might be one for a fairly small segment of your audience.)”
74 min: Saka goes down in pain having been accidentally clipped on the heel by Hall. A lot of screaming, though he thankfully gets up quickly enough and is back up and running. Arsenal hearts in mouths for a split second there.
70 min: Newcastle go up the other end and win a corner down the right. Tonali swings in. It’s another particularly poor delivery, but Arsenal only half clear, and Tonali is able to try again. This time Arsenal deal with the situation. This is getting pretty scrappy.",2024-11-02
