News Max,"Walz, Vance Go After Each Other's Running Mates","Tim Walz and J.D. Vance on Tuesday went after each other's running mates in a vice presidential debate that opened with a discussion of burgeoning domestic and international troubles — a hurricane that ravaged much of the southeast U.S. and growing fears of a regional Middle East war.
Both Walz, the Democratic governor of Minnesota, and Vance, a Republican senator from Ohio, focused many of their attacks at the top of the ticket, as is traditional for VP debates. They each pointed to the crises of the day as reasons for voters to choose Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump.
Walz, answering a question on whether he'd support a preemptive strike on Iran after it launched missiles at Israel, painted Trump as too dangerous for the country and the world in an unstable moment.
“What’s fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter,” said Walz, the Democratic governor of Minnesota. ""And the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago, a nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment.”
Vance, in his reply, argued that Trump is an intimidating figure whose presence on the international stage is its own deterrent.
“Donald Trump actually delivered stability,"" he said.
The debate in New York hosted by CBS News opened with a sober tone that reflected growing domestic and international concerns about safety and security. But it gave way to sharper attacks from both Walz and Vance — and a moment in which the moderators stopped the discussion by cutting the two men's mics.
Walz accused Vance and Trump of villainizing legal immigrants in Vance’s home state. He pointed to the fact that Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine had to send in extra law enforcement to provide security to the city’s schools after Vance tweeted about and Trump amplified persistent claims about Haitians eating pets.
“This is what happens when you don’t want to solve it, you demonize it,” Walz said, saying not doing so would allow people to “come together.”
Vance said the 15,000 Haitians in the city had caused housing, economic and other issues that the Biden-Harris administration was ignoring.
When the debate moderators pointed out that the Haitians living there had legal status, Vance protested that CBS News had said its moderators would not be fact-checking, leaving the onus to the candidates. As Vance continued and the moderators tried to move on, his microphone was cut and neither man could be heard.
Both men found unity on Hurricane Helene, which has devastated several states and caused massive flooding in North Carolina in particular. Walz mentioned the storm’s devastation and talked about working with governors across the country, saying they don’t let politics get in the way of collaborating.
The question about Hurricane Helene led to a moment of political comity as Vance said, “I’m sure Gov. Walz joins me in saying our hearts go out to those innocent people.”
The two Midwesterners struck a noticeably friendlier tone than matchup between Trump and Harris — or, earlier this year, Trump and President Joe Biden before he dropped out of the race.
When they first turned to immigration and the influx of migrants coming over the U.S.-Mexico border, one of the most heated topics of the campaign, the two men credited each other with having good intentions.
“I believe Senator Vance wants to solve this, but by standing with Donald Trump and not working together to find a solution, it becomes a talking point and when it becomes a talking point like this, we dehumanize and villainize other human beings,” Walz said.
Vance echoed the sentiment, saying, “I think you want to solve this problem, but I don’t think that Kamala Harris does.”
Polls have shown Harris and Trump locked in a close contest, giving added weight to anything that can sway voters on the margins, including the impression left by the vice presidential candidates. It also might be the last debate of the campaign, with the Harris and Trump teams failing to agree on another meeting.
The role of a presidential running mate is typically to serve as an attack dog for the person at the top of the ticket, arguing against the opposing presidential candidate and their proxy on stage. Both Vance and Walz have embraced that role.
Early Tuesday night, Vance was giving a largely measured performance instead of assuming his combative persona from the campaign trail or in media interviews.
Walz, meanwhile, did not deploy the arsenal of folksy zingers that excited Democrats when he was named as Harris’ running mate.
Vance's occasionally confrontational interviews and appearances have underscored why Trump picked him for the Republican ticket despite his past biting criticisms of the former president, including once suggesting Trump would be “America’s Hitler.”
“When you get something wrong and you change your mind, you ought to be honest with the American people,” he said Tuesday.
Walz had catapulted onto Harris’ campaign by branding Trump and Republicans as “ just weird,” creating an attack line for Democrats seeking to argue Republicans are disconnected from the American people.
He was pressed Tuesday on his claim, which was investigated this week by Minnesota Public Radio and other outlets, that he was in Hong Kong during the turbulence surrounding the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, part of a broader pattern of inaccuracies that Republicans hope to exploit.
Confronted with his misstatements about his travels to China years ago, Walz defended himself by saying, “I’ve not been perfect.” In fact, he said, “I’m a knucklehead at times.” Eventually, he acknowledged he misspoke about his history.
A new AP-NORC poll found that Walz is better liked than Vance, potentially giving the Republican an added challenge.
Trump, on Tuesday evening, said his advice to Vance was to “have a lot of fun” and praised his running mate as a “smart guy” and “a real warrior.”

News Max,Decision Desk/The Hill: Trump Leads for First Time,"Former President Donald Trump moved ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris for the first time in the Decision Desk HQ/The Hill presidential election forecast.
The presidential election model showed Trump with a 52% chance of winning the election, while Harris has a 48% chance, The Hill reported Sunday.
It marked the first time the Republican presidential nominee has been the favorite over Democrat Harris in this election cycle.
The forecast also gave Republicans the advantage to win majorities in both houses of Congress, with a 71% chance of winning control of the Senate and a 54% chance of retaining control of the House.
Trump's edge coincided with his improved polling averages in battleground states Wisconsin and Michigan. He already held slim swing-state advantages in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina.
Pennsylvania remained the lone battleground state favoring Harris, The Hill reported.
The polling showed that the races in all seven key swing states remained within the margins of error.
From late August to September, the Decision Desk HQ/The Hill forecast gave Harris a 54%-56% chance of winning. In early October, the forecast predicted that Trump and Harris each had a close to 50% chance.
Trump took the advantage Oct. 20.
The latest Decision Desk HQ/The Hill election forecast favored the GOP to flip two (Montana and West Virginia) Democrat U.S. Senate seats and one Democrat-held seat (Ohio) as a toss-up.
The forecast showed 16 seats as toss-ups, split evenly between the two parties when given a ""slightly favoring"" description; 12 seats are rated as ""lean,"" with seven leaning Republican and seven leaning Democrat.
On Monday, TIPP survey results showed Trump holding a 1-point lead (48% to 47%) over Harris in the race for the White House just 15 days before Election Day.
TIPP's poll results said Trump holds a 48% plurality among independents and has made inroads with Black voters.

News Max,Fla. Poll: Trump Up 10 in Former Swing State,"A new poll out of the University of North Florida's Public Opinion Research Lab shows that former President Donald Trump is ten points ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris in the Sunshine State.
The survey of 977 likely Florida voters said Trump was leading Harris, with 53% of respondents indicating they would vote for the former president if the election were held today as opposed to the vice president, who garnered 43% support. Meanwhile, 2% of respondents said they would vote for another candidate, and 2% remain undecided.
""Hurricane Milton making landfall smack dab in the middle of our field period for this poll proved a big challenge, so we made some methodological choices to increase our coverage and ensure a representative sample,"" UNF political science professor Dr. Michael Binder said.
""Prior research tells us that the folks who blurt out their candidate vote choice and then hang up are very likely to vote, and most of those 'blurters' are Trump supporters. This might help explain why his lead widened to 10 points, up from 7 in our last poll back in July.""
The survey was conducted from Oct. 7 through Oct. 18, with a margin of error of ± 3.49 percentage points.

News Max,Biden: 'I Don't Believe There Is Going to Be an All-Out War',"President Joe Biden said on Thursday he did not believe there is going to be an ""all-out war"" in the Middle East, a region that has been on edge amid Israel's assaults in Gaza and Lebanon and escalation of the U.S. ally's tensions with Iran.
The president said that such a war can be avoided but more needed to be done to ensure that.
Asked how confident he was that such a war can be averted, he paused and told reporters: ""How confident are you it's not going to rain? Look, I don't believe there is going to be an all-out war. I think we can avoid it.""
He added: ""But there is a lot to do yet, a lot to do yet.""
When asked if he would send American troops to help Israel, he responded: ""We have already helped Israel. We are going to protect Israel.""
Tensions between Iran and Israel have been high as Israel has been weighing options to respond to Tehran's ballistic missile attack on Tuesday, which Iran had carried out in response to Israel's military action in Lebanon.
The latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered by Palestinian Hamas militants' Oct. 7 attack that killed 1,200, with about 250 taken as hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's subsequent assault on Hamas-governed Gaza has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health ministry, and displaced nearly Gaza's entire population, caused a hunger crisis and led to genocide allegations that Israel denies.
Israel's recent military action in Lebanon has killed hundreds, wounded thousands and displaced a million. Israel says it is targeting Lebanese Iran-backed Hezbollah militants.

News Max,"Police: Fires at Ballot Sites in Ore., Wash. Connected; 'Suspect Vehicle' ID'd","Police said Monday that a “suspect vehicle” has been identified in connection with incendiary devices that set fires to ballot drop boxes in Oregon and Washington state.
Surveillance images captured a Volvo stopping at a drop box in Portland, Oregon, just before security personnel nearby discovered a fire inside the box on Monday, Portland Police Bureau spokesman Mike Benner told a news conference.
That fire damaged three ballots inside, while officials say a fire at a drop box in nearby Vancouver, Washington, early Monday destroyed hundreds of ballots. The devices were attached to the outside of the boxes, police said.
Authorities said at a news conference in Portland that enough material from the incendiary devices was recovered to show that the two fires Monday were connected — and that they were also connected to an Oct. 8 incident, when an incendiary device was placed at a different ballot drop box in Vancouver.
“Heartbreaking,” said Greg Kimsey, the longtime elected auditor in Clark County, Washington, which includes Vancouver. “It’s a direct attack on democracy.”
The ballot drop boxes in Washington and Oregon both have fire suppression systems that are designed to activate when the temperature inside reaches a certain point, coating ballots inside with a fire-suppressing powder. The system appeared to have worked in the Portland drop box, and security staffers were nearby to help put out the fire.
But for unknown reasons, the system failed to prevent the destruction of hundreds of ballots in Vancouver, just across the Columbia River from Portland.
Vancouver is the biggest city in Washington’s 3rd Congressional District, the site of what is expected to be one of the closest U.S. House races in the country, between first-term Democratic Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez and Republican challenger Joe Kent.
“I hope the perpetrator of this reprehensible act is quickly apprehended — and local and federal law enforcement have my full support in working to keep our democratic process safe and secure,” Gluesenkamp Perez said in a statement.
She said she’s requesting an overnight law enforcement presence posted at all ballot drop boxes in Clark County through Election Day.
“Southwest Washington cannot risk a single vote being lost to arson and political violence,” her statement said.
Representatives for Kent’s campaign didn’t immediately return phone and email messages seeking comment.
The Portland Police Bureau said the fire there was reported at about 3:30 a.m. Multnomah County Elections Director Tim Scott said thanks to the suppressant system, only three ballots there were damaged, and his office planned to contact those voters to help them obtain replacement ballots.
A few hours later, television crews in Vancouver captured footage of smoke pouring out of a ballot box at a transit center.
There were surveillance cameras that covered the drop box and surrounding area, Kimsey said.
The last ballot pickup at the transit center drop box was at 11 a.m. Saturday, Kimsey said. Anyone who dropped their ballot there after that was urged to contact the auditor’s office to obtain a new one.
The office will be increasing how frequently it collects ballots, Kimsey said, and changing collection times to the evening, to keep the ballot boxes from remaining full of ballots overnight when similar crimes are considered more likely to occur.
An incendiary device was also found on or near a ballot drop box in downtown Vancouver early on Oct. 8. It did not damage the box or destroy any ballots, police said.
In a statement, the FBI said it is coordinating with federal, state and local partners to actively investigate the two incidents. Anyone with information is asked to contact the nearest FBI office, provide information through tips.fbi.gov or call 1-800-CALL-FBI ( 800-225-5324 ).
Washington Secretary of State Steve Hobbs said the state would not tolerate threats or acts of violence meant to derail voting.
“I strongly denounce any acts of terror that aim to disrupt lawful and fair elections in Washington state,” he said.
Voters were encouraged to check their ballot status online at www.votewa.gov to track its return status. If a returned ballot is not marked as “received,” voters can print a replacement ballot or visit their local elections department for a replacement, the Secretary of State’s office said.
Washington and Oregon are both vote-by-mail states. Registered voters receive their ballots in the mail a few weeks before elections and then return them by mail or by placing them in ballot drop boxes.
In Phoenix last week, officials said roughly five ballots were destroyed and others damaged when a fire was set in a drop box at a U.S. Postal Service station there.

News Max,Mark Cuban: Trump Is Grinch Trying to Steal Christmas,"Donald Trump is the “Grinch that’s trying to steal your Christmas,” according to entrepreneur Mark Cuban.
“This time next year, we're going to be thinking about Christmas presents for all of our kids, and if he puts a 60% tariff on everything from China, those prices are going up,” Cuban told Vice President Kamala Harris in a conversation uploaded to YouTube on Wednesday.
""And now all of a sudden, your vision of everything you wanted to have for your kids at Christmas is gone. Donald Trump just crushed it,"" added Cuban, a Harris supporter.
Trump has vowed to implement massive tariffs should he get reelected, including a 10% or 20% tax on all imported goods and a 60% tariff on Chinese imports.
He said he would also impose additional tariffs on China if China were to ""go into Taiwan,"" The Wall Street Journal reported.
""I would say: If you go into Taiwan, I'm sorry to do this, I'm going to tax you, at 150% to 200%,"" the former U.S. president was quoted as saying in an interview with the Journal published on Friday evening.
During his term as president from early 2017 to early 2021, Trump's aggressive approach toward China was underscored by waves of tariffs that plunged the two countries into a trade war that moved markets worldwide.

News Max,Trump Pokes Fun at NYC Legal Woes at Al Smith Dinner,"Former President Donald Trump, speaking at the Al Smith charity dinner in New York City on Thursday night, said it was nice to come to the Big Apple without having to appear in court.
""It's really a pleasure anywhere in New York without a subpoena for my appearance,"" Trump said to laughter at the New York Hilton Midtown in an event that benefits Catholic charities. ""Anytime I don't get a subpoena, I'm very happy.""
The dinner, which in a presidential election year traditionally features both major party candidates for some good-natured ribbing and roasting – Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris declined to attend Thursday night – is named after the first major-party Roman Catholic presidential nominee, four-term Democrat New York Gov. Al Smith, who lost to Republican Herbert Hoover in the 1928 election.
Trump's speech was simulcast on Newsmax.
Playing on the legal theme, Trump joked with Democrat New York Mayor Eric Adams, who is facing federal charges alleging he secured bribes from foreign nationals and illegal campaign contributions in exchange for political favors.
""Mayor Adams, good luck with everything,"" Trump said while looking at Adams on the huge dais. ""They went after you. They went after you, mayor. Yeah, boy, I knew that nine-and-a-half months ago. I said, you know, he just said something [bad] about the [Biden-Harris] administration. He's going to be indicted. Any moment.
""And guess what happened? But you're going to win. I think you're going to win. I know you're going to win. So good luck. Good luck. I don't like what they do. I don't like what they do.""
In 2020, Trump and Joe Biden appeared at the event virtually because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in 2016, Trump and Hillary Clinton spoke. Trump noted that Harris was the first Democrat presidential candidate to skip since Walter Mondale in 1984.""
""The last Democrat not to attend this important event was Walter Mondale, and it did not go very well for him,"" Trump said. ""He lost 49 states, and he won one: Minnesota. So, I said, there's no way I'm missing it. .. But that's true, Walter Mondale, 49 to 1. He was expected to do well, and it didn't work out. It shows you there is a God. I mean, for those people that are questioning it.""

News Max,Woodward Book: Biden Like a 'Senile Grandfather',"A new book by Watergate journalist Bob Woodward features eyewitness accounts that claim President Joe Biden looked ""frighteningly awful"" and like a ""senile grandfather"" at fundraising events more than a year before he ended his bid for reelection.
According to the New York Post, Woodward's book, ""War,"" quoted Liberties Journal President Bill Reichblum, who claimed Biden ""never completed a sentence"" at a fundraiser held in June 2023 at the home of philanthropists Michael and Susie Gelman.
""He would start to talk about something, jump somewhere else. He told the same story three times in exactly the same way and it meandered so much,"" Reichblum was quoted as saying in the book. ""Frankly, my impression was there were times it was as though we didn't exist. He was just rambling and talking as to what came into his head.""
Biden dropped out of the race days after the Republican National Convention and one week after the first assassination attempt on Donald Trump. Those followed Biden's widely panned debate performance against Trump in late June.
Many of the president's allies had defended his cognitive fitness before the debate and disputed claims he was mentally unfit to run for office. In the book, Woodward describes how several top Biden aides did not admit the full extent of his struggles until after it became apparent on the debate stage.
The book also revealed some Democrats observed peculiarities regarding Biden's behavior long before Democrat leaders called on him to withdraw from the race.
One party donor at a Silicon Valley fundraiser hosted by Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott in June 2023 was quoted in ""War"" as saying the president ""could not wait to sit down and only took two pre-arranged questions.""
Other witnesses at the same event claimed in the book Biden seemed to have difficulty giving his speech, despite having notecards to help him.
""It was 'like your 87-year-old senile grandfather,' wandering around the room, saying to women guests, 'Your eyes are so beautiful,'"" Woodward wrote, quoting one anonymous guest.
However, at a second event on the same day, Woodward quoted venture capitalist Steve Westly as saying Biden was ""energetic"" and ""wouldn't sit down for two hours.""
According to the book, attendees at a Biden campaign fundraiser at the Four Seasons Hotel in New York City also observed the president's declining state.
The attendees claimed Biden could not recall the word ""veteran"" and asked members of the audience what word was used to describe a person who ""served in the military.""
At one point during the event, an anonymous Hollywood executive reportedly confronted Biden, telling him he was ""f*cking up your campaign.""
""Every time you get out and walk, people think 'old,'"" the executive said.

News Max,Danielle Alvarez to Newsmax: Trump 'Leader for Working Americans',"Danielle Alvarez, a senior adviser to the 2024 Trump campaign, told Newsmax on Monday that the GOP presidential nominee's weekend shift at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania shows that he is the ""leader for working Americans.""
""President Donald Trump has now spent more time working at a McDonald's than [Vice President] Kamala Harris has, but that's no surprise, given that all that she can do is lie when she opens her mouth,"" Alvarez told ""Wake Up America.""
""It was such an incredible experience,"" she said. ""President Donald Trump is the leader for working Americans and we saw that yesterday, displayed as he worked the fry cooker at McDonald's.
""We saw thousands and thousands of patriots outside in Pennsylvania just trying to get a glimpse of him. That's the movement, that's the momentum that President Trump has as we head into the final days of this election, because people know that he can restore our economy, that he can fight for the working class, that he can bring down inflation, that he can do all the things that this administration, the Harris-Biden administration, has failed to do.""
Even though RealClearPolitics shows Trump ahead in every battleground state for the first time Monday morning, Alvarez said the campaign ""is not taking anything for granted.""
""When Kamala Harris joined the race, there was manufactured enthusiasm because she wasn't Joe Biden and she wasn't brain dead, but come to find out that none of her policies work for the American people,"" Alvarez said. ""She is responsible for the last four years of failure and weakness in this country — that record high inflation, the poor economy, chaos at home, abroad and open border fentanyl pouring in.
""All of those key issues that voters care about. And that is why you see President Trump surging, because he has always campaigned on those issues that matter most to voters, that matter most to the American people.""
According to Alvarez, Trump ""is the only one who can solve the problems of the last four years created by Kamala Harris and by [President] Joe Biden.""
""You're seeing that is our final message, while they no longer have joy, they no longer have vibes because they are about to be fired,"" she said. ""They are about to be evicted from the White House and we will again restore this great country and President Donald Trump will be successful in November.""
As for Trump's upcoming rally at Madison Square Garden, Alvarez said it was ""the president's idea"" and ""it's going to be huge.""
""It's been something that he has been wanting to do for months, at least, and it's going to be incredible,"" she said. ""New York is so symbolic because it's who he was as a businessman, as a successful businessman, before he brought that success to the White House and served the American people.""

News Max,"Trump: Harris Incompetent, Unfit, Unqualified","Vice President Kamala Harris is so incompetent and unfit that she is not qualified to be president, said former President Donald Trump.
""We want to bring back the American dream. We're going to do it,"" Trump said during a rally at Pennsylvania State University Saturday, carried live by Newsmax2.
""As we restore our economy, we will also restore our borders. Over the last four years, Kamala Harris has orchestrated the most egregious betrayal than any leader in American history has ever inflicted on our people,"" he added.
""She has eradicated our sovereign border, and she has unleashed an army of migrant gangs who are waging a campaign of violence and terror against our citizens all over our country. Kamala has imported an invasion of criminal migrants from prisons and jails, insane asylums, and mental institutions from all around the world, from Venezuela to the Congo in Africa.
""They're letting in tremendous numbers. They're letting out all their prisoners from the prisons in the Congo, and they're coming into the United States. And they're forcing them into our country, and we're accepting them because we're led by stupid people.""
The border will be closed come January, said Trump, among other fixes.
""The country is in free fall,"" he said. ""We're a nation in decline, but we're going to turn it around fast. ... You won't have to send your kids out to war, have your kid blown up in a country you never heard of.""
""I will not send you to fight and die in a foolish, never-ending foreign war. I'll get you out of the wokeness, and your schools will be great again. We'll end left-wing censorship, and I'll defend your God-given rights,"" he added.

News Max,"Musk: Media Encouraging Assassination of Me, Trump","Elon Musk said the media is encouraging the assassination of him and former President Donald Trump.
""With their relentless hit pieces, legacy mainstream media are actively encouraging the assassination of @realDonaldTrump and now me,"" Musk wrote in a post on X, which he owns.
Musk made similar comments at a Trump rally in Pennsylvania.
""Anyway, so dramatically increasing my risk of being assassinated,"" Musk said. ""Engaging in politics [is] not what I want to do. I do not have a death wish. But the stakes are so high that I really have — I feel I have no choice but to do it.""
Musk endorsed Trump over the summer and has formed a super PAC to support him, donating $75 million. The group is helping mobilize and register voters in battleground states.
After the second assassination attempt on Trump’s life, Musk said that ""no one is even trying to assassinate"" Vice President Kamala Harris. He deleted the tweet, which he called a joke.
Over the weekend, Musk promised to give away $1 million each day until November's election to someone in a swing state who signs his online petition supporting the U.S. Constitution.
The petition Musk is asking people to sign reads: ""The First and Second Amendments guarantee freedom of speech and the right to bear arms. By signing below, I am pledging my support for the First and Second Amendments.""
While questions have been raised about the legality of Musk’s giveaway, Bradley Smith, former commissioner of the Federal Election Commission, said he doesn’t believe it violates any laws.
""He's not limiting the offer to someone who makes a new registration in any way. I think it would be very hard to show this violates the law. Even if it has the effect of getting some people to vote or to register,"" Smith said.

News Max,Harris Is Attending Church in Georgia and Encouraging Black Congregants to Vote,"Democrat Kamala Harris kicked off her 60th birthday on Sunday with a church visit in Georgia as part of an effort to court early voters, while her Republican rival, Donald Trump, is set to hold an event in battleground Pennsylvania and visit a local McDonald's.
Harris and Trump, who are essentially tied in the race for president in the most competitive states, have sharpened their attacks in recent days, while drumming up support for early votes by mail or in person with just 16 days left until the Nov. 5 election.
Vice President Harris and former President Trump, 78, are focusing on Georgia, Pennsylvania and a handful of other states likely to decide the election, where both parties have strong support and electoral results have been close in past cycles.
Harris, who was raised in the teachings of the Black church and sang in a church choir, attended a service and spoke at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Stonecrest, Georgia, about 30 miles (50 km) east of Atlanta. Invoking her childhood experiences in a Black church, Harris drew a sharp contrast to the harsh and divisive rhetoric of the current political climate, although she did not mention Trump by name.
""At this point across our nation, what we do see are some trying to deepen division among us, spread hate, sow fear and cause chaos,"" she said. ""At this moment, our country is at a crossroads and where we go is up to us."" She will also speak at Divine Faith Ministries International in Jonesboro, just south of Atlanta, where she plans to encourage worshippers to exercise their voting rights. Music icon Stevie Wonder will attend and is slated to perform.
Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, on Sunday were promoting a ""Souls to the Polls"" initiative aimed at using gospel performances, national and state faith leaders, elected officials and others to mobilize voters.
After her events, Harris will record an interview with civil rights leader Al Sharpton that will air Sunday night on MSNBC. Walz attended a service in Saginaw, Michigan, while his wife, Gwen Walz, planned to visit a church in Las Vegas.
Harris will need strong results in the majority non-white cities of Detroit and Atlanta and their surrounding suburbs to repeat President Joe Biden's 2020 wins in Michigan and Georgia.
Trump, after escalating personal attacks on Harris on Saturday, told Breitbart News he would work at a McDonald’s restaurant in Pennsylvania on Sunday “just for fun” to mock Harris. Trump adviser Jason Miller said Trump would be working in the french fries area of the restaurant.
Harris says she worked at a McDonald’s when she was young but Trump says he does not believe her.
Trump then will hold a town hall in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
The former president is seeking to take advantage of what he felt was an improved position for him in opinion polls that show a deadlocked race. Some voters already have sent mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania, the biggest prize on Election Day among battleground states.
On Monday, Harris said she will campaign with Republican former Representative Liz Cheney in the suburbs of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a Democrat who is supporting Harris, acknowledged on NBC'S ""Meet the Press"" that the race in his state is tight.
""We understand that this election likely will come down to tens of thousands of votes ... you've got to compete for every vote,"" Shapiro said.

News Max,"NY Times/Siena College Poll: Trump, Harris Deadlocked","Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are in a tie of 48% each for the popular vote, The New York Times/Siena College final national poll for this election season revealed Friday.
The numbers do not bode well for Harris, considering Democrat candidates in recent years have taken the popular vote, even while losing the Electoral College nod, as was the case in 2016 when Hillary Clinton lost to Trump, reports The New York Times.
The poll was conducted of 2,516 registered voters nationally between Oct. 20-23 and carried a margin of error of plus or minus 2.2 percentage points. Harris' numbers have taken a slight drop since October when the Times/Siena College poll had her at a 49%-46% lead over Trump, but even then, the numbers left them at a statistical tie, considering the polling margin of error.
Even the polls in the battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin remain tight, pointing to a contest that remains up in the air with less than two weeks left until Election Day.
Some factors could swing the race toward one or the other of the candidates.
Immigration, one of the top issues among voters, is a strong suit for Trump, who has slammed Harris, the Biden administration's ""border czar"" on the matter.
Trump has promised that if elected, he'll launch the ""largest deportation"" in American history, and voters in the NY Times/Siena College poll said by an 11% margin that they trust him over Harris to handle the situation.
However, the number of Americans who say that Trump, at 78 years of age, is too old to be president stayed at 41% since July, which could prove an advantage for Harris among voters.
Harris has also drawn closer to Trump when it comes to the economy, the top issue for voters. Trump had a 13-point edge on Harris concerning the economy, but his lead shrunk to 6 percentage points.
Harris also held a 16-point lead over Trump in the poll about who would better protect access to abortion, and those numbers may grow. The survey showed that 15% of voters said they are not decided on who would handle the abortion issue better, and 42% of those people said they lean toward Harris, compared to 32% for Trump.
But two weeks ago, Trump held that edge with the undecided voters by 36% to 35%.
The poll also showed that Harris is ahead by 59% to 40% with voters who have already cast their ballots. However, there are signs that Republicans are also increasingly voting early this year, unlike in the past.
Other numbers have changed little in the Times/Siena polls over the past three months, including voters' opinion of Harris after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. She was seen favorably by 48% of the voters, as was Trump.
Harris also continued to lead among women, by 54% to 42%, with Trump ahead with men by 55% to 41%, numbers that have changed little in comparison with other polls.
In addition to the presidential race being deadlocked, the poll also found that 48% said they plan to vote for a Republican for Congress, with 48% saying they plan to vote for a Democrat.

News Max,Trump Says Election Cheaters Will Be Prosecuted,"Former President Donald Trump on Friday warned that his campaign is keeping a close eye on the 2024 election and plans to prosecute cheaters.
In posts on Truth Social and X, the GOP nominee wrote: ""CEASE & DESIST: I, together with many Attorneys and Legal Scholars, am watching the Sanctity of the 2024 Presidential Election very closely because I know, better than most, the rampant Cheating and Skullduggery that has taken place by the Democrats in the 2020 Presidential Election. It was a Disgrace to our Nation!
""Therefore, the 2024 Election, where Votes have just started being cast, will be under the closest professional scrutiny and, WHEN I WIN, those people that CHEATED will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law, which will include long term prison sentences so that this Depravity of Justice does not happen again. We cannot let our Country further devolve into a Third World Nation, AND WE WON'T!""
Trump concluded: ""Please beware that this legal exposure extends to Lawyers, Political Operatives, Donors, Illegal Voters, & Corrupt Election Officials. Those involved in unscrupulous behavior will be sought out, caught, and prosecuted at levels, unfortunately, never seen before in our Country.""
Trump has made election integrity a staple of his campaign. The Republican National Committee has recruited hundreds of thousands of poll watchers, poll workers, and legal experts to be on hand on Election Day. A spokeswoman for the RNC said the GOP is ""protecting every legal vote.""
Reuters reported that state and federal judges — some appointed by Trump — dismissed more than 50 lawsuits brought by Trump or his allies alleging election fraud and other irregularities in the 2020 election.
The Wall Street Journal this week reported that a group of wealthy, conservative donors has been quietly pouring millions into groups working on an effort to shore up election security.

News Max,Rob Steele to Newsmax: 'All Hands on Deck' for Trump in Michigan,"After losing the state by just 100,000 votes in 2020, Michigan is heading back to the former President Donald Trump column on Election Day, Republican National Committeeman Rob Steele told Newsmax on Thursday.
On ""Finnerty,"" Steele said, ""There's no question that he's strong here. The whole campaign and RNC [Republican National Committee] understand how important Michigan is.""
""Trump is doing three events in Michigan tomorrow. [Ohio Sen.] J.D. Vance has been here repeatedly. Lara Trump. Don [Trump] Jr. has been here twice in the last week. [Entrepreneur] Vivek [Ramaswamy] has been here.
""So it's all hands on deck for Michigan because, you know, if President Trump wins Michigan, it's very difficult for [Vice President] Kamala [Harris] to have a way through the Electoral College,"" he said.
The latest RealClearPolitics polling average has Trump ahead of Harris by less than 1 percentage point in Michigan, beating her 48.3% to 47.4%.
As for downballot races, Steele said they're also looking good for the GOP.
""Senate candidate Mike Rogers is a great candidate. Former FBI, Army officer, was chair of the Intelligence Committee in the House, and he's campaigned very hard, has a very organized campaign. The NRSC [National Republican Senatorial Committee] is pouring money into Michigan now, and he's caught up to President Trump.""
Steele went on to say that the House races are also very competitive, as are candidates for state offices, in their bid to ""stop [Gov.] Gretchen Whitmer from her craziness.""

News Max,"Trump Promises to 'Frack, Frack, Frack' If He Wins","Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday held a rally in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the birthplace of President Joe Biden, where he focused on his plans to revive U.S. energy production, bring jobs back to the commonwealth, and lower taxes if he is reelected.
Trump said the policies of the Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have contributed to America's energy woes and that those woes would continue if Harris is elected in November.
On fracking, Trump said, ""On day one, I will tell Pennsylvania energy workers to frack, frack, frack and drill, drill, drill. Drill, baby, drill.
""We're going to frack, frack, frack. We will have energy independence and energy dominance as we did just four short years ago. We were energy independent four years ago. Can you believe now we get our energy from Venezuela? What's that all about?
Trump said Harris will ""never, ever let you frack. You're not going to frack if she won. You're not going to frack. She's been against it her whole life.""
Harris said during her 2020 campaign for president that she opposed fracking. But lately, including during the debate, Harris said she would not ban the practice if she is elected.
Trump added, ""Even now, Kamala's Green New Deal mandates are regulations that were — are — impossible, impossible to enforce. As an example, forcing power plants to shut down. All across the country, more than 50 plants have recently been closed. So she took office and they are not going to be replaced.
""If Kamala is reelected, your costs will go up and your lights will go out,"" he said. ""That's what's going to happen.""
Trump said if he wins, he will work to keep energy costs down.
""Today, I make Pennsylvania this promise,"" he said. ""I will stop the energy price hikes. I will stop the plant closures immediately, and we will restart the plants that Kamala has very cruelly closed. I mean, you know, they don't know they have thousands of jobs involved, people that have worked there for 25 years or longer.
""And we're not going to let it happen. I will terminate the Green New scam immediately,"" he said, referring to the Green New Deal. Harris supported the original Green New Deal.
Trump said, ""I will end the destruction of our electrical grid. They are destroying our grid. It's already in bad shape, I'll tell you right now. But they are destroying. Isn't it amazing? We don't have any electricity, but they want to go all electric cars. Think of that.""

News Max,Former Bush Adviser McKinnon: Race Is Harris' to Lose,"GOP political adviser Mark McKinnon, who worked for President George W. Bush, is predicting that Vice President Kamala Harris will defeat former President Donald Trump in November, ""maybe easily.""
""Here's why I say it's Harris' [race] to lose,"" McKinnon wrote in an opinion piece published Friday by Vanity Fair, according to The Hill. ""Trump voters may be committed, but Harris voters are excited and enthusiastic. In August, the Harris-Tim Walz ticket enjoyed an eight-point lead when it came to voter enthusiasm.""
Harris' supporters, he said, have led him to make his ""bold prediction"" that Harris will win, adding that he didn't care ""if I'm wrong, even if this lives on the internet forever.""
A USA Today/Suffolk University poll last month showed excitement among Harris' voters was 8 points higher than that among Trump supporters, by 68%-60%.
In April, Gallup said the party that has the ""higher net-enthusiasm score at the end of a presidential campaign usually sees their candidate win.""
McKinnon also wrote there is a ""big difference in the ground game"" between workers for the two parties.
""Democrats are largely paying their field workers, while Republicans are mostly relying on volunteers,"" he wrote. ""These are factors not being picked up on the radar of the head-to-head polling.”
The New York Times reported earlier this month, Harris' operation has deployed paid staff members to organize nationwide for the campaign, but Trump's side has focused on ""less frequent voters"" and ""well-funded but inexperienced outside groups.""
McKinnon further brought up Project 2025, the game plan for the next GOP presidency published by the conservative Heritage Foundation, which was written by several Trump loyalists. It has been a focal point for Democrats and Harris, who tried to tie the plan to Trump and his allies.
However, Trump has insisted that he had ""nothing to do"" with Project 2025.
McKinnon also pointed out the ""gender gap"" between Harris and Trump, and said women will help the vice president win.
""Trump has an advantage with men,"" he wrote. ""But I believe that in the end, the Harris gender gap with women will shatter all previous records and be determinative.""
According to an Emerson College survey released Friday, Trump was leading Harris among men by 56%-42%, but Harris was ahead with women by 55%-41%.
The poll also showed the pair in a virtual tie: 49% for Harris to 48% for Trump.
McKinnon added that women will ""do the work and save our a** and our democracy. They've been doing it for centuries, so it shouldn't be a surprise.""

News Max,"Biden Warns of Threat From Milton, Condemns Misinformation","President Joe Biden warned on Wednesday that Hurricane Milton carried incredible destructiveness, as he urged people to take safe shelter and condemned misinformation about the storm as un-American.
“It’s harmful to those that need help,” Biden said of misinformation on the storm and the government's response.
Biden also said former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, was spreading misinformation about the federal hurricane response.
Trump, who is running against Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, has sought to portray the Biden-Harris administration's response to recent storms as ineffective.
“It is dangerous – it is unconscionable, frankly, that anyone who would consider themselves a leader would mislead desperate people to the point that those desperate people would not receive the aid to which they are entitled, and that’s why I call it dangerous,” Harris said, according to CNN.

News Max,Battleground State Dems Press Biden to Crack Down on Iran,"A bipartisan group of senators — including three battleground Democrats fighting for reelection — urged the Biden-Harris administration to move faster against Iran in the wake of legislation the president signed in April.
Included in the emergency supplemental appropriations for Ukraine, Israel, and the Indo-Pacific that President Joe Biden signed into law on April 24 were two measures to help bolster national security against Iran: the Stop Harboring Iranian Petroleum Act, known as the SHIP Act, and the Fight and Combat Rampant Iranian Missile Exports Act, known as the Fight CRIME Act.
Those provisions were enacted to restrict Iran's ability to sell oil and engage in ""certain missile-related activities.""
After the administration missed five deadlines over the summer to report back to Congress on the status of those security measures against the terrorist state, the seven senators, led by outgoing Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, I-Ariz., are pressing the administration for information and action.
In a letter sent by Sinema on Tuesday, signed by vulnerable incumbent Democrat Sens. Jacky Rosen of Nevada, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, and Bob Casey Jr. of Pennsylvania, the lawmakers pressed the Biden administration to move faster against Iran.
""For decades, there has been evidence that Iran has funded direct attacks on America and our allies. Since Hamas' attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, Iran has only become more emboldened to act against democratic interests across the globe,"" read the letter to Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Office of Foreign Assets Control Acting Director Lisa Palluconi, and Energy Information Administration Administrator Joseph DeCarolis.
Republican Sens. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Eric Schmitt of Missouri, and John Hoeven of North Dakota also signed the letter.
""Due to the quantity of oil that Iran is able to trade and the subsequent profits, as well as their historical pattern of utilizing these funds to foster violence and chaos, it is vital that the United States take concrete action to disrupt their petroleum trade. Therefore, we ask the administration to honor the reporting deadlines and enforcement requirements prescribed within the SHIP and Fight CRIME Acts,"" the senators wrote.
The Biden-Harris administration faces three more deadlines in the next 30 days, including imposing sanctions on ""foreign persons determined to have knowingly engaged in the Iranian petroleum trade.""
""Given the havoc Iran is wreaking in the Middle East and the wider region, this information is both timely and vital for Congress to carry out appropriate sanctions oversight and understand what greater legislative action is required to ensure Iran does not have the resources to harm the United States or our partners and allies,"" the senators wrote.

News Max,Trump: Officials 'All Over' Pa. Look for Voter Fraud,"Former President Donald Trump, after earlier on Tuesday calling for law enforcement to investigate claims of voter fraud in Pennsylvania, announced that officials ""all over"" the state are conducting probes.
""Law Enforcement is all over the GREAT Commonwealth of Pennsylvania looking at, and for, VOTER FRAUD!"" the Republican nominee posted on Truth Social.
Trump on Monday posted a response to news that in York County, Pennsylvania, ""THOUSANDS of potentially FRAUDULENT Voter Registration Forms and Mail-In Ballot Applications"" were received from a third-party group.
""This is on top of Lancaster County being caught with 2600 Fake Ballots and Forms, all written by the same person. Really bad 'stuff.' WHAT IS GOING ON IN PENNSYLVANIA??? Law Enforcement must do their job, immediately!!! WOW!!!""
The investigations are taking place after Lancaster County officials said they are investigating nearly 2,500 voter registration forms for fraud.
In York County, the Office of Elections got the delivery of thousands of voter registration forms and applications for mail-in ballots, from a third-party source.
York County President Commissioner Julie Wheeler said the local elections and voter registration office is still processing the large delivery of materials related to the election, reported the York Daily Record.
""As with all submissions, our staff follows a process for ensuring all voter registrations and mail-in ballot requests are legal,"" Wheeler said. ""That process is currently underway. If suspected fraud is identified, we will alert the District Attorney's Office, which will then conduct an investigation. We will have no further comment until our internal review has been completed.""
Al Schmidt, the secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, who is the top election official, insisted after the news broke about the issues in Lancaster and York Counties that Pennsylvania is ""not susceptible to any sort of widespread voter fraud.""
He added in an interview with CBS News' ""Face the Nation"" that Pennsylvania has already prepared to increase security.
""Time and time again, in many dozens of cases in 2020, every one of those cases upheld that our elections were accurate and that we're not susceptible to any sort of widespread voter fraud or anything like that,"" Schmidt said.
He further said on Sunday that Lancaster County officials reached out to his office ""right away"" when it found the incidents of voter registration fraud and that an investigation will be done ""responsibly.""
The work, Schmidt said, is being done ""so that we have a free, fair, safe and secure election in 2024 just as we had in 2020.""
State officials are also working to combat any threats to election workers, said Schmidt.
The changes include the formation of an election threat task force of federal, state, and local law enforcement partners to work with election administrators.
Open lines of communication are also in place so Pennsylvania will be better prepared this time around, ""so if any of the ugliness returns that we experienced in 2020, everyone will be ready,"" he said.

News Max,Trump: 'Kamala's Agenda Is They/Them — Not You',"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump continues to use Vice President Kamala Harris' own words against her during the campaign, including in another go-around on the attack for using taxpayer funds for prisoners' transgender surgeries.
""KAMALA'S AGENDA IS THEY/THEM — NOT YOU!"" Trump posted Sunday morning to Truth Social, sharing the campaign ad that concludes that in detailing Harris boasting how she used ""power"" to ""pushing forward the movement, frankly, and the agenda.""
Republicans, including Trump mega-donor billionaire Elon Musk, have consistently denounced transgender surgeries of children and puberty-aged teens. Musk said he ""lost"" a child to gender dysphoria, effectively ""killed"" by the ""woke mind virus.""
The campaign ad narrator started by outlining a transgender biological male who ""murdered a father of 3"" and was sentenced to life in prison.
""Kamala Harris pushed to use tax dollars to pay for his sex change,"" the ad stated.
Harris attempted to blame the Trump administration for ""following the law"" in using taxpayer funding for transgender surgeries during her televised interview with Bret Baier this week. Even liberal fact-checkers note Harris' attempt to misinform and boomerang on the issue is ""true.""
""I will follow the law,"" Harris told Baier in her pivot when asked whether she was pushing for public funding of prisoner transgender surgeries. ""And it's a law that Donald Trump actually followed. You're probably familiar with now. It's a public report that under Donald Trump's administration, these surgeries were available on a medical necessity basis, to people in the federal prison system.""
But conservatives argue there is no ""medical necessity"" for a prisoner changing his gender to a woman, noting that prisoners transitioning to women can do so to get into a less strict, lower-security prison, potentially positioning them to rape or even consensually consummate with in close prison populations.
And, Harris in her own words, admitted in the past she ""pushed to use tax dollars"" to pay for male prisoners to transition to women, the narrator of the Trump campaign ad above noted.
""I made sure they changed the policy so that every transgender inmate would have access,"" Harris is shown in the ad saying when she was running for the Democrat presidential primary in 2019.
""It sounds insane, because it is insane,"" the narrator continued. ""Kamala was the first to help pay for a prisoner's sex change.""
The ad then goes back to Harris' own words to use them against her.
""The power that I had, I used it in a way that was about pushing forward the movement, frankly, and the agenda,"" Harris is shown saying in the ad, which showed The Associated Press headline from 2017 exposing a ""Killer Gets Sex Reassignment Surgery on Taxpayer's Dime"" under Harris' ""push.""
Democrats since the failed Hillary Clinton campaign of 2016 have used the campaign mantra of ""I'm with her,"" which is now trolled by the Trump campaign as ""they/them"" with regard to pushing the transgender dysphoria ""agenda"" and ""movement.""
""Kamala's agenda is they/them, not you,"" the campaign ad narrator concludes, as quoted by Trump in the above Truth post Sunday morning.

News Max,JPMorgan Chase CEO Declines to Endorse Candidate,"JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon declined to publicly endorse a candidate in the 2024 presidential election, instead saying, ""I will decide. I will vote.""
When asked by Bloomberg Television's Lisa Abramowicz, ""You haven't endorsed a candidate, and I wonder why: Is it because you think as the leader of a big company you've got to work with anyone? Or is this that you just can't decide this time particular time around.""
Dimon answered, ""I will decide, OK. I will vote. I reserve the right to do whatever I want. OK? I'm a citizen. I can vote. I can say what I want. I've never been in the private [sector] endorsing candidates, you know? But I am thinking through what I want to say or something like that.""
Abramowicz then cited a recent Washington Post opinion article Dimon wrote in August where he suggested fully half of the next president's Cabinet positions should be private sector people adding, ""The American public needs and deserves very competent, effective government.""
Dimon said part of the problem with the current state of America's political leaders is ""over time, we've had less and less people who have worked in the real world.""
In the nearly half-hour interview, Dimon also looked favorably on the use of artificial intelligence in business hoping to temper the concerns some have regarding the implementation of the technology saying, ""I'm not worried about it"" and, if your company is growing, ""you're always adding jobs.""
The CEO of America's largest bank noted that so many policies put in place by both Democrats and Republicans ""have the exact unintended consequence"" of their original intention, citing the perpetual crime and subpar public schools of American's inner cities.
Without calling out any particular individual or policy, Dimon said the current state of the economy and a subdued mergers and acquisitions market is ""maybe by the election,"" but he cited ""rules and regulations"" as the primary reason for companies to hit pause in the current political climate.
In terms of his own political ambitions, Dimon indicated he has no interest in political office calling the speculation from some business colleagues ""flattering"" but ""more annoying than not.""
His main focus is ""to help our government do the right stuff,"" he concluded.

News Max,Trump Gains Momentum in Swing State Polls as Race Tightens,"Former President Donald Trump is seeing an uptick in key battleground state polls, with Vice President Kamala Harris' early leads fading as the presidential race narrows in its final weeks, The Hill reported.
As the 2024 presidential election nears its final stretch, polls in crucial swing states show a shift toward former President Trump. Polling averages from The Hill and Decision Desk HQ (DDHQ) indicate a tightening race, with both Trump and Vice President Harris having an equal chance of victory. Harris' initial post-debate boost has dissipated, leaving both campaigns in a dead heat.
Trump's polling surge has raised concerns among Democrats, especially given his history of outperforming expectations. However, Harris' team remains hopeful that issues like abortion will energize her base.
Arizona
The Hill/DDHQ average shows that Trump currently leads in Arizona by 1.7 points. Recent polls have solidified his lead, including a New York Times/Siena College poll showing him ahead by 6 points. This marks a significant shift from 2020 when President Biden narrowly won the state. Meanwhile, Arizona's Senate race, featuring Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego and Republican Kari Lake, is drawing attention, though Harris faces an uphill battle here.
Georgia
Trump holds a 1.9-point lead in Georgia, his largest lead among battleground states. This marks a reversal from earlier polling, which had Harris ahead. A recent Quinnipiac poll showed Trump up by 6 points. Early voting began this week with record turnout, and Harris is set to campaign alongside former President Obama to boost Black voter turnout.
Michigan
In Michigan, Trump holds a narrow 0.7-point lead in The Hill/DDHQ average, while other polling sources show Harris with a slight edge. Concerns over the Biden-Harris administration's stance on Israel may affect Arab American voters in the state, while labor support remains a question mark. Both candidates are effectively tied in recent polls, keeping Michigan highly competitive.
Nevada
Nevada is also closely contested, with Harris leading by just 0.2 points in the Hill/DDHQ average. The state's six electoral votes are crucial, and service industry workers play a key role. Although polling has been sparse in recent weeks, a Trafalgar poll shows Harris up by only 1 point, making Nevada a battleground to watch.
North Carolina
Trump leads by 1 point in North Carolina. Early voting began Thursday, with a record-breaking 353,000 ballots cast on the first day. Harris leads by 3 points in one Quinnipiac poll, but other surveys show Trump with a slight edge. Trump's visit to flood-hit Asheville may have affected voters' views in the state.
Pennsylvania
Pennsylvania, with 19 electoral votes, is critical. Harris holds a slim lead of 0.3 points in the Hill/DDHQ average. Democrats argue that GOP-leaning polls are skewing the numbers, but a New York Times/Siena poll gives Harris a 4-point advantage among likely voters. Both campaigns are investing heavily in the state, with nearly $300 million spent on political ads.
Wisconsin
In Wisconsin, Trump holds a slight 0.5-point lead in the Hill/DDHQ average, with Harris' former 5-point lead eroding. Recent polls favor Trump, making Wisconsin a key battleground.

News Max,Cygnal Survey: Vance Favorability Rating Improves,"For the first time in months, Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, former President Donald Trump's running mate for vice president, has a positive favorability rating, according to a new survey.
The survey from the analytics firm Cygnal, shows Vance with a 45.4% favorability rating against an unfavorability rating of 45%.
The survey of 1,500 people was conducted Oct. 2-3, after Vance's debate with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate on the Democrat ticket.
The survey has a margin of error of +/- 2.52 percentage points.
Prior to the debate, Vance had a net favorability rating of minus 8. Post-debate, Walz's favorability rating was 47% with a 42.5% unfavorability rating. Walz's favorability rating has consistently been polled as a net positive.
Vance's favorability rating has most improved among urban voters and independents, while Walz's favorable rating suffered among the same groups, according to the survey.

News Max,Rep. Mike Waltz to Newsmax: Biden Admin Trying to Appease Iran,"By failing to hold Iran accountable for anything, the Biden administration is, in effect, rewarding Tehran for its bad behavior, says Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla.
""What consequences has Iran suffered for firing on our Navy ships? For shutting down international shipping in the Red sea? For launching ballistic missiles? Not once, but twice, directly from its soil at our ally,"" Waltz said during an appearance on Newsmax TV's ""American Agenda.""
""For killing Americans in Iraq and wounding them afterwards? Trying to assassinate a former president and leading political candidate?""
He equated the moves to appeasing a bully.
""There have been zero consequences because is a group that believes they can appease the bully, that they can wake up in the morning and go to the schoolyard and just keep giving a little more lunch money — in this case, it's to the tune of billions of dollars — and that [Iran] will behave responsibly,"" he added.
""And instead, what we're doing is we're going to wake up one day and they're going to have a nuclear missile and operational ICBM with an irrational religious fanatic with their fingers on the button. And that is a scary, scary thought.""
Waltz, who is a member of the House Intelligence Committee, also said Iran was actively plotting to kill former President Donald Trump.
""The Iranians right now are trying to kill President Trump,"" he said.
""That isn't a plot in the past. It's ongoing right now as we speak. And this isn't kind of your typical ‘Death to America’ propaganda rhetoric. They are existentially threatened byTrump's return. Why? Because he knows he's going to go after what they care about the most. Their wallet, their control.
""It's unacceptable that Biden and Harris have been just silent until just last week on these ongoing plots.""

News Max,Rep. Clyde to Newsmax: Dems Trying to 'Assassinate' Trump's Personality,"Democrats are trying to ""destroy"" former President Donald Trump's personality with the claims they are making about him, Rep. Andrew Clyde told Newsmax on Tuesday.
""They think it's personality over policy and they're trying to destroy his personality,"" said the Georgia Republican on ""Wake Up America."" ""If they can't assassinate the president, they're going to assassinate his personality. And that's exactly what they've tried to do.""
Clyde said he was at Trump's rally in Atlanta on Monday night and ""the energy in the room was phenomenal.""
Clyde said Trump's election also depends on policy, not his personality, and Americans understand that.
While Trump has been subjected to comparisons to Adolf Hitler and has been called a fascist in recent weeks, Clyde says that's out of the Democrats' ""desperation"" over their candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris.
""They are at the end of their wits because they know they're going to lose and so they are trying everything and anything just to try and make it stick,"" Clyde said. ""It is so disrespectful to do that and it's dishonest. It's disrespectful. It just shows that the left will do anything to win and here they are, lying completely again.""
Meanwhile, Georgians are turning out in droves to vote early, and Clyde said that's because of the excitement surrounding Trump and his call for people to vote.
Nearly 3 million Georgia voters have cast early ballots, with Republicans taking the majority of 49% of those votes. Clyde noted that several counties are turning out to vote for Trump.
""It seems to be that way in so many other states, too,"" he said.
Georgia voters are focused, he added, on the security of the southern border and illegal immigration, particularly after the murder of University of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley, said Clyde.
""In our 9th District, we also had a 12-year-old girl abducted, kidnapped, in Gainesville, Georgia, by an illegal alien from Guatemala,"" said Clyde. ""We're seeing it up close and personal, the lack of security, the open border policies of the Biden-Harris administration.""
And Harris, as the border czar, has said she would not change anything from the Biden administration's policies, said Clyde.
""How is she going to fix a wide-open border [including] 600,000 criminals that have poured across our border, let in by her administration, including 13,000 of those convicted with prior convictions of murder,"" he added. ""We don't need to be importing criminals.
""We need to be deporting them, every solitary one of them needs to be deported. And that's another policy of President Trump. It's the policies that matter. And President Trump's policies will indeed bring this country back from the abyss.""

News Max,GOP Rep. Ken Calvert Faces Tight Race as Hollywood Targets Him,"The rematch for Congress in California's 41st District, the notable Inland Empire to the east of Los Angeles, between Rep. Ken Calvert, R-Calif., and liberal Democrat Will Rollins is looking like a dead heat.
The Center for Urban Politics and Policy at Cal State completed a poll last month that showed Calvert and Rollins tied at 41.6% each.
Two weeks ago, the Global Strategy Group concluded a poll also showing a tie — Calvert and Rollins even at 45% each.
This comes two years after Calvert edged out Rollins, a former prosecutor, by 52%-48% (just over 10,000 votes out of more than 230,000 cast).
In their rematch, Calvert and Rollins have spent a combined total of $12 million so far.
""Hollywood wants Rollins,"" Ken Khachigian, longtime California Republican strategist for the late GOP Gov. George Deukmejian, told Newsmax.
""Steven Spielberg, Rob Reiner — you name them — are pouring millions into the Inland Empire to elect Rollins,"" he said.
Rollins, who is gay, has national backing from the LGBT community.
Calvert, now the second senior Republican in the entire House, is a member of the House Appropriations Committee and of the moderate Main Street Partnership of House Republicans.
""I think it will be a very close race,"" Jon Fleischman, editor of the Flash Report on California politics, told Newsmax.
""There are a lot of liberal special interests that would like to see Calvert retired from office,"" he said.
Fleischman thinks the race might be so close it could take days or weeks to determine the winner.
The race has become a national one, with groups like AIPAC, the NRA, and U.S. Chamber of Commerce endorsing and backing Calvert.

News Max,Florida Sues Biden Admin Over Migrant Voter Info,"The state of Florida on Wednesday filed a lawsuit against the Biden Administration for allegedly refusing to confirm immigration records so the state can verify citizenship and prevent non-citizens from voting, Bloomberg Law reports.
The complaint, Florida v. Dept Homeland Sec., was filed in U.S. District Country for the Northern District of Florida, claims that ""because the federal government is refusing to comply with these obligations and frustrating Florida’s ability to maintain the integrity of its elections, Florida files this suit.""
Citing the case Bond v. United States, the state argues that ""as part of the prerogatives and responsibilities of the States and the National Government – the federal government has an obligation to cooperate with the States in ensuring only citizens vote in their elections.""
""Without further information from DHS, Florida is unable to fulfill its statutory duties to ensure the integrity of its elections and maintain accurate voter registration records,"" Florida’s Republican Attorney General Ashley Moody said in a statement.
""Florida’s inability to carry out its statutory obligations inflicts sovereign injury upon the state.""
The state claims it is unable to track and maintain immigration information on its own, saying it does not have the unique identifiers needed to run verification checks through the federal Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) Program and that it has been denied a request for information from the Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
The lawsuit claims that Florida’s Department of State has identified several individuals that are not citizens but could not verify their legal status and run a search through the SAVE app due to the government’s lack of cooperation.
""Voting is a right granted to American citizens—not illegal immigrants or other noncitizens. The Biden-Harris administration has allowed millions of illegal immigrants into the country, and we must ensure that only citizens are on our voter rolls,"" Moody wrote in her statement.
""I am taking legal action against the Department of Homeland Security and Secretary Mayorkas to ensure Florida is able to maintain the integrity of our state’s voter rolls.""

News Max,TIPP Daily Poll: Harris Holds 3-Point Lead Over Trump,"Vice President Kamala Harris is holding a slight lead of 50%-47% over former President Donald Trump in a race for the White House that remains ""tighter than ever,"" according to TIPP Tracking Poll's Day 11 edition.
Over the past 10 days of TIPP's tracking, Trump's numbers have ranged between 46% and 49%, with Harris' numbers fluctuating between 47% and 50%, a steady margin suggesting that the electorate remains volatile.
TIPP Insights polled 1,260 likely voters nationally Oct. 21-23, and the results have a margin of error of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points.
With 11 days left before Election Day, Harris also holds a slight lead over Trump of 49.8%-47.3% when third-party candidates Cornel West and Jill Stein are factored in. West gathered 0.9%; Stein 0.5%; and other candidates, 0.5%, with 1% of voters remaining undecided.
Meanwhile, Trump is holding a commanding lead of 52%-45% in the South, with Harris holding strong leads in the West by 54%-42% and the Northeast by 58%-38%. The fight remains in the Midwest, with Trump up by 50%-48% and with suburban swing voters.
Harris also continues to hold the advantage among voters 18-44 by 56%-40%, with Trump leading by 49%-48% with people ages 45-64, and by 51%-46% with voters older than 65.
Trump is also leading with men by 51%-46%, while Harris is ahead with women by 54%-43%.
Trump also remains in the lead with white voters (55%-42%), while Harris leads with Black and Hispanic voters (72%-24%).
Trump also holds the lead among high school graduates, while Harris is ahead with college graduates.
She also has a slim lead over Trump with independents (47%-44%).
Harris also holds the lead among urban voters (64%-33%), while Trump leads with suburban and rural voters (50%-47%).
However, the tracking poll shows that the two remain in a near tie for levels of strong support, with 70% for Trump and 71% for Harris.
Meanwhile, the prevailing mood among voters and pundits are uneasy about calling the election, with 41% of voters saying they expect Harris to win, compared to 39% for Trump.

News Max,Biden: I Don't Know If Israel Is Holding Up Peace Deal to Sway November Election,"President Joe Biden had terse words for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, and said he didn't know whether the Israeli leader was holding up a peace deal in order to influence the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election.
“No administration has helped Israel more than I have,” Biden said. “None. None, none. And I think Bibi should remember that. And whether he’s trying to influence the election, I don’t know but I’m not counting on that.”
Biden, in a rare appearance in the White House press briefing room, was responding to comments made by one of his allies, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who said on CNN this week that he was concerned Netanyahu had little interest in a peace deal in part because of U.S. politics.
Israel has pressed forward on two fronts, pursuing a ground incursion into Lebanon against Hezbollah that left eight Israeli soldiers dead and conducting strikes in Gaza that killed dozens, including children. And the nation has vowed to retaliate for Iran’s ballistic missile attack this week, as the region braced for further escalation.
Biden said there had been no decision yet on what type of response there would be toward Iran.
“I’m assuming when they make a decision on how they’re going to respond, we will then have a discussion,"" he said.

Trump began with a post on Truth Social, praising Newhouse's opponent Jerrod Sessler, who he said would ""be a GREAT Congressman for Washington State's 4th Congressional District.

Newhouse is one of two remaining House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump after the Capitol attack. The other is California Rep. David Valadao.

News Max,Report: Trump Campaign Buys Big on Urban Radio,"The campaign for former President Donald Trump has purchased ads on some the ""biggest R&B and hip hop radio stations"" in the battleground states of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, Dan O'Donnell reported on Wednesday.
O'Donnell, of the ""Dan O'Donnell Show"" out of Milwaukee, posted Wednesday morning on X that the Trump team's investment in urban radio ad buys in both Philadelphia and Milwaukee show the former president sees a window to court young Blacks in the two critical swing states.
""This follows my exclusive report several weeks ago that the Harris campaign was moving radio money out of Milwaukee and aggressively buying ads on those same two Philadelphia stations to shore up her black support,"" O'Donnell wrote.
According to a recent poll released Wednesday from GenForward, 26% of Black men between the ages of 18 and 40 say they will vote for Trump over Vice President Kamala Harris. The monumental shift in support of Blacks this election cycle has the Harris team having to win back a key demographic.
""Taken together, the spending indicates that Harris is deeply concerned about black turnout in Philadelphia and Trump sees this weakness and is aggressively going after voters there and in Milwaukee,"" he continued.
O'Donnell noted that Republicans in Wisconsin see Harris' dwindling support among Black males as a window to pick up critical votes.
""In addition to the Trump campaign's buy in Philadelphia, I reported exclusively last week that the Republican Party of Wisconsin was making a significant urban radio buy in Milwaukee,"" O'Donnell added.

News Max,Internal Trump Poll Shows Lead in Every Swing State,"Former President Donald Trump released internal polling on Thursday that shows him leading Vice President Kamala Harris in seven key battleground states.
The poll, conducted by Trump campaign pollsters Tony Fabrizio and John McLaughlin, shows the former president leading Harris by 5 percentage points in Georgia, 50%-45%; 3 points in Arizona, 49%-46%; and 1 point in Michigan, 49%-48%, Nevada, 48%-47%, North Carolina, 48%-47%, Pennsylvania, 49%-48%, and Wisconsin, 49%-48%.
""As you can clearly see, President Trump holds an edge in all 7 Battlegrounds including all the 'Blue Wall States.' This data projected out would put President Trump at 312 Electoral votes. As importantly, President Trump is at or on the precipice of 50% in virtually all of these states,"" wrote Fabrizio and McLaughlin in a memo Trump posted to Truth Social.
""Given today's high inflation data and Kamala Harris' admission that she would not have changed or done anything different than Joe Biden, we expect that President Trump's edge will only continue to solidify,"" the pollsters added.
The survey of 800 likely voters was conducted in each state between Oct. 6-9 and has a margin of error +/- 3.5 percentage points.

News Max,US Judge Won't Reopen Voter Registration in Ga. After Helene,"A federal judge said Thursday that she won't order the presidential battleground state of Georgia to reopen voter registration for November's elections despite recent disruptions to registration caused by Hurricane Helene.
U.S. District Judge Eleanor Ross rejected arguments that the state should reopen registration through next Monday. The registration deadline was last Monday and she said in her ruling from the bench Thursday afternoon that there would be no extension.
A lawsuit filed by the Georgia conference of the NAACP, the Georgia Coalition for the People's Agenda, and the New Georgia Project had argued that damage and disruptions from Helene unfairly deprived people of the opportunity to register.
All three groups said they had to cancel voter registration activities last week after the hurricane tore through the Southeast. Historically, there's a spike in Georgia voter registrations just before the deadline, the plaintiffs said.
Ross said in her verbal ruling Thursday that the groups didn't sufficiently prove their members were harmed and said there are no state laws allowing Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, the Republican defendants in the case, to order an extension of the voter registration deadline. Although the groups presented testimony Thursday that they know of at least two people unable to register, Ross said the testimony wasn't detailed enough to link that failure to the burdens of Helene.
""I don't think we had even one voter who had been harmed or would likely be harmed by failure to register to vote,"" Ross said.
The state and the Republican Party argued that election processes could be disrupted since absentee ballots have already been mailed and early in-person voting was scheduled to begin Tuesday. Ross seemed to agree with that argument in her ruling.
""The harm to the state's interests outweighs the plaintiffs' interests,"" Ross said.
Leaders of the NAACP and the Coalition for the People's Agenda, who were present in the courtroom for the case, voiced their disagreement with the verdict.
""We're still going to fight to make sure every voter's rights are protected,"" said Helen Butler, the coalition's executive director. ""We believe voters were harmed, but this doesn't deter us.""
Lawyers for the plaintiffs declined to say whether they would appeal.
Georgia has 8.2 million registered voters, according to online records from Raffensperger's office. But with Georgia's presidential race having been decided by only 12,000 votes in 2020, a few thousand votes could make a difference in whether Republican Donald Trump or Democrat Kamala Harris wins the state's 16 electoral votes.
The lawsuit said the hurricane kept people with driver's licenses from registering online because of widespread power and internet outages in the eastern half of the state and kept people from registering in person because at least 37 county election offices were closed for parts of last week. The lawsuit also notes that mail pickup and delivery was suspended in 27 counties, including the cities of Augusta, Savannah, Statesboro, Dublin, and Vidalia.
A federal judge in Florida denied a request to reopen voter registration in that state after hearing arguments Wednesday. The plaintiffs are considering whether to appeal. The lawsuit brought by the Florida chapters of the League of Women Voters and NAACP contends that thousands of people may have missed the registration deadline because they were recovering from Helene or preparing to evacuate from Milton, which churned across Florida this week.
A court in South Carolina extended that state's registration deadline after Helene and courts in Georgia and Florida extended registration deadlines after 2016's Hurricane Matthew. In North Carolina, which was more heavily impacted by Hurricane Helene, the registration deadline isn't until Friday. Voters there can also register and cast a ballot simultaneously during the state's early in-person voting period, which runs from Oct. 17 through Nov. 2.
At least 40 advocacy groups asked Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and Raffensperger to extend the registration deadline in affected counties before the Georgia lawsuit was filed.

News Max,CNN: Trump's Gain With Independents Signals Shift,"Harry Enten, CNN's senior political data reporter, revealed that former President Donald Trump is gaining significant ground with independent voters compared to his 2020 performance, a trend that could reshape the dynamics of this year's election, Breitbart reported Wednesday.
Enten's analysis, shared on CNN's ""News Central,"" emphasized the importance of this voting group in determining the outcome of closely contested elections.
Host John Berman opened the discussion by highlighting the crucial role of independent voters, saying, ""In an election this close, any group of voters could be decisive, but this group of voters in every election is worth watching. I'm talking about independents.""
Enten said that in 2020, Joe Biden secured the independent vote by 11 points. However, the landscape looks quite different this year.
""You look at September of 2024, a month ago, Kamala Harris was up 5 points among independents,"" Enten said. ""You look now, though, she's only up by 2 points among a key block, the center of the electorate.""
This 9-point drop from Biden's 2020 margin is significant, suggesting a shift in the allegiance of independent voters.
Enten elaborated on how this change plays out in the broader national context but stressed that the focus should be on key battleground states.
""Of course, this is a national picture,"" he said. ""What is going on in those key battleground states — Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, the Great Lakes, that blue wall? Joe Biden, last time around, won them by 5 points over Donald Trump. Look at where we are today. This is the type of movement Donald Trump likes to see in the center of the electorate, up by a point.""
Enten emphasized the importance of the overall trend.
""It's the movement we are looking at,"" he said, underscoring that even small shifts among independent voters could prove pivotal in determining the election outcome.
This sentiment was reinforced by a Washington Post-Schar School Deciders poll released Monday that showed Harris and Trump polling within the margin of error in seven crucial swing states.

News Max,Jason Miller to Newsmax: Trump Surging Because Harris Lacks Ideas,"Former President Donald Trump is surging in the latest polls because people are getting to know Kamala Harris and are not liking what they see, Jason Miller, senior adviser to Trump, told Newsmax on Tuesday.
Miller said on ""Wake Up America"" that the new surveys illustrate that ""people are getting to know Kamala Harris"" through the many interviews she had done recently and they do not like her ""lack of ideas.""
""When you see the Harris campaign come out with brand new things with just a few weeks to go before the elections, you know they are in trouble,"" Miller said.
Miller said people are justifiably asking why Harris did not put together a plan on various topics during her almost four years in the Biden administration.
He emphasized that her interviews are constantly doing her damage, demonstrating ""how really unprepared and unserious a candidate Kamala Harris is.""
Miller particularly said it was stunning that Harris said ""nothing comes to mind"" when she was asked what she would have done differently from President Joe Biden.
Miller stressed that, in contrast, ""Trump is in great position with just three weeks to go, way better than we were in 2020 or 2016.""
The fact that Trump has closed the gap in the polls shows that ""he momentum is all with [him].""
What is particularly important, he pointed out, is that the trends are the same in all the surveys.
Miller said that Trump has ""really honed in on his message of illegal immigration, the border, migrant crime and the economy.""
Miller added that Trump also displays ""authenticity"" when he participates in town halls.

News Max,"Rep. Waltz to Newsmax: Biden Tough on Israel, but Not on Iran","The Biden administration has placed undue pressure on Israel while being lenient with Iran, which has contributed to escalating violence in the Middle East, Rep. Mike Waltz, R-Fla., told Newsmax Wednesday.
""There is nothing but pressure — far more pressure — on Israel,"" Waltz told ""The Record With Greta Van Susteren.""
He said the administration fosters a culture of ""distrust of Israel"" and ""appeasement towards Iran,"" which he believes has contributed to the turmoil. According to Waltz, this strategy is misguided and has ""literally led to the entire Middle East being on fire.""
Waltz, a House Armed Services and Foreign Affairs Committees member, said former President Donald Trump took a tougher stance during his administration, enforcing sanctions that cut off funds to Tehran.
""The hard truth is that the core issue is Iran's cash,"" Waltz said. ""And when you choke that off, then they can't fund this terrorism all over the world.""
He pointed to a period in 2019 during Trump's presidency when Iranian-backed groups reportedly struggled financially.
""All of those groups were complaining that they were out of money. They couldn't pay their fighters, they couldn't buy ammunition because the payments had stopped from Tehran because President Trump was actually enforcing the sanctions.
""He told China, who buys most of Iran's oil, If you buy from them, you can't buy from us, and they stopped.""
""This is all about getting to the core part, the root of the disease, rather than kind of running around dealing with their proxies, which is what the Biden people are trying to do,"" he said.

News Max,Biden Doesn't Support Attacks on Iran Nuclear Sites,"President Joe Biden said Wednesday that he will not support any Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear sites in response to its missile attack and urged Israel to act ""proportionally.""
Biden spoke a day after Iran fired more than 180 ballistic missiles at Israel in a move that he previously described as ""ineffective."" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran would pay for the attack.
""We'll be discussing with the Israelis what they're going to do, but all seven of us (G7 nations) agree that they have a right to respond but they should respond proportionally,"" Biden told reporters before boarding Air Force One.
Some analysts said Israel's response would likely be sharper than when Iran fired missiles and drones at Israel in April, suggesting this time it could target Tehran's nuclear or oil facilities.
Asked if the U.S. would back any Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear sites, Biden told reporters: ""The answer is no.""
Biden said more sanctions would be imposed on Iran and that he would speak soon with Netanyahu.
""Obviously, Iran is way off course,"" Biden said.
U.S. Deputy Secretary Kurt Campbell said the administration was seeking to align its position with Israel on any response to Iran's attack but also recognizes the Middle East is on a ""knife's edge"" and a broader escalation could imperil both Israeli and U.S. interests.
Speaking at a virtual event hosted by Washington-based think tank Carnegie Endowment, Campbell repeated the U.S. view that what Tehran has undertaken was ""deeply irresponsible"" and that there must be a ""return message.""
""I think we tried to underscore our support for some of the actions that Israel has taken,"" he added. ""We have real wariness about a extended or substantial ground set of operations in Lebanon,"" Campbell said.
The Israeli army is locked in combat at its northern border with Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah fighters. On Wednesday, eight Israeli soldiers were killed — the deadliest suffered by Israel's military on the Lebanon front in the past year of border-area clashes between Israel and Hezbollah.
Iran said on Wednesday its missile volley, its biggest ever assault on Israel, was over, barring further provocation.

""We are talking about things that matter to American families, and it's resonating with the folks here in the Keystone State. They are excited to have a president that actually cares about their kitchen table issues, not the hope and joy and good vibes that Kamala Harris is trying to pass off to American families,"" she said.
Ernst encouraged supports to get out and vote early, assuring that election integrity remains intact.
""Things are much different this year than it was four years ago during COVID, where many of the election officials were able to get away with hijinks because of the COVID excuse. They don't have that excuse ... I do believe that we will be able to secure this election, make sure that the voters feel confident in the election integrity,"" she said.

News Max,House GOP Leadership Elections Set for Nov. 13,"House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., announced that internal Republican leadership elections will be held Nov. 13, the day after lawmakers return for the lame duck session, Axios reported Monday.
That vote will go a long way to determine whether Johnson stays on as Republican leader, either as speaker or minority leader. The internal vote will also determine who would serve as his lieutenants beginning in 2025, according to Axios.
Rank-and-file Republicans have until Nov. 12 to declare if they plan to run for a leadership position, according to the report.
If Republicans maintain their majority in the aftermath of the Nov. 5 elections, Johnson will have to win a vote on the House floor in January to maintain his speakership.
Johnson has said he will make no deals with Democrats to keep the gavel, even as there are at least four House Republicans who say they're in a ""Never Mike"" camp, and there could be more who will oppose his returning to his seat, it was reported last week.
Axios reported that significant shakeups are likely if Republican lose the majority to Democrats.
Johnson has not said what his plans would be should that happen.

News Max,Nebraska Top Court: Felons Can Now Vote,"Nebraska’s top election official had no authority to strip voting rights from people convicted of a felony, the state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday in a decision that could add hundreds of new voters to the rolls and affect the outcome on Nov. 5.
The order by Republican Secretary of State Bob Evnen could have kept 7,000 or more Nebraskans from voting in the upcoming election, the American Civil Liberties Union has said. Many of them reside in Nebraska’s Omaha-centered 2nd Congressional District, where both the race for president and the makeup of Congress could be in play.
Nebraska overall is heavily Republican but is one of only two states — the other is Maine — that apportions its Electoral College votes by congressional district. The Omaha-area district has twice awarded its one vote to Democrat presidential candidates — to Barack Obama in 2008 and again to Joe Biden in 2020. In a 2024 presidential race shown by polling to be a dead heat, a single electoral vote could determine who wins.
Given the Omaha district’s history, Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris and Democrat groups have spent millions there to secure the electoral vote — far more than former President Donald Trump and Republican groups.
Nebraska also has competitive races for one U.S. Senate seat and the 2nd District’s U.S. House seat. Two-term Republican Sen. Deb Fischer faces her strongest challenge yet in independent candidate Dan Osborn, a former union leader who has eschewed both major parties. In the House race, Republican Rep. Don Bacon is running against Democrat state Sen. Tony Vargas in a rematch of the 2022 election, which Bacon narrowly won with 51% of the vote.
The last day to register to vote for the 2024 general election in Nebraska is Oct. 25 and must be done in person. Election Day is Nov. 5.
Evnen in July had ordered county election officials to reject the voter registrations of those with felony convictions, citing an opinion issued by Attorney General Mike Hilgers. That opinion, which Evnen had requested, deemed as unconstitutional a law passed this year by the Legislature immediately restoring the voting rights of people who have completed the terms of their felony sentences.
Hilgers′ opinion said that the law violated the state constitution’s separation of powers and that only the state Board of Pardons under the control of the executive branch could restore voting rights through pardons.
Pardons are exceedingly rare in Nebraska. Evnen, Hilgers and Gov. Jim Pillen make up the three-member Board of Pardons. All three are Republicans.
The opinion also found unconstitutional a 2005 state law that restored the voting rights of people with felony convictions two years after they complete the terms of their sentences.
The ACLU is representing advocacy group Civic Nebraska and two Nebraska residents, a Republican and an independent, who would be denied the right to vote under Evnen’s directive. Because Evnen’s move came only weeks ahead of the November election, the ACLU asked to take the lawsuit directly to the Nebraska Supreme Court, and the high court agreed.
Restoring the voting rights of former felons has drawn national attention in recent years. In Florida, lawmakers weakened a 2018 voter-approved constitutional amendment to restore the voting rights of most people convicted of felonies. Following that, an election police unit championed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis arrested 20 such people. Several said they were confused by the arrests because they had been allowed to register to vote.
In Tennessee, lawmakers killed a bipartisan bill this year that would have let residents convicted of felonies apply to vote again without also restoring their gun rights.
Dozens of states allow people living with felony convictions to vote, either for those not currently in prison or upon completion of their sentences. Two states, Maine and Vermont, allow everyone, even those in prison, to vote. But despite a recent trend toward restoration of rights, felony disenfranchisement laws prevent around 5.85 million people across the country from voting, according to the ACLU.

News Max,DCCC Head Merz to House Dems: Don't Get Too Comfortable,"With just 11 days to go before Election Day, Julie Merz, the executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, warned Democrats not to get too complacent if they want to take back the House.
House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries’ campaign arm sent a memo to colleagues citing internal polling that shows nearly two dozen races within a few percentage points, Axios reported.
Democrats are increasingly concerned former President Donald Trump will win re-election and the Senate looks to be trending toward Republicans. House Democrats see themselves as the last line of defense against a Trump presidency.
""In the worst case scenario, if we don't hold on [to the White House], I think we will win back the House,"" New Democrat Coalition Chair Rep. Annie Kuster, D-N.H., told Axios.
Kuster said many races aren’t just within the margin of error, but are effectively tied.
Julie Merz, the executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee maintained in a memo she would “rather be us than them.” Internal polling puts 21 of 25 races rated as ""toss-up"" by Cook Political Report within a 3 percentage-point margin.
""Now is not the time to take our foot off the gas, nor is it time to get comfortable with the enthusiasm we are seeing on the ground,"" Merz said. ""I don't need to tell any of you how important it is that Leader Jeffries is serving as Speaker Jeffries when it comes time to certify the election on Jan. 6, 2025.""

News Max,Texas Man Hits Election Worker Who Said Remove Trump Hat: Police,"A Texas man who wore a hat supporting former President Donald Trump punched an election worker who told him that wearing items endorsing a candidate are prohibited at voting sites, a sheriff said Friday.
The election worker, identified as a 69-year-old man, was treated at the scene Thursday and returned to his election post at a San Antonio library on Friday, officials said. The suspect was arrested on felony charges of assaulting an elderly person and could face additional charges, Bexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar said.
The alleged assault happened at the end of the first week of early voting in Texas, where long lines have stretched outside some polling places.
Both the sheriff and county elections administrator urged voters to stay calm and patient during sometimes long waits to vote during what they described as a contentious election.
“Thankfully there was nothing life-threatening about what occurred, but it was still an ugly incident,” Salazar said.
The suspect, identified as Jesse Lutzenberger, remained in jail Friday evening, according to Bexar County records. Jail records did not list an attorney and a phone number for Lutzenberger's home could not immediately be found Friday.
Under Texas law, wearing clothing for or against a candidate inside a polling place is prohibited, as it's considered electioneering. Lutzenberger allegedly entered the polling location in a red “MAGA or TRUMP” baseball cap, according to an arrest affidavit.
After being told he had to remove his cap in the voting area, Lutzenberger did and proceeded to cast a ballot, according to Salazar. He then put the cap back on before leaving, followed by the clerk again telling him remove the hat while inside the building.
As the clerk escorted him out of the library, Lutzenberger allegedly threw an elbow or arm back toward the clerk and then turned to punch him in the face multiple times, according to Salazar.
The clerk was treated at the scene by emergency medical personnel, Bexar County Elections Administrator Jacque Callanen said.
Salazar said there have been “several” incidents of voters wearing prohibited clothing or caps into polling places, but they then removed them when the state law was explained to them.
“Nothing here is worth getting hurt for, going to jail for,"" he said.

News Max,Dick Morris to Newsmax: Tied Polls Suggest Trump Leads in Electoral College,"Dick Morris, a close adviser to former president Donald Trump and host of ""Dick Morris Democracy"" on Newsmax, believes that recent polls showing a tied race between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris actually indicate a Trump lead in the Electoral College.
In an appearance on “Saturday Report,” Morris discussed the latest polling data showing a neck-and-neck race between Trump and Harris.
Morris observed that while the Real Clear Politics average and the Times-Siena poll show the race tied at 48%, the underlying dynamics favor Trump in the Electoral College.
“I just want to make a point, though, when the media shows a tie race, like the Times-Siena poll did for between Trump and Harris in the popular vote, what they're really saying is that Trump is beating Harris by 2 to 3 points in the Electoral College,” he explained.
He elaborated on the distinction between the popular vote and the Electoral College, using the 2016 election as an example.
“Remember, in 2016 ... the popular vote was 3% for Hillary. And yet she got massacred in the Electoral College,” Morris said, attributing this to the influence of populous states like New York and California on the popular vote. “The states in the Electoral College, which are not biased that way, end up reflecting a much higher Republican and conservative vote.”
“If you look through the national polling, there are very few, if any, that show more than a three-point margin for Harris ... that says that those polls are showing a massive Trump win in the Electoral College. And I think that's clearly what you're looking at,” he added.
“It just all tilted very rapidly because the media has been so pro-Harris and so anti-Trump,” Morris said, suggesting that last-minute shifts could alter the current race as well.
Morris emphasized that Trump supporters' discussions and information sharing could be pivotal in shifting the race.
“The difference between victory and a landslide is really going to be the word of mouth of the Trump supporters,” he said, highlighting the importance of grassroots communication outside the media as Election Day draws closer.

News Max,"In '24, America Can Elect the 'Women's President'","(Editor's Note: The following opinion column does not constitute an endorsement of any political party, or candidate, on the part of Newsmax.)
OPINION
The 47th president of the United States will inherit issues that directly impact the day-to-day life of the American woman. The next administration’s policies must be based on an authentically positive vision for the American woman’s future.
This means the American woman has a critical decision to make on Nov. 5— but that is nothing new. The everyday American woman balances responsibility in numerous arenas, from home and parenthood to office and industry.
This woman makes daily decisions that affect the health and financial well-being of her household, her work outside the home, and her prospects for the future.
This industrious citizen calls to mind a proverb about the woman who ""works with willing hands"" and ""does not eat the bread of idleness."" The writer of Proverbs 31:31 adds, ""Give her the fruit of her hands, and let her works praise her""!
This woman, whether she is married, unmarried, a parent, or a caregiver, has a unique set of interests at stake in the 2024 election.
The 47th president of the United States has the opportunity to cement a legacy as the Women’s President, if this person sets policy based on a positive vision of who the American woman is, what she can attain, and the policies that will help her thrive.
Women are key stakeholders in America’s economic outlook, owning and operating nearly 40 percent of all businesses in America.
Women are directly affected by the state of the U.S. economy as they shop for groceries, put gas in the car, and plan for the future.
Mothers and expectant mothers must evaluate paid parental leave policies in choosing whether to work outside the home, and for whom.
Additionally, moms must weigh the quality of options against financial feasibility when deciding whether to educate their children through public, private, or homeschool.
The American woman, with her myriad responsibilities and contributions in every season of life, deserves a thoughtful assessment of her policy interests, not reductive pandering about ""reproductive choice.""
In recent years, policymakers have been more focused on things like writing ""genderlessness"" into federal law and eliminating safety guardrails for chemical abortion than understanding who the American woman is.
She is feeling the impact of those policy initiatives.
While women’s median income increased every year under former President Donald J. Trump's presidency, American women are now facing skyrocketing inflation and sticker shock on basic household goods.
When federal authorities neglected to respond to America’s devastating baby formula supply chain shortage for six months, American women had to drive from store to store just to find infant care essentials.
American families, on average, are finding that it costs an extra $12,590 in 2024 to maintain their 2021 standards of living, requiring many women to choose between working to supplement household income or spending less on what they and their families enjoy --- not to mention waiting longer to enjoy the fruits of their labor in retirement.
The left simply can't even define what a woman is, let alone address her true interests and concerns. The American woman works hard for America.
But will America work hard for her?
The pages of Scripture honor the wise and industrious woman and praise the heroic acts of the biblical queens, prophets, and judges.
But the Bible also cautions women not to be weak-willed and deceived by personalities and appearances.
The Christian tradition honors, cherishes, and uplifts women in the example of Jesus Christ, and Christianity has been the antidote to injustice and dishonor toward women from time immemorial.
Therefore, it is incumbent on women of faith to show up to the polls and act as salt and light on Nov. 5.
The left has successfully driven a wedge with its discouraging and spiritually bankrupt vision for the future of women in America.
While it may take generations to rebuild political consensus around policies that bear good fruit, the 47th president of the United States will be empowered to advance policies that dignify women or policies that harm them. Women of faith must not stay home and let policies inspired by misery and dysfunction prevail over a positive vision for a future of health, wellness, and prosperity for the American woman. Now is the time to elect a true Women’s President.
Noelle Huizenga is the vice president of public policy & communications at National Religious Broadcasters, a 501(c)(3) organization that neither supports nor opposes any candidate for public office.

News Max,Joe Penland to Newsmax: Endorsing Trump for Economic Agenda,"Texas business leader ""Joe from Texas"" Penland Sr., who has been asking candidates to sign onto the ""Contract from the American People,"" a 10-point initiative to fight the spiraling national debt, told Newsmax that he's endorsing former President Donald Trump, saying his platform to revive the economy closely matches what Americans are demanding.
""If you look at Donald Trump's platform, what he has, about eight of these 10 [on the contract] are on his 15-point script that he has,"" Penland told Newsmax's National Report Friday.
Still, Penland said he and others working with the initiative didn't support Trump from day one because two years ago, they didn't know who would be in the election.
""We held off until we talked to thousands of people to see what they really want,"" said Penland, explaining that the contract contains demands that make sense to the American people, and politicians are being asked to sign on and take the pledge to better the country.
Penland told Newsmax that the economy has gotten worse for the ""last several presidents.""
He added that when the election started, he got requests for money for campaigns, and decided to ""take the money that they want"" and launch an investigation into what is going on with debt and other problems.
""We hired some people and we put a team together and we started researching, and as you researched it, it got a lot worse than what you hear on the news or reading the paper,"" said Penland.
And while on tour around the country, Penland said the group learned that ""people are really further into this than what the politicians give us credit.""
""They think that the American people are completely in the dark, that we don't know what we're doing,"" he said. ""Look at all the businesses that this country has. You know, we are the empire of the world as far as business and people all want to come to this country. They all want to start their business here.""
But the United States is ""subbing that market out,"" he said.
Penland is the founder and chairman of Quality Mat Company, one of the oldest and largest producers of rig, oilfield, and crane mats in the world, and has served on several bank boards over a quarter of a century, and he said he thought it was important to ""unmask the American financial situation.""
""This contract is not from me and is not from Dave Walker, who's the former comptroller general of the United States who helped author it,"" he said. ""This is from the American people. This is what the American people want. And the politicians need to listen to that.""
The national debt is now at almost $36 trillion, and Penland pointed out that the Congressional Budget Office has projected that the United States will go $2 trillion more in the hole per year for the next 10 years.
""That would be $56 trillion,"" he said. ""We'll pay $2 trillion a year in interest. That money should be helping children go to school, should be helping elderly people, should be taking care of our streets and our border.
""It took us over 220 years to get to $1 trillion in debt, and now we go $2 trillion every year in debt for the next 10 years,"" he said. ""I think it's unacceptable. And I take offense to it.""

News Max,Rep. Andy Harris: Invoke Taft-Hartley Act on Strike,"Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., called on President Joe Biden on Thursday to invoke the Taft-Hartley Act in response to the port workers' strike that has paralyzed ocean shipping on the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico.
The 1947 Taft-Hartley Act authorizes a president to seek a court order for an 80-day cooling-off period for companies and unions to try to resolve their differences.
""It is in the interest of the American people and the economy of Maryland for the President to invoke the Taft-Hartley Act, order the disputing parties in this port strike to the negotiating table, and intensively arbitrate,"" Harris said in a statement. ""The President should not allow this strike to ruin the economy or disrupt the supply chain.""
Ports from Maine to Texas shut down early Tuesday when the union representing about 45,000 dock workers went on strike for the first time since 1977.
If a shutdown lasts more than a few weeks, it could raise prices and create shortages of goods across the country as both the presidential election and holiday shopping season approach.
Biden could suspend the strike by invoking the Taft-Hartley Act, but he didn't seem inclined to do so when asked about it by reporters on Sunday.
When asked if he planned to intervene in the longshoremen's labor dispute, the president said ""no.""
""Because it's collective bargaining, I don't believe in Taft-Hartley,"" he said.
Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack told reporters on Thursday that container loads of highly-perishable bananas are stuck at some ports and the strike will make it difficult to retrieve them in time to prevent spoilage. Biden has pushed shipping companies to try harder to reach a deal, he said.
""That's the most effective way of getting the bananas to wherever they need to go,"" Vilsack said. ""And hopefully the shippers will come to the table. The union will come to the table. Collective bargaining will work, and we'll get this resolved quickly.""
The key to preventing product shortages and higher prices, Vilsack said, is limiting how long the strike lasts.
""Our assessment is if this lasts a couple of weeks, we're not talking about a significant disruption,"" he said. ""If you get into months, then obviously that's a different situation.""

News Max,"NY Times Poll: Trump Leads by 1, Flipping Biden Voters","In a polling pool that said it voted for President Joe Biden in 2020 by 7 points (52%-45%), Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump leads Vice President Kamala Harris by 1 point (46%-45%), according to the latest The New York Times/Siena College poll released Sunday.
""I think I'm going Republican this time because, really, the economy is the biggest issue for me,"" Atlanta voter Oliver Funk, 25, told the Times. ""I think Donald Trump will be better at handling just everyday prices than what we've seen in the past four years.
""I think that’s funny to say 'American democracy is under threat.' There's actually democracy under threat around the world. We're pretty coddled and pretty safe. Actually, extremely safe.""
Despite that data point above and that voter's position, the Times' analysis focused on the Democrats' election narrative of ""threat to democracy"" weaponized against Trump – albeit without the story mentioning multiple assassination attempts against Trump or the fact Harris eschewed the democratic process by not competing in the Democrat presidential primary won by Biden by a landslide.
The story dutifully mentions the Democrat narratives of ""the 2020 presidential election, the criminal conviction of former President Donald J. Trump and Mr. Trump’s continued insistence that the democratic process is rigged,"" however.
The Times/Siena College poll results among registered voters in a full field:
- Republican Trump 46%
- Democrat Harris 45%
- Green Party Jill Stein 2%
Independents and third-party candidates Robert F. Kennedy, Cornel West, Libertarian Chase Oliver, and another unnamed candidate each received less than 1% support. There were 1% who vowed to not vote because those were the choices, while 4% do not know who to vote for or refused to answer.
The Times analysis homed in on the Democrat narrative of the threat to democracy with the headlined ""Voters Are Deeply Skeptical About the Health of American Democracy.""
Its subheadline did suggest a dissatisfaction with the Biden-Harris administration, though: ""Nearly half say it does not do a good job representing the people, and three-quarters say it is under threat.""
But that narrative does not mention the fact a plurality of votes say American democracy ""does a good job representing people"" (49%), trumping the 45% it ""does not do a good job representing the people.""
But those polled do admit overwhelmingly under Biden-Harris that American democracy ""is currently under threat"" (76%), while just 20% replied it ""is not currently under threat.""
Vital to Americans is their personal finances, according to a Norfolk, Virginia, social worker.
""I even have to go to a food bank, and my husband and I make a decent salary, and we still can’t wholly make ends meet with three children,"" Tyra Jackson-Taylor, 51, told the Times. ""It's just a lot, me having to work and him work overtime, just to try to make the ends meet.""
Despite the skepticism of American economics and democracy as laid out by the Times, the poll does show overwhelming confidence the election will accurately present a true victor.
The confidence in the 2024 election is up 10 points from 2022 midterms, as nearly 80% of voters trust the upcoming election result will be accurate. That includes a majority of Republicans, Democrats, and independents. That figure was about 70% just two years ago, representing an increase in U.S. election confidence, despite the Times story's concern for American democracy.
Also, the Times report noted ""few voters say that concerns about democracy are central to their vote. Just 7% of voters said democracy was the most important issue regarding their choice for president.""
The Times poll featured 2,516 voters polled nationwide by Siena College (Oct. 20-23). the margin of error among likely voters is plus or minus 2.2 percentage points.

News Max,Potential October Surprises Loom Over Presidential Election,"October surprises have a history of upending presidential elections, from the revelation of George W. Bush's DWI arrest in 2000 to Donald Trump's infamous Access Hollywood tape in 2016.
The Access Hollywood tape showed how potential new audio or video could upend a presidential election. Vice President Kamala Harris could face trouble if audio or video of her talking about how her past positions like supporting a ban of fracking surfaces, The Hill reported, while former President Donald Trump has faced attacks from the Harris campaign for promising wealthy donors a tax cut if elected.
The unpredictable nature of weather could change the shape of the race. Barack Obama got a boost for his handling of Superstorm Sandy in 2012, getting a hug from then-New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie.
Hurricane Helene forced Harris to suspend in-person campaigning to return to Washington, D.C., to be briefed on the storm while Trump visited Georgia where he criticized the federal government's response to the storm. Harris and President Joe Biden are expected to visit areas affected by the storm.
The 2024 presidential election has seen Trump face two assassination attempts, including being grazed by a bullet while speaking at a rally in Pennsylvania. NBC News reported last month the FBI was investigating after election officials in six states received suspicious packages.
""I'm most concerned about vote-counting and election judges and violence. There's been a pretty clear pattern of threats about who gets to count votes,"" John Murphy, a professor at the University of Illinois who studies political rhetoric, told The Hill.
Another presidential debate could also change the shape of the race. The debate between Biden and Trump led to Biden dropping out of the race, while Harris was widely viewed to have bested Trump in their only debate. Trump has refused another debate, saying it would be too late, with early voting well underway in many states.
Vice presidential candidates Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, will be debating on Tuesday.
The continued turmoil in the Middle East looms over the presidential campaign. Next week marks a year since Hamas attacked Israel and Israel recently launched a ground invasion of Lebanon, while US officials believe Iran is preparing to launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel.

News Max,N.C. GOP Chair to Newsmax: Record Voting in Helene-Hit Areas,"Jason Simmons, chair of the North Carolina GOP, told Newsmax on Monday that the areas of the state ripped by Hurricane Helene have seen ""record turnout"" during the early voting period.
""I had the opportunity to travel to western North Carolina and visit with our leaders last week before the start of early voting and was very confident after visiting with them that their resolve, their commitment to getting out the vote, is high,"" Simmons said during an appearance on ""Wake Up America."" ""What we saw then, after the first day of early voting, record turnout in these impacted counties and what we've seen is indicative across the state.
""More than a million North Carolinians have already cast a ballot. Republican turnout is way up. Democrat turnout is way down. People are ready to fire [Democrat presidential nominee] Kamala Harris and send her home.""
Former President Donald Trump is reportedly making multiple stops in the storm-battered areas of North Carolina on Monday, which Simmons said is likely to be well received by the residents in the absence of substantial federal assistance.
""As I've had an opportunity to visit with people in western North Carolina, they feel very much abandoned by the federal government, and the state response has been very lackluster,"" he said. ""And so, people are ready to see President Trump once again in western North Carolina and then see him get into the White House to be able to have the strength and the resolve that they need also in the White House.""
The state GOP official also shared his thoughts on why there has been such a bump in early voting among Republicans, who have historically shunned the practice.
""People understand that they're not better off than they were four years ago, and, as a result, they are showing up to the polls in record numbers,"" Simmons said. ""Republicans, unaffiliated voters, they are making sure to fire Kamala Harris and send Donald Trump back to the White House.""
FiveThirtyEight polling shows that Trump is ahead in North Carolina 48.2% to Harris’ 47.4%, which Simmons said has been a trend in the swing state in recent years.
""North Carolina has always been a very close battleground state for the last number of cycles and so, as we continue to focus on identifying and turning out our vote, we make sure that they understand where to vote, how to vote but, more importantly, make a plan and get out and vote,"" he added.

News Max,James Carville 'Scared to Death' About Election,"Veteran Democratic strategist James Carville said Wednesday that with the election coming up, he's ""scared to death.""
Carville told MSNBC that he is ""very, very concerned and very scared"" after estimating that Vice President Kamala Harris has less than three weeks to get her message out to voters.
As of Wednesday, there were 27 days until the Nov. 5 vote, but Carville said, ""Today is gone. You're going to lose four to the hurricane ... and everything kind of shuts down the Saturday before the election.""
""So you're really probably under 20 days that you have to really get a message out.""
Carville said Harris' campaign needs ""to be sharp. They need to be aggressive. They need to stop answering questions and start asking questions. They're doing all this and sitting down with '60 Minutes' and sitting down with [Stephen] Colbert and sitting down with this.""
When asked if he'd like Harris to do more press conferences, Carville said, ""I'd like for her to put more things in play, where she's out saying, 'What is [Republican vice presidential nominee] J.D. Vance talking about that [Republican presidential nominee Donald] Trump saved Obamacare? He tried to destroy it at every point.' I would put [former] President [Barack] Obama out to make that; he's only got a 92% approval with Democrats.""
Carville also suggested that Harris ask former President Bill Clinton to go on local TV in Michigan and Wisconsin to talk about how tariffs would ""destroy the economy"" to counter Trump's recent call to implement tariffs on goods made outside the U.S.
Overall, Carville said, ""I think [Harris] and the whole campaign needs to be much more aggressive and much less passive than they are.""

News Max,"Reuters/Ipsos Poll: Gains: Trump, Hispanic Men, Harris, White Women","Republican Donald Trump has nearly erased Democrats' longstanding advantage among Hispanic men ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election when he will face Democrat Kamala Harris, according to an analysis of Reuters/Ipsos polling.
Former President Trump now trails Vice President Harris by just 2 percentage points among Hispanic men — 44% to 46% — compared with his 19 point deficit with Democrat Joe Biden at the same point in 2020, according to the analysis of more than 15,000 responses to Reuters/Ipsos polls conducted in the month through Oct. 21 and during the same period of 2020.
Trump's gains have been offset by increased support for Harris among white women, who favored him over Biden by 12 points late in 2020 but now lean Republican by 3 points, 46% to 43%.
The two candidates are locked in an exceptionally tight race, with Harris up only marginally — 46% to 43% — in the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted Oct. 16-21.
The shifts are part of larger changes in the coalitions that each candidate is counting on for victory, with Trump boosting his advantage with Hispanic and Black voters — particularly men — while Harris has cut away at the Republicans' longstanding edge with white voters by gaining ground with women.
Robert Alomia, a Hispanic voter in Elizabeth, New Jersey, who works at a security firm, said he respects Trump's career as a businessman and plans to vote for him this year after sitting out the 2020 election.
""We need people who think quick and people who are willing to lead — he’s a leader,"" said Alomia, 42, who said he was also sympathetic to Trump's hardline views on immigration. ""You have these people that come into the country where they get everything, and basically the door is open for them.""
Trump has accused the Biden administration of leaving the southern border open to migrants while Harris has pushed back against that by blaming Trump for pressuring Republicans in Congress to jettison a bipartisan border security bill that have would tightened border controls.
Hispanic voters, the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. electorate, have leaned heavily Democratic in most presidential elections since the 1970s but Trump has made significant inroads.
The analysis of recent Reuters/Ipsos polling shows Trump with support from 37% of registered Hispanic voters, up from 30% at the same point in 2020. Harris is at 51% compared to Biden's 54% four years earlier. The numbers are subject to sampling error, and have levels of precision of between 2 and 6 percentage points.
Trump ended up winning 38% of the Hispanic votes in 2020, 21 points below Biden but still the biggest share for a Republican candidate since President George W. Bush won 44% in 2004, according to a 2020 exit poll analysis by the Pew Research Center and historical figures compiled by the American Enterprise Institute.
The Republican is also on track to whittle away at the edges of Democrats' strength in the Black electorate. Some 18% of Black men picked him in recent Reuters/Ipsos polls, up from 14% four years earlier, as did 8% of Black women, up from 4%. Exit polls after the 2020 election showed that about 8% of Black voters overall picked Trump in 2020, while the recent Reuters/Ipsos polling shows him at 12%.
Republican campaign strategist Kristin Davison said Trump is wooing Black voters by convincing them that the Democratic Party is too extreme on social issues.
""That's what Trump has been able to do with Black men and with Hispanics in the last four years, not just on the issues of the economy and hard work, but with country and family,"" she said.
America's history of racial tension and injustice looms large in the minds of Trump's supporters and detractors alike. Trump famously asked Black voters during his 2016 presidential campaign, ""What the hell do you have to lose?""
""A lot of people might play the race card. They might say he's racist, they might say he's using Black people. They might say a lot of stuff. But for me, personally, I feel like he proved that he wants to see everybody win,"" said Kedrick Benford, a Black voter in Houston who didn't vote in 2020 but said he thinks he'll vote for Trump this time.
Benford, 30, a self-employed retailer, said he considered Trump more experienced than Harris.
Harris has kept the race close in part by winning over white women, who made up about four in 10 voters in 2020, double the combined share of Black and Hispanic voters. While the two candidates' shares of support from white men is largely unchanged, Harris' boost among white women means Trump is only leading by nine points with white voters overall, compared to when he led Biden by 14 points with them in 2020.
Davison, the Republican strategist, said many women have turned to Harris in part because Democrats have effectively focused them on abortion following the 2022 U.S. Supreme Court ruling by ending the nationwide right to abortion.
Women are also evaluating ""the stark contrast in leadership and character between the vice president and Trump, which is influencing their choices,"" said Meghan Hays, a Democratic strategist and former senior communications aide to President Biden.
""The vice president must widen her lead among women voters to offset Trump’s advantage with Black and Latino men,"" Hays added. ""This election will be won by the smallest of margins.""
Donna Berg, a white woman in St. Charles, Illinois, voted for Trump in 2016 and again ""reluctantly"" in 2020, but Berg decisively dumped Trump following the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol attack.
""After Jan. 6, it was all over,"" Berg said. She said the Republican Party has veered into extremism under Trump's leadership and she would vote for Harris this year. ""I am not necessarily voting for her as much as I’m voting against Trump.""

News Max,"NBC Poll: Trump, Harris in Dead Heat at 48 Percent","Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris remain in a dead heat with just over three weeks left until Election Day, according to the latest national NBC News poll.
The poll, conducted from Oct. 4-8, shows Harris and Trump each with 48% of the vote in a head-to-head matchup, with another 4% saying they are undecided or won't vote for either candidate, the network reported Sunday.
Last month's NBC News poll showed Harris ahead of Trump by 5 points, at 49%-44%, but that result was also within the margin of error.
Trump fared slightly better in the current poll when third-party candidates were added, with 47% picking Trump, 46% for Harris, and a combined 7% either saying they were undecided or picking other candidates.
Harris, however, held a 6-point lead on the expanded ballot in September.
The current poll questioned 1,000 registered voters and carried an overall margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.
""As summer has turned to fall, any signs of momentum for Kamala Harris have stopped,"" Democrat pollster Jeff Horwitt, who conducted the survey with GOP pollster Bill McInturff, commented. ""The race is a dead heat.""
However, the poll shows that there is still uncertainty among voters, with 10% of voters still saying they might change their minds and some voters remaining undecided.
There was also an all-time high among voters who believe the election will mean a ""great deal of difference"" to their lives.
The third-party vote may also play a role, with the poll showing that Trump got a one-point edge when third-party candidates were included in the poll.
The numbers could also change based on whether the voting environment is more favorable for Republicans or Democrats, the poll showed.
If more men, white voters, and voters without college degrees turn out, an environment deemed more favorable for Republicans, Trump was shown to be leading Harris by 2 points, at 49% to 47%.
But if there is a more favorable turnout environment for Democrats, including more white voters with college degrees, women, or voters of color showing up, Harris came out at 3 points ahead of Trump, at 49%-46%.
All of the different results, however, fell within poll's margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, leaving the race in a virtual tie.
In other numbers:
- Harris led Trump among Black voters (84%-11%), younger voters ages 18 to 34 (57%-37%), and white voters with college degrees (55%-41%).
- Trump came out ahead of Harris with rural voters (75%-23%), white voters (56%-42%) and whites without college degrees (65%-33%).
- Woman supported Harris by 55% to 41% and men backed Trump by 56%-40%.
- Independent voters were also split, with Harris getting 44% and 40% backing Trump.
- Harris' popularity was 43% positive and 49% negative. Trump's numbers were almost identical, at 43% positive and 51% negative.
The top issues among voters are abortion (22%), immigration/border security (19%), protecting democracy or constitutional rights (18%), and cost of living (16%), the poll showed.
Harris topped Trump on abortion, healthcare, and being competent, while Trump came out ahead in the border, the Middle East, and handling the cost of living.

News Max,CBS Cuts JD Vance's Mic as He Calls Out Moderator for Debating Him,"CBS News cut the debate microphone of Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, when he objected to an attempt by moderator Margaret Brennan to debate Vance on how Haitian immigrations obtained temporary status in Springfield, Ohio.
Vance pointed out to Brennan that CBS News had said it would be up to the two candidates — not moderators Brennan and Norah O'Donnell — to fact-check each other and the journalists would encourage them to do so at Tuesday night's vice presidential debate.
Vance called out CBS News for breaking the rules it had set down, then had his mic cut.
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump posted on his Truth Social site during Tuesday's debate that ""both young ladies have been extremely biased anchors!""
""Margaret Brennan just lied again about the ILLEGAL MIGRANTS let into our Country by Lyin' Kamala Harris, and then she cut off JD's mic to stop him from correcting her!"" Trump protested in a real-time post.
It was the evening's most contentious moment and exposed CBS News' attempt to put its thumb on the scale against Vance and for Minnesota Democrat Gov. Tim Walz.
After Vance had talked about illegal immigrants overwhelming some American cities like Springfield, Brennan interjected that the Haitians that had moved to that city were now technically legal under the Biden-Harris administration's policies.
""Since you're fact-checking me, it's important to say what is actually going on,"" Vance said.
After briefly letting Vance speak, Brennan interrupted him to debate him as a wide-eyed Walz stood quietly. When Brennan had enough, she decided it was time for her to get the last word and move on to other issues. CBS News muted the microphone of Vance, who could still be faintly heard in the background debating Brennan in the New York City studio.
""Gentlemen, the audience can't hear you because your mics are cut,"" Brennan said, looking at Vance, who she was debating and unhappy with his correcting her on facts.
Trump was live posting on Truth Social, remarking at the myriad cases of evidence of bias in the moderating, a sticking point for his rejecting overtures for further presidential debates.
""Margaret Brennan just 'fact checked' JD, incorrectly, on 'Climate Change,'"" Trump wrote. ""When is she going to fact check Tampon Tim on all of his false statements? Another repeat with the Fake News being unfair to the Republican Candidate, and trying to get the pathetic Democrat across the finish line.
""But it doesn't matter, the Public sees it for what it is – FAKE NEWS!""
Fact-checking has been an issue for liberal media moderators during the Trump era, because of their propensity to devolve the debate into media versus Trump instead of candidate versus candidate.
This was fully on display before the American people with Brennan debating Vance on the issue he is closely intune with as sitting senator of Ohio.
There were points at which the moderators sought to encourage the candidates to police each other. During a discussion about whether illegal migration was driving up housing costs, Brennan said to Walz, ""I do want to let you respond to the allegation that the vice president is letting in migrants.""
Conservatives have been making that case for years.
And it took the Democrat-pressing issue of abortion to allow the candidates engage in the fact-checking CBS News promised to permit.
Vance cited a provision in a Minnesota abortion law, where Walz is governor.
""As I read Minnesota law, it says that a doctor that presides over an abortion where the baby survives, the doctor is under no obligation to provide life-saving care,"" Vance said, accurately.
Vance called that ""fundamentally barbaric,"" while Walz merely claimed his opponent's interpretation of the law was untrue without providing any explanation.
What did the law actually say? That was left unclear, and viewers were left to decide which candidate they wanted to believe. The CBS moderators cut to a commercial, unwilling to clarify that Vance was pointing to Minnesota's law that permits doctors to allow a failed abortion baby to die without care.
Also, Minnesota unwound the reporting requirements for doctors to report on what care was delivered or not to a baby born after a failed abortion.
""Norah just made a statement about the Election, not a question: She's having a bad night!"" Trump added on Truth Social after another moment where the moderator was debating Vance on the contested 2020 election.
""I thought Norah was fired from CBS for Low Ratings. Why is she still on?"" Trump added.
Throughout the debate, CBS News ran on its screen a message that viewers could log onto its ""CBS News Confirmed"" website to read about claims in the debate that were untrue or misleading. At some points, the network even showed a code that enabled viewers to instantly call up the information on their mobile phones.
That entreaties was not shown on the screen of Newsmax's simulcast of the CBS News debate.
The debate may have represented the last chance for viewers to see representatives of the two presidential campaigns duke it out on screen. Vice President Kamala Harris has called for a second debate between her and Trump, but the Republican candidate has rejected the overture because Harris refuses to debate before voting started – or with moderators that were not decidedly favoring Harris in the race.

News Max,Karoline Leavitt to Newsmax: Trump 'a Hit' at Al Smith Dinner,"Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign's national press secretary, told Newsmax on Friday that former President Donald Trump's speech to the annual Al Smith dinner on Thursday ""was a hit"" and that Vice President Kamala Harris' video appearance ""was a huge flop.""
Trump appeared at the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in New York City, a high-profile, white-tie fundraiser for Catholic charities held every year at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Harris, Trump's opponent in the 2024 election, declined to attend the dinner. President Joe Biden and Trump both spoke at the event in 2020.
""President Trump's speech last night at the Al Smith dinner was a hit, as it always has been in years past,"" Leavitt said on ""Wake Up America"" Friday.
She added that Trump ""had great one-liners about Kamala Harris, even sneaking in a funny joke about Doug Emhoff and nannies on the stage last night,"" a reference to Harris' husband's confession that he had an affair during his first marriage with a woman who taught his daughter.
""The crowd clearly very much appreciated that he showed up, and it's for a great cause,"" Leavitt added. ""The Catholic Church, which does so much good for Americans and for people all around this world who are in need.""
She went on to say, ""It's shameful that Kamala Harris canceled on this event, did not show up in person, and then sent a video that was a huge flop.
""You couldn't hear laughs from anyone in the room. And when they panned through the crowd, it was just a lot of straight faces. So President Trump won the night and he will continue to win every day between now and Nov. 5.""

News Max,"Threats, Assassination Attempts Reshape Trump's Campaign","Donald Trump was onstage at a rally on Long Island last month, talking about taxes, when he appeared momentarily spooked by something he'd spotted over his shoulder.
“I thought this was a wise guy coming up,” he explained, joking that he was getting his elbow ready to fight back.
“You know I got a little bit of a yip problem here, right?” he added to laughs, using a term familiar to golf aficionados to describe a phenomenon once blamed on performance anxiety where players suddenly lose the ability to make easy shots. “I was all ready to start duking it out.""
It was a fleeting moment passed off as a joke. But as he returns to Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday for a rally at the site where a gunman opened fire in July, grazing his ear with a bullet, the scare underscores the lasting fallout for the candidate and his campaign even as much of the national attention has shifted to other crises.
Beyond the two attempts on his life in as many months, the former president and GOP nominee faces ongoing death threats from Iran, which has also been blamed for hacking top campaign officials and allies, exacerbating anxieties already heightened by a stepped-up security apparatus and new restrictions on how he can campaign.
Trump's allies insist he was not fundamentally changed by the gunman who fired from an unsecured roof at the rally in July or the would-be assailant in September who shoved a rifle barrel through the fence at his West Palm Beach golf course.
The picture of Trump standing, with blood streaked across his face, as he raised his fist and shouted “Fight!” has become the indelible image of the campaign.
“When you almost lose your life, it stays with you. It stays with him,” said Florida Rep. Byron Donalds, a close Trump ally. “But that doesn’t change his resolve. His resolve is just as strong as it ever has been.”
Trump staffers are on edge. There have been death threats directed at his aides, and his team isn't as able to quickly organize the mass rallies that have always been the signature of his campaigns.
Armed security officers now stand guard at the campaign’s Florida headquarters, and staff have been told to remain vigilant and alert.
Events have been canceled and moved around because the U.S. Secret Service lacked the resources to safely secure them. Even with the use of glass barricades to protect Trump onstage, there are concerns about holding additional rallies outdoors due to fears about drones.
Trump has accused President Joe Biden's administration of intentionally denying security resources to help Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent, by preventing him from addressing large crowds.
“They couldn't give me any help. And I'm so angry about it because what they're doing is interfering in the election,” he said in a recent Fox News interview.
U.S. Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement that Trump “is receiving heightened levels of U.S. Secret Service protection” and that “our top priority is mitigating risks to ensure his continued safety at all times.” Biden expressed concern for Trump after both assassination attempts, saying in September, “Thank God the president is OK.”
Trump also now travels with a larger security footprint, with new traffic restrictions outside his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida, and a line of dump trucks and big guns on display outside Trump Tower in New York when he’s staying there.
As reporters filed into his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, for a press conference this summer, guests — including a little girl wearing a red, white and blue bathing suit — were forced to exit their cars and go through airport-style metal detectors as their vehicles were searched for bombs.
Trump’s campaign last week was briefed on continued threats from Iran in presumed retaliation for his administration's killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, an act that prompted Iran’s leaders to vow revenge. In August, a Pakistani man alleged to have links to Iran was charged in a plot to carry out political assassinations on U.S. soil. Law enforcement did not name the targets of the alleged plot, but legal filings suggest Trump was a potential target.
Iranian hackers have also been charged with stealing information from Trump’s campaign and trying to pass it along to news organizations. In May, prosecutors say, the men charged began trying to penetrate the Trump campaign, successfully breaking into the email accounts of campaign officials and other Trump allies. They then sought to “weaponize” the stolen campaign material by sending unsolicited emails to people associated with Biden’s campaign. None of the recipients who worked for Biden responded.
The cyberattacks have forced some staff to change their email addresses and others to be wary of communicating online.
Trump already faced unprecedented legal jeopardy for a presidential candidate, with four criminal indictments — one resulting in a felony conviction with sentencing delayed until after the election, one case dismissed, and two pending — along with civil lawsuits that carry hundreds of millions of dollars in potential penalties.
“I think that from our perspective, just from the campaign standpoint, operationally, if there’s one group of people that can handle something like this thrown in their lap, it’s the team that Donald Trump assembled to run this campaign, just based on everything we’ve had to deal with, whether it’s lawsuits to keep him off the ballot, to indictments, to assassination attempts,” Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita said.
Trump often discusses the role of divine intervention in his life, suggesting that it may have been a factor in his political journey, noting that significant political figures often attract criticism.
“Obviously, when you come within a half an inch of a very different outcome, that’s going to impact you,"" said New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, another ally who said she spoke to Trump the morning after the Butler shooting.
“Of course, those moments really make you consider a higher power, why you are so committed to helping save this country,” she said. “I think it has further empowered and energized President Trump.”
Trump was recently asked by NewsNation if he's concerned about his safety ahead of his return to Butler. “Well, I'm always worried,” he responded.
“I’m going back to Butler because I feel I have an obligation to go back to Butler. We never finished what we were supposed to do,"" he said. “And I said that, when I was shot, I said, we’re coming back. We’re going to come back. And I’m fulfilling a promise; I’m fulfilling really an obligation.”
His most loyal supporters at his rallies, including the one on Long Island where he joked about the “yips,” haven't been dissuaded from seeing him in person.
“I know some people are scared to come, but I’m not,” said Eileen Deighan, 63, a nurse from nearby Yonkers, New York, who said she was inspired by Trump’s decision to keep on campaigning given the threats.
“The fact that he didn’t give up, he’s willing to fight for our country, how could you not support that?’ she asked. “That will that he has — doesn’t give up. It’s very contagious.”
Trump told his supporters at a rally in Wisconsin on Saturday that he would continue fighting “no matter what obstacles and dangers are thrown on our path.” But he had another point to make.
“I tell you what, I had a good life before I did this,” he said. “Nobody was shooting at me. I had a hell of a life.”

News Max,Trump Again Tries to Move N.Y. Case to Federal Court,"Donald Trump's lawyers pushed Monday to transfer to federal court the case in which he was convicted in a New York state court on charges involving covering up a payment paid to an adult film star, a move that would give him the ability to end the prosecution if he regains the presidency.
His lawyers renewed the request in a brief filed with the Manhattan-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals as they appealed U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein's Sept. 3 ruling rejecting the shift to federal court. Trump was convicted in May of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents.
In their brief, Trump's lawyers cited the U.S. Supreme Court's July 1 decision that former presidents cannot be prosecuted for official actions taken in office. In the case, they said, jurors had improperly seen evidence of Trump's official acts as president.
His lawyers said the state charges intruded on the authority of the presidency under the U.S. Constitution.
Trump is the Republican candidate facing Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris in the Nov. 5 election. If he wins, he could seek to pardon himself for any federal crime or have his new Justice Department leadership dismiss any criminal cases pending against him in federal court. State criminal charges are beyond the reach of presidential pardon authority or Justice Department action.
Under U.S. law, civil or criminal cases pursued against federal officials may be moved to federal court if they relate to do their duties in office.
Trump's lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove wrote that prosecutors' ""use of official-acts evidence in grand jury proceedings and at trial violated the Constitution and threatens the ability of all future Presidents to fulfill that role.""
Trump was convicted by a jury in May of falsifying business records to cover up a payment of $130,000 made by his former lawyer Michael Cohen to adult film actress Stormy Daniels for her silence before the 2016 election about a sexual encounter she has said she had with Trump a decade earlier. The case was brought by the office of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat.
Trump denies the encounter with Daniels. He has vowed to appeal the verdict after his sentencing, which is scheduled for Nov. 26.
The Supreme Court's immunity ruling, arising from an appeal related to federal criminal charges against Trump over his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden, held that evidence of a former president's official acts cannot be used in criminal cases about otherwise personal conduct.
Trump's lawyers have argued that the Supreme Court's decision meant the case should be dismissed. Trump pleaded not guilty in the Manhattan case and the federal election-related case.
Hellerstein denied Trump's request to move the case to federal court, finding that the trial dealt with ""private, unofficial acts, outside the bounds of executive authority.""
If the 2nd Circuit rules against Trump, he could ask the Supreme Court — whose 6-3 conservative majority includes three justices he nominated — to hear the matter.
A spokesperson for Bragg's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The 2nd Circuit has not given Bragg's office a deadline to respond to Trump's brief.

News Max,Election Lab: More Than 10.1M Have Already Voted,"More than 10.1 million people have voted early in several states, including key battleground locations as of Friday.
According to data released Friday from the University of Florida's Election Lab, early voting is taking place in several states, including some that are key battleground locations for this year's general election, ABC News reported.
The statistics show that as of Friday morning, more than 2.7 million cast in-person early votes; more than 7.4 million have returned mail-in ballots, and 55.6 million have requested mail ballots.
The numbers further showed that more Democrats than Republicans are voting early, according to states with party registration reporting in earlier results:
- Democrats: 2,396,022, or 49.5 %.
- Republican: 1,509,659, or 31.2 %.
- No party affiliation: 932,450, or 19.3%.
However, in-person early voting is nearly equal between the two major parties:
- Democrats: 169,538, or 38.3 %
- Republicans: 155,500, or 35.1 %
- None/Minor: 117,898, or 26.6 %
The numbers also are higher among Democrats who have requested mail-in ballots:
- Democrats: 2,264,349 ballots accepted; 18,205,223 requested; 12.4 % returned.
- Republicans: 1,356,293 ballots accepted: 11,471,148 requested; 11.8 % returned
- None/Minor: 815,084 accepted; 13,686,551 requested; 6.0 % returned
The totals also revealed that far more older people than young are voting:
- Ages 18-25: 166,196
- Ages 26-40: 371,563
- Ages 41-65: 1,215,359
- Over 65: 2,087,064
The researchers noted that the party registration statistics are for states that have party registration but are not actual votes because, by federal law, election officials do not begin counting ballots until Election Day, although they may start the process of preparing ballots for counting in advance.
In some states, voters who are using an absentee ballot are able to drop off their paper ballots at an approved location or election office before Election Day, while in other locations and the District of Columbia, polling sites are open where voters can use election machines to cast their votes.
According to political science experts, voting early cuts lines on Election Day while giving more options to voters.

News Max,"Speaker, ABC Host Spar Over Trump Election Rhetoric","House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and ABC News ""This Week"" host George Stephanopoulos spent the majority of a Sunday interview arguing over what questions to answer.
Stephanopoulos spent the majority of his interview trying to get Johnson to respond to a statement former President Donald Trump made at his most recent Butler, Pennsylvania rally, where he stated:
""Over the past eight years, those who want to stop us from achieving this future have slandered me, impeached me, indicted me, and tried to throw me off the ballot. And who knows? Maybe even tried to kill me?""
The clip of Trump speaking, taken by ABC News, was immediately followed up with a clip from Trump's son, Eric Trump, speaking at the rally, stating: ""They tried to kill him.""
""So,"" Stephanopoulos asked Johnson, ""is it right for the president and his family to suggest that Democrats are behind the effort to assassinate him?""
Reacting to the clip, Johnson told Stephanopoulos, ""I think what they're alluding to is what we've all been saying: They have got to turn the rhetoric down.""
""For years now, the leading Democrats in this country, the – the highly – highest elected officials, and the current nominee for president have gone out and said that Donald Trump is a threat to democracy. That, you know, the republic will end if he's reelected.""
Stephanopoulos then pressed Johnson on a series of gotcha questions, mostly in regards to Jan. 6., such as: ""Can you say unequivocally that Joe Biden won the 2020 election and Donald Trump lost? What would you do next Jan. 6 if you are indeed speaker? If every state completes the certification process successfully, will you accept the results even if [Vice President] Kamala Harris is the winner?""
Amid Stephanopoulos's pressing, Johnson requested the news anchor to ask him a policy question. But Stephanopoulos refused.
When it came to asking Johnson about election fraud, in an effort to grab a sound bite from the speaker that the election was stolen, Johnson refrained for a second and then mentioned how, throughout his travels across the country this campaign season, voters have told him that election security is a primary concern for them.
""I'll tell you that election security is a major concern of the American people. The first or second question, almost without exception in every audience and crowd, is about election security.""
""I think,"" he added, ""the latest poll says 60% of Americans and both parties are worried about that. They're worried about election interference by foreign nationals like Iran who's trying to meddle in our elections. They're worried about, of course, illegals voting, non-citizens voting. That is against federal law.""
Newsmax has found no evidence that Iran or Russia or China has meddled in the lead-up to the upcoming election. However, the FBI did release a statement claiming that ""Russia, Iran, and China are trying by some measure to exacerbate divisions in U.S. society for their own benefit, and see election periods as moments of vulnerability. Efforts by these, or other foreign actors, to undermine our democratic institutions are a direct threat to the U.S. and will not be tolerated.""
Nonetheless, and despite the agency providing no evidence, the statement from the FBI can only be taken on good faith.

News Max,Harris: Immigration Plan Needs Citizenship Pathway,"Vice President Kamala Harris told Telemundo that the U.S. needs an immigration policy that includes a pathway to citizenship.
In his interview with Harris, Telemundo host Julio Vaqueiro said he asked Harris if former President Donald Trump won the argument on immigration.
""She's defending the bipartisan bill that includes more resources to secure the border, even shutting down the border and closing loopholes around asylum,"" Vaqueiro said in a preview of the interview on MSNBC's ""José Díaz-Balart Reports."" ""Those are policies that President Trump defended when he was the president.""
Harris said America was a country that was built on immigrants and said she doesn't support mass deportation, which Trump has vowed to enact if he's elected.
""We need smart, humane immigration policy in America that includes a pathway to citizenship, putting more resources at the border in terms of security,"" Harris said.

News Max,FBI Arrests Afghan Man Who Officials Say Planned Election Day Attack,"The FBI has arrested an Afghan man who officials say was inspired by the Islamic State militant organization and was plotting an Election Day attack targeting large crowds in the U.S., the Justice Department said Tuesday.
Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, 27, of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, told investigators after his arrest Monday that he had planned his attack to coincide with Election Day next month and that he and a juvenile co-conspirator expected to die as martyrs, according to charging documents.
Tawhedi, who entered the U.S. in 2021 on a special immigrant visa, had taken steps in recent weeks to advance his attack plans, including by ordering AK-47 rifles, liquidating his family's assets and buying one-way tickets for his wife and child to travel home to Afghanistan.
“Terrorism is still the FBI’s number one priority, and we will use every resource to protect the American people,” FBI Director Christopher Wray said in a statement.
After he was arrested, the Justice Department said, Tawhedi told investigators he had planned an attack for Election Day that would target large gatherings of people.
Tawhedi was charged with conspiring and attempting to provide material support to the Islamic State group, which is designated by the U.S. as a foreign terrorist organization.
It was not immediately clear if he had a lawyer who could speak on his behalf.

News Max,Harris Courts 'McCain Wing' of GOP in Arizona,"Vice President Kamala Harris is looking to win over ""the McCain wing"" of the Republican Party in the battleground state of Arizona, NBC News reported.
Jen Cox, senior adviser for the Harris campaign in Arizona, told the news outlet, ""Talking with folks in the Maricopa County suburbs is really, really critical to our path to victory.""
More than two-thirds of Arizona voters live in Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located and where Biden won by more than 2 percentage points against former President Donald Trump in 2020.
""What we've heard from Republicans who have come out in support of the vice president is that respect for the rule of law is a critical component of their support for her,"" Cox added.
Phoenix-based Republican consultant Barrett Marson told NBC News on Friday that Harris is facing a challenge in winning over the same moderate suburban Republicans that helped President Joe Biden win the state by less than 0.5% of the vote in 2020.
""The McCain wing of this party is a conservative group. It just isn't nuts,"" he said.
""It makes it hard to vote for someone like Kamala Harris, because she's the antithesis of a lot of things John McCain advocated for throughout his life,"" Marson continued. ""But on the other hand, she doesn't want to overthrow the government.""
He added that Harris ""doesn't want to institute a dictatorship. She doesn't want to instruct the Justice Department to start arresting Republicans left and right. So the choice isn't a very good one for McCain Republicans, but it is also probably easier because of the actions of Donald Trump.""

News Max,San Francisco's First Black Female Mayor in Pricey Battle for Reelection,"When London Breed was elected as San Francisco's first Black woman mayor, it was a pinch-me moment for a poor girl from public housing whose ascension showed that no dream was impossible in the progressive, compassionate and equitable city.
But the honeymoon was short-lived as a COVID-19 pandemic shuttered stores and tech workers retreated to home offices. Tent encampments surged and so did public drug use.
Breed now finds herself in a pricey campaign as she battles for a second term.
The moderate Democrat faces four main challengers on the Nov. 5 ballot, all fellow Democrats, who say Breed has squandered her six years in office. They say she allowed San Francisco to descend into chaos and blamed others for her inability to rein in homelessness and erratic street behavior, all while burglarized businesses pleaded for help.
Her closest competitors appear to be Mark Farrell, a former interim mayor and venture capitalist who is the most conservative of the group, and Daniel Lurie, an anti-poverty nonprofit founder and an heir to the Levi Strauss fortune who has pumped at least $6 million of his own money into his first bid for mayor.
The other two are Aaron Peskin, president of the Board of Supervisors, the most liberal of the candidates, and Ahsha Safaí, a city supervisor and former labor organizer.
Streets have become cleaner and homeless tents much harder to find, but the daytime shooting in September of 49ers rookie Ricky Pearsall in a popular central shopping district reignited the public safety issue.
""Even though San Francisco is seen as this kind of West Coast liberal icon, the city has experienced a series of episodes that challenge that, and that puts voters into kind of a testy mood,"" said David McCuan, a political science professor at Sonoma State University.
McCuan added that he thinks Breed still has the advantage, but ""she's just got difficulties around her.""
The Nov. 5 vote in a presidential election year is happening amid a national debate on public safety and a statewide vote on a tough-on-crime proposition that would, if approved, reclassify some misdemeanor theft and drug crimes as felonies.
Voters concerned over crime ousted progressive San Francisco prosecutor Chesa Boudin in a rare recall in 2022, and across the bay this year, the Oakland mayor is facing a recall election due in part to crime concerns.
In an interview, Breed, 50, said San Francisco is turning a corner — thanks to her hard work — and voters she meets are upbeat.
She championed a pair of successful public safety ballot measures in the March primary to expand police powers and compel some people into drug treatment. She ordered a crackdown on homeless tent encampments following a U.S. Supreme Court decision that said bans on outdoor sleeping are allowed. Reported crime is down.
""We laid the groundwork, and now people are reaping the benefits of our infrastructure projects, the capacity we built and the technology we're using to combat crime,"" Breed said, adding that voters ""know that someone's in charge and making it happen.""
Farrell challenged that notion at a meeting with voters at a boisterous gastropub on a recent evening, saying Breed failed to maintain the streets he cleared of tents when he was interim mayor in 2018. Farrell, 50, was a city supervisor who served in the role for six months following the death of Mayor Ed Lee.
He envisions a San Francisco where police feel respected and older residents don't have to hire private security when the city has a $15 billion annual budget.
""San Franciscans, given the state of our city right now, want not only a change of leadership, but a sense of direction for the city,"" Farrell said in an interview this week.
Lurie, 47, says voters deserve a true public servant and that as a political outsider, he has the experience to overhaul corrupt government bureaucracy.
Voters are ""desperate, desperate for someone that is going to come in there and bring accountability,"" Lurie said.
As founder of the nonprofit Tipping Point Community, he says, he built tiny cabin shelters and permanent subsidized housing at a fraction of the cost and time that it would take City Hall.
Breed, Farrell and Lurie all have strong ties to wealthy business donors.
Lurie leads in fundraising with more than $13 million, including $1 million from his mother, businesswoman Miriam Haas, to an outside committee supporting his candidacy. Breed has collected more than $4.6 million, including $1.2 million from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, while Farrell has raised $3.5 million.
All three candidates also carry baggage.
Breed is embroiled in an unfolding scandal over financial mismanagement in the Dream Keeper Initiative, her marquee racial equity program for Black communities. The mayor says the program does good work.
Farrell has been accused by opponents of dodging campaign contribution limits by pooling staff and office costs with a campaign he established in support of a ballot measure, which can accept unlimited donations. Farrell says he is following the law.
And critics of Lurie say the affordable housing project his nonprofit built cannot be replicated citywide because it used a construction method opposed by local labor unions and required massive private investment. Lurie says naysayers will naysay.
San Francisco elects its mayor using a ranked choice voting system that could yield a winner who did does get the most first-place votes. It also can encourage unusual alliances between rival candidates and, indeed, this week Farrell and Safaí agreed to ask their supporters to make the other their No. 2 pick.
Breed won election as mayor in June 2018 to serve out the remainder of Lee's term and was reelected in 2019 to a full term that has lasted five years instead of the typical four after voters changed the election calendar to line up with presidential contests.

News Max,Trafalgar Poll: Trump Holds Slight Edge in Arizona,"Former President Donald Trump maintained his lead over his Democrat rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, in the crucial swing state of Arizona, a poll released Monday by the Trafalgar Group showed.
The poll of 1,090 likely Arizona voters taken Oct. 11-13 showed Trump with a lead of 47.5%-46%. The poll has a margin of error of 2.9 percentage points. Just 3.7% of those polled were undecided.
Trump's lead of 1.5 percentage points is slightly smaller than the 1.6-point edge he held in September's poll.
Trump is ahead in six of seven swing states polled by Trafalgar — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Harris has a slight lead in Nevada. The former president appears to be doing better in battleground state polls than he is nationally, where Harris is either ahead within the margin of error or the candidates are tied.
In the hotly contested race to fill Arizona's vacant U.S. Senate seat — independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema declined to seek reelection — Dem. Rep. Ruben Gallego holds a 47.6%-43.9% lead over Republican Kari Lake, a staunch Trump supporter. Lake has carved into Gallego's lead — he was up 47.2%-43% in the September poll.

News Max,Judge Rejects Repairman's Defamation Claims Over Reports on Hunter's Laptop,"A computer repairman at the center of a controversy over Hunter Biden's laptop has lost his defamation case against news outlets, the president's son and Joe Biden's presidential campaign.
A Delaware judge on Monday also dismissed Hunter Biden's claims accusing Wilmington computer shop owner John Paul Mac Isaac of invasion of privacy.
Mac Isaac alleged that he was defamed by media reports and statements from Hunter Biden and his father’s presidential campaign implying that the laptop left at his shop in April 2019 was part of a Russian disinformation campaign and that the computer and data it contained may have been stolen.
The laptop surfaced publicly in October 2020 when The New York Post reported on emails it contained regarding Hunter Biden’s business dealings in Ukraine, where the Obama administration's foreign policy efforts had been led by his father. In response, 51 former intelligence officials signed a public statement asserting that the laptop story had “all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation,” an assertion that proved to be false.
In a 2021 television interview, Hunter Biden said the laptop could have been stolen from him or hacked, or that Russian intelligence was involved.
Mac Isaac said he was defamed by suggestions that he was a thief, a hacker or involved in a Russian plot.
Hunter Biden’s attorneys argued that his comments were opinion, did not mention Isaac by name and therefore could not be defamatory. Superior Court Judge Robert Robinson Jr. agreed.
Ronald Poliquin, an attorney for Mac Isaac, told The Associated Press that he plans to appeal.
“Hunter Biden went on national TV and gaslighted the American public by indicating John Paul Mac Isaac was part of a Russian hoax when he knew it to be false,” Poliquin said in an email. “As the FBI has confirmed, Biden dropped off his laptop at the Mac Shop. Hunter Biden lied and needs to be held accountable.”
Robinson also dismissed Mac Isaac's defamation claims against CNN and Politico over their reporting on the laptop, as well as claims against Joe Biden's campaign committee for saying the laptop contents were Russian disinformation.
The judge also said Hunter Biden’s counterclaims against Mac Isaac for invasion of privacy must be dismissed because he waited too long to file them.

News Max,"NY Times/Siena Poll: Trump Leads in Ariz., Harris in Pa.","Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have split two of the most coveted swing states, according to a pair of NY Times/Philadelphia Inquirer/Siena College polls released Saturday.
In Arizona, Trump leads Harris 51% to 46%, holding a noteworthy lead as his advantage is outside the poll's margin of error. The former president has made inroads in Arizona with his strong support among independents and Hispanic males. Voters favored Trump on the economy 56% to 41% and on immigration 55% to 42%.
Harris maintains a lead over Trump in Pennsylvania 50% to 47%, holding a massive 18 percentage point advantage among voters who consider abortion to be the most important election issue. For those voters in the Key Stone State who feel the economy is the most important issue, Trump leads 54% to 43%, and on immigration 55% to 42%.
The NY Times/Siena College poll surveyed 857 likely voters in Pennsylvania from Oct. 7 to Oct. 10 with a sampling error of +/- 3.8 percentage points. The Arizona poll surveyed 808 voters from Oct. 7 to Oct 10 with a sampling error of +/- 3.9 percentage points.

News Max,Trump Gains Ground as Harris Falters in Key Battleground States,"Former President Donald Trump is showing signs of resurgence in his bid for a second term, as Vice President Kamala Harris faces a dwindling lead in critical battleground states, raising concerns among Democrats just weeks before the election, The Hill reported.
With the 2024 presidential election fast approaching, Trump is seeing an uptick in his chances for a second term, while Harris' early momentum appears to be waning. According to the latest election forecast by The Hill and Decision Desk HQ (DDHQ), Harris' chances of victory on Nov. 5 have dropped to 51%, down from 56% in late September.
In key battleground states, Trump now leads in five out of seven, reversing the 4-3 edge Harris held earlier in October. Polls show tight margins, making it difficult to predict a clear winner. While national polls still favor Harris, with a 2.9-point advantage, the real challenge lies in the Electoral College, where battleground states could determine the outcome, as seen in the 2000 and 2016 elections.
Concerns among Democrats are growing as Trump's recent gains have shifted the political landscape. Harris' national advantage might not be enough to secure victory, especially given the narrow polling margins in states like Michigan and Wisconsin, where she has recently lost ground. In Michigan, she had a 2-point lead in mid-August; in Wisconsin, she held a nearly 5-point advantage in late August. Both states now lean toward Trump, adding to the unease among her supporters.
Several factors could influence the election's outcome. Polling accuracy has been questioned, particularly after misses in previous elections. Additionally, significant issues like abortion, which favors Harris, and immigration, a key Trump talking point, could drive voter turnout. However, the polls also offer only a snapshot, and with weeks remaining until Election Day, new developments could still sway public opinion.
Harris, who has led in national polls since President Joe Biden stepped aside, remains under pressure to maintain her visibility. Over the past week, she has increased her media appearances, including interviews on CBS's ""60 Minutes"" and ABC's ""The View,"" along with a town hall event with Univision. While her media presence has been steady, some moments, particularly evasive answers during the ""60 Minutes"" interview, have led to criticism from opponents.
However, even in friendly settings, her failure to conclusively show how she differentiates herself from Biden has caused her to face pushback, with critics quick to seize on any perceived missteps.
Meanwhile, while former President Barack Obama campaigned in Pittsburgh, he suggested that sexism may be hindering Black male voter turnout for Harris, an opinion that has sparked controversy in the Democratic Party.
Despite these challenges, Harris' fundraising remains a bright spot for her campaign. She has raised over $1 billion, significantly outpacing Trump's efforts. However, the high expenditure rate, with her campaign spending $7.5 million per day in August compared to Trump's $2.6 million, may show that the Republican platform speaks to voters more than the advertising dollar.

News Max,Trump Blasts Harris for Campaigning With Liz Cheney,"Donald Trump slammed Vice President Kamala Harris for promoting her support from two of the former president's harshest Republican critics, former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney and her father, Dick Cheney.
Harris campaigned in three battleground states Monday with Liz Cheney, one of two GOP lawmakers who sat on former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's partisan Jan. 6 select committee.
Liz Cheney and father Dick, the former vice president, have said they will vote for progressive Harris in the White House race because of their personal feelings about Trump.
The former president took to his social media platform to lambaste Harris and the Cheneys.
""Lyin' Kamala has stooped so low as to pick a woman to campaign with her who lost her Congressional Race by the largest margin, 40%, in history. The record holder is Crazed Warhawk Liz Cheney, whose father, Dick, convinced Bush to go into the Middle East and KILL. Now Kamala wants Arabs to vote for her? I don't think so!"" Trump posted on Truth Social in Tuesday's early hours.
Trump's comment came hours after his campaign took a jab at Harris spokesman Ian Sams, who criticized Dick Cheney's role in getting his daughter into a special State Department position that allowed the Bush administration to pursue its war in Iraq under false pretenses.
""Even a broken clock is right twice a day,"" the Trump campaign quipped. ""And a Kamala Harris spokesman is right once in his life.""
The statement referenced a tweet of Sams from 2019, when he wrote, ""Liz Cheney helped lead us into Iraq from a special State Department Middle East post her dad's administration created for her.""
Liz Cheney, who has claimed to be pro-life, appeared with Harris in Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin to tell voters they should vote for the proponent of abortion rights now that Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and returned the issue to the states.
""I have been very troubled, deeply troubled by what I have watched happen in so many states,"" Cheney said, CNN reported.
""I have been troubled by the extent to which you have women who, as the vice president said, in some cases, have died, who can't get medical treatment that they need because providers are worried about criminal liability.""

News Max,Ipsos/Reuters Poll: Trump Leads Harris On Economic Issues,"A new Reuters/Ipsos poll finds that economic issues are the top priority for American voters. According to the survey, conducted a month before the Nov. 5 election, 26% of Americans say the economy, unemployment, and jobs are the most important issues facing the country today.
Political extremism and threats to democracy follow at 17%, with immigration close behind at 16%. The poll highlights inflation and the cost of living as the most pressing economic concerns, with 70% of registered voters saying the next president should focus on tackling affordability.
Former President Donald Trump is seen by more registered voters as having a better plan for handling economic challenges, compared to Vice President Kamala Harris. He holds a 15-point lead over Harris when it comes to managing the stock market, and a 9-point lead on improving Americans' financial well-being and in overseeing the broader U.S. economy, and a 4-point lead on taxes.
As Election Day closes in, the poll suggests that economic issues, and particularly addressing inflation, will be top-of-mind for a majority of voters. Early voting is already underway in some states.
The Ipsos poll was conducted Oct. 4-7, 2024, on behalf of Reuters using the KnowledgePanel®. It's based on a representative sample of 1,272 U.S. residents, age 18 or older, with a margin of error ± 2.8 percentage points for results based on the entire sample of adults.

News Max,Biden Praises DeSantis on Hurricane Efforts,"President Joe Biden praised Florida's Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis on Tuesday saying he has been “cooperative” with his administration as Hurricane Milton bears down on the Sunshine State.
“The governor of Florida has been cooperative. He said he’s gotten all that he needs. I talked to him again yesterday,” Biden said at the White House before heading to Wisconsin and Pennsylvania to campaign for Vice President Kamala Harris.
On Monday, it was widely reported that DeSantis had refused to accept any calls from Harris because “they seemed” political, according to a DeSantis aide. DeSantis later denied the report saying, ""I didn't know that she had called,"" he said. ""I'm not sure who they called. They didn't call me. Their characterization of it was something that they did.
""It wasn't anything that anybody in my office did, in terms of saying it was political.""
Harris had previously accused DeSantis of being “utterly irresponsible” and “selfish” for not taking her call last week following the devastating caused by Hurricane Helene.
Biden gave a different account of DeSantis saying, “I literally gave him my personal phone number to call, so, I don’t know — there was a rough start in some places, but every governor, every governor from Florida to North Carolina, has been fully cooperative and supportive and acknowledged what this team is doing.”
DeSantis told Fox News earlier in the day that Harris had never called him before during any of the many hurricanes that have hit Florida during his time in office and noted he’s worked with both Biden and former President Donald Trump in the past.
“Why all of the sudden is she trying to parachute in and inject herself when she’s never shown any interest in the past? We know it’s because of politics, we know it’s because of her campaign. I have zero time to entertain these political games. We’re going to continue to do what we need to do to prepare and respond to what may be one of the most damaging storms in the history of the United States,” DeSantis said.
The National Weather Service in Tampa Bay has said Milton could be the worst storm to hit the city in more than 100 years. Forecasters suggest the hurricane will make landfall near Tampa Bay as a Category 3 late Wednesday or early Thursday morning.

News Max,Trump: 'Obama Will Be Voting for Me',"Former President Donald Trump posted that former President Barack Obama ""will be voting for me"" because Vice President Kamala Harris ""is an extremely Low IQ Person!""
Trump commented Friday morning, the day after Obama lectured Black men in Pennsylvania on why they should vote for Harris and not the former president.
""Obama admits a total lack of enthusiasm for Kamala, especially with Black Men,"" Trump posted on Truth Social. ""I think Obama will be voting for me because he doesn't like the fact that Kamala is an extremely Low IQ Person!""
Five minutes after that post, Trump made a pitch to minority voters.
""Kamala's Border Invasion is killing the jobs of our Black and Hispanic populations. BAD NUMBERS, will only get worse!"" Trump posted.
While speaking to a group of campaign volunteers and officials in Pittsburgh, Obama addressed reports that many Black men were leaning toward voting for Trump.
""You're coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses,"" Obama said, The New York Times reported. ""I've got a problem with that.
""Part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.""

News Max,GOP Loses Bid to Block Pa. Voters From 'Curing' Mail-In Ballots,"Pennsylvania election officials will be able to notify voters of any mistakes in their mail-in ballots and let them make changes, the state's top court ruled, in a blow to Republicans who sought to block the practice in a state crucial to determining who will be the next U.S. president.
In declining on Saturday to hear a lawsuit brought by the Republican National Committee and its state affiliate against so-called notice and cure procedures, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said the RNC filed the case too close to the Nov. 5 election, which pits Republican former President Donald Trump against Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris.
Pennsylvania is one of seven key battlegrounds likely to sway the state-by-state Electoral College outcome that determines the winner of U.S. presidential elections. Whichever candidate wins Pennsylvania will receive 19 electoral votes toward the total of 270 needed for victory.
The case is one of more than 120 voting-related lawsuits the RNC is involved with across 26 states. Republicans say they are trying to restore faith in elections by ensuring people don't vote illegally.
The Republican push has yielded some victories.
In another ruling on Saturday, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court declined to hear a case brought by voting rights groups against a state requirement that mail-in ballots must bear the correct date in order to be counted. The court also said that case was brought too close to the upcoming election.
""This is a huge win for election integrity, and Pennsylvania voters can cast their mail ballots with confidence,"" RNC Chair Michael Whatley said in a statement, referring to the ballot dates decision.
The use of mail-in ballots has surged since the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump, who falsely claims his loss to President Joe Biden in the 2020 election was marred by fraud, has criticized mail-in ballots as unreliable without evidence.
In asking the court on Sept. 18 to block county election boards from adapting ""notice and cure"" procedures, the RNC argued that the state's legislature had not granted the local boards the authority to adopt them.
In a Sept. 20 court filing, the Democratic National Committee and its state affiliate argued that the state's election laws indeed gave local boards the authority to implement such measures, and said the ruling the Republicans sought would prevent local officials from facilitating voter participation.
Charles Lutvak, a spokesperson for Harris' campaign, in a statement called the Pennsylvania Supreme Court's decision ""a victory, not for Democrats but for our democracy.""

News Max,"Robert Wilkie to Newsmax: Biden, UN Blame Israel for Everything","Robert Wilkie, the former Veterans Administration secretary under former President Donald Trump, told Newsmax on Tuesday the Biden administration is continuing to go against Israel's best interests.
""Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are now threatening Netanyahu with a U.S. arms embargo if he doesn't open up more avenues for humanitarian relief in Gaza,"" Wilkie told ""Newsline."" ""Look, the only way they're going to have peace in Gaza is if Hamas is destroyed or if Hamas surrenders. They're the ones who even took American humanitarian aid. They're keeping it from the people. They've done this for decades and decades.""
Wilkie said the Biden-Harris administration too often goes along with the U.N. which appeases Hamas and blames Israel for everything.
""If Israel ceased to exist, the United Nations would go out of business,"" Wilkie said. ""Because I think 80% of its docket is devoted to harassing and punishing the Israelis.""
The Arab American PAC announced it will not be endorsing a presidential candidate, which marks the first time in its 20-year history it will not be endorsing a Democrat for president.
""Neither side trusts this administration,"" Wilkie said. ""We've had feckless leadership now for four years. The world's on fire. If Donald Trump had remained in office, Ukraine wouldn't have happened. China would have been back in its box and Hamas wouldn't have dared attack Israel.""

News Max,Michelle Obama to Headline Atlanta Vote Rally,"Former first lady Michelle Obama will headline a rally in Atlanta a week before the Nov. 5 election alongside celebrities and civic leaders focusing on engaging younger and first-time voters, as well as voters of color.
The Oct. 29 event will be hosted by When We All Vote, a nonpartisan civic engagement group that Obama founded in 2018 to ""change the culture around voting"" and reach out to people who are less likely to engage in politics and elections.
The rally is likely to help the campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democrat presidential nominee, in a closely contested state. Obama is one of the party's best-known figures and gave a speech boosting Harris’ candidacy at the national convention in August.
It is unclear which celebrities will attend the rally but organizers noted that the group's co-chairs include professional basketball players Stephen Curry and Chris Paul; musical artists Becky G, H.E.R., Selena Gomez, Jennifer Lopez and Janelle Monáe; beauty influencer Bretman Rock; and actors Tom Hanks, Lin-Manuel Miranda and Kerry Washington.
The group has hosted more than 500 ""Party at the Polls"" events across the country focused on increasing voter registration and turnout. The events have ranged from pop-up block parties in Las Vegas, Phoenix and Philadelphia to voter registration partnerships with professional sports leagues and music festivals over the past year.
""The goal is to take the energy and momentum at the rally to the ballot box,"" said Beth Lynk, executive director of When We All Vote. ""We want to bring the culture, the energy and the momentum together in one big space.""
Lynk said the group chose Atlanta because of the state's diversity and the impact that only a handful of voters can make in Georgia. About one-third of Georgia's electorate is Black alongside rapidly growing Asian American and Latino communities. When We All Vote is focused on engaging college students on campuses in the metropolitan Atlanta area, Lynk said.
""Something that we have been hearing from young voters is that a lot of people don’t believe that their votes have power. But they do, plain and simple,"" Lynk said. ""We know that democracy has to work for all of us and that’s what we will be stressing at this rally.""
The rally will take place just before early voting ends in Georgia on Nov. 1, less than a week before Election Day.

Sondland, on ""Newsline,"" commented on his recent interview with MSNBC where he revealed that he plans to vote for Trump despite testifying against the former president during his impeachment trial in 2019, saying that he doesn't ""stand by"" his previous statement that he would no longer support Trump after the Capitol riot.
""Look, you have to put Jan. 6 into perspective,"" Sondland said. ""I was not pleased by Jan. 6, It was not our finest hour. I do believe, sadly, that President [Joe] Biden won the election.""
He added, ""Were there voting anomalies? Absolutely. Did they amount to enough to change the outcome of the election? Sadly, no. President Biden won.""
Sondland went on to say that he sees ""things through a different lens four years later,"" adding that while he's ""upset by the events of Jan. 6, they're far eclipsed by what the Biden-Harris administration have put us through as a country and will put us through even more and more dramatically if Vice President Harris is elected president.""
He also clarified that he believes Harris being elected president would be ""an existential threat to our way of life,"" but not ""an existential threat to our country.""
Sondland said, ""Our country has survived far worse than Kamala Harris and Joe Biden, and hopefully, will continue to do so.""

News Max,"Suffolk Poll: Trump Gains as Harris Struggles With Latino, Black Voters","Former President Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are in a tight race as they near the final stage of the presidential campaign. Both are competing for crucial Latino and Black voter support. A USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll released on Monday shows Trump closing the gap with targeted messaging while Harris struggles to generate enthusiasm among critical demographics, USA Today reported.
The poll reveals that Trump and Harris are effectively tied. Harris holds a narrow lead of 45% to Trump's 44%, a shift from August when Harris led by five percentage points.
Trump's success stems from his efforts to appeal to Latino and Black voters, particularly men, by focusing on economic issues and crime. The poll shows that 49% of Latino voters support Trump, while 38% back Harris.
Harris leads among Black voters with 72%, but this is a significant drop compared to traditional Democratic margins in the group. By contrast, Trump's 17% among Black voters marks a considerable inroad.
While Trump has focused on issues like the economy, his approach to specific policies has also influenced public opinion. Among likely voters, 49% believe Trump has adequately explained his policies, compared to 48% who disagree. Meanwhile, Harris faces scrutiny, with 57% of respondents stating she hasn't done enough to clarify her policies. Even among her supporters, 23% want to hear more details about her plans.
Harris, however, leads Trump by double-digit margins on specific issues, including healthcare and abortion rights. The poll shows Harris is favored 54% to 39% on healthcare and 56% to 36% on abortion. She also leads in her perceived ability to bring about political change, with 46% of voters preferring her over Trump, who garnered 44%.
Despite her strengths, Harris has lost ground with the voter base that helped Joe Biden win in 2020 when 92% of Black and 59% of Latino voters supported the Democratic ticket.
Harris has ramped up outreach to Latino and Black voters, especially in swing states. She released an economic plan for Black men that includes small-business loans and marijuana legalization. However, the poll shows she has yet to generate the enthusiasm to secure these key voting blocs.
Conversely, Trump continues to be seen as stronger on issues such as the economy and immigration. Voters trust him more to handle the economy, 53% to 43%, and he leads Harris on immigration, 51% to 44%.
The poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points, surveyed 1,000 likely voters from Oct. 14 to 18. It highlights a deeply polarized electorate: 61% believe the country is on the wrong track, but opinions are sharply divided on the best path forward.
In the poll, 44% of respondents said they were worse off than four years ago, compared to 39% who disagreed.

News Max,Trump: Youngkin Right to Appeal Noncitizen Voting Decision,"Former President Donald Trump said he supports Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin's decision to appeal a federal judge's Friday decision allowing nearly 1,600 noncitizens to vote in the upcoming general election.
Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, took to Truth Social to blast the Department of Justice after U.S. District Judge Patricia Giles granted an injunction request brought against Virginia election officials.
""Sleepy Joe Biden and Comrade Kamala Harris ridiculously accuse me of wanting to 'weaponize' the Justice Department, when they have done all of the weaponizing. Now, their truly Weaponized Department of ‘Injustice,’ and a Judge (appointed by Joe), have ORDERED the Great Commonwealth of Virginia to PUT NON-CITIZEN VOTERS BACK ON THE ROLLS,"" Trump posted.
""This is a totally unacceptable travesty, and Governor Youngkin is absolutely right to appeal this ILLEGAL ORDER, and the U.S. Supreme Court will hopefully fix it! Only U.S. Citizens should be allowed to vote. Keep fighting, Glenn - AND REPUBLICANS IN VIRGINIA, KEEP VOTING EARLY! I will be calling in to Glenn’s Rally with Lara Trump tomorrow morning to talk about this crazy Ruling, and announce my final stop in Virginia before Election Day. TUNE IN!""
Youngkin's office issued a press release with the governor saying the state will appeal the judge's ruling to the Supreme Court, if necessary.
""Let’s be clear about what just happened: only 11 days before a Presidential election, a federal judge ordered Virginia to reinstate over 1,500 individuals–who self-identified themselves as noncitizens–back onto the voter rolls. Almost all these individuals had previously presented immigration documents confirming their noncitizen status, a fact recently verified by federal authorities,"" Youngkin said in his statement.
""This is a Virginia law passed in 2006, signed by then-Governor Tim Kaine, that mandates certain procedures to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls, with safeguards in place to affirm citizenship before removal–and the ultimate failsafe of same-day registration for U.S. citizens to cast a provisional ballot. This law has been applied in every Presidential election by Republicans and Democrats since enacted 18 years ago.
""Virginia will immediately petition the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and, if necessary, the U.S. Supreme Court, for an emergency stay of the injunction.""
Giles ordered Virginia to reinstate more than 1,600 voter registrations that were canceled in the past two months as part of a campaign to prevent noncitizens from voting.
The Justice Department and private groups, including the League of Women Voters, said many of the 1,600 voters whose registrations were canceled were in fact citizens whose registrations were canceled because of bureaucratic errors or simple mistakes like a mischecked box on a form.

News Max,Vance: Aurora Mayor Shows 'Element of Truth' to Gang Claims,"Sen. J.D. Vance on Sunday doubled down on former President Donald Trump's claims that members of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang have ""overrun"" the city of Aurora, Colorado, saying Mayor Mike Coffman has admitted there is a problem while denying one exists.
""Well, Martha, you just said the mayor said they were exaggerated,"" Trump's running mate told ABC News' ""This Week"" anchor Martha Raddatz. ""That means there's got to be some element of truth here.""
Coffman, the GOP mayor of Aurora, said Trump's claims, made during a rally in the city and during other political speeches and interviews, are ""grossly exaggerated"" and that they ""have unfairly hurt the city's identity and sense of safety.""
During a rally Friday in Aurora, located near Denver, Trump repeated claims that the migrants have ""invaded and conquered"" the city and accused his Democrat rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, of letting the city's buildings be ""infested"" by gang members, calling them ""animals and barbaric thugs.""
He also unveiled a plan he's calling ""Operation Aurora"" and promised that if he's elected, ""we will send elite squads of ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement], Border Patrol, and federal law enforcement officers to hunt down and arrest and deport every last illegal alien gang member until there is not a single one left in this country.""
Raddatz told Vance that the city says the issues are limited to a few apartment complexes and that the mayor said the city's police will handle the concerns.
But Vance argued that Harris has caused the issues in Aurora through her involvement with the Biden administration and as its ""border czar.""
""Unfortunately, when you let people in by the millions — most of whom are unvetted, most of whom you don't know who they really are — you're going to have problems like this,"" he said, adding that Harris ""bragged about opening the border, and now we have the consequences, and we're living with it.""
""We're not going to do better, Martha, unless Donald Trump calls this stuff out. I'm glad that he did,"" said Vance.
The Ohio Republican also defended Trump's claims that aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency that should be going to hurricane victims in Florida, North Carolina, and Georgia has instead gone to migrants.
""What the president said is that, fundamentally, FEMA aid is distracted by going to illegal migrants,"" Vance said. ""We've got Republican congressmen who are on the ground who represent that area saying that they have to call the White House to get food and water to FEMA.""
Vance said that he doesn't think there is ""anything malicious"" happening,"" but at the same time, ""we've had an incompetent response to this particular crisis, particularly in western North Carolina, which, to be fair, was hit harder than a lot of us expected it.""
Raddatz on Sunday also asked Vance if Trump plans to go after his political opponent if he wins the November election.
""No, he was president for four years, and he didn't go after his political opponents,"" said Vance, claiming instead that Harris has ""tried to arrest everything from pro-life activists to her political opponents.""
Raddatz told Vance that Trump has threatened to prosecute people who have cheated in the election, and he responded that the former president has said that ""people who violated our election laws will be prosecuted.""
""I think that's the administration of law,"" he added. ""He didn't say people are going to go to jail because they disagree with me.""

News Max,Judge Allows Biden Student Loan Forgiveness Plan to Proceed,"The temporary restraining order preventing President Joe Biden from forgiving student loan debt for over 25 million Americans will expire after a federal judge delivered a loss to the Republican-led effort to stop the plan.
Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, North Dakota, and Ohio filed a lawsuit against the aid package that includes debt cancellation for millions of dollars worth of student loans, arguing that the attempt is illegal and would harm student loan providers.
However, U.S. District Judge Randal Hall in Georgia ruled on Wednesday that the state lacked the standing to sue against the plan and therefore could not serve as the venue for the lawsuit. The judge ruled that the case should be transferred to Missouri since the suit claims that the plan would harm the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority.
""Based on Plaintiffs' reliance on MOHELA as its primary basis for standing, the Court finds the most equitable transfer would be to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri,"" Hall wrote in his decision.
A spokesperson for the Department of Education hit out at Republicans following the ruling in a statement to CNBC.
""The fact remains that this lawsuit reflects an ongoing effort by Republican elected officials who want to prevent millions of their own constituents from getting breathing room on their student loans,"" the spokesperson said.

News Max,Ohio Dem Staffer Caught Saying 'Open' the Border,"A staffer for two Ohio lawmakers was caught on audio calling residents racist and saying the entire border should be open. Kevin Oyakawa, who works for Democrats Sen. Sherrod Brown and Rep. Emilia Sykes as a regional organizing director, can be heard saying, ""Open the f—ing border, I don't give a s— who the f— comes in here,"" according to Ohio.news.
""We don't need border patrol, but the issue with even talking about immigration here in Ohio is that it's a losing issue for Democrats here. For like no f—ing reason other than people's pure racism,"" he said.
He added that if Sykes ""has to start talking about immigration, she starts losing.""
In response, Sykes' campaign defended her record, highlighting her support for bipartisan measures like the Dignity Act, which aims to strengthen border security and curb the flow of illegal drugs.
Her campaign said in a statement, ""Congresswoman Emilia Sykes has worked to deliver increased funding to help secure our border and stop the flow of illegal drugs like fentanyl.""
Sykes' Republican opponent, Kevin Coughlin said, ""Ohioans are already aware of Emilia Sykes' dangerous open border policies, and now we see what she and her team support behind closed doors."" He added that Sykes calls anyone who disagrees with her ""racist.""
Brown's campaign also emphasized his support for border security. His campaign spokesman said Brown has ""worked with both parties to secure our southern border and keep Ohioans safe from fentanyl by cracking down on the chemical suppliers in China and drug cartels in Mexico.""
A spokesperson for Bernie Moreno, Brown's Republican opponent, said, ""Ohio Democrats would rather keep the border open and continue to allow millions of illegals to enter our nation rather than secure the border and protect our communities.""
In 2017, when Oyakawa was just 20, he ran for a local office in Illinois, where he was attending college. His name was left off the ballot because of a mistake on his petition forms. He told Ncclinked.com in February 2018, ""I had to make up for my inexperience through my energy, and I put all that energy into building up the campaign and building momentum. Just to have it taken away on a technicality was really saddening.""

News Max,Kremlin Denies October Report of Trump Phone Calls With Putin,"The Kremlin on Wednesday denied reports by American journalist Bob Woodward that former President Donald Trump spoke to Russian President Vladimir Putin as many as seven times after leaving office, the RBC daily reported.
When asked by RBC if Putin and Trump had spoken on the phone, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""No, that's not true.""
In his book ""War,"" Woodward said Trump ordered an aide away from his office at his Florida residence at Mar-a-Lago in early 2024 so he could conduct a private phone call with Putin, according to The Washington Post's summary of the book.
The Post said Wednesday the book does not describe what the two men discussed, and it quotes a Trump campaign official casting doubt on the supposed contact.
The book also cited an unnamed Trump aide as indicating that Trump might have spoken to Putin as many as seven times since Trump left the White House in 2021.
Trump's campaign dismissed Woodward's book and said the book's content was ""made-up,"" The New York Times reported.

News Max,Trump Won't Rule Out Pardon for Hunter Biden,"Donald Trump on Thursday did not rule out granting a pardon to Hunter Biden if the Republican presidential nominee wins back the White House, saying, ""I wouldn't take it off the books.""
Trump commented during an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt.
President Joe Biden's son is scheduled for two sentencing hearings in December, one for his conviction on felony gun charges (Dec. 4) and the other for his guilty plea on federal tax charges (Dec. 16). Trump told Hewitt the look is ""very bad for our country"" despite the fact that Biden has ""been a bad boy.""
""I wouldn't take it off the books,"" Trump told Hewitt. ""See, unlike Joe Biden, despite what they've done to me, where they've gone after me so viciously, despite what, and Hunter's a bad boy. There's no question about it. He's been a bad boy. All you had to do is see the laptop from hell. But I happen to think it's very bad for our country.""
Hunter Biden was convicted in June on charges of lying about his use of illegal narcotics while purchasing a firearm in 2018. He then pleaded guilty to all nine federal tax charges in early September, the day that jury selection was set to begin.
Before ending his bid for reelection, President Biden repeatedly said he would not pardon or commute any sentence for Hunter.
Trump was convicted on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in May. His sentencing is set for Nov. 26, three weeks after the election. Democrat nominee Kamala Harris was asked this week if she would consider pardoning Trump if she won the presidency.
""I'm not going to get into those hypotheticals,"" Harris told NBC News. ""I'm focused on the next 14 days.""
Trump also faces two federal indictments issued by Department of Justice special counsel Jack Smith, one for allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 election results and another over the handling of presidential documents, some deemed classified, at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. The documents case was tossed by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, but Smith is appealing the decision.
Trump told Hewitt he would fire Smith ""in 2 seconds"" if he wins the election but said he doesn't think he would get impeached for it.
""No, I don't think they'll impeach me if I fire Jack Smith,"" he said. ""Jack Smith is a scoundrel. He's a very dishonest man, in my opinion, very dishonest man. And he's a mean man. [B]ut his problem is, he's so mean that he always goes too far like the raid of Mar-A-Lago.""
Trump was referring to FBI agents searching his Palm Beach, Florida, estate at the outset of Smith's classified documents investigation in August 2022.

News Max,Man Arrested Near Trump Rally Denies Assassination Plot,"The man arrested on gun charges near Donald Trump's Coachella rally on Saturday denied he was trying to assassinate the Republican presidential nominee.
Vem Miller, 49, was stopped half a mile from the Indio, California, rally entrance and ""was found to be illegally in possession of a shotgun, a loaded handgun, and a high-capacity magazine,"" as well as fake press and VIP passes, according to the Riverside County Sheriff's Office.
""I truly do believe we prevented another assassination attempt,"" Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco told reporters Sunday, the New York Post reported.
Trump has survived two assassination attempts in recent months.
Miller, though, told Fox News Digital he's ""100% a Trump supporter"" and had no plans to harm the former president. He also said he reported the guns to authorities at the checkpoint and insisted the documents Riverside Bianco said were fake are legit.
Miller quickly released on $5,000 bail and no federal charges have been filed.
""I always travel around with my firearms in the back of my truck,"" Miller told the outlet in a phone interview.
""I've literally never even shot a gun in my life. … I don't know anything about guns. I am beyond a novice.""
Miller said he bought the guns after receiving threats due to launching the America Happens Network to combat ""censorship"" in the media.
A one-time Democrat and Barack Obama supporter, Miller said, ""I'm certainly more Republican now,"" and fully backs Trump.
""This is a man that I deeply admire, because I was a closet individual in terms of my beliefs, because I worked in Hollywood. As my politics started to change, I realized that Hollywood is a homogenous community,"" Miller told Fox News Digital.
He also discussed Bianco's statement that Miller's license plate is ""one that is homemade and indicative of a group of individuals that claim to be sovereign citizens.""
""That's a nonsensical statement,"" said Miller, who added he doesn't support the sovereign citizen movement and is not a part of it or any other anti-government groups.
""I don't think there's such a thing,"" he says, adding that the two terms don't make any sense together.
Mindy Robinson, a conservative activist and friend of Miller, said police acted ""hysterically"" in arresting the Las Vegas, Nevada, man.
""The fact he's out on $5,000 bail proves they know he's not a threat; they're just mad they're about to have a lot of egg on their face for running with this as hysterically as they did,"" Robinson told Newsweek.
Miller said he's considering suing over defamatory statements and alleged police infringement of his rights, journalist Kyle Becker posted on X.

News Max,Michigan's Bloated Voter Rolls Under Microscope as Election Looms,"Michigan’s voter rolls are under scrutiny less than three weeks from the Nov. 5 election, following a report the state has 500,000 more registered voters than people old enough to vote. The discrepancy has led to concerns about election integrity.
The Republican National Committee filed a lawsuit in March after finding that 53 Michigan counties had registration rates of 100% or higher based on U.S. Census data.
Attorneys for the RNC wrote: “These voter registration rates are abnormally or, in the case of counties with greater than 100% registration, impossibly high.” While the lawsuit did not allege fraud, it argued the inflated rolls increase the opportunity for it. The suit also claims that inflated rolls cause political parties to spend more money on mailers and other voter outreach.
Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat who’s been named in several lawsuits, maintains the state is in compliance with federal law and that the lawsuits are part of a broader effort to undermine confidence in the election process.
A spokeswoman for Benson said the legal complaints are an effort to “lay the groundwork to overturn the results of the election if they don’t like them.”
Secretaries of state are required by law to maintain clean voter rolls by removing people who have died, moved, been convicted of a felony, or have otherwise become ineligible to vote.
Benson’s office has removed approximately 800,000 voters since 2019 and plans to remove another 360,000 in 2025. Still, more than 200,000 new voters have registered since the RNC lawsuit was filed, further complicating the issue.

News Max,Trump Ribs Schumer: He'll Bring Back Biden if Polls Worsen,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump elicited laughs out of Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., saying the Senate majority leader was the one responsible for kicking President Joe Biden out of the presidential race but will be the one to bring him back if Vice President Kamala Harris' polling gets any worse.
Trump made the comments at the Al Smith Dinner on Thursday night in Manhattan, a white-tie charity event skipped by Harris.
""If she does any worse in the polls, they're going to bring [Biden] back again, I think,"" Trump said during his roast. ""Chuck, he's going to do it,"" Trump said, pointing to the senator, who was seated directly to Trump's left during his speech.
""He's the one that got [Biden] out. That's the guy. Much more so than crazy [Rep.] Nancy [Pelosi] I will tell you, because I know him. He did it,"" getting a chuckle and an eyebrow raise out of Schumer.
Trump also needled Schumer on the name of his political party.
""But many of you are Manhattan liberals from the media and the Democrat Party. I always say the Democrat. You know, Chuck doesn't like that. He likes Democratic,"" Trump said. ""And it sounds much more beautiful: the Democratic Party. I always say the Democrat Party because it sounds worse. And it's true.
""He likes Democratic. Why don't they just change the name this way? You know, it is Democrat,"" Trump said, again getting a laugh out of Schumer.

News Max,Acting Director Rowe: Secret Service 'Not Waiting to Act',"The Secret Service is ""not waiting to act"" and has already ""significantly improved our readiness, operational, and organizational communications and implemented enhanced protective operations for the former president and other protectees,"" Acting Director Ronald Rowe said Thursday.
He was responding to an independent panel's assessment that the agency needs ""fundamental reform"" and that ""another Butler can and will happen again"" without major changes in how candidates are protected.
The review faulted the Secret Service for poor communications that day and failing to secure the building where the gunman took his shots on former President Donald Trump. It also found more systemic issues at the agency such as a failure to understand the unique risks facing Trump and a culture of doing ""more with less.""
Rowe said the Secret Service is ""making changes to better integrate with our state and local law enforcement partners and augmenting our protection with support from the U.S. Department of Defense and other agencies.""
""Additionally, we are developing a comprehensive plan aimed at driving a fundamental transformation within the Secret Service to ensure we are appropriately configured to execute our dual integrated mission of protection and complex investigations,"" he added.
""This plan focuses on increasing and retaining the agency's personnel, modernizing our technology, and building a training plan that is sustainable now and into the future. We acknowledge that July 13 did not occur because of a lack of resources; however, our enhanced protective model implemented after July 13 requires additional people, equipment, and asset capabilities. The agency is also working with Congress to increase the agency's budget so that we can make this paradigm shift a reality and ensure that our people have the resources they need to successfully carry out the mission.""
One rallygoer was killed and two others wounded when Thomas Matthew Crooks climbed onto the roof of a nearby building and opened fire as Trump spoke. The former president was wounded in the ear before being rushed off the stage by Secret Service agents. That shooting, along with another incident in Florida when Trump was golfing — a gunman there never got a line of site on the president or fired a shot — has led to a crisis in confidence in the agency.
The report by a panel of four former law enforcement officials from national and state government follows investigations by members of Congress, the agency's own investigators and by Homeland Security's oversight body.
Information from The Associated Press was used in this report.

News Max,Trump to Newsmax: Why Haven't They Opened Assassin Phones?,"The Biden administration's FBI is not probing the assassination attempts with the same vigor and curiosity it had with the weaponized Jan. 6 Capitol protest, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump told Newsmax.
""It's a heavy, heavy deal, assassination, and I ask why didn't they open up the apps,"" Trump told Chris Salcedo in an exclusive, 26-minute sit-down interview Saturday. ""You know, they have three apps. The first one had three apps and the second one, I think, had six phones. That's a little unusual.
""And why haven't they been opened up? Why haven't they opened up? They opened them up for J6. Why haven't they opened up the phones?""
Trump dodged assassination in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13 with a slight head turn to the left, and the bolstered and on-alert Secret Service scouted out a would-be assassin with an AK-47-style rifle at his South Florida golf course in September.
The fact the would-be assassins had encrypted apps on their phones is disconcerting to Trump, who had been publicly targeted by Iranians for assassination – eerily in a social media video while golfing – for retaliation for having taken out the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps QUDs Force Commander Qasem Soleimani.
""Some were foreign oriented, and they haven't been able to open them up, so why?"" Trump asked.
""They opened them up on J6, I think, pretty much, right?
""They got, they had no problem doing that, so.""
It is proof positive of corruption in the Biden administration and the Deep State, according to Trump, who has been long skeptical, if not outright critical, of the weaponization of justice and government against President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the chief political opponent.
""Look, we have a very corrupt country, and we're going to straighten it out,"" Trump said. ""The radical left, what they've done to our country is incredible – what Biden has done, and now, I say Kamala.""
And the Harris-adoring media might be complicit in ""election interference,"" Trump concluded, pointing to the lack of a mention of it in the lone debate on ABC News last month.
""I want to bring up assassination but now that you mention it and other people have mentioned it: Probably should have been brought up,"" in the debate, Trump said.
""It's a big thing. They play it down.""
Trump has noted the July 13 assassination has broken the Democrats' ""threat to democracy"" narrative from Jan. 6, 2021, because Trump asked, ""what did I do for democracy?"" and answered: ""I took a bullet for democracy.""

News Max,Pollster Nate Silver: Presidential Race 'Literally 50/50',"The presidential race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris remains a toss-up, according to Democrat election forecaster Nate Silver.
The latest Silver Bulletin numbers show Vice President Harris with 49.3% national support compared to former President Trump's 46.5%.
""After another day of polls showing an essentially tied race in the Midwestern battlegrounds, it's now literally 50/50. We're just not seeing as many Harris +3 type numbers in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania as we did immediately after the debate,"" Silver posted Tuesday afternoon on his website.
""It hasn't been a huge swing, but even a half point to a point makes a difference.""
Silver's forecast model shows Trump ahead in the battleground states of Arizona (plus 1.6 percentage points), Georgia (plus-0.9), North Carolina (plus-0.8), and Harris leading in Michigan (plus-1.0), Nevada (plus-0.8), Pennsylvania (plus-0.6), and Wisconsin (plus-0.8).
Although his latest forecasts showed Harris narrowly on track to capture enough Electoral College votes to win the election, Silver in late September said he believed the vice president's campaign should be nervous about Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, Newsweek reported.
Last week, Silver said the presidential race likely would continue to be a toss-up until voters go to the polls on Nov. 5.
""I've never seen an election in which the forecast spent more time in the vicinity of 50/50, and I probably never will,"" Silver wrote, adding that there were a few instances in the past few months where it appeared that the election was swinging in one direction, ""but they proved to be false starts.""
Last week, Silver questioned Harris' choice of Minnesota Democrat Gov. Tim Walz to be her running mate in this year's election.
Silver, who previously said he intends to vote for Harris in November, admitted, ""I'm not into Tim Walz"" during the Oct. 9 episode of Risky Business, the podcast he hosts with Maria Konnikova.
The pollster said he would have preferred Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro with Harris on the Democrat national ticket.

News Max,Russians Made Fake Video of Mail-In Ballots for Trump Being Destroyed: FBI,"Russian actors were behind a widely circulated video falsely depicting mail-in ballots for Donald Trump being destroyed in Pennsylvania, U.S. officials confirmed on Friday.
The video had taken off on social media Thursday but was debunked within three hours by local election officials and law enforcement after members of the public reported it.
U.S. officials said in a statement sent by the FBI that they believe the video was “manufactured and amplified” by Russian actors. The officials said it’s part of “Moscow’s broader effort to raise unfounded questions about the integrity of the U.S. election and stoke divisions among Americans.”
The information was released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.
The Bucks County Board of Elections had identified the video as fake on Thursday, saying the envelope and other materials in the video “are clearly not authentic materials belonging to or distributed by"" the board.all content.

Vance accused President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris of ordering the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to focus on helping illegal aliens more than U.S. citizens.
Vance wrote an opinion column for The Wall Street Journal on Tuesday, when then-Category 5 Hurricane Milton was headed toward Florida. The Ohio senator detailed his criticisms of the Biden-Harris administration regarding both its response to Hurricane Helene and FEMA.
""During times of crisis and war, presidential leadership is critical to cut through competing bureaucratic fiefs and protect Americans from death and devastation,"" Vance began his column. ""The Biden-Harris response to Hurricane Helene, the deadliest storm since Katrina, has the people of the Southeast and especially Appalachia paying an extraordinary price for the administration's incompetence.""
Former President Donald Trump's running mate this year then described how Biden, Harris, the Democrat presidential candidate, and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas did not prioritize helping hurricane victims in the days Helene approached the U.S. and after it made landfall on Sept. 26.
""While Ms. Harris and Mr. Biden flouted their duties, a bureaucratic bottleneck was delaying the deployment of active-duty military personnel to the western mountains of North Carolina,"" Vance said.
The senator added that by the evening of Oct. 4, fewer than half of the 1,000 troops authorized to deploy to the hurricane response zone were conducting operations and deployed to Western North Carolina.
It wasn't until North Carolina Republican Sens. Ted Budd and Thom Tillis issued a joint statement on Oct. 4 calling for ""an active-duty military leader who has extensive experience with operations of this magnitude to lead moving forward"" that the administration upped its response.
""In disaster response, every second counts,"" Vance wrote. ""A week went by while the citizens of North Carolina suffered without the equipment and soldiers needed to save lives and begin recovery. This is the sort of bureaucratic hiccup that engaged political leaders solve. A competent leader would have ordered those men and women into motion earlier, bureaucracy be damned. Ms. Harris and Mr. Biden treated the situation like a public-relations disaster instead of a real one.
""Even the Obama administration was better at deploying assets in disaster zones.""
Later in the column, after complimenting FEMA staff for ""working hard,"" Vance said the agency has ""been the victim of misplaced Biden-Harris political priorities.""
""Under Ms. Harris and Mr. Biden, FEMA has funneled millions of dollars to nongovernmental organizations whose stated goal is facilitating mass migration into the U.S.,"" he wrote.
""The effort stems from a White House directive to reorient FEMA's institutional focus away from U.S. citizens and toward aliens who either have no legal right to be here or whose legal status depends on the say-so of the Biden-Harris administration.""
Vance added that politics also have contributed to other FEMA actions.
""FEMA even seems to be picking winners and losers among the American people,"" he wrote. ""In March 2023, FEMA hosted a panel titled 'Helping the LGBTQI+ Community Before Disasters: Preparedness and Mitigation Considerations.' Ordinary Americans of all backgrounds know that especially when it comes to disaster relief, federal agencies exist to serve all Americans, not to give some groups special treatment.""

News Max,Trump on Tariffs: 'Beautiful' Way to Boost Economy,"Former President Donald Trump, in an interview with members of the Economic Club of Chicago on Tuesday, argued that his plans for higher tariffs for foreign manufacturers, combined with other plans including tax cuts, will return the United States to prosperity, despite claims from a bipartisan group that said his proposals would add $7.5 trillion to the U.S. debt.
""To me, the most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff,"" Trump told his interviewer, Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait. ""It's my favorite word.""
That's because stiff tariffs on foreign manufacturers wanting to sell goods in the U.S. will boost U.S. manufacturing, Trump said.
""We will bring the companies back,"" he said. ""We will lower taxes further for companies that will make their product in the USA. We will protect those companies with strong tariffs because I am a believer in tariffs. I am not sure you are. I don't think you are.""
Micklethwait pointed out that the bipartisan Peterson Institute has said Trump's tariffs plan will bring in just $200 billion, but Trump argued that he was just getting started on imposing tariffs when he was president when the COVID-19 pandemic began.
""Tariffs are two things,"" he said. ""No. 1, it is for protection of the companies we have here and, the new companies that will move in. We will have thousands of companies coming into the country ... we won't have somebody undercut them.""
Trump pointed to Detroit as an example of his plan.
""We have been talking about Detroit coming back for 40 years, and it has never come back and it is very dependent on the car industry,"" he said. ""They have lost 60% of their business over a long period of time.""
He also rejected an argument that his plan for tariffs would plunge the U.S. into a trade war.
""All you have to do is build your plant in the U.S., and there are no tariffs,"" Trump said.
Meanwhile, he said other countries, including China and India, as well as the European Union, are tough on U.S. sales.
""They don't want anything from us,"" Trump said. ""We have deficits that are crazy. We won't have them anymore. We will put tariffs on them ... the higher the tariff, the more likely it is the country will come into the United States and build a factory in the United States so it doesn't have to pay the tariff.""
Trump also argued that his tariffs kept foreign countries from dumping substandard steel into the U.S.
""China, as you remember, was dumping steel at levels nobody had seen before and I put a 50% tax on that,"" he said. ""It was what they called dirty steel, not good steel, a bad thing for structural components of buildings and things like that. They were dumping crap into our country. I raised it to 50% [tariffs] and they stopped dumping steel. I saved our steel.""
Trump also argued that tariffs will also help with foreign policy, and said U.S. allies have taken more advantage of American industry than ""our enemies.""
""Our allies are the European Union,"" he said. ""We have a trade deficit of $300 billion dollars with the European Union. Our allies are Japan.""
He described the late President Shinzo Abe, who was assassinated, as a ""great friend of mine,"" who questioned why the U.S. was not negotiating with Japan.
""I renegotiated a whole trade deal from a little bit of a disadvantage because I was stuck with a bad deal,"" Trump said. ""We have the worst trade deals all over the world.""

News Max,"Trump to Bloomberg: Pa., Mich., Focus on Election Night","Former President Donald Trump told Bloomberg Television on Tuesday that on election night, he will be focused on Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Arizona.
Speaking to Bloomberg News' Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait at the Economic Club of Chicago, Trump touched on a variety of economic issues including, tariffs, trade, the national debt, and immigration. Micklethwait closed the conversation by asking Trump, ""On election night, which state would you look at first? Which state do you think this race is gonna be decided by?""
Trump said his top priority is the Keystone State.
""Pennsylvania, I would say mostly,"" he said. ""I think we're doing very well there. I think you look at Michigan, too.""
The former president noted that although polls can be useful, in many states voting has already started so the campaign is able to see that as ""a pretty good indication.""
""Based on the votes that are coming in so far we are doing well,"" he said. ""We're way up in Pennsylvania, we're up in Michigan, we're doing very well in Arizona. In fact, someone said they [the Harris campaign] are going to pull the plug in Arizona. They're gonna give it up because we're quite a ways ahead.""
Trump closed by saying the Republican Party is now the ""party of common sense. Forget about conservative, liberal. We need border, we need fair elections, we don't want men playing in women's sports, we don't want transgender operations without parental consent.""
Micklethwait noted at the outset that Vice President Kamala Harris was invited to speak to Bloomberg on the topic of economics but declined.

News Max,NY Times/Siena Poll: Harris Leads Trump by 3 Points,"Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris leads Republican Donald Trump by 3 points head to head nationally, four weeks away from Election Day, according to the latest New York Times/Siena College poll released Tuesday.
Harris leads Trump 49% to 46%, with 5% refusing to answer or responding ""don't know.""
It's the first time Harris has led in the poll since becoming the Democrat nominee in July, according to the Times. Trump and Harris were tied at 47% each in the NYT/Siena survey in mid-September.
Among independents, however, Trump leads Harris 48% to 47%, according to the poll results. Harris, meanwhile, pulls in 9% of those surveyed identifying as Republican.
Harris also owns a 3-point lead over Trump in a multicandidate field, 47% to 44%, according to the survey. The NYT/Siena poll is in line with the RealClearPolitics national polling average, which shows Harris with a 2-point lead on Tuesday.
In the NYT/Siena poll, Trump leads Harris on the issue of the economy, the No. 1 issue among those surveyed.
Nearly half of those surveyed (47%) said the country's current economic conditions are ""poor,"" and nearly one-third (28%) said the economy was their No. 1 issue in next month's election, more than double the second-biggest issue, abortion (14%), according to the poll.
To that end, Trump leads Harris 48% to 46% as the candidate who would ""do a better job of handling the issue you think is most important,"" according to the survey.
Despite a 3½-year run as vice president in the Biden administration, Harris leads Trump on a question of being the change candidate, 46% to 44%, according to the survey. However, Trump leads Harris 48% to 45% on the question of being a ""strong leader.""
The New York Times/Siena College nationwide poll of 3,385 likely voters was conducted from Sept. 29 to Oct. 6. The margin of sampling error is +/- 2.4 percentage points.
