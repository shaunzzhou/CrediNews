The Daily Caller,‘Unacceptable’: County Fires Election Worker After Republican Spots Ballot Security Lapse In Realtime,"Hennepin County, Minnesota, fired an election worker who left several boxes of mail-in ballots unattended after a local GOP group exposed the alleged negligence, according to a statement from county officials released Friday.
Minnesota Senate District 50 Republicans — the Republican Party’s official political unit for portions of Minnesota cities Edina and Bloomington — snapped a photo outside of Edina City Hall Friday showing a courier vehicle’s “rear door ajar with ballot transfer cases inside.” A review of parking lot surveillance footage found the ballots were not tampered with, and a comparison of the votes with the statewide voter registration system for absentee ballots found a perfect match.

“Hennepin County acknowledges that this lapse in protocol occurred, should not have happened, and is unacceptable,” the county’s statement reads. “Corrective actions have been taken by the county and its courier to prevent any recurrence. The county has confirmed the driver has been terminated.”

Mail-in voting began in early September, with over 17 million Americans having already voted as of Monday. Critics of mail-in voting have raised concern regarding ballot delivery, with the National Association of State Election Directors and other officials writing a letter to the U.S. Postal Service Postmaster in September flagging potential challenges such as processing delays, lost or delayed election mail and insufficient training.
“Election security is of utmost importance, and leaving ballots unattended is simply unacceptable,” Hennepin County Auditor Daniel Rogan said in the county’s statement regarding Friday’s incident. “Hennepin County is reinforcing its transfer protocols with county staff and vendors. An incident like this underscores the value of strong chain-of-custody processes, so that risk can be addressed and integrity can be verified.”
Hennepin County and the Minnesota Senate District 50 Republicans did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The Daily Caller,Bill Clinton Calls Kari Lake ‘Physically Attractive’ During Rally For ‘Extremely Vulnerable’ Harris,"Former President Bill Clinton called Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake “physically attractive” while at a Thursday rally for Vice President Kamala Harris in Arizona.
Lake is running against Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego of Arizona to fill the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. Clinton noted that voters felt that Harris “just showed up” after President Joe Biden announced he would not seek reelection. (RELATED: NY Times Poll Shows Harris’ Support Among Key Voter Bloc In ‘Dangerously Low Territory’)
WATCH:
“About 45% of the people think he can do no wrong, and they don’t care if we save our democracy or not. So there is a sliver there that has to make up their mind. And to them, Kamala Harris just showed up,” Clinton said regarding former President Donald Trump. “I mean, she was there as vice president, and what they think of her largely depends on what they think of President Biden. But she is extremely vulnerable, more vulnerable than she deserves to be, through crazy attacks.”
Harris leads Trump by 0.2% in the RealClearPolling average of polls from Oct. 8 to 22, with the gap increasing to 0.6% when Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein, independent candidate Cornel West and Libertarian candidate Chase Oliver are included in surveys.
Clinton also took aim at Lake during the event, who narrowly lost the 2022 gubernatorial race in Arizona.
WATCH:
“You got a person that grew up under sometimes challenging circumstances, who made something of his life running against someone who is physically attractive, but believes that politics is a performance art,” Clinton said. (Watch The Daily Caller Documentary “Rigged”)
Gallego leads Lake by 6.1% in the RealClearPolling average for the Senate race, while Harris trails Trump in Arizona by 1.5% according to RealClearPolling.

The Daily Caller,‘Daddy Was A Member Of Hezbollah’: Dem Senator Claps Back At NYT Reporter Over Question On Israel’s War Against Terror,"Democratic Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman clapped back at New York Times (NYT) reporter Lulu Garcia-Navarro over a question on Israel’s war against terror in an interview released Saturday.
Garcia-Navarro poked at Fetterman’s unwavering support for Israel following the deadly Oct. 7, 2023 attack by Islamic terror group Hamas with a slew of questions. The Democratic senator remained consistent when pressed about Israel’s exploding pager attack of mid-September which targeted Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon.
Fetterman told the NYT reporter he “absolutely” does support Israel’s pager attack despite the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh chapters of the Council on American Islamic Relations condemning him in a joint statement issued in late September. (RELATED: Democratic Senator Marvels That Trump Support In Key Battleground State Is ‘Astonishing’)
“They said, ‘When our elected officials start condoning the civilian loss of life, our collective moral compass is irreparably harmed,’” Garcia-Navarro said.
“It was targeted for members of Hezbollah. You know, no one uses beepers in that situation other than they were a member of Hezbollah,” Fetterman countered.
“There was a young child who was killed,” the NYT reporter said.
“Unfortunately, tragically, because daddy was a member of Hezbollah,” Fetterman responded. “He brought that danger and evil into their home. And that’s what tragically resulted in that poor child’s death.”
“That’s what’s so terrible. She paid the price because her father was a terrorist for Hezbollah,” he added.
Garcia-Navarro asked Fetterman earlier if he thinks Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is working to help elect Trump, which the Democratic senator said he does not believe.
“I don’t believe that. I don’t. And if you think that might be, I don’t know why it’s helpful to say that publicly,” Fetterman said. “I have to believe all of those college protesting and a lot of those other things, they would give Hamas opportunity to rejoice a lot of this division. But now there’s not much left of them anymore to celebrate.”",2024-10-27
The Daily Caller,‘It’s Not True’: CNN Fact-Checker Scolds Walz For Latest Whopper On Trump’s Jobs Record,"CNN fact-checker Daniel Dale asserted Tuesday that Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota falsely claimed that former President Donald Trump set a record for lost manufacturing jobs.
Walz claimed that Trump set a record for the most manufacturing job losses during his administration in a Monday appearance on “The View,” where he also took aim at Republican Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, alleging that Vance and Trump were “venture capitalists” who helped ship jobs overseas. Dale contested Walz’s point and pointed out that job losses under Trump were due to the COVID-19 pandemic. (RELATED: Self-Proclaimed Firearm Enthusiast Tim Walz Struggles To Load $2100 Shotgun During Hunting Trip)
“If you’re going to say something is simply factual, it should be factual. This is not. It’s not true that the Trump presidency lost more manufacturing jobs than any other presidency,” Dale told “CNN News Central” host Kate Bolduan. “Under George W. Bush, there were about 4.5 million manufacturing jobs lost. Under Trump, it was about 178,000. But there are also more manufacturing jobs lost than under Trump: under Eisenhower, under Ford, under Reagan. So Trump does not have the record.”
WATCH:
“I think it’s also worth pointing out for context that these Trump job losses in manufacturing overwhelmingly occurred because of the COVID pandemic,” Dale continued. “Pre-pandemic, under Trump, there was a gain of about 414,000 manufacturing jobs. Again, he ended a negative 178,000, but that was largely because we had a pandemic-related crash.”
Walz has made numerous claims that haven’t borne scrutiny since Vice President Kamala Harris announced him as her running mate on Aug. 6. He has also come under fire after claiming he was in Hong Kong during the June 1989 massacre or protesters in Tiananmen Square during the Oct. 1 vice presidential debate against Republican Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio.
Vance accused Walz of “stolen valor” in an Aug. 7 campaign event, citing comments about gun control Walz made in a video posted on X by the Harris-Walz campaign. Walz also faced questions about the timing of his 2005 retirement in regards to the war in Iraq from the Minnesota National Guard that arose after a 2018 Facebook post by retired Army Command Sergeant Major Thomas Behrends resurfaced.

The Daily Caller,High Number Of Liberal Men Admit What We Knew All Along,"Liberal men are finally admitting what we knew all along: they are more feminine than conservatives.
Pew Research conducted a fascinating report earlier in October on masculinity in America, surveying over 6,000 adults about whether they identify as more feminine or masculine, which male behaviors should be considered socially acceptable, and how men have fared in modern society compared to women. In an interesting nugget, Pew found that fewer Democratic men, 29%, rate themselves as “highly masculine” compared to Republican men, 53%.
The results aren’t shocking. Liberal men lean more feminine, while conservatives lean more masculine. Sometimes, I wonder if liberal women, who I presume are dating liberal men, attack traditional masculinity because they are jealous that their boyfriends or husbands are not as masculine as they want them to be and that they are unable to attract a typically masculine man. Perhaps? Perhaps the lady doth protest too much?
As a general observation about masculinity in America, I think both the left (in nearly 95% of instances) and the right (sometimes, but not always) offer twisted views about what it means to be a man. The left makes traditional masculinity a toxic problem that needs to be corrected with the proper feminist coding. What this means is to deny your biological hardwiring as a man and try to be more feminine and overly sensitive, which leads nowhere good.
Meanwhile, the right sometimes offers a kooky, childish version of masculinity in response to the left. For example, it’s manly to eat red meat all the time, for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and use red-light therapy on your testicles. No, that’s not masculine at all, that’s just stupid and absurd. You’ll end up keeling over from a heart attack before you’re 60 and will have zero swimmers by the time you turn 35.
Both fringes can offer utter delusions, which is why, dear reader, you should consider signing up for my newsletter, Mr. Right. (Click HERE to sign up for Mr. Right’s weekly newsletter)
Something else of note from the Pew survey: almost everyone agrees women are doing better than men.
“Most Americans say women are doing better than they were 20 years ago when it comes to getting leadership positions at work, getting a well-paying job, and getting into a college or university,” Pew reported.
For all the hyperventilating about Republican politicians trying to steal away women’s rights, it seems like liberal women have never had it better.",2024-11-01
The Daily Caller,ROOKE: Harris World Should Keep Panicking. She’s Floundering In Only Election Metric That Matters,"While much has been made about 2024 election polling, the only data that truly matters in the presidential race is already looking good for Republicans.
When the Daily Caller asked Harris’ rally attendees how they felt about the 2024 elections, many said they were worried Harris would lose to Trump.
“I’m very nervous, honestly. I think Trump might win. I don’t know,” one female student from Maryland told the Daily Caller as her friend nodded in agreement.
NEW: At Harris’ closing argument the joy was high. But even at a high-energy, packed rally, some of her supporters expressed a sense of nervousness about what would happen Nov. 5 and beyond.
“I think Trump might win.”

Anything can happen between now and Nov. 5. There is no way to accurately predict who will win the presidential election. Early voting results are positive for Republicans, however, which should scare Vice President Kamala Harris and her supporters.
Traditionally, Democrats lead in early voting, but the 2024 early voting data in critical states like Pennsylvania, Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina, Georgia and Michigan show just how far Republicans have come in those states.
In 2020, Democrats held a 1.1 million-vote lead in Pennsylvania, creating a massive firewall for former President Donald Trump and other Republican candidates to overcome. Republicans drastically cut that lead in 2024. The most recent early voting results show that 57% of Democrats voted in 2024 so far, casting around 894,400 ballots, according to L2 DataMapping. For Republicans, close to 33% have voted, with 515,900 votes. (Democrats Working Overtime To Turn Election Conspiracies Into Reality)
PA Ballots RETURNED:
Dems: 947,214 (56.1%) +29,318 from 10.31
GOP: 553,158 (32.8%) +23,072 from 10.31

GOP: +289,508
Dem: +89,934Change from end of 2020:
GOP: -65,080
Dem: -771,512 https://t.co/5BM9ydBA0y pic.twitter.com/IuZxdf6F1V— Ryan James Girdusky (@RyanGirdusky) November 1, 2024
This gives Democrats just a 378,500 vote lead over Republicans, which means Democrats’ lead is down by 621,5000 votes compared to 2020. Harris won’t have the million-vote firewall that Biden had in 2020 going into Election Day.
The reason Democrats’ numbers are down in Pennsylvania is two-fold. Not only is Philadelphia underperforming for Democrats compared to 2020, but Republicans have successfully flipped five counties red in terms of voter registration, including Bucks and Luzerne County.
Republicans are currently outvoting Democrats in Arizona by 118,200 votes. In 2024, 42% of Republicans cast 672,100 ballots, while only 35% of Democrats cast 553,900 votes. Arizona’s early voting data from 2020 showed a much closer race between Democrats and Republicans. In 2020, Democrats cast 923,805 ballots, with Republicans casting 914,172 votes. Voters gave Democrats a 9,633 vote lead at this same time four years ago. Because Republicans have a much larger lead than Democrats did four years ago, Harris has an uphill climb in Arizona compared to Biden, who beat Trump by just 10,457 votes in 2020.

Democrats are also losing the early voting race in Nevada. Republicans hold a 12,800-vote lead over Democrats in the state, with 241,800 votes cast compared to Democrats’ 229,000. Compared to 2020, Democrats had a 47,000-vote lead during early voting. This marks a 53,000-vote swing to Republicans in four years.
North Carolina voters tend not to wait until Election Day to vote. In 2020, Democrats held a 260,112 vote lead over Republicans heading into Election Day. In 2024, Republicans are outvoting Democrats by 100,000 votes. Harris hoped to flip North Carolina blue in 2024 despite knowing that Trump won the state in 2016 and 2020. The early voting results indicate that he will likely win North Carolina again. (ROOKE: Republicans’ Latest Swing State Win Is The Last Thing Democrats Want Right Now)

Georgia, a critical swing state, set a record for early voting in 2024 by reaching 50% turnout Thursday. It’s harder to break down the state’s early vote records for 2020 because the data by party is hard to find. Biden, however, won Georgia by just 11,779 votes. In 2024, early voter data shows Democrats have an advantage going into Election Day, but it likely won’t be long-lived.
While female voters in Georgia are surging in early voter turnout, which is good for Harris, so are voters age 65 and older who typically vote Republican. Democrats currently have a 100,000-vote lead in early voting. Still, Republicans tend to capture most of Election Day votes, allowing Trump to close this gap as Republicans have more registered voters than Democrats in Georgia.

Michigan will likely be the closest swing state contest between Trump and Harris. It’s not a sure win for Harris, however. While Democrats have more registered voters in the state, they have just around a 200,000-vote lead over Republicans in early voting results. Democrats cast 1.3 million votes in 2020, compared to Republicans’ 1.1 million.
Unlike in 2020, Harris is not enjoying a cushy vote lead in several swing states going into Election Day, where Republicans tend to outvote Democrats. While polling can fluctuate, the only data that can accurately portray whether Harris or Trump will win is actual votes tallied. And right now, Harris is struggling in the states she needs to win Nov. 5.",2024-11-01
The Daily Caller,"Woman Rips Off Clothes, Casts Vote In Bra After Being Confronted Over New Jersey Anti-Electioneering Law","A woman in New Jersey ripped off her clothes before casting her vote in her bra on Oct. 26 after an election official confronted her over her attire supporting 2024 Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, NJ Advance Media reported.
The voter in Hamilton Township, who arrived at her polling station on the Garden State’s first day of in-person early voting wearing a Trump t-shirt and a MAGA hat, became agitated when poll workers informed her attire promoting political candidates was prohibited, according to NJ Advance Media.
That’s what’s up.

The unidentified voter took off her shirt in front of a long line of voters in the Colonial Fire House, flung the shirt around and, after being confronted, hastily voted after hurling “nasty” names at election workers, Mercer County Board of Elections Chairwoman Jill Moyer claimed to the outlet.
“I asked her to remove her hat and said, ‘If you want to go get a jacket from your car, I will hold your place in line or you could go into the bathroom to turn the shirt inside out,'” Moyer said. “Before I could get it all out, she took off her shirt and flung it around.”
New Jersey law states people are not allowed to “distribute or display any circular or printed matter or offer any suggestion or solicit any support for any candidate, party or public question within the polling place or room or within a distance of 100 feet of the outside entrance to such polling place or room, or within 100 feet of a ballot drop box in use during the conduct of an election.”
The shirtless woman left the building as police were being called, Moyer told the outlet. (RELATED: REPORT: Police Catch, Charge Man For Throwing Offensive Flyers Into Trump Supporters’ Yards)
Another witness who captured a photo of the apparently topless Trump supporter said she put her shirt back on inside-out and donned her MAGA hat before leaving.
“She gave the finger and said, ‘Suck my c**t,'” a witness said, according to the New York Post.
“I felt so bad for (the poll workers). They’re just trying to do their jobs and people are saying this god-awful stuff,” the witness added, according to NJ Advance Media.

The Daily Caller,CNN Host Asks The Obvious Question About Swalwell’s Mixed Message On Trump,"CNN host John Berman asked Democratic Rep. Eric Swalwell of California Friday if his claims of former President Donald Trump showing “cognitive dissonance” interfered with other talking points.
Vice President Kamala Harris used a Wednesday press conference to highlight claims from a report in The Atlantic claiming that former President Donald Trump expressed a desire for generals like those who served under German dictator Adolf Hitler. Berman played a clip from an ad Swalwell’s campaign aired that argued Trump should be placed in a nursing home. (RELATED: ‘I’ve Heard It All Before’: Scott Jennings Lists Republicans Who Democrats Compared To Hitler In The Past)
“So what’s the goal here?” Berman asked Swalwell during “CNN News Central. “And I ask that because there seems to be a little bit of a mixed message in this case. You are, I think, making fun of Donald Trump, it is safe to say in this case, yet there is a message from some Democrats, including the candidate, that he is an existential threat to democracy.”
WATCH:
“John, he’s also in cognitive decline. And that ad, Donald Trump makes it a little too on the nose, the way that he’s acted in the last week, standing almost completely frozen on stage for nearly 30 minutes,” Swalwell claimed. “He’s almost 80 years old. He continues to talk about completely irrelevant material when he’s talking to his supporters. And so the argument is, you may like Donald Trump, he may appeal to you in some ways with his policies, but the last place we want to put him is at the White House, where he can make decisions about our lives. He’s just not ready for prime time. And yes, humor, I think, sometimes is the best way to land a point.”
Swalwell then turned back to the claims from the article in The Atlantic.
“But his default, and if you do believe that folks will regress to the mean, his default, of course, is a fascist-like tendency during the time that he can have a cognitive ability. And that’s not an accusation that I’m making,” Swalwell maintained. “That’s an accusation that comes from people who have worked for him at the most senior levels.”
Trump and Harris are tied in the RealClearPolling average of polls from Oct. 11 to 24 in a head-to-head matchup and remain deadlocked when Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein, independent candidate Cornel West and Libertarian candidate Chase Oliver are included in surveys. (Watch The Daily Caller Documentary “Cleaning Up Kamala”)
“But do you see what I’m saying — that there may be some cognitive dissonance between making a joke about Donald Trump like that and saying he is a fascist?” Berman asked. “The two things seem a little bit separate.”

The Daily Caller,‘Going Down?’: Top Democrats Reportedly Anxious About Harris’ Election Chances,"Top Democrats are worried about Vice President Kamala Harris’ chances Nov. 5 while most polls have the presidential race locked in a dead heat, according to Axios.
Less than two weeks to go, top Democrats are already discussing who is to blame for a loss to former President Donald Trump: the vice president or President Joe Biden for failing to drop out of the race earlier, Axios reported based on conversations with officials inside her campaign and top Biden administration officials. Democrats expressed concern to Axios that in her shortened campaign the vice president hasn’t defined herself enough and has cast too many different arguments against Trump.
“She is who she is,” one longtime Democratic strategist told the outlet. “Let’s hope it’s enough.”
“Going down?” a top Democratic official sent in a text to Axios.
The Harris campaign is worried about the vice president’s chances in the states that make up the “blue wall,” especially in Michigan, where the Muslim community is prominent, three sources with knowledge of the campaign’s strategy told NBC News. (RELATED: ‘We’re Desperate’: Socialists, Muslims Band Together To Deny Harris The White House)
As top Democrats worry the vice president hasn’t done a good job making the case for why she should be president, many were impressed with a line she used during a CNN town hall Wednesday, Axios reported.
“Just imagine the Oval Office in three months … It’s either Donald Trump in there stewing — stewing! — over his enemies list, or me, working for you, checking off my to-do list,” Harris said.
“Better late than never,” a top Democrat told Axios, with another adding, “it’s good. We’re not dead yet.”
During that same town hall, the vice president said she believed Trump was a fascist, citing comments his former chief of staff John Kelly made to The New York Times and the Atlantic. Earlier that day, Harris gave impromptu remarks on the articles in which Kelly claimed that Trump would rule like a fascist, said Hitler “did some good things” and wanted generals like the Nazi dictator.
The Trump campaign has denied both stories.
The Atlantic story also alleged that Trump disparaged a deceased veteran and her family. Former officials, the Trump campaign, the veteran’s family and their lawyer all went on the record to deny the story.
“All of this is further evidence for the American people of who Donald Trump really is,” Harris said about the stories. “This is a window into who Donald Trump really is, from the people who know him best. From the people who worked with him side by side, in the Oval Office and in the Situation Room.
“It is clear from John Kelly’s words that Donald Trump is someone who, I quote, ‘certainly falls into the general definition of fascist.’ Who vowed to be a dictator on day one and vowed to use the military as his personal militia to carry out his personal and political vendettas,” she continued.
In the final weeks of the campaign, Harris’ message has shifted to criticizing Trump and the threat he poses to the nation. Biden’s campaign message was similar and centered around calling Trump a threat to democracy. Before the president ended his bid for the White House, senior Democrats alongside some of Biden’s aides were doubting the “threat to democracy” slogan, Axios reported.
Harris is poised to make her closing argument for new leadership Tuesday at the spot Trump spoke at before the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, according to NBC News.",2024-10-25
The Daily Caller,Control Of The House May Depend On If These New York GOP Reps Can Hang On In Pro-Biden Districts,"House Republicans’ quest to preserve their slim majority will likely be dependent on the outcomes of four New York races with GOP incumbents in previously pro-Biden districts engaged in tough reelection fights.
Democrats need to flip just four Republican-held seats to retake control of the House, and party operatives are zeroing in on a group of freshman lawmakers representing competitive New York districts as prime pick-up opportunities. Though these Republican incumbents have faced voter registration and fundraising deficits in addition to running in a presidential election year that could see increased turnout, the campaigns and GOP operatives are optimistic that all of the Republican incumbent candidates in tight races will prevail on election day, according to interviews with campaign officials and written statements given to the Daily Caller News Foundation.
The incumbents — New York Republican Reps. Anthony D’Esposito, Mike Lawler, Marc Molinaro and Brandon Williams — must also overcome another challenge: President Joe Biden won the districts they represent by comfortable margins in 2020. Each candidate won by less than five points during the 2022 midterms, which saw New York Republican candidates make historic gains.
In D’Esposito’s Long Island district, Biden beat former President Donald Trump by more than 14 points in 2020, making the district the most pro-Biden seat in the country held by a Republican running for reelection.
In 2022, D’Esposito won New York’s fourth district by a four-point margin against his opponent, former Hempstead Town supervisor Laura Gillen, with the two set for a rematch in November. A Siena College poll from Oct. 13-17 showed Gillen ahead by 12 points in the contest.
D’Esposito’s campaign argued to the DCNF that the Siena College poll has “fundamental flaws” because the polling occurred during the Jewish holiday of Sukkot and failed to get an accurate sample of Jewish voters, which the campaign believes overwhelmingly support him.
“In a district with a large Jewish population, the pollster interviewed people during significant Jewish holy days. In fact, a large segment of the Jewish population don’t use electronic devices at this time. If Siena’s numbers were even close to accurate, Democrats would not be spending tens of millions of dollars to defeat D’Esposito while totally neglecting a statistical dead heat (according to Siena’s data) in the adjacent district, NY-1,” Matt Capp, spokesman for the D’Esposito campaign, added.
A poll conducted between Oct. 11 and 19 by Gotham Polling & Analytics has D’Esposito up by one point, with 6% of voters undecided. Capp told the DCNF that local opposition to the influx of migrants in New York City, the recently-tabled congestion pricing program and offshore wind are keeping this district in play for Republicans. (RELATED: Kathy Hochul Reportedly Looking To Slam The Brakes On Climate Toll After Realizing It Could Hurt Dems)
“The New York races have the advantage in that the Democratic Party has almost destroyed the state,” New York Republican consultant Bill O’Reilly told the DCNF. “We’re feeling it in taxes, in crime, in the migrant chaos.”
“There’s a built-in inclination to go Republican this time,” O’Reilly added.
Gillen has also outraised D’Esposito by more than $700,000, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission. Cook Political Report designates the race as a “toss-up.”
O’Reilly pointed to Lawler as the candidate most likely to prevail among the four incumbents despite running in a district that Biden won by more than ten points in 2020 and being outraised by roughly $1.3 million by his opponent, former Democratic Rep. Mondaire Jones of New York, according to FEC filings. O’Reilly served as the spokesperson for Lawler’s 2022 campaign.
“He has worked that district incredibly hard. He’s a classic example of someone who’s differentiated himself,” O’Reilly told the DCNF. “He’s a bipartisan guy. He works hard, he talks to everybody. He’s in the district like he said. He’s done the work to make himself known.”
Despite the most recent independent polling showing Lawler up by just one point, O’Reilly told the DCNF that Lawler’s internal polling has the candidate up by higher margins. The Cook Political Report changed the rating from “toss-up” to “lean Republican” on Oct. 25.
O’Reilly also told the DCNF that Lawler’s condemnation of anti-Israel protests at Columbia University over the past year and support for Israel in the country’s war against Hamas is likely to pay dividends in a district that has one of the highest percentages of Jewish voters in the country.

“Jewish voters in the 17th Congressional District and across the country will have a decisive impact on how elections play out across the country,” Chris Russell, spokesman for Lawler’s campaign, told the DCNF. “Orthodox, Reform, Conservative and Hasidic voters all want a few basic things in life — safe neighborhoods, good schools and a strong economy. Republicans provide winning arguments on all of those issues, and that’s why Jewish voters will be supporting candidates like Mike Lawler this November.”
Roll Call designated Williams as the most vulnerable member of the House running for reelection due to redistricting changes that made the Republican incumbent’s central New York district more Democratic. He leads his opponent, New York state senator John Mannion, by one point in the Williams campaign’s most recent internal poll. The Cook Political Report designates the race as “lean Democrat.”
Taylor Weyneth, a Williams campaign official, told the DCNF that their focus is not on the presidential ticket but on Albany and the “disastrous policies” pushed by state Democratic lawmakers and signed into law by New York governor Kathy Hochul.
“We’re running against Albany because we’re running against a New York state senator who was there for all of these disastrous policy decisions and has to own that record,” Weyneth told the DCNF. “Our opponent — he voted to give taxpayer-funded free health care to illegal immigrants and called voters ‘ignorant’ for being concerned about the migrant crisis impacting their community.”
Weyneth also told the DCNF that the campaign is feeling optimistic due to strong early voting numbers from registered Republicans. “We’re feeling confident and onward to victory,” Weyneth added.
O’Reilly described Molinaro, the 2018 New York Republican nominee for governor who now represents the Hudson Valley, as a “fighter.” Molinaro is currently in a brutal reelection contest and trails his Democratic opponent, Josh Riley, by four points in the latest polling. Molinaro beat Riley by less than two points in 2022.
The Molinaro-Riley rematch is the most expensive House race in New York, with more than $25 million worth of political ads on track to air.
“This race is about priorities,” Molinaro told the DCNF. “I’m for securing our border and putting Upstate New Yorkers first, my opponent Josh Riley supports keeping the border open and giving taxpayer-funded perks like credit cards and hotels to illegal immigrants.”
The Cook Political Report rates Molinaro’s reelection bid as a “toss-up.”
New York House Republicans, led by Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik, are also trying to flip a competitive seat in the mid-Hudson Valley held by Democratic Rep. Pat Ryan.
The Republican candidate, Alison Esposito, ran as the Republican nominee for New York’s lieutenant governor in 2022. The most recent independent polling from early October shows Esposito trailing Ryan by five points. The projected outcome for the Esposito-Ryan contest is “lean-Democrat,” according to Cook Political Report.
“Alison’s message of supporting law enforcement, securing our border, creating jobs, strengthening the economy, and defending our allies is resonating across NY-18,” Ben Weiner, spokesman for the Esposito campaign, told the DCNF. “Since beginning our campaign over a year ago, we’ve heard from Hudson Valley residents across the district who are ready for change. They know Pat Ryan is on the wrong side of every issue and are ready to send a common sense leader to D.C. That’s why Alison is surging in the polls and within striking distance of Pat Ryan.
“We are confident that we have the momentum and the winning message to flip NY-18 and secure a victory on election night,” Weiner added.

The Daily Caller,Republicans Ask Supreme Court To Block Some Provisional Ballots In Swing State For People With Mail-In Errors,"Republicans petitioned the Supreme Court Monday to block a lower court’s ruling allowing voters in Pennsylvania to cast a provisional vote in person on election day if their mail-in ballot is rejected.
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled on Oct. 23 that the Butler County Board of Election could count provisional ballots cast by voters whose original mail-in ballots were voided due to voter errors, according to court documents. The Republican National Committee (RNC) and Republican Party of Pennsylvania argue that allowing the provisional ballots is illegal and could spark “chaos” and “confusion” and has the potential to flip elections in the state, according to the petition.
“Even if the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s decision does not change the outcome of any election, the question of whether the provisional ballots can be added to the vote total would remain a concrete dispute this Court can review,” the court documents read. “As this Court knows, this is the second consecutive presidential election in which the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has changed important election rules at the last minute. Reviewing that court’s authority to do so — even after Election Day (when the pressure of an imminent election would be absent) — would provide invaluable guidance for future elections.'”
The appellants argue that provisional ballots are only allowed in a few circumstances by law and are illegal after a voter’s “first (and only) ballot” is received, according to the documents. Voters are already warned when they receive their mail-in ballots that documents with incorrect information will not be counted and therefore do not need to be granted a second chance to vote, they argue.
In its initial ruling, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court stated that mail-in ballots with errors were considered invalid and therefore were not acknowledged formally as a voter’s first ballot, according to the ruling.
The plaintiffs state that the original court’s ruling is “so unreasonable that it violates the Elections and Electors Clauses of the U.S. Constitution” and petitioned the Supreme Court to issue an emergency stay by Nov. 1.
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court previously stated on Oct. 7 it would not issue rulings regarding mail-in ballots this close to the election, including a case challenging the legality of ballots with incorrect dates. (RELATED: Bomb Threat Forces Swing State County GOP Headquarters To Close)

The Daily Caller,Louisiana AG Accuses ICE Of Facilitating Entry Of ‘Illegal Chinese National’ With Deadly Pathogen,"Louisiana Attorney General Elizabeth Murrill filed a lawsuit Wednesday against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), alleging that a Chinese national infected with a “rare, aggressive and drug-resistant” form of tuberculosis illegally entered the country.
Murrill claimed that immigration officials exposed Americans and other detainees to the disease after they transported the Chinese “Patient Zero” to various ICE facilities around the state, according to a statement released by Louisiana’s Department of Justice. The attorney general also claimed that the illegal migrant suffers from an antibiotic-resistant form of tuberculosis with a high mortality rate.
🚨BREAKING: I am suing @AliMayorkas & @DHSgov after a Chinese national who illegally entered the United States was found in Louisiana with a rare, aggressive, & drug-resistant form of Tuberculosis, threatening the health & safety of the people of Louisiana & America.… pic.twitter.com/isxk9fYRub
— Attorney General Liz Murrill (@AGLizMurrill) October 23, 2024
Murrill blamed the alleged exposure on the Biden administration’s border policy, calling the alleged misstep a “dereliction of duty” in the statement. U.S. Customs and Border Protection has recorded roughly 8.5 million encounters with illegal migrants along the U.S.-Mexico border since 2021, according to data released Tuesday.
“Millions of undocumented illegal aliens continue to pour across the southern border – unidentified, untracked, and untested for diseases that can threaten the lives of American citizens,” Murrill said in the statement. “The federal government has put the health and safety of Louisiana and American people at risk. Despite this dereliction of duty by President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Secretary Mayorkas, Louisiana officials acted immediately to protect our people.” (RELATED: ‘I Love Kamala’: Migrants Fear Trump Victory As Caravan Heads To US)
Murrill also alleged in an interview with the Caller that the Biden administration does not require migrants to undergo any form of health screening after crossing the border.
“They’re not checking them,” Murrill told the Caller. “If you know anything about the asylum rule, it is a fast track to get people across the border. And so they’re not checking them.”
The attorney general claims that “Patient Zero” underwent no health screenings after she arrived by plane to the ICE facility in Monroe, Louisiana, from San Diego, endangering other airline passengers who were traveling across the entire country.
“So they flew this person into Alexandria, put her on a bus with 39 other people, took her to Richwood in Monroe and that point, all people coming into that facility, which is an ICE processing facility, were tested … but they don’t test them when they cross the border, so this lady flew with 140 people from San Diego, and the rest of that airplane went on to Houston.”
The state of Louisiana first learned that the Chinese migrant had tested positive for “pre-extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB)” on Oct. 9, according to the suit. The tuberculosis strain in question is deadlier than others, with a mortality rate of 34-39%, the suit said.
Treatments for this type of TB are rare and expensive.
“I’m told by the medical experts that the treatment alone costs $22,000 per treatment,” Murrill told the Caller.
The cost may be much higher, exceeding $500,000 for a direct treatment of the XDR-TB strain, according to data released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Louisiana Surgeon General Ralph Abraham ordered a hospital to hold the Chinese national in isolation Oct 11, according to the filings. He issued a second order demanding ICE to quarantine its Basile facility, where the patient was allegedly being held, and that the facility should isolate and retain high-risk contact until they are cleared by the Louisiana Department of Health. The same order was issued to ICE’s Richwood facility Oct. 14, where the patient had also allegedly been held.
ICE officials said they would release any detainees held in their facilities if the White House ordered them to do so, Murrill said of an Oct. 15 phone call with state and federal officials.
The attorney general complained that federal officials were creating problems and leaving the states to deal with the mess.
“Once they release them, by the way, they become the state’s problem,” Murrill told the Caller. “So we had that conversation with ICE. So if you’re gonna release somebody even though we haven’t medically cleared them, but you think you’ve got to let them go, then what? And they’re like, ‘Basically, it’s your problem.’ So the state of Louisiana would have had to assume the cost and the responsibility for quarantining that person in a hotel and providing security to make sure that they didn’t leave, bringing them meals, and, you know, addressing their basic needs to make sure they stayed quarantined for the time that we needed them to stay quarantined because ICE refused to do it.”
“I can confirm that both Richwood and Basile are currently not intaking any new detainees,” an ICE employee wrote in a follow-up email to state officials, according to the lawsuit. “If we encounter a situation involving a detainee that we are legally required to release, we will contact LDH and provide time to take appropriate action and coordinate any transfer of custody to LDH [Louisiana Department of Health] as needed.”
The attorney general’s filing argues that ICE’s alleged actions violate Louisiana’s constitutionally delegated powers under the Tenth Amendment.
“The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States, respectively, or to the people.”
Murrill originally filed the suit Oct. 16 before it was publicized Wednesday. The U.S. District Court of the Western District of Louisiana granted the state a temporary restraining order Oct. 17 against ICE.
“On October 17, we got on the phone with the court, and on the same day, the court entered a temporary restraining order against ICE basically barring ICE from releasing potentially infected detainees without court approval,” a spokesperson for the attorney general said in a press conference.

The Daily Caller,Foreign Agents Are Spending Big To Help Dems Win Key Senate Seats,"Lobbyists working on behalf of foreign nations are cutting large checks to help Democrats win two competitive Senate seats, records show.
Maryland, a traditionally blue state made competitive by the candidacy of popular Republican former Gov. Larry Hogan, and Arizona, a core swing state, have both seen an influx of cash from registered foreign agents ahead of election day, disclosures show.
Democrats are taking home the majority of these foreign agent contributions, with Rep. Ruben Gallego, the Democratic nominee in Arizona, bringing in well over ten times more cash from foreign agents than Republican nominee Kari Lake. In Maryland, Democratic Senate nominee Angela Alsobrooks has brought in nearly twice as much in donations from foreign agents as Hogan.
Gallego has long railed against the influence of lobbyists on policy. (Stream The Daily Caller’s Documentary ‘Cleaning Up Kamala’ HERE)
“One of the things I am most proud of is that almost every dollar we raise comes from donations of less than $50,” a September 2023 fundraising email from Gallego reads. “That means when I go to the Senate, I’m not on the hook to some huge corporation or a bunch of lobbyists.”
Despite his convictions, the freshman representative took roughly $31,000 from registered agents of foreign nations between January 2020 and September 2023, according to disclosures. Lake, by contrast, received just $2,400 from foreign agents.
“We’ve known since the start of this race that Ruben Gallego is funded by Soros money, blue state billionaires and Hollywood elites,” a Lake campaign spokesperson told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “To learn that he is also being propped up by foreign agents isn’t surprising, but it is alarming. These swampy and globalist factions love Ruben Gallego because they know he’s their willing puppet.”
Among the foreign agents helping to bankroll Gallego are a trio of lobbyists representing Venezuela’s state-run oil company.
Mike Smith and Israel Klein, two lobbyists who donated to Gallego and represent Venezuela, have forwarded information from the Venezuelan government to the State Department and met with high-ranking senators to advocate for a subsidiary of the socialist country’s state-owned oil company. Gallego, however, has criticized the Venezuelan government, condemning the country’s socialist government for rigging elections in July and calling for sanctions against it, according to press releases.
RealClearPolitics’ average of polls has Gallego leading Lake by about six points as of Oct. 29. Recent polls released by firms like Data Orbital, Trafalgar Group, and Insider Advantage, however, have Lake within a few points of Gallego.
Alsobrooks, similarly to Gallego, promised to “stand up to deep-pocketed, powerful, special interest” in a December 2023 fundraising email. Despite this, she has accepted $62,500 from registered foreign agents this election cycle, disclosures show. Lobbyists at Empire Consulting Group working for Qatar were one of the biggest blocs of foreign agents supporting Alsobrooks, giving her $12,600 since January 2023.
Qatar has sent millions of dollars since 2018 to Gaza that has then been used to prop up Hamas, the terrorist organization behind the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks in Israel, according to CNN. The oil-rich Gulf state has also been harboring Hamas’ political leadership in some capacity since 2012, The Times of Israel reported.
Alsobrooks, though expressing support for Israel, called for a ceasefire shortly after the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks, believes in a two-state solution and is in favor of increased humanitarian aid to Gaza, according to the Baltimore Banner. Humanitarian aid sent to Gaza has historically been captured by Palestinian terrorists.
Hogan, on the other hand, got $33,000 from foreign agents, disclosures show.
While he has also taken a couple thousand worth of donations from Qatari foreign agents, the former governor has come out as a strong supporter of Israel in its war against Hamas, promising to be Maryland’s “pro-Israel champion” if elected. Hogan, for instance, called on Alsobrooks to reverse her support for cutting off aid to Israel after she said in May the U.S. should cut off support to Israel if it continued operations in the city of Rafah, according to the Washington Examiner.
Alsobrooks holds an average of about 51% support, with Hogan trailing at roughly 40%, according to RealClearPolitics’ aggregate of polls. Democrats won Maryland by over 30 points in 2020, CNN reported.
The Gallego, Alsobrooks and Hogan campaigns did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s requests for comment.

The Daily Caller,‘You Said A Lot Of Wild Sh*t’: Joe Rogan Explains Trump’s Unique Path To The Presidency,"Top podcaster Joe Rogan explained Friday during a three-hour unscripted interview with former President Donald Trump how the 2024 Republican nominee’s unique path to the White House in 2016 involved saying “a lot of wild shit.”
Trump commented he always attracted more publicity than others without trying, prompting the host of “The Joe Rogan Experience” to reflect how establishment media contributed to Trump’s surge in popularity and ascension to the presidency.
“Oh, I can definitely tell you. You said a lot of wild shit,” Rogan laughed. “You said a lot of wild shit, and then CNN, in all their brilliance, by highlighting your wild shit, made you much more popular.”
Rogan also told Trump how voters exhausted by carefully scripted political rhetoric were drawn to the then-Repiblican candidate’s perceived authenticity.
Wow 😂
TRUMP: “I always got more publicity than other people…I don’t know exactly why?”
ROGAN: “You said a lot of wild shit!” pic.twitter.com/ybf0zYSIh8
— Russell Brand (@rustyrockets) October 26, 2024
“People were tired of someone talking in this bullshit, pre-prepared politician lingo. And even if they didn’t agree with you, they at least knew whoever that guy is, that’s him,” Rogan said.
Rogan then pointed to Trump’s large rallies and compared his delivery to that of a standup comedian — for which he said no politician was comparable.
“You need at least the attitude of a comedian when you’re doing this business. This is a very dangerous business, first of all. It’s a very tough business,” Trump said.
Rogan also ripped the media for brushing the two assassination attempts on Trump’s life out of the news. The GOP nominee, however, said he would “rather not talk about” the incidents. (RELATED: Biden Will Not Appear With Kamala Harris Before Election Day: REPORT)
Trump also admitted to the major podcaster how his biggest mistake as president was appointing people he later reflected should not have been selected for certain positions in his administration.
“The biggest mistake I’ve made is I’ve picked some people — I’ve picked some great people, but you don’t think about that — I picked some people that I shouldn’t have picked,” Trump said, specifically naming his former chief of staff, John Kelly.
Vice President Kamala Harris was asked the same question during a Wednesday town hall hosted by CNN’s Anderson Cooper. The 2024 Democratic presidential nominee said she made many mistakes, initially comparing herself to a parent.
Harris eventually settled on highlighting a strength instead of a weakness, only to say it would be a weakness to lack the said strength.

“In my role as vice president, I mean, I probably worked very hard at making sure that I am well-versed on issues and I think that is very important. It’s a mistake not to be well-versed on an issue and feel compelled to answer a question,” Harris said with a smirk at the CNN host.
Harris backed out of an interview with Rogan on Thursday due to a scheduling conflict, Harris campaign spokesperson Ian Sams told MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes.
Rogan previously revealed he had concerns how interviewing Trump could “help him.”
“By the way, I am not a Trump supporter, in any way, shape or form,” Rogan said during a July 2022 appearance on the “Lex Fridman Podcast.” “I have had the opportunity to have him on my show, more than once, and I have said no every time. I don’t want to help him, I’m not interested in helping him.”
After the former president survived an assassination attempt at a July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, however, Rogan reconsidered his position.
“Once they shot you, I was like, ‘He’s got to come in here,'” Rogan said. “It’s all about timing.”
Trump opened the long-anticipated interview with Rogan — which garnered over seven million views overnight after being uploaded Friday night — by revealing how winning the presidency was more “surreal” than his being shot in the ear.

The Daily Caller,"Colorado Secretary Of State Website Posts ‘Partial Passwords’ To Voting Systems, Assures Public ‘No Security Breach’","Democratic Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold admitted Tuesday that “partial passwords” to state voting systems were posted on her office’s website for months before being taken down and appeared to downplay election integrity concerns.
A file available for download was posted on the Secretary of State website, the Colorado Republican Party said, citing an affidavit. This file allegedly contained a list BIOS passwords for more than 700 voting components in 63 out of Colorado’s 64 counties. An unidentified official quietly removed the file on Oct. 24, the party claimed.
Griswold denied the allegations of the Colorado GOP in a Tuesday interview with 9News, saying that the leaked passwords were only “partial passwords.”
“This is not a security threat,” Griswold said. When asked how many counties were impacted, Griswold would not answer.
“At this point, Kyle, we have staff in the field looking at the situation, but we will disclose when we are out of the field,” Griswold said. “To be clear, we do not see this as a full security threat to the state.”
Griswold did admit that the passwords were published on her office’s website and “were up for several months” before being taken down. She also claimed some of the passwords were not “active.” The secretary maintained that an investigation was underway with federal assistance. (RELATED: Pro-Palestine Messages Reportedly Found On Devices At Ballot Box Fires)
Colorado GOP Chairman Dave Williams sent a letter to Griswold’s office on Oct. 29 demanding immediate action. He also contradicted Griswold’s characterization that the leaks were not a security threat.
“As you are well aware, a BIOS password could allow a knowledgeable user to not only gain total control over any system accessed either physically or remotely, including the ability to manipulate those systems and results, but it would allow that user to remove any trace that she was ever there (overwriting even fundamental system logs necessary during a subsequent audit to show whether illicit access or activity had ever occurred),” Williams wrote.
He also requested verification that the passwords in question had been replaced.
Heidi Ganahl, former Republican gubernatorial candidate in Colorado, pointed out that Griswold’s office has previously classified the leakage of BIOS passwords as a “serious breach.”
If Mesa in 2021 was a “serious breach,” NOT during an election, what is 600+ DURING an election? (1/3)@JenaGriswold said “The public disclosure of the BIOS passwords for one or more components of Mesa County’s voting system alone constitutes a serious breach… pic.twitter.com/SdyUyY82mm
— Heidi Ganahl (@heidiganahl) October 29, 2024
“The public disclosure of BIOS passwords for one or more components of Mesa County’s voting system alone constitutes a serious breach of voting system security protocols, as well as a violation of Election Rule 20.6.1,” Griswold’s office said in a 2021 press release.
Tina Peters, a former election clerk from Mesa County, was sentenced to prison earlier this month for allowing unauthorized access to voting equipment, according to The Associated Press (AP). In that case, Griswold touted the case as representing Colorado’s approach to election security.
“Colorado’s elections are the nation’s gold standard. I am proud of how we have responded to the first insider elections breach in the nation and look forward to another secure and successful election in November,” Griswold said in a statement following the sentencing.
The Daily Caller has reached out to Griswold’s office.
**UPDATE: On Wednesday evening, Chairman Dave Williams of the Colorado GOP responded to a request for comment. He challenged Griwold’s assertion that the leaked passwords were only “partial passwords,” one of two security layers that would not be able to provide access to the voting systems.
“This is not true for the BIOS, and at best, shows a serious lack of understanding of how the systems themselves even work by her and her most senior team members, including Matt Crane, the head of the Colorado Clerk Association,” Williams said.
Williams also sent over a link to a 2015 WIRED article discussing how even semi-knowledgable hackers could break into a BIOS system in less than two minutes, either remotely or through physical access. With access to a BIOS system, the hacker could use acquired or hacked escalated privileges to maintain non-tracable access to a system in the way Williams described.
“Using this [escalated] mode, they can rewrite the contents of the BIOS chip to install an implant that gives them a persistent and stealth foothold,” noted the article. “From there, they can install root kits and steal passwords and other data from the system.”
The article also suggested that with physical access to the system, a hacker or other malicious actor could install malicious code into the BIOS in under two minutes. Williams noted that there are thousands of individuals in the state with such physical access, and with the BIOS passwords, any one of these individuals could tamper with voting machines.",2024-10-30
The Daily Caller,Biden-Harris Admin Focused On Diversity At The VA As Veterans Faced Massive Claims Backlog,"The Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) expanded its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts while hundreds of thousands of veterans were stuck on a waitlist for benefits under the Biden-Harris administration.
The VA took at least a dozen actions aimed at bolstering its DEI initiatives during the Biden-Harris administration, according to a list of federal DEI programs compiled by the right-of-center nonprofit Do No Harm. While the VA was focused on pursuing diversity, the number of homeless veterans increased and the amount of claims in the VA’s backlog grew to roughly 378,000.
In June 2023, the VA adopted an equity action plan and, as part of that plan, established its Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Access Council to comply with President Joe Biden’s executive order mandating that all federal agencies work toward achieving racial equity, according to federal documents. The council exists to assess the VA’s programs to ensure they are being carried out with racial equity in mind. (Stream The Daily Caller’s Documentary ‘Cleaning Up Kamala’ HERE)
As the VA was expending resources to measure racial equity, the number of veterans waiting for it to review their claims remained persistently high. At the end of 2023, the VA had 378,000 claims from veterans that had been pending for at least 125 days. This represents an increase from the 210,854 backlogged claims the agency had as of September 2021.
The VA expected the number of these backlogged claims to increase over the course of 2024, though the agency has yet to publish year-end data.
While struggling to provide services to veterans, the VA moved to contract with more diverse suppliers, providing “underserved” businesses with advanced information to assist them in the contract bidding process and making procurement decisions that privilege minority-owned businesses, according to Do No Harm’s list of federal DEI policies. The agency also engaged in marketing campaigns aimed at reaching out to “LGBTQ+” and female-owned businesses as well as a campaign targeted at getting more women to self-identify as veterans.
The number of homeless veterans increased from 33,129 in 2022 to 35,574 in 2023, according to data maintained by the VA. The uptick was particularly pronounced among homeless veterans who were “unsheltered,” meaning that they were living on the street as opposed to in a homeless shelter.
As veterans slept on streets, the VA promised to address “health equity” by gathering more information on the race, ethnicity, sex, gender identity and sexual orientation of veterans, according to Do No Harm. The agency spent $718,000 to provide 20 medical centers with resources to “implement” or “advance” equity.
Veterans of the armed forces favor former President Donald Trump over Vice President Kamala Harris by a margin of 61% to 37%, according to data published by the Pew Research Center in September. Trump sought to increase the VA’s budget and expanded the ability of veterans to seek medical care outside of the agency’s hospital system.
President Joe Biden, by comparison, signed the PACT Act, which greatly expanded benefits available to veterans. Biden’s VA, however, expanded diversity trainings and pushed for abortions in VA hospitals.
The VA did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

The Daily Caller,ROOKE: Republicans’ Latest Swing State Win Is The Last Thing Democrats Want Right Now,"The Trump campaign just won a major victory that should scare Democrats hoping to see a drop in Republican voter turnout.
The Republican National Committee (RNC) and former President Donald Trump’s campaign prevailed in a lawsuit Wednesday against Bucks County, Pennsylvania, to extend early voting by three days.
Trump’s campaign filed the lawsuit Tuesday alleging voter suppression after viral videos of supporters complaining that they were turned away from their polling places despite being in line to vote by 5:00 pm. The original deadline to vote early in person in Pennsylvania ended Oct. 29, but the court’s ruling means that the state has to extend its early voting until Nov.1.

The Real Clear Polling average has Trump up over Harris by just 0.7%, making Pennsylvania a true toss-up state.

(ROOKE: These Are The Early Results That Will Tell Us The Winner On Election Night)
DecisionDeskHQ author Michael Pruser reported that Tuesday’s Pennsylvania early voting data showed Republicans outvoted Democrats for the first time since early voting began. “Philadelphia was one of the big three way out in front in returns.

As of Tuesday, 1.55 million votes had been cast, roughly 23% of the expected electorate, according to Pruser. Democrats currently have a 380,043 vote lead over Republicans, which is considerably lower than at this same time in 2020 when Democrats had a 1.1 million vote lead.
The RNC’s win gives Republicans three more days to close the gaps and increase their voter turnout before election day, which should scare Democrats who needed low Republican returns. While Harris is still in the race to win Pennsylvania, it looks like she won’t be able to count on Philadelphia to pull her over the edge in the same way it did for Biden. This lawsuit might be the final momentum shift Trump needed to secure him Pennsylvania’s 19 Electoral College votes.",2024-10-30
The Daily Caller,Former Soros Prosecutor Admits She Used Public Funds To Pay Personal Expenses,"Former Democratic St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kimberly Gardner has admitted to using public funds to cover her personal legal expenses, the Department of Justice announced on Wednesday.
As part of a pretrial diversion agreement, Gardner acknowledged that she ordered her subordinates to withdraw over $5,000 from the St. Louis Circuit Attorney’s Office and then deposited it in her personal bank account to reimburse herself for legal fees associated with a personal ethics lawsuit. The former St. Louis Circuit Attorney, effectively the district attorney for the city, was supported by liberal billionaire George Soros and faced criticism for not prosecuting criminals while in office.
‘The agreement follows a thorough investigation by the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI, during which investigators interviewed all pertinent witnesses and reviewed all available evidence and financial records,” U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri Sayler Fleming said about the agreement. The funds “were deposited in her personal bank account and used for her personal expenses unrelated to her job duties and the operations of the Circuit Attorney’s Office. Kimberly Gardner was not entitled under the law to that additional compensation,” according to the diversion agreement. (Stream The Daily Caller’s Documentary ‘Cleaning Up Kamala’ HERE)
The illicit legal expense Gardner paid stems from her investigation into Republican Former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens where the Missouri Supreme Court determined she breached ethics rules. Gardner was probing Greitens for alleged sexual misconduct, though she dropped the case after a judge ruled she would have to answer questions under oath from the former governor’s attorney, The Associated Press reported.
Under the agreement, Gardner’s prosecution will be deferred for 18 months provided that she avoids breaking any other laws and reports to a pretrial services officer. She will also be required to pay back the funds she improperly used.
Gardner resigned from her post as St. Louis’ top prosecutor in May 2023 after Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey moved to remove her from office for, among other things, allowing a backlog of “at least 3,000 cases” to stack up without being reviewed. Police data shows that 2020, when Gardner was in office, saw the second-highest number of homicides in St. Louis history.
Bailey accused Gardener of “willful negligence” in a statement to the Daily Caller News Foundation.
While Gardner declined to pursue charges against many criminals, she did launch an investigation into Mark and Patricia McCloskey, St. Louis lawyers who became famous for standing outside their home with firearms to ward off protesters during the 2020 race riots.
“While Ms. Gardner was prepared to vigorously defend any allegations that may have been lodged against her, she and the government agreed to end any dispute and terminate any investigation with the pre-charge diversion agreement,” Ronald Sullivan, the Harvard Law School professor representing Gardner, told the DCNF.

The Daily Caller,"Caught On Camera: Dem Staffer Calls Americans Racist, Rants About Ending Border Patrol, Opening Borders","A staffer who has reportedly worked with Democratic Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown’s campaign appeared to call for open borders and accused voters of “pure racism,” according to a video posted by Ohio.news.
“Open the f**king border, I don’t give a sh*t who the fuck comes in here,” Kevin Oyakawa, a staffer reportedly working alongside Brown and Democratic Ohio Rep. Emilia Sykes’ campaigns, said, according to Ohio.news.
Oyakawa, a Regional Organizing Director for the Ohio Democratic Party, according to Ohio.news, called immigration a “losing issue” for Ohio Democrats “for like no f**king reason other than people’s pure racism.”
The staffer could be heard saying the U.S. doesn’t “need Border Patrol” in the video.
He then appeared to criticize Sykes, noting her silence on immigration.
“If she has to address immigration, she starts losing,” he said in the video which the outlet posted to YouTube on Thursday.
Ohio.news appeared to confirm Oyakawa’s identity as a Democratic staffer through one of his Facebook posts, though the post now appears to be private or deleted.
“I’m excited to announce that I have accepted a position with the Ohio Coordinated Campaign to re-elect Senator Sherrod Brown, Congresswoman Emilia Sykes, and other down ballot Democratic candidates,” Oyakawa appeared to write in an alleged screenshot of an April 15 Facebook post.

The Daily Caller,Harris Made Intel Agencies Sift Through Years Of Docs Ensuring Similar Adjectives Were Used To Describe Both Genders,"Shortly after her inauguration in 2021, Vice President Kamala Harris initiated a campaign for gender sensitivity across intelligence agencies, spurred by her discovery of allegedly biased language in briefings that described female leaders differently than males.
Harris ordered a comprehensive review of past intelligence reports to detect gender biases, according to The New York Times. This review revealed some inconsistencies in language, which prompted the implementation of gender sensitivity training for intelligence analysts to ensure fair representation of female leaders in intelligence reports.
Kamala Harris put questions about gender and race at the center of many of the policy discussions in her office, former administration officials said. Though it is a defining feature of her vice presidency, she is not running on this part of her record. https://t.co/UkB0AmcE8h
— The New York Times (@nytimes) October 25, 2024
However, as the political landscape shifted, Harris strategically redirected her focus to widely appealing issues such as abortion rights, entrepreneurship, homeowner assistance and tax relief, according to NYT. (RELATED: Harris’ Tax Plan Would Pulverize Nearly 1 Million Full-Time Jobs, Study Finds)
“She learned that if she wanted to be president of the United States, she would have to walk a very delicate, tight rope when it came to race and gender,” political historian and associate professor at Johns Hopkins University Leah Wright Rigueur told the NYT. “And that is exactly what we have seen from her.”
As the presidential campaign enters its final phase and her appeal to black male voters wanes, Harris has introduced a policy package called “Opportunity Agenda for Black Men,” aimed at aiding them in wealth building, with subsidized loans for new entrepreneurs as a key element. However, days after introducing it, the Harris campaign announced that the economic initiative was open to all Americans.
The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

The Daily Caller,"‘Trump Is The Only Candidate’: Hundreds Of Former Nat Sec Officials Endorse Trump, Say Harris Dismantled Border","More than 200 retired Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials signed onto an open letter endorsing former President Donald Trump, arguing he’s the only candidate who will enforce border security.
The Biden-Harris administration enacted policies that “systematically dismantled” a border enforcement apparatus that prevented crime at the U.S.-Mexico border and across the country, according to numerous retired Border Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other DHS officials who have spent a career in the field. Signatories to the letter included retired Border Patrol chief Rodney Scott and former ICE chief Tom Homan, among many others. (RELATED: ‘Something Has To Be Done’: Trump Pledges Compensation Fund For Victims Of Migrant Crime)
These border enforcement professionals laid out their case as to why they believe the border crisis got so incredibly bad during the current administration, and how things were different in the previous administration.
“President Trump respected the experience of career border security professionals and listened to our advice,” the letter stated. “When border security experts explained to President Trump how illegal immigration empowers the cartels to control who and what enters our home, he listened and acted.”
“The Trump administration supported policies and programs that reduced illegal immigration, instilled integrity into our legal immigration system and ensured that the U.S. government was doing all we could to control who and what entered our homeland. The borders of the U.S. were never more secure than they were during the Trump administration,” the letter continues.
Upon entering office, the Biden-Harris administration undertook 296 executive actions on immigration, with 89 of those orders specifically reversing or beginning the process of undoing Trump’s immigration policies. The administration went on to undo a number of major Trump initiatives concerning border security, such as ending border wall construction and shutting down the Remain in Mexico program.
What followed was a historic flow of illegal immigration through the U.S.-Mexico border. The number of illegal border crossings in fiscal year 2024 were the second worst in U.S. history — only surpassed by fiscal year 2023, according to data tracked by Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
Scott, who led Border Patrol from February 2020 to August 2021, previously told the Daily Caller News Foundation that the Biden administration tightly cracked down on him and his colleagues from speaking out about the border crisis.
Since taking over the re-election mantle from President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris has attempted to rebrand herself as more of a border hawk, with her campaign boasting ads that feature the border wall and a pledge to hire more Border Patrol agents if she wins in November.
Trump’s support from border security professionals isn’t limited to those who have since retired from service. Earlier in October, the Border Patrol union formally endorsed the Republican candidate, with the president of the National Border Patrol Council saying that a victory for Harris would mean “every city, every community in this great country, is going to go to hell.”
The letter brought forward by the retired border professionals echoed similar sentiments.
[U]nder VP Harris’ watch, idealist political appointees with zero border security experience were empowered to implement disastrous and deadly border security policy for the United States,” the letter states. “The devastating results have handed complete control of our border to the cartels, provided them with astronomical record profits, ballooned legal immigration backlogs, and have left millions of illegal aliens in the country.”
“Assuming you care about border security as much as we do, the choice is clear. President Trump is the only candidate that we can trust to secure our nation’s borders,” the letter concluded.
Neither the Trump campaign nor the Harris campaign immediately responded to a request for comment from the DCNF.

The Daily Caller,ROOKE: Harris Campaign’s 11th Hour Looks Like A Nightmare,"With just eight days left in the presidential election, there are clear signs that Vice President Kamala Harris is on unsteady ground.
Democrats started whispering to their friends in the corporate press about their election-day fears that Harris could lose to former President Donald Trump.
“A growing number of top Democrats tell us privately they feel Vice President Harris will lose — even though polls show a coin-toss finish 11 days from now,” Axios reported. “Democrats admit they tend to be hand-wringing, bed-wetting, doomsdayers. But what’s striking is how our private conversations with Democrats inside and outside her campaign reveal broad concern that little she does, says — or tries — seems to move the needle.”

It’s never a good sign when Democrats (even anonymously) tell the media their candidate is going to lose and that nothing she does “seems to move the needle.” The polling shows that while the election is still close and could go either way, Trump has a shot to win not only the Electoral College vote but also the popular vote. (ROOKE: These Are The Early Results That Will Tell Us The Winner On Election Night)
The RealClear polling average has Trump up just 0.2% in the national poll, the first time he’s led since Harris first entered the race. Emerson, NY Times/Sienna and CNN all have polls showing that Harris and Trump are tied for the popular vote. Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal and Forbes polls both show that Trump wins the popular vote by two points.

A Republican presidential candidate hasn’t won the popular vote since former President George W. Bush in 2004. Trump’s support was on full display Sunday in Manhattan when voters turned out in droves, occupying block after block in dark blue New York City wearing MAGA hats and other Trump gear to hear him speak.
The media did their usual dog and pony show, attempting to connect Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally to the Nazi Party rally held there in 1930. Outside of Harris’ staunch supporters, regular voters see this rhetoric for what it is — Democrat propaganda. It’s hard to make people believe the lie that “Trump is a Nazi” when there are supporters from every race and religion in the crowd.

Trump trails Harris by 0.6% in the RealClearPolling average of polls from Oct. 8 – 22, with the gap increasing to 0.8% when Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein, independent candidate Cornel West and Libertarian candidate Chase Oliver are included in surveys. Stevens cited the campaign’s use of Hollywood actors like “West Wing” star Bradley Whitford and “Good Wife” star Christine Baranski.

“It’s huge because there’s a special connection there. You know, when you see these performers and they come to their hometowns or they come to some place, you know, like where they grew up, they can bond on that,” Stevens said. “What it’s really saying is, you know, you and I are not that different. I’m famous, but we share the same values. Let’s work together on this. I think it’s really smart.”
“And I have to say, I think when this thing is over and done with and Harris has won, which I think she’s going to do rather comfortably, I think we’re going to look back on this as one of the most perfectly executed campaigns in modern history,” Stevens continued.

The Daily Caller,"Tens Of Millions In Foreign Funds Could Be Flowing Into 2024 Election To Help Dems, Report Reveals","A Democratic-aligned dark money group that receives significant backing from a foreign billionaire is dumping tens of millions of dollars into influencing ballot initiatives ahead of November’s election, according to a new report.
The Sixteen Thirty Fund received $143 million in backing from the Berger Action Fund, a nonprofit bankrolled by Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss, between 2019 and 2022. This election cycle, the Sixteen Thirty Fund has spent nearly $23 million on ballot initiatives in a number of swing states on issues like abortion, minimum wage policy and election reform, according to a report from watchdog group Americans for Public Trust (APT).
“It’s unconscionable that foreign money is currently influencing our politics through a loophole most mainstream media and politicians are either ignoring or don’t know about,” APT executive director Caitlin Sutherland told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Activists like the ones running Sixteen Thirty Fund are targeting competitive states — not just to usher in left-wing legislative changes via these ballot measures, but also to give a boost to the liberals at the top of the ticket, which folks have openly admitted that’s their goal.”
“Americans for Public Trust — a right-wing group tied to Leonard Leo — published this report because they resent our successful efforts to guarantee freedoms for all Americans, work Leo fundamentally opposes,” a Sixteen Thirty Fund spokesperson told the DCNF. “Sixteen Thirty Fund proudly supports local groups organizing around ballot initiatives that expand fundamental rights like access to abortion, the ballot box and livable wages. Every contribution we receive is used in strict compliance with all guidelines, regulations and laws.”
Some Democratic strategists view ballot abortion referendums, which the Sixteen Thirty Fund has spent considerable funds supporting, as a way to sway people toward their party’s candidates. The Sixteen Thirty Fund has pumped millions into ballot initiative campaigns in Arizona, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada and Ohio, all of which have competitive presidential or senatorial races — both in some cases.
Federal law doesn’t currently prohibit foreign dollars from funding ballot measure campaigns, according to APT. Foreigners, however, are barred from donating directly to candidates and political action committees.
The Sixteen Thirty Fund has spent a total of $115 million on state ballot issues since 2014, with Wyss donating at least $243 million to the group since its inception, per APT’s analysis of campaign finance and nonprofit records.
“State legislatures and the U.S. Congress should act to close this foreign influence loophole,” the report’s conclusion reads. “Foreign nationals are already prohibited from donating to U.S. political candidates, committees and Super PACs, and the same prohibition should apply to state ballot issue campaigns … American policy debates should be for American citizens.”
When reached by the DCNF in February, a spokesperson for the Berger Action Fund would not comment on whether or not Wyss’ money supported political activities but stressed that it “complies with laws and rules governing its activities and prohibits its grants from being used to support or oppose political candidates or parties, or otherwise engage in electoral activities.”
Berger Action Fund did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

The Daily Caller,Swing State Supreme Court Upholds Ruling To Count Mail Ballots Without Postmarks Up To Three Days Post-Election,"The Nevada Supreme Court affirmed Monday a lower court’s ruling that mail ballots arriving up to three days after the Nov. 5 election can be counted, regardless of whether they bear a postmark.
The verdict upholds a previous lower court’s decision and expands the scope of the state law mandating that such ballots be counted when a postmark “cannot be determined,” according to the ruling. The ruling marks a setback for the Republican National Committee (RNC), which maintained that the law should only cover ballots with unreadable postmarks.
The court’s majority opinion argued that dismissing a vote mailed on or before election day due to missing postmarks from postal errors would contravene public policy. The justices argued that no valid reason exists to differentiate between ballots with smeared or illegible postmarks and those completely lacking one.
The Nevada Supreme Court upheld a lower court’s ruling Monday, allowing mail-in ballots without postmarks received by Election Day to be counted in the days after the election. https://t.co/rhcuUAQM0f

“If a voter properly and timely casts their vote by mailing their ballot before or on the day of the election, and through a post office omission the ballot is not postmarked, it would go against public policy to discount that properly cast vote,” Nevada’s majority opinion reads.
Justices said they acknowledged the RNC‘s standing due to competitive injury, yet they upheld the lower court’s decision, noting the RNC’s unlikely success in their case, according to the court document. The justices also said both interpretations of the law are reasonable but highlighted discussions among lawmakers during the bill’s passage about allowing the counting of ballots without postmarks. (RELATED: Federal Judge Upholds Arizona Law To Verify Voters’ Citizenship Status)
They further emphasized that the lawmakers intended the legislation to broaden voting methods and simplify the voting process, the court filing added. The court dismissed the notion that mail ballots inherently favor Democrats, thus rejecting any claims of partisan bias in their decision.
Out of the seven justices, five agreed with the majority ruling, according to the court filing. The two remaining justices concurred with the outcome but for differing reasons; one cited inadequate evidence from the appellants, and the other emphasized the imprudence of altering electoral rules so close to election day.
“Requiring ballots to be postmarked on or before election day is a critical election integrity safeguard that ensures ballots mailed after election day are not counted,” RNC Spokesperson Claire Zunk said, The Hill reported. “It is also a requirement of Nevada law. By allowing Nevada officials to ignore the law’s postmark requirement, the state’s highest court has undermined the integrity of Nevada’s elections.”
The RNC did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

The Daily Caller,Conservative Commentator Banned From CNN After Spat With Ex-MSNBC Host Who Labeled Trump Supporters ‘Nazis’,"CNN fired conservative commentator Ryan James Girdusky after a heated Monday night exchange that started after former MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan defended calling Trump supporters Nazis.
CNN host Abby Phillip shared a CNN statement that said Girdusky would not be allowed on the network after the fiery exchange, and apologized to Hasan following the incident. Girdusky had earlier clashed with Phillip over media portrayals of Trump’s Sunday rally at Madison Square Garden before Hasan and Girdusky’s heated exchange. (RELATED: ‘Deeply Dangerous’: MSNBC Host Says Media Needs To Stop Covering ‘Both Sides’ Of Issues)
“Nobody wants to be called Nazis. It‘s very inflammatory, but if you don‘t want to be called Nazis, stop doing-” Hasan said after making the comparison, prompting Girdusky to cut in and say, “You’re called an antisemite more than anyone at this table,”
“Are you calling me an antisemite?” Hasan asked, with Girdusky responding, “No, I’m just saying people call you that.”
WATCH:
Hasan has been a vociferous critic of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and of Israel’s response to the Oct. 7, 2023 attack by the radical Islamic terrorist group Hamas that killed over 1,200 people.
“I’m used to it because I support the Palestinians,” Hasan said.
“Well, I hope your beeper doesn’t go off,” Girdusky responded, referring to an Israeli operation that targeted the radical Islamic terrorist group Hezbollah. Girdusky apologized repeatedly for the remark, saying he thought the former MSNBC host mentioned Hamas. (Watch The Daily Caller Documentary “Anarchy U”)
Girdusky was removed from the panel and Phillip later addressed the exchange on-air after a commercial break.
“I want to just address what happened in the last segment. First, I want to apologize to Mehdi Hasan for what was said at this table. It was completely unacceptable,” Phillip said. “When we get this discussion started, you’ll see that Ryan is not at the table. There is a line that was crossed there and it’s not acceptable to me, it’s not acceptable to us at this network. We want discussion, we want people who disagree with each other to talk to each other, but when you cross the line of a complete lack of civility, that is not going to happen here on this show.”
Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, have escalated attacks on Trump, labeling him a “fascist” during an Oct. 24 CNN town hall. Walz compared Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden to a 1939 rally by Nazi sympathizers Sunday. “Morning Joe” co-host Mika Brzezinski called the rally at Madison Square Garden hate speech Monday, while Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson compared it to the Nazi rally on the MSNBC morning program Tuesday.

The Daily Caller,"EXCLUSIVE: Ted Cruz Campaign Accuses Political Opponent Of Violating Federal Law With Chuck Schumer, Fellow Democrats","Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s campaign filed a complaint Thursday with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) against Democratic Rep. Colin Allred. The senator is claiming his opponent is operating illegally in coordination with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC).
The Daily Caller first obtained a copy of the complaint, which states that Allred and his Senate campaign are illegally coordinating with Schumer and the DSCC on television ads that exceeded the coordinated party expenditure limit, resulting in potentially millions of dollars in excessive in-kind contributions from DSCC to Allred.
The complaint specifically mentions four advertisements that the Cruz campaign believes meets the criteria for qualifying as “hybrid ads.” The campaign says that the DSCC must be held accountable for allegedly presenting an advisory opinion request to the commission under false pretenses and making representations that it now fails to abide by.
“Colin Allred’s campaign is illegally coordinating with Chuck Schumer and the DSCC. We are calling on the FEC to immediately investigate and put a stop to this flagrant violation of federal law,” a Cruz campaign spokesperson told the Daily Caller.

The race between Cruz and Allred remains very tight. Polling shows Cruz and Allred are neck and neck as Allred has continued to pitch himself as a moderate candidate and has been distancing himself from Vice President Kamala Harris and her bid for the presidency as polling continues to tighten between her and former President Donald Trump.

(DAILY CALLER OBTAINED) — … by Henry Rodgers
“Allred and his Senate campaign are blatantly coordinating with the DSCC on television ads far in excess of the coordinated party expenditure limit, thus resulting in potentially millions of dollars in excessive in-kind contributions from DSCC to Allred. Complainants ask the Federal Election Commission (‘FEC’ or ‘Commission’) to immediately investigate and put a stop to this flagrant violation of federal law,” the complaint states.

The Daily Caller,‘I’m Nervous’: Sense Of Unease Persists Among Harris Rally Crowd,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – American flags waving, USA signs in hand, snacking on Pop-Tarts and cotton candy, thousands and thousands of Kamala Harris supporters squeezed into the Ellipse to see the vice president make her final pitch for the White House.
The joy was high. But even at a high-energy, packed rally, some of Harris’s supporters expressed a sense of nervousness about what would happen Nov. 5 and beyond.
“I’m very nervous honestly. I think Trump might win. I don’t know,” one female student from Maryland told the Daily Caller as her friend nodded in agreement. The Caller granted anonymity to the Harris supporters so they could speak freely about their thoughts.
Another rally goer, a woman from Maryland in the travel industry, remarked that the Harris event was very joyful, but she felt anxiety over the vice president’s chances.
“I am confident that she will get the popular vote but I am worried about the electoral college,” she told the Caller. “The electoral college does not go with the American people.”
Across a majority of polls, both nationally and in swing states, Harris and Donald Trump have been locked neck-and-neck. The vice president rode a honeymoon wave into the Democratic National Convention this summer, helped by dodging media interviews for the first month of her campaign.
But as pressure from the media built up, Harris eventually began to do more press. Some repeated lines and non-answers began to quell her momentum, and the Trump campaign started to surge back.
The two female Maryland students the Caller spoke to said they believed the media’s coverage of Harris had been unfair compared to Trump, which they think could be hurting Harris’s chances. They added they were nervous people may not elect Harris because she is a woman.
“I think there is a lot of misogyny, I don’t think people want to see a woman as president,” one of the students told the Caller.

The vice president took the stage shortly after 7:30 p.m., speaking for just over thirty minutes to a crowd that extended up the National Mall. Harris capitalized on the location of her rally, the Ellipse, where Trump addressed his supporters ahead of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. She called the former president a “petty tyrant” that is “obsessed with revenge,” alleging that he would use the military against his enemies if elected to the White House. (RELATED: Harris Completes Pivot To Failed ‘Democracy’ Message With Speech At J6 Site)
While Harris was on stage, Biden, sitting in her backdrop in the White House, was igniting a firestorm.
The president attended a get-out-the-vote call on Tuesday hosted by Voto Latino where he responded to a joke made by comic Tony Hinchcliffe. During Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally over the weekend, Hinchcliffe called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage.” The president called Trump a “failed businessman” with “no character” before saying the only garbage “floating out there is his supporters.”
“Biden may have done some pretty significant harm [to the Harris campaign],” CNN’s Abby Phillip admitted Wednesday.
The backlash forced Harris to address the situation first thing this morning.
“Listen, I think that first of all, he clarified his comments. Let me be clear, I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for,” the vice president began.
“You heard my speech last night and continuously throughout my career. I believe that the work that I do is about representing all the people, whether they support me or not, and as president of the United States I will be a president for all Americans whether you vote for me or not. I have that responsibility and that’s the kind of work I’ve done my entire career and I take it very seriously,” she continued.
Harris’s biggest fans aren’t the only ones worried about the vice president’s chances. Top Democrats are too, and some are even beginning to discuss who to blame if Trump wins, Axios reported Friday.
What it will come down to, another Harris supporter said, is the media coverage of the vice president, despite her belief that she is very qualified for the job.
“I guess it’s the way the media [has treated her] and I don’t think they are treating her on the same level they are treating Trump,” Michelle Cole, a retired investment banker from New Jersey, told the Caller.
“I don’t know. I’m nervous,” she said.",2024-10-30
The Daily Caller,Florida Sues Biden-Harris DOJ For Allegedly Blocking Trump Assassination Attempt Investigation,"Florida sued the Biden-Harris administration’s Department of Justice (DOJ) Wednesday for allegedly blocking the state’s investigation into the second Trump assassination attempt.
Federal officials almost immediately began “taking steps to halt the state’s investigation” into Ryan Wesley Routh, who was indicted for attempting to assassinate former President Donald Trump at his Florida golf course in September, the lawsuit states.
“Every day that Florida is prevented from investigating, the State’s case becomes harder to prove at trial,” the lawsuit states. “By contrast, the federal government suffers no injury from Florida investigating state law crimes, as the State has no intention of interfering with or obstructing the federal investigation.” (RELATED: Trump Assassination Attempt Suspect Seeks Judge’s Recusal From Case)
Republican Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed an executive order two days after the Sept. 15 attempt directing Florida law enforcement agencies to investigate and ensure violations of state law were referred for prosecution.
Attorney General Ashley Moody wrote a letter Sept. 23 to FBI Director Christopher Wray indicating it would be a “mistake” to frustrate Florida’s investigation.
In a Sept. 30 response, U.S. Attorney Lapointe said the state cannot conduct investigative activities until the federal prosecution is complete, according to the lawsuit. Federal officials indicated that activities like interviewing potential witnesses are illegal under federal law, the lawsuit states.
Routh was initially charged with two gun offenses. The DOJ later charged him with attempted assassination on Sept. 24.
The statute Routh was charged under states that local authority will be suspended once federal jurisdiction is asserted.
The DOJ declined to comment on the lawsuit.

The Daily Caller,‘An Absolute Wimping Out’: Fox News Guest Roasts WaPo Decision To Sit Out Election,"Fox News media analyst Howard Kurtz said Friday that the Washington Post was a “profile in non-courage” when it elected not to endorse in the 2024 presidential election.
The Post’s decision, which it announced Friday, followed a similar move by the Los Angeles Times, which said it would make no endorsement Tuesday. Kurtz noted that the non-endorsements, which were ordered by the owners of the newspapers, resulted in a “backlash.” (RELATED: ‘A Case For Panic’: ‘Morning Joe’ Guest Says Kamala Harris Has ‘Good Reason To Worry’ About Election)
WATCH:
“Look, this is a profile in non-courage, an absolute wimping out. Now Jeff Bezos does have the right to do this, but at the same time, the other 364 days a year, the liberal Washington Post tells us what to think about everything, every issue under the sun, and all of a sudden comes onto the most important question like, ‘Oh, we couldn’t possibly give you our opinion now,’” Kurtz, a former Washington Post employee, told Fox News host Martha MacCallum.
“And so I think Jeff Bezos, by the way, does a lot of business with the federal government through his rocket company, through Amazon, and he may fear that Trump is going to win, and he doesn’t want to exacerbate their already testy relationship,” Kurtz said.
MacCallum noted that not only had the Post and Times stayed neutral, but she also noted the non-endorsement decisions from the Teamsters and the International Association of Fire Fighters earlier in the campaign.
“In both cases, L.A. Times and Washington Post, there were editorials drafted favoring Kamala Harris, and the billionaire owner of the L.A. Times not only killed it, but three top editors have now resigned in protest when people have canceled their subscriptions, so the idea that, oh, we don’t want to be divisive and this is up to our readers to make up their minds, sure most newspaper editorials don’t matter much anymore, but it is interesting that they are pulling back on this, the most important decision of the year, after they’ve lectured us all on every issue,” Kurtz said.
“They’ve been anti-Trump mostly, more recently largely pro-Kamala Harris, and yet both of the owners are saying, I run the place, and you’re not running that Harris endorsement,’” he continued. (Watch The Daily Caller Documentary “Cleaning Up Kamala”)

The Daily Caller,What Happens If Trump Wins?,"Blocks from the U.S. Capitol, a limo burst into flames moments after dropping guests off at Donald Trump’s inauguration.
Flares and bricks flew through its windows. The driver, Luis Villarroel, fled his torched car, which belonged to a Muslim immigrant small business owner.
Throughout D.C., store windows were smashed, car doors dented. Police stood shoulder to shoulder unloading pepper spray on protesters.
In the middle of the chaos, Trump put his hand on the Bible, took an oath and became the 45th president of the United States.
“In 2016, I just don’t think that the population was prepared for it, and that’s why we didn’t see wider-spread unrest, because nobody expected it to happen,” Richie McGinniss, a longtime video journalist who has covered social unrest for years, told the Caller. McGinnis was previously the video director for the Daily Caller.
“I hate to say it, but it’s going to be a lot worse [in 2024] than it was in 2016 if Trump wins.”
In 2016, Trump stunned the nation by defeating Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Instantly, Democrats were shocked and began to melt down. Images of Clinton supporters falling to their knees, crying and screaming, went viral.

Much of the corporate media was no less hysterical, decrying Jan. 20, 2017 as a dark day for America.
Eight years later, after being dragged from courthouse to courthouse, two assassination attempts and being labeled a “fascist” by his opponents daily, Trump has a real chance at another victory against long odds. The Daily Caller spoke to various experts across the political landscape about what to expect if that happens. From violence in the streets, to Democrats’ plans to contest a Trump win, to the media meltdown, to election lawfare from Democratic super-lawyer Marc Elias, they all predicted a much more dangerous and extreme response this time around if the “threat to democracy” is democratically elected.
McGinniss told the Caller he is preparing for unrest across the country that will be more intense than what was seen in 2016. He says nearly a decade of persistent anti-Trump messaging will be an accelerant for extremism.
“[We’ve been] told that, effectively, our country is going to be under a dictatorship if Trump wins,” McGinniss told the Caller.
He predicted that violent activists throughout the country would target the nearest avatar of the government they could find, whether that be federal courthouses or police precincts.
Julio Rosas, a national correspondent for The Blaze who has years of experience covering riots and social unrest, had a similar prediction, adding that migrants who have been let into the country under the Biden-Harris administration may join in big cities such as New York and Chicago. Above all, Rosas said protests can be expected because violent demonstrators have never learned their lesson.

“Why it’s a guarantee the left riots is because they’ve gotten away with it for so long,” Rosas told the Caller. “There hasn’t been that huge government crackdown, like January 6.”
McGinniss said he has seen the warning signs of organized protests in the event of a Trump victory. Maryland Rep. Jamie Raskin, an influential figure among House Democrats, hasn’t committed to certifying a Trump victory, telling Axios that he would only move forward if the former president “won a free, fair and honest election.”
Such comments led McGinniss to warn that Democrats are already preparing to hit the streets, especially if the party apparatus attempts to cloud the legitimacy of Trump’s victory.
“In that case, you’d see not just pockets of rioting and stuff, but you’d see actual organized, ‘stop the steal’ style stuff,” McGinniss said.
“When that happens on the left, we all know, once the sun goes down, there’s a whole other group of people who [come out],” he added, noting that “more chaos” helps their chance at “keeping Trump out of office.”
Raskin’s comments also caught the attention of conservative election integrity advocates and Trump allies.
“It sounds like Jamie Raskin is trying to start a civil war,” Mike Davis, a Trump-aligned lawyer and founder of the Article III Project, told the Caller.
History indicates that the Raskins and rioters of the world will be egged on by corporate media.
“The Atlantic story is a great preview of what we can expect, which is pure hysteria over Trump being a fascist that’s going to use the military to force his will into existence against the American people,” The Spectator’s Washington editor Amber Duke told the Caller. Duke was previously a media reporter and then White House correspondent for the Caller.
The Atlantic story that Duke highlighted was published Tuesday by Editor-In-Chief Jeffrey Goldberg, who alleged that the former president praised Hitler while also disparaging a deceased veteran and her family. Instantly, the family, their lawyer and former Trump administration officials pushed back on the story, with figures close to Trump denying he had made the comments. Vice President Kamala Harris ran with it anyway, giving a rare unexpected address to push the fascism narrative. (RELATED: The Atlantic’s October Surprise On Trump Implodes After Denials Galore From Everyone Involved)
Duke believes this line of attack will intensify as critics paint the former president as a “dictator, a fascist who will never give up power.”
The Harris campaign also appears ready to engage in legal battles after the election. In August, the vice president hired back Marc Elias, one of the party’s top lawyers. In 2020, Elias played a leading role in hundreds of lawsuits seeking to make it easier to vote and undo Republican efforts to make elections more secure. He did the same in 2022, engaging in nearly 50 lawsuits in an effort to change election laws to Democrats’ liking.

In March, Republicans and their lawyers were concerned about the security of November’s election. Compared to Democrats, the Republican National Committee has been decades behind on the issue because of a 1982 consent decree that forbade them from engaging on many election integrity initiatives. But once that consent decree was lifted in 2018, the party began to rebuild, and by 2024 a fully-funded and staffed election integrity department was created. This cycle, the party has filed more than 100 election integrity lawsuits on issues ranging from removing non-citizens from voter rolls to implementing stricter checks on ballot validity.
A Trump campaign official previously told the Caller that what happened on the election integrity front in 2020 will not happen again in 2024.
Davis agreed.
“President Trump learned his lesson from 2020 … He has hired a very good legal team led by David Warrington on his campaign, along with a very good legal team led by RNC Chairman Michael Whatley,” Davis told the Caller.
Davis said the legal teams were being far more proactive in getting injunctions against Democratic initiatives this time around: “That was the mistake in 2020: they didn’t get injunctions … They’re doing it this time,” he added.
But Republicans agree that regardless of what work they do before Nov. 5, Democrats will turn to lawfare in the days and weeks thereafter if Trump prevails in the election.
“Democrats have used the claim of voter suppression to oppose every good election reform. Every reform proposed, whether it’s voter ID … cleaning up voter rolls, they always claim that’s voter suppression,” Hans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow focusing on election integrity at the Heritage Foundation, said, adding that data shows when voter ID is required, turnout goes up.
“But what I expect is that in any state where they lose, if it’s a close loss, they’re going to make general claims of voter suppression,” Hans explained.
He predicted that wherever an ID requirement was used or people were turned away from the polls, “the voter suppression claim” will be a fixture of Democrats’ post-election narrative.
To defeat Democrats in the legal arena, Davis said the key is for Trump supporters to turn out early.

“Early voting is crucial because it guarantees that your voters can actually vote and don’t get disenfranchised on Election Day,” Davis explained, adding that early voting allows the Trump campaign to spend more resources on voters who haven’t turned out yet.
Duke predicted that early voting will be the crutch Democrats use to cope with a Trump victory. She explained she recently heard the argument that because journalists are reporting turnout numbers ahead of time, they are “suppressing turnout” before the election even arrives.
“I guess the Democrats are going to be against early voting because it didn’t go in their favor this time around,” Duke remarked.
Violence in the streets, a media meltdown and lawsuits would be predictable results of a second Trump victory. Security concerns may not be top of mind, but former Secret Service members said they should be.
Three months ago the former president took a shot to the head. Since then, reports have shown the Secret Service is not in a position to adequately protect him. The former agents warned that Trump could be in more danger as the 47th president than ever.
“This is uncharted territory for the Secret Service. I’ve never seen a threat landscape like we see now directed against President Trump,” former secret service agent Tim Miller told the Caller.
Miller explained that right now everyone is worried about “the guy on the roof with a rifle,” but he raised concerns about a car bomb, a plane, a biohazard attack — all things Trump could be susceptible to if the Secret Service isn’t prepared. And as of right now, he told the Caller, it seems as if they are not ready to handle the magnitude of the situation. (RELATED: Despite Skyrocketing Budget, Secret Service Can’t Seem To Find The Money To Protect The President)
“The Secret Service ought to be the most technology-savvy organization in all of government, and yet they’re 10 years behind the Department of Defense in terms of drone technology,” Miller told the Caller.
Miller compared agents’ lack of experience with drone technology at Trump’s Butler, Pennsylvania rally to a pro football team showing up to a game without a ball.
Miller made it clear that he didn’t fault the officers themselves for being ill-prepared, rather he saw the leadership to blame.
Rich Staropoli, a former Secret Service agent, told the Caller that Trump’s high-profile family and global threats will bring additional security concerns not considered under the Biden administration. The biggest issue, however, is the agency’s lack of ability to retain officers.
“When I was there, we never had a problem going to other federal agencies and saying, ‘hey, we need a dozen guys. We need 50 guys,'” Staropoli told the Caller, adding that help was provided and legalities were sorted out later.
“Where’s the hesitancy in doing that? But it’s obvious it isn’t being done. That’s a problem,” Staropoli continued.
There is one other person to consider in the aftermath of the Nov. 5 election: Kamala Harris.
Democrats have rallied behind Harris in 2024 after a tumultuous term as vice president. Her future in Democratic politics could rest in the balance of Nov. 5’s results.
“They would not be happy to lose, but either outcome would be fine to them,” Duke told the Caller. “On one hand, they win, and on the other they get rid of Kamala.”",2024-10-27
The Daily Caller,‘The Dang Thing Would Explode’: Sen. John Kennedy Suggests Kamala Harris Could Break A Polygraph By Walking Near It,"Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana sarcastically remarked during a Saturday night appearance on Fox News that Vice President Kamala Harris could cause a polygraph machine to blow up by simply walking near it.
Harris has escalated attacks on former President Donald Trump, most recently labeling him a “fascist” during a CNN town hall on Wednesday. While speaking to Fox News’ Brian Kilmeade, Kennedy said that Harris is falling behind Trump because Americans are “uncertain” about what she would do if elected to the presidency. (RELATED: ‘You’ve Lied To Us’: Chris Sununu Blasts Kamala Harris For ‘Absolutely Condescending’ Campaign)
WATCH:
“It’s worth examining why Vice President Harris is now behind,” Kennedy told Kilmeade. “I think she’s behind because of all her gauzy rhetoric. People are uncertain about her. They don’t know if she has the right stuff to be president. They’re worried that she doesn’t, they’re worried that she was that kid in grade school who ate paste, they just don’t know. She hasn’t — she won’t be pinned down, I think in some cases she’s lying. People are worried that if she walked by a polygraph machine, the dang thing would explode.”
“People want to know what their president is going to do,” Kennedy continued. “Now, I’ll tell you the other thing that’s changed in this race other than the vice president behind. Vice President Harris has adopted a new strategy. Joy is out. She’s adopted the Hillary Clinton deplorable strategy of 2016, which is if you vote for President Trump, you are a bad person.”
A July poll by YouGov for The Times showed that 54% of respondents believed that President Joe Biden’s health issues were covered up, with 68% of those respondents saying they felt Harris had “a lot” to do with concealing the truth about Biden’s health. Trump accused Harris of lying about working at McDonald’s as a teenager, and her campaign has yet to provide evidence suggesting that she did. (Watch The Daily Caller Documentary “Cleaning Up Kamala”)
Harris has also reportedly backed away from left-wing positions she held during her campaign for the 2020 Democratic Party nomination for president, primarily through statements by campaign aides to reporters.
Trump leads Harris by 0.1% in the RealClearPolling average of polls from Oct. 11 to 26, and maintains that margin when Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein, independent candidate Cornel West and Libertarian candidate Chase Oliver are included in surveys.

The Daily Caller,‘Shut The Hell Up’: Charlamagne Melts Down Over Caller Saying Trump Isn’t ‘Nazi’,"Radio host Charlamagne Tha God on Thursday appeared to lose his temper at a Virginia caller named Mike who asserted former President Donald Trump’s record proves he is not a bigot.
Trump’s former White House chief of staff, John Kelly, told The New York Times and The Atlantic that the former president exhibited “fascist” tendencies and allegedly praised Adolf Hitler, which the Trump campaign has denied. Mike, on “The Breakfast Club,” said Trump’s history of publicly associating with prominent black figures indicates he’s not “racist,” but Charlamagne sharply disagreed, challenging Mike’s logic and trying to dismantle his argument. (RELATED: Harris Fails To Explain Flip-Flops, Says She Has No Regrets About Biden In First Interview)
LISTEN:
“No disrespect to nobody, man. I know everybody in that radio station more than likely gon’ vote Democrat, but it’s just kind of funny, the rhetoric about Trump being a racist,” Mike said. “I mean, I do my Googles, man and I see this man having pictures with all kinds of famous black people that you guys are fans of, especially I see him standing next to Rosa Parks. I mean, for crying out loud people, how can this man be a Nazi, a Hitler? That shit is crazy. No disrespect.”
“So that’s all it takes? So if you take a picture with a gay person, does that make you gay?” Charlamagne asked, to which Mike answered, “Nah.”
The radio host then told the caller to “shut the hell up” and asked, “What are you talking about?”
“No Nazi, no Hitler will ever take a picture with black people, man, will never do any kind of favors to black people,” Mike responded.
“That’s not true,” Charlamagne retorted. “Slave masters used to sleep with slaves. And what? Slave masters would have babies with slaves. And what?”
Mike responded that we’re beyond “slavery times.”
“So let me ask you a question, serious question … You think you don’t encounter no racist white people everyday, you think just because they interact with you and they engage with you, you think that they’re not racist?” Charlamagne asked, with Mike answering, “No.”
The show then hung up on the caller, with Charlamagne saying, “I can’t listen to that.”
Trump currently holds narrow leads over Vice President Kamala Harris in all of the seven top swing states, according to RealClearPolling averages. The caller before Mike on “The Breakfast Club” described Trump as “Hitler Jr.” but told Charlamagne he still wouldn’t be voting for Harris due to his distrust of Democrats.
“I don’t trust the Democrats, bruh. As a black man in America, we done been lied to so long. Promises have never been kept,” he said. “I’ma just keep it a buck. I’m not voting this year … I don’t trust the Democrats, and I damn sure ain’t voting for Hitler Jr. Whatever happens gon’ happen.”
“Well, if you not votin’ and Hitler Jr. wins, then you know you gon’ have to blame yourself,” Charlamagne retorted. “You gon’ have to take some of the blame.”

The Daily Caller,UK Socialist Leader Insists He’s Still Good Friends With Trump After Party Staffers Plan Trip To Help Harris,"United Kingdom (U.K.) Prime Minister Keir Starmer — a self-admitted socialist — is insisting he’s very good friends with former President Donald Trump, even as Trump’s campaign has recently filed a complaint against Starmer’s party for sending staffers to campaign for Kamala Harris.
There were reports last week that a high-level Labour Party staffer was organizing a trip to fly approximately 100 party staffers into the U.S. to campaign on behalf of Harris’ campaign, raising concerns about potential foreign election interference. Trump’s campaign filed a legal complaint against the Labour Party following the reports, but Starmer brushed aside concerns that the move was illegal and assured reporters on Wednesday that he was still “good friends” with Trump, according to multiple reports. (RELATED: ‘Unacceptable’: County Fires Election Worker After Republican Spots Ballot Security Lapse In Realtime)
Starmer is now the prime minister of the U.K. after the Labour Party won the country’s elections in July, ousting the Conservative Party and former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak from power. Starmer will have to work with either Trump or Harris on maintaining U.S.-U.K. relations depending on which candidate wins in the November presidential elections.
“I spent time in New York with President Trump, had dinner with him and my purpose in doing that was to make sure that between the two of us, we established a good relationship, which we did,” Starmer told reporters. “We had a good, constructive discussion and, of course, as prime minister of the United Kingdom I will work with whoever the American people return as their president.”
Starmer also told reporters that Labour had sent staffers to volunteer in previous U.S. elections, according to reports.
“They’re doing it in their spare time, they’re doing it as volunteers, they’re staying I think with other volunteers over there. That’s what they’ve done in previous elections, that’s what they’re doing in this election and that’s really straightforward,” Starmer said.
The Labour Party said it isn’t funding the trip and that staffers choosing to go campaign on behalf of Harris have to go on their own dime, according to Politico EU.
The rules and regulations surrounding how foreign nationals can participate in the U.S. election process are strict. Besides the obvious law prohibiting foreign nationals from voting in a U.S. election, they also cannot donate to a political campaign, according to the Federal Election Commission (FEC). Foreign nationals can volunteer for a campaign, but they cannot be a part of the decision-making process as to how the campaign should operate.
The Labour Party insists its staffer trip to the U.S. is in compliance with these laws, according to Politico EU. But the Trump campaign feels there are aspects to the trip that may be crossing the line.
“Those searching for foreign interference in our elections need to look no further than [the] LinkedIn post,” the Trump campaign wrote in a legal complaint to the FEC.
The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Walz engaged in the secret tryst with Jenna Wang, then an English language teacher, during his 1989 teaching stint in the Chinese city Foshan, she told the Daily Mail.
Wang claimed the pair did not show any public affection to each other as it apparently would have bothered Wang’s father, Bin Hui, a high-ranking CCP official and chairman of a labor union in her home city Guilin, according to the outlet. Walz married Gwen Whipple in 1994.
“My father would have been very, very angry and sad if he had found out,” Wang told the outlet.
The pair allegedly slept together and spent nights romantically dancing to the song “Careless Whisper” by George Michael, according to the outlet.
The pair apparently talked about getting married, she told the Daily Mail. She claimed she left her teaching post in 1992 because she thought their relationship would become official.
Things soured, however, when Walz allegedly insinuated Wang was only marrying him for a US passport.
“This was very offensive,” Wang told the outlet. “I wasn’t giving up my life and my position to move to Nebraska, a cold place in the middle of nowhere that most Chinese people had never heard of.”
Wang said the way Walz treated her made her feel “like a prostitute” and claimed she contemplated killing herself as a result, the Daily Mail reported.
“Knowing now that he wasn’t going to marry me made me feel cheap and common,” Wang told the outlet. (RELATED: ‘Timmy Got Issues’: Edgar The Puppet’s Rap Debut | MUSIC VIDEO OUT NOW)
Walz’s alleged clandestine affair is another chapter in what is becoming a long and complex Chinese backstory for the Democratic Minnesota governor.
After his initial August 1989 teaching trip to Foshan, Walz started to head up yearly summer visits to China with students from Nebraska and Minnesota, according to the Daily Mail.
His cultural enrichment extended both ways as he also invited CCP officials to his Nebraska classroom in 1996, according to exclusive reporting from the Daily Caller News Foundation (DCNF).
He also appointed a man affiliated with a minor Chinese political party “loyal” to the CCP to a state board in Minnesota in May 2020, according to the DCNF.
Walz received a mountain of criticism after seemingly lying about being in China during the deadly Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. The protests took place from April to June 1989, according to Britannica. Walz previously claimed, in separate instances, that he was there in May and June 1989. He later walked back those statements and claimed he was a knucklehead. CheckYourFact reported that Walz likely did not travel to China until August of that year.
“Tim lied about Tiananmen Square and he’s lied about other things,” Wang told the Daily Mail
‘This is a very crucial moment in history and a man like this does not appear to have the character and integrity to do one of the most important jobs in the world,” Wang concluded.",2024-10-28
The Daily Caller,‘There Wasn’t One’: Dana Bash Says Kamala Harris Failed To ‘Close The Deal’ On Policy During Town Hall,"CNN host Dana Bash conceded Wednesday night that Vice President Kamala Harris was not able to “close the deal” with voters on policy during a town hall hosted by the network.
Harris took part in the town hall moderated by CNN host Anderson Cooper, during which she called former President Donald Trump a fascist, but also delivered “word salad” answers. Bash said that Harris did not outline any legislative priorities for a potential administration. (RELATED: ‘She Did Very Poorly’: Geraldo Rivera Hammers Harris Over Response To Border Questions)
WATCH:
“I’ll just tell you what I’m hearing from people who I have been talking to, and that is that if her goal was to close the deal, they’re not sure she did that. And, you know, some people have asked, is she being held to a different standard? Maybe,” Bash said. “But that’s maybe the world that she’s living in.”
“And on the question of who she is, people are understanding that a little bit more. But what she will do, the question about her legislative priorities, name one, there wasn’t one,” Bash told CNN host Jake Tapper. “You know, some more of her personality and her sort of character questions about your weaknesses or what mistakes did you make, not necessarily the answers there. Having said that, any time that she can be in front of an audience and interacting with voters is a win as far as her campaign goes, and they are very happy about that.”
Harris initially rarely did interviews and had not taken questions at a press conference since replacing President Joe Biden after he announced he would not seek reelection July 21. She did a media blitz earlier in October, which included an Oct. 16 interview with Fox News host Bret Baier, who pressed the vice president on the border and Biden’s declining health.
Prior to the interview with Baier, Harris did interviews or appearances with “60 Minutes,” shock jock Howard Stern, the co-hosts of “The View,” the “Call Her Daddy” podcast and CBS late-night host Stephen Colbert. (Watch The Daily Caller Documentary “Cleaning Up Kamala”)
A Wall Street Journal poll shows Trump leading Harris by two points, 47% to 45%, with the vice president’s favorability at only 45% compared to a 53% unfavorable rating two weeks before the Nov. 5 election.
Trump trails Harris by 0.2% in the RealClearPolling average of polls from Oct. 8 to 22, with the gap increasing to 0.6% when Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein, independent candidate Cornel West and Libertarian candidate Chase Oliver are included in surveys.

The Daily Caller,‘He’s A Reminder Of The Last Four Years’: Harris Campaign Keeps Its Distance From Joe Biden: REPORT,"The Harris campaign is reportedly keeping its distance from President Joe Biden, who wants to campaign for his vice president in the final days before the election.
Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris’s team is passively resisting Biden’s increasingly assertive efforts to stump for Harris as concerns about optics reach a crescendo, Axios reported.
“He’s a reminder of the last four years, not the new way forward,” one person familiar with the situation told the outlet.

The Harris campaign has repeatedly responded to Biden’s requests to campaign with “we’ll get back to you,” three people familiar with the dynamic told Axios. Another person familiar with the situation compared it to “a slow-moving break-up.”
The Harris campaign’s “Day Ahead” email blast for Saturday excluded Biden’s solo campaign stops in Pittsburgh, according to Axios.
Biden’s unpopularity is the main deterrent to a joint appearance from the president and Harris, the outlet reported. Biden currently sits at a 39% approval rating, according to FiveThirtyEight’s average.
Axios reported that Harris’s campaign considers Biden to be a “political liability.” However, the vice president’s team reportedly refuses to be direct with Biden to avoid bruising his ego or hurting his feelings. (RELATED: Biden Will Not Appear With Kamala Harris Before Election Day: REPORT)
Many Biden staffers believe the president can help Harris, citing the decades-old Democratic politician’s coalitions in white, working-class communities. Biden has spent much time in the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania, where Republican nominee Donald Trump leads Harris by 0.6%, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average.
Harris said her prospective presidency would not be a “continuation” of the Biden-Harris administration in her Oct. 16 interview with Fox News anchor Bret Baier.
NBC News reported on Oct. 20 that no plans exist for Biden to appear alongside Harris.

The Daily Caller,Feds Fund ‘Environmental Justice’ Literacy And ‘LGBTQ+’ Health In Chicago Public Schools As Students Fall Behind,"Roughly 40% of public school students in Chicago are chronically absent, commonly defined as missing at least 10% of days in a given school year, and the vast majority of the students actually showing up to class lack proficiency in math and reading. Amid these conditions, CPS asked federal agencies for funds to increase students’ “literacy for environmental justice” and to improve “mental health equity” for racial minority and “LGBTQ+” pupils, according to government spending records.
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) awarded over $400,000 to CPS in August after the district requested funds to help improve the health of its “LGBTQ+” and newcomer students, according to government spending records. The six-figure grant will help address the issues that arise from higher rates of risky sexual behavior, drug usage and worse mental health statuses among LGBT students. (Stream The Daily Caller’s documentary ‘Cleaning Up Kamala’ HERE)
Even as the proportion of chronically absent students remains high, and as test scores remain low, CPS boasts a graduation rate of 83%. The Illinois Policy Institute, a right-of-center think tank, has accused CPS of “promoting students who haven’t mastered critical skills” and argued that doing so “is unfair to those students and sets them up for frustration later in life.”
Another grant appeal CPS made to HHS cites the disproportionately poor health outcomes of black and “Latinx” students to request resources to fund “training for [a] mental health equity” program that “links mental health awareness with a foundational understanding of bias-based harm,” records show. The grant, worth nearly a half million dollars and awarded to the district in August, will train school administrators to improve their proficiency in “recognizing, preventing, responding to and transforming incidents of bias and discrimination.”
As of 2023, over 80% of CPS students between third and eighth grade failed to meet grade-level standards for math with roughly three-quarters failing to meet the standards for reading, according to the Illinois Policy Institute. While students struggle with basic literacy in Chicago, the school board has appealed to the federal government to foster “literacy for environmental justice” among students, according to federal records.
The Department of Commerce (DOC) approved a $75,000 grant proposal from CPS to prepare students for “success in civic life” by teaching them to investigate and understand “scientific solutions which build resilience to extreme weather and climate change,” according to federal spending records.
As CPS requested financial assistance to fund environmental and racial justice, the district faced a half-billion-dollar deficit coming into this school year, The Washington Post reported. The financial shortfall was the product of CPS’ refusal to make spending cuts as the district’s $2.8 billion in COVID-19 relief funding dries up. Even as the district faces an uncertain financial future, the local teachers’ union is pushing for more hiring and increased pay.
“This is what it looks like when you burn a district down,” Georgetown University education professor Marguerite Roza told The Post. “It is a level of dysfunction that feels beyond destabilizing, enough to make people lose confidence in the system.”
Amid the failure to resolve the budgetary tension with the mayor, every member of Chicago’s school board resigned in October.
CPS, DOC and HHS did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s requests for comment.

The Daily Caller,DOJ Sends Musk’s PAC Warning Over $1 Million Voter Lottery,"The Justice Department(DOJ) reportedly notified Elon Musk’s America PAC that its $1 million sweepstakes for registered voters in key swing states might contravene federal regulations, according to The Wall Street Journal.
These payments might breach laws against compensating people to register or vote in elections involving federal candidates, according to the DOJ’s letter, WSJ reported. Musk’s political action committee has been actively promoting the chance to win $1 million for registered voters in Pennsylvania and six other pivotal states who pledge their support for free speech and gun rights by signing a petition.
The America Pac declined to comment but a spokesperson earlier claimed their cash awards were entirely legal, suggesting that the outcry from media only aids their cause. “The PAC is confident in the legality of this initiative and the predictable media meltdown is only helping America PAC’s efforts to support President Trump,” a representative said earlier this week, WSJ stated.
The Justice Department has written to Elon Musk’s America PAC cautioning him that giving cash payments to voters who sign a petition might violate federal law, according to people familiar with the matter https://t.co/4AcFbc6jic

Three voters from Pennsylvania and one in North Carolina have secured million-dollar rewards, with daily drawings set to continue through Election Day, targeting both new and existing registrants, WSJ reported. Musk stated that the million-dollar rewards from his PAC come without conditions, except for the expectation that winners advocate for his petition.
The sweepstakes aims to boost voter registrations in battleground areas as he fervently supports former President Donald Trump’s re-election bid. Musk announced at a Pennsylvania rally for Trump’s campaign Saturday evening that he will give $1 million daily to one individual.

UCLA law professor Rick Hasen previously raised a question about whether a constitutional amendment is necessary to curb the campaign influence of ultra-wealthy individuals like Musk. Hasen pointed out on MSNBC that under current law, efforts to curb election spending by the ultra-rich have been deemed unconstitutional, affirming the legality of Musk’s activities with his super PAC and other ventures.

The Daily Caller,Biden Official Says Quiet Part Out Loud: ‘No One Is Listening To Him’,"A Biden official admitted Tuesday to Axios that “no one is listening” to the 81-year-old president after he appeared to claim former President Donald Trump needs to be locked up.
While on a trip to New Hampshire to talk about lowering the cost of prescription drugs, President Joe Biden said “we gotta lock him up” after discussing what he expected Trump to do during a second term. Moments later, the president appeared to clean his comments up by adding, “politically, lock him up.” One of the president’s officials responded to the remarks in a statement to Axios, admitting that the president has lost his star power and the comments will soon be forgotten. (RELATED: Biden And Obama Bad-Mouth Harris At Funeral, Pro Lip-Reader Claims)
“For better or worse, no one is listening to him anymore and his words have little power and less reach. It’s a blip. Gone in any meaningful way by mid-day tomorrow if it makes it that long,” a Biden official said, according to Axios national correspondent Alex Thompson.

The president’s comments come after the vice president’s team seemingly sidelined the 81-year-old from the campaign trail, three Harris campaign officials and three White House officials told NBC News. Biden last appeared on the campaign trail with Harris on Sept. 2 for a joint rally. The vice president has struggled to separate herself from the president and articulate how she would lead differently.
After telling The View he thought he could still beat Trump, the president also dodged the perfect opportunity to defend his vice president after she got in a back and forth with Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over hurricane recovery efforts.
“Mr. President, does Gov. DeSantis need to take Vice President Harris’s calls?” RealClearPolitics White House correspondent Phil Wegmann asked.
“All I can tell you is I’ve talked to Gov. DeSantis. He’s been very gracious. He’s thanked me for all we’ve done. He knows what we are doing, and I think that’s important,” the president answered before leaving the room.",2024-10-23
The Daily Caller,The Left’s ‘Jim Crow 2.0’ Propaganda Crumbles For Good As States Set Early Voting Records,"Since the 2020 election and its climax on Jan. 6, 2021, the Democratic Party, its activists and its media apparatchiks have portrayed Republican-led election integrity efforts as a sinister plot to disenfranchise black voters and rebuild Jim Crow South.
The unhinged rhetoric had its origins in the battleground state of Georgia, where, in March 2021, the state passed a law that placed restrictions on absentee ballots and enhanced the verification process for said ballots, requiring a photo ID, driver’s license or state ID number or the last four digits of one’s Social Security number instead of a signature match. President Joe Biden attacked the new rules, which he described as “Jim Crow in the 21st Century,” and accused Georgia Republicans of voter suppression. In the aftermath, the Biden Department of Justice (DOJ) launched a lawsuit against the state, while Major League Baseball (MLB) boycotted its own All-Star Game in Atlanta. (RELATED: Georgia’s New Voting Law — Myths And Facts)
Biden and the Democratic Party only escalated their rhetoric nearly a year later, with Biden doubling down on the “Jim Crow” propaganda.
“Their endgame? To turn the will of the voters into a mere suggestion — something states can respect or ignore,” Biden said in Atlanta, Georgia, in January 2022. “Jim Crow 2.0 is about two insidious things: voter suppression and election subversion. It’s no longer about who gets to vote; it’s about making it harder to vote. It’s about who gets to count the vote and whether your vote counts at all. It’s not hyperbole; this is a fact.”
Despite the hysteria, Georgia saw a record turnout for the 2022 Midterm Elections. Now in the 2024 Election, the battleground state, which broke for Biden and delivered the Senate to Democrats in 2020, is shattering its previous record, with over 1.4 million voters casting a ballot in just one week of early voting.
Other Republican-controlled swing states, such as Texas and North Carolina, have also taken steps to ensure election integrity. Texas passed its own election security bill in 2021 after Georgia’s in March of that year. In September 2024, officials announced that the North Carolina State Board of Elections had removed 747,000 names from the state’s voter rolls within the past 20 months for reasons including death, felony convictions or a failure to register new addresses after moving to a different county.
Like Georgia, North Carolina saw a new record in early voting this election, with more than 350,000 ballots casted Oct. 17. Another 150,000 ballots were casted by afternoon of Oct. 18, even though the Western half of the state is still reeling from the devastation of Hurricane Helene, according to The Washington Post.
Republican Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry signed an election integrity executive order in August that requires the state’s Office of Motor Vehicles to share names of foreign nationals and non-permanent residents with the Secretary of State’s office. State agencies must include a notice that U.S. citizenship is required to vote when distributing voter registration materials, according to the order. None of these rules come close to the level of disenfranchisement seen throughout the actual Jim Crow South, before Civil Rights legislation in the 60s. And of course, Louisiana has already set a new record for early voting, with 176,882 ballots cast Oct. 18., a 1.3% increase from the first day of early voting in 2020.
Early voting in Texas starts Monday, and if Georgia, Louisiana and North Carolina are any indicators, the Lone Star state will also see a record or two broken. The pace of 2024’s early voting might also point to a record-breaking voter turnout across all states.
Whether more Americans turn out to vote in 2024 than 2020, these early numbers should finally put to bed the left’s fear-mongering that Republicans are instituting a new wave of Jim Crow. Although it’s difficult to say whether Democrats believe their conspiracies, their rhetoric is nonetheless a potent, if poisonous, political attack that does more harm than good to U.S. elections. It is also an insult to the black Americans who lived through actual Jim Crow and to the Civil Rights activists who worked to overturn racist laws, not laws that simply require so much as photo ID to vote.",2024-10-21
The Daily Caller,Jake Paul Reveals Why He’s Supporting Trump,"Jake Paul threw his support behind Donald Trump for the 2024 U.S. Presidential election in a passionate video posted Oct. 31.
Paul acknowledged that he couldn’t actually vote himself, after rescinding his right to do so when he moved to Puerto Rico. He noted that his inability to vote “doesn’t mean I can’t present my 80 million-large audience with proper facts, numbers and data to encourage them to vote in the proper direction to quite literally save America,” he said.
Paul went on to quote stats that read strongly in Trump’s favor, and he knocked Harris’ celebrity endorsements.
Paul began by noting he was prepared for the backlash after sharing his political views.
“Uh nervous, scared to make this video because of what it means in terms of my career, my life, people coming after me — more accusations, more turmoil, more
division, potentially,” he said. “However, I just want to provide information to the potentially undecided voter the things that I have seen over the past couple of
years that have led me in a certain direction as to who I am supporting in this presidential election.”
Paul brought up how the economy, the border crisis and gender ideology were all issues that have swayed him in favor of Trump.
He reiterated that he expected backlash for presenting his views in the video but declared he was not scared of the “liberal left media.” He then encouraged his fanbase to see through the celebrities that endorsed Harris. (Stream Daily Caller’s latest documentary ‘Cleaning Up Kamala’ HERE)
“Do your own research, and base that research in the truth, not just reckless propaganda, or your favorite pop star telling you to vote a certain way and you believing them because you love their song,” Paul said.
“Most of your favorite celebrities, athletes, all of them are secretly conservative because the left has created a world where conservatives like me speaking out have major, major consequences,” he said.
Paul clarified that the comments made by Hinchcliffe about Puerto Rico were not uttered by Trump himself, and put the focus back on Trump’s accomplishments, compared to Harris’ failures. He pointed to the fact that inflation has been worse under the Biden Administration than during the Trump years.
Kamala has ” basically no accomplishments” while in office, Paul said,
He went on to detail his perception of Trump.
“Do I think Donald Trump is a perfect human being? No, I don’t think anybody on this planet is a perfect human being, myself included. Don’t judge people off of a character that the media has portrayed them to be,” he said.
“To be frank, I’m not concerned with Donald Trump’s character flaws or what he’s done in the past — what I’m concerned with is how good of a president he is, because that is his job and that is what’s going to affect the people of This Nation.”
Paul criticized the current dynamic of conservatives not being able to voice their opinions without major backlash from the left.
“That’s only going to get worse unless people like myself stand up and say fuck the system.”
“I can’t sit back and watch this blasphemy unfold in front of me any longer,” Paul said. (RELATED: Usher Creates Cringe Video With Kamala Harris After Saying He’s Staying Out Of Politics)

The Daily Caller,‘Transparently Political’: Jonathan Turley Says Soros-Backed DA Trying To Pull Elon Musk Off Campaign Trail,"George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley said Thursday that Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner’s suit against Tesla CEO Elon Musk was “transparently political.”
Krasner, who has been backed by left-wing billionaire George Soros, sued Musk Monday over a giveaway that allowed one signatory of a petition to win $1 million daily. Turley told “America’s Newsroom” co-hosts Dana Perino and Bill Hemmer that Krasner was trying to “drag” Musk into a courtroom and off the campaign trail. (RELATED: ‘Harassed And Sued’: Turley Slams Biden-Harris Admin After Court Blocks State’s Effort To Clean Voter Rolls)
WATCH:
“He has always been known to have a very strong political edge as a district attorney. I think the filings his office has made are transparently political,” Turley said. “They want to pull Musk off the campaign and into a Philadelphia courtroom. Musk’s argument and his company’s argument is look, it is not illegal to have a lottery to sign a petition in favor of the constitution, we only want registered voters to do that. If you are going to be competing in this lottery, you have to be participating in the political process. The other side is saying it’s illegal to pay people to register or to vote.”
Musk, who funds America PAC, a super-PAC that is seeking to boost former President Donald Trump in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, announced Oct. 20 he would give $1 million each day to a random signatory to a petition on the PAC’s website.
“They got a shot across the bow from the Justice Department on this but there have been no charges,” Turley continued. “The Krasner thing in Philadelphia is a civil action that is largely sort of nitpicking on whether this is an appropriate lottery system, but it seems like a real effort just to pull him into Philadelphia and into this courtroom in front of hopefully a friendly judge from Krasner’s point of view.” (Watch The Daily Caller Documentary “Rigged: The Death Of The American Voter” Here)
Crime in Philadelphia has skyrocketed during Krasner’s tenure as district attorney, with a news anchor noting that over 1,000 people had been killed in 20 months in a contentious September 2022 interview with the district attorney.
Trump leads Harris in a head-to-head matchup by 0.8% in polls of Pennsylvania voters from Oct. 7 to Oct. 29, according to the RealClear Polling average. The former president leads or is tied in five of the last six polls in the crucial swing state when independent candidate Cornel West, Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein and Libertarian Chase Oliver are included as options in the surveys.

The Daily Caller,NYC Mayor Eric Adams To Stand Trial In April On Federal Corruption Charges,"Democratic New York City Mayor Eric Adams is set to go to trial on federal corruption charges starting April 21, 2025, a U.S. judge ruled on Friday.
U.S. District Judge Dale Ho set the date at a hearing in Manhattan federal court over the opposition of Adams’ defense lawyer, Alex Spiro, who wanted the trial over the mayor’s alleged dealings with Turkish officials to end by March, well before the Democratic primary election in June, according to Reuters. Adams pleaded not guilty in September, with Spiro predicting he would be acquitted and warning of “grave, grave democratic concerns” if Adams does not have enough time to clear his name before voters go to the polls.
“It doesn’t give him a realistic chance,” Spiro said, Reuters reported. Judge Ho, however, pointed out the necessity for a fair and thorough process, citing the need for more time to review and turn over evidence, including potential classified materials.
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan charged Adams in September with allegedly accepting bribes, including flight upgrades and luxury hotel stays, as well as illegal campaign contributions, in exchange for pressuring city officials to greenlight Turkey’s new 36-story consulate, despite alleged safety concerns. The trial, expected to last about a month, will examine these and other actions the prosecution alleges constitute a breach of public trust.

Adams received an unexpected nod from former President Donald Trump, who, like Adams, faces a legal battle while campaigning for office. “Good luck with everything, they went after you,” Trump said during an event, Newsweek reported.
Trump also faced 34 felony charges over alleged falsification of business records tied to a “hush money” payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. The jury found Trump guilty in May.
Adams claims he’s been targeted by the Biden Department of Justice for his comments on the illegal immigration crisis.
“Despite our pleas, when the federal government did nothing as its broken immigration policies overloaded our shelter system with no relief, I put the people of New York before party and politics,” Adams said. “I always knew that if I stood my ground for all of you, that I would be a target — and a target I became.”

The Daily Caller,Frank Luntz Says Harris ‘Going To Fail’ If All She Does Is Bash Trump,"Pollster Frank Luntz said on Tuesday that Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign is doomed if she focuses solely on attacking former President Donald Trump.
As her campaign nears its end, Harris has shifted her messaging from promoting joyfulness to attempting to portray Trump as a danger to the United States, The New York Times reported. Luntz, on “CNN News Central,” argued that Harris needs to provide voters with compelling reasons to support her instead of relying solely on criticism of the former president. (RELATED: Harris Campaign Backpedals From Economic Agenda For Black Men Days After Releasing It)
WATCH:
“I’ve said that Trump would do better if he says less, not more, that he would be more successful if he did not use these outbursts that he’s been doing over the last few weeks. And Harris would do much better if she talked with some detail about exactly what she will do. Not what she wants, not her objectives, but how she’s going to get there,” Luntz said. “Trump basically has reached the ceiling of his votes and that’s enough for him to win.”
“Harris has a higher ceiling. I agree with her campaign in that assertion, but she’s not going to get there until she gives voters what they need to know to have faith, trust and confidence in her,” the pollster added. “It’s a good strategy that she’s doing, but I assure you, if she’s just beating up on Donald Trump, she’s going to fail.”
Luntz added what Trump and Harris “say and how they say it the last 48 hours” of the campaign “that will determine” the ultimate vote tally.
Trump currently holds leads over Harris in all seven top battleground states, according to the RealClear Polling averages. Journalist Mark Halperin said Tuesday that Trump will be elected on Nov. 5 if the current early voting trajectory holds.
“Make no mistake, if these numbers hold up in the states where we can understand even partially what the data is like, we’ll know that Donald Trump’s going to be president on Election Day,” he said.

Though Bannon has 10 time credits under the First Step Act that could have allowed his release from the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut, to home confinement on Oct. 19, his sentence is too short to secure approval, Acting Warden Darek Puzio told Bannon’s attorneys in a letter. Bannon is set to be released when his full sentence is up on Oct. 29.
“The Regional Reentry Management Office overseeing your client’ s release area advised their Residential Reentry Centers, which monitor home confinement placements, that they will not accept placements under 30 days,” Puzio wrote.
Bannon’s attorneys asked the judge Monday to grant Bannon’s request for early release in light of the warden’s admission.
“But for that bureaucratic processing delay, Mr. Bannon presumably would have been released to home confinement two days ago,” his attorneys wrote. “There is no reason for Mr. Bannon to remain in prison despite earning those credits.”
A spokesperson for the Federal Bureau of Prisons told the Daily Caller News Foundation the bureau “does not comment on the conditions of confinement for any incarcerated individual.” (RELATED: Steve Bannon Asks To Be Released From Prison Pending Appeal)
Bannon reported to prison for his four-month sentence July 1 after the Supreme Court declined to postpone the sentence pending his appeal.
He was convicted in 2022 on contempt of Congress charges for ignoring a subpoena from the Jan. 6 committee. A federal appeals court upheld the conviction in May.
Bannon called Vice President Kamala Harris the “Queen of Mass Incarcerations” in a statement to the National Pulse on Friday, saying she is”detested by black and hispanic men who are refusing to turn out and vote for her.”
“She has done nothing to implement President Trump’s heroic First Step Act, in fact welcoming hundreds of thousands of hardened illegal migrant criminals while allowing US citizens eligible for early release to rot in prison,” he said. “No mass deportations, but continual mass incarcerations.”

The Daily Caller,Steve Bannon Released From Prison One Week Before Election,"Former Trump advisor Steve Bannon was released from prison Tuesday morning after serving a four-month sentence for refusing to comply with a subpoena from the Jan. 6 Select Committee.
Bannon was was taken into custody July 1 following an order from Judge Carl J. Nichols granting prosecutors’ motion requiring the “War Room” host to serve the four-month sentence he received in Oct. 2022.
Bureau of Prisons spokesperson Randilee Giamusso confirmed Bannon’s release, according to NBC News. Bannon started his sentence shortly before Vice President Kamala Harris replaced President Joe Biden on the Democrat ticket.
“Steve Bannon is a free man,” Natalie Winters, the guest host of Bannon’s show during his imprisonment, wrote on Twitter.

Harris is set to deliver her closing arguments to “turn the page” on Trump during a campaign event at the Washington, D.C.’s, Ellipse — the location of Trump’s Jan. 6, 2021 rally, according to ABC News.",2024-10-29
The Daily Caller,Dem-Appointed Election Official Assures Voters Drop Boxes Are One Of ‘The Most Secure’ Ways To Vote,"Democratic Wisconsin Election Commissioner Ann Jacobs claimed Tuesday that drop boxes were among “the most secure” ways to vote, blaming “conspiracy theorists” for causing voters to be skeptical of their reliability.
In-person early voting in the swing state started Tuesday, USA Today reported. MSNBC host Chris Jansing noted during the interview with Jacobs that the number of known drop box locations in the state had declined to 107 from over 500 in the 2020 election, with the Wisconsin election commissioner saying “conspiracy theories” are to blame for the sharp decline. (RELATED: NY Times Poll Shows Harris’ Support Among Key Voter Bloc In ‘Dangerously Low Territory’)
WATCH:
“I tell them that it is the most secure way short of handing your ballot to your clerk’s hands. It goes through,” Jacobs claimed. “We have guidelines for the Wisconsin Elections Commission, for all of the communities in the state on how to make sure they’re safe and secure, how to make sure that the chain of custody between the drop box and the clerk occurs.”
“I always tell people, think about how many people touch a piece of mail, if you put it in your mailbox to go out into the mail stream, it goes to your postal carrier, it goes to a sorting entity,” Jacobs said. “For a lot of the state of Wisconsin, it goes to one of the two major cities, either Minneapolis in Minnesota or to Milwaukee, and then it gets redistributed and redelivered. So drop boxes are just a great, safe way to turn in your absentee ballots, and it’s disappointing that conspiracy theorists have caused that to be limited for some voters.”
Former President Donald Trump leads Vice President Kamala Harris by 0.4% in Wisconsin, according to the RealClear Polling average of polls taken from Sept. 28 to Oct. 20, with six of the last seven polls showing the former president either in the lead or a tie. The vice president leads Trump by 0.6% when Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein, independent candidate Cornel West and Libertarian candidate Chase Oliver are included in surveys of the state.
Trump won Wisconsin in the 2016 election, edging former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by 0.7%, and lost to then-former Vice President Joe Biden by 0.7% in 2020. In both years, the opinion polls understated Trump’s support by at least six percentage points.

The Daily Caller,Republicans Hopeful ‘Historic’ Early Vote Turnout Could Enable Unexpected Swing State Candidate To Flip The Senate,"LAS VEGAS, Nevada — Republican Senate candidate Sam Brown has polled behind the Democratic incumbent for his entire race, but the party is hoping a strong early vote turnout will carry him across the finish line.
While the race has narrowed, Brown still trails opponent Sen. Jacky Rosen by around 4%, according to the Real Clear Polling average. Republicans’ unusual early voting lead has them feeling optimistic a victory for former President Donald Trump could mean down-ballot success.
“We’ve got a great shot,” Brown told the Daily Caller News Foundation at a Las Vegas campaign event on Friday, citing “historic turnout” in early voting.
A veteran who survived with serious burn injuries from an explosion in Afghanistan, Brown calls himself a fighter. He believes he can be the one to hand his party the Senate majority.
Brown was just two points behind Rosen in the most recent Trafalgar Group poll of Nevada voters between Oct. 25 and Oct. 28, narrowing from Rosen’s five point lead earlier in the month.
Republicans have an over 40,000 vote lead in the state between mail ballots and in-person early votes, according to numbers released Monday night. In Clark County, typically known as a “firewall” for Democrats, Republicans are down only around 3,000 votes.
“The rural counties are turning out in a massive number, completely offsetting what has been, you know, the firewall the Democrats used to have in Clark County and Washoe County,” Brown told the DCNF.
Despite Democrat efforts to flip Washoe County, Brown said “Republicans are still holding an advantage there.” (RELATED: Swing State Republicans Are Leaning Into Ballot Harvesting — And It Seems To Be Working)
Long-time Nevada political reporter Jon Ralston has been stressing that this pattern is unprecedented. He warned on Sunday that Democrats must shift the trend or “carnage ensues.”
“I know people want to keep comparing this year to 2020 or 2022, but at the risk of repeating myself: This is a unicorn year,” Ralston, editor of The Nevada Independent, wrote Monday on his early voting blog. “We have never seen this.”
In 2022, Republican candidate Adam Laxalt lost to Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto by just over 9,000 votes.
Last week, the GOP-aligned Senate Leadership Fund dumped a last-minute $6.2 million into the race for TV, radio and digital ads in an effort to flip Rosen’s seat. Real Clear Polling also changed the race label Oct. 18 from leans Democrat to “Toss Up.”
Brown told the DCNF that people he speaks to at the polls are “enthusiastic.”
“Almost everyone who walked by was wanting to stop and take pictures,” he said. “There’s optimism and hope that you can see. That people see that the American Dream that they feared was at risk is not dead and that hope is right around the corner.”
Brown visited Reno on Saturday for a Save Women’s Sports rally with Riley Gaines in support of the University of Nevada, Reno Women’s Volleyball team, which decided to forfeit its game against San Jose State University over a male player. At an veterans event Monday, Republican Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton joined Brown to campaign. (RELATED: ‘I’m The Underdog’: Dave McCormick Sees ‘Momentum’ In Uphill Battle For Pivotal Senate Seat)
“We put a lot of effort into reaching out to our Hispanic community, reaching out to our Asian American Pacific Islander community, reaching out to our black community,” Brown told the DCNF. “This is a campaign for all Nevadans, not just Republicans.”
Brown met on Friday with Asian American and Pacific Islander voters at a Chinese restaurant before heading to an event at the Clark County GOP’s office with Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley, where he spoke to volunteers.
Whatley outlined how Brown could be the one who carries Republicans into the majority.
“We know we’re going to win West Virginia. Joe Manchin didn’t even run. That gives us 50,” he said. “Where are we going to get 51? Sam Brown.”
In Pennsylvania, Republicans could pick up a seat in Senate candidate Dave McCormick’s tightening race. The party may also have opportunities in Ohio, Wisconsin and Michigan, Whatley said.
“But I’ll tell you what: for my money, our 51st vote is coming right out of Nevada,” Whatley said.

The Daily Caller,ROOKE: Trump’s McDonald’s Visit Tears Down Thin Veil Covering Harris Campaign’s Greatest Weakness,"Former President Donald Trump visited a McDonald’s store Sunday in Pennsylvania, causing the left to melt down as they attempted to cope with his ability to connect with voters — something Vice President Kamala Harris has struggled to do.
Despite showing up to McDonald’s in his typical power suit with a bright red tie and French cuffs, Trump was gracious, charismatic and funny. While there, he learned how to use the fry station, helped fill orders and manned the drive-thru window as his supporters lined the block with Trump flags and MAGA gear. These moments not only humanized him but made him relatable even though he’s a New York City billionaire living in a Florida mansion.

It also highlighted the glaring reality that Harris (or her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz) would be able to achieve the same outcome. Despite Democrats’ best efforts to portray the Harris ticket as typical middle-class-loving candidates standing with struggling Americans and understanding their plight, most voters still believe Trump is the better candidate to handle issues that matter most to them, like the economy, inflation and illegal immigration. The visit to McDonald’s only made this more apparent.

That about sums up exactly what we’re fighting for. Absolutely incredible moment. 🔥🔥
pic.twitter.com/wuk5ZK5Dwz— Charlie Kirk (@charliekirk11) October 20, 2024
Unlike Harris and Walz, who dress in flannel and high-v vests when they want to look like hunters, t-shirts and chucks when they want to look casual and change their accents depending on the audience demographics, Trump wears his suit. He doesn’t pretend to come from the middle class by cosplaying as one of them. Instead, his suit tells voters he’s very well aware that he’s a billionaire who’s part of the elite class but, unlike the pretenders, he’s here to help. (ROOKE: Harris Campaign Braces For Fatal Election Collision)
Democrats and their friends in corporate media went into overdrive after the event, claiming Trump was “disrespecting” fast food workers and how he was a threat to (D)emocracy. There were even reported pieces about his visit being a campaign photo-op, as if voters didn’t already know. Their anger towards Trump’s time serving french fries stems from their understanding that Harris can’t compete in this game.

Harris is known to be hard to work with. During her time in the California Attorney General’s office, her staff were reportedly required to stand at attention when she arrived and refer to her as “General.” The staff turnover rate skyrocketed when she became vice president, even among employees of color. She seems like your typical “boss babe” who gets high off her power supply and ability to control others. This isn’t a good place to start if you want to convey compassion and empathy to voters crushed by your administration’s policies. (ROOKE: In Fewer Than 10 Words, Brian Stelter Lays Bare Democrats’ White Liberal Ignorance Problem)
Former President Barack Obama and even President Joe Biden (despite how terrible their policies were for Americans) were still able to conduct the same type of retail politics that Trump does so effortlessly. Democrats look at Harris, realizing that her anxious cackle, dependency on a teleprompter and inability to connect with voters is a recipe for disaster, so they lash out at Trump. Their defense mechanism exposes Harris as an out-of-touch political elite that, without abortion, would have zero chance of winning in November.
— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 20, 2024
It scares them because although Trump is unabashedly wealthy, he has always been able to interact respectfully and even playfully with his employees. He has taken this talent with him on the campaign trail, and it works. Voters want the billionaire to fight with them in the trenches; not the “girl boss” HR rep Harris comes off as. As a candidate, if your weakest attribute is policy, then there is something that can be done to fix that. However, there is nothing that can be done about a terrible personality.",2024-10-21
The Daily Caller,ROOKE: These Are The Early Results That Will Tell Us The Winner On Election Night,"Former President Donald Trump is making a play for a state President Joe Biden won by ten points in 2024. All eyes should be on Virginia on Nov. 5.
In 2023, political pundits told voters to look to Virginia as a bellwether for what would come in the 2024 election. One year after Biden won the state, Republicans swept all three executive branch races statewide and narrowly won the House of Delegates in 2021, while Democrats remained in control of the state Senate.
And Republicans have officially taken back the House of Delegates in Virginia, cementing a 52-48 majority in the chamber.

Democrats in the state ran heavily on preventing Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin and state Republicans from passing an abortion ban into law. Something Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball, said would show voters trust Democrats more on this issue. (Harris’ Advocates Are Crushing Her Only Winnable Narrative)
“I think if Republicans have a good night, that’s a message that you’ll hear from Republicans in other parts of the country,” said Kondik, according to Spectrum News. “If they don’t, I think it’ll reinforce the idea that Dems have an advantage on the abortion issue.”

The political pendulum did swing back to Democrats in 2023 when they regained control of the House of Delegates and held their majority in the state Senate. Their fearmongering on abortion was key to their victory.
Virginia Democrats’ messaging on this issue is similar to what Vice President Kamala Harris is running on in 2024. While Trump is attempting to make the election about the economy, inflation and illegal immigration, Harris wants this to be an abortion referendum. Her results in Virginia could forecast how voters in swing states rank these issues.

Harris is holding a 6.2-point lead in Virginia at the time of writing, according to the 538 polling averages. Again, Biden won this state by ten points in 2020. Despite the polling disadvantage, the Trump campaign believes he can win and is using Youngkin’s 2021 playbook, hoping it will push him over the line. Jeff Ryer, Virginia Trump campaign spokesman, told the Daily Caller that Youngkin would be at several rallies for Trump as part of the campaign’s get-out-the-vote effort (Trump Force 47) in Virginia.

The Daily Caller,Dem Strategist Says Harris Being ‘So Scripted’ Has ‘Offended Some Voters’,"Democratic strategist Dan Turrentine said Wednesday that “some voters” are frustrated with Vice President Kamala Harris’ tendency to stick to scripted responses during interviews.
Harris began granting more interviews in October after initially avoiding them following her campaign launch on July 21. Turrentine, on “The Megyn Kelly Show,” based his observation in part on the voters he communicates with on “The Morning Meeting,” a show he co-hosts on journalist Mark Halperin’s 2WAY platform, adding that Harris typically only goes off-script when attacking former President Donald Trump. (RELATED: Harris Fails To Explain Flip-Flops, Says She Has No Regrets About Biden In First Interview)
WATCH:
“Her message discipline has been very intense. She has stuck to her kind of narrow set of talking points to the point where I think she’s offended some voters. I hope they haven’t thrown their hands up and locked in for Trump, but it is something you see,” Turrentine said. “You know, we hear it on our show, you see it in the data, both the campaigns’ and what’s out there publicly, that there is frustration that she is so scripted and so tight in her answers.”
“And I think some of her best moments on the campaign have been when she’s leaned forward and had passion and energy and kind of gotten off the talking points, which really, the one issue where we see that is when it’s anti-Trump,” he added. “Like, you can tell she dislikes the guy so much. It really probably is the animating reason why she’s running.”
Turrentine also asserted that he believes “the average voter” would say “she just hates Trump” if asked why they think Harris wants to be elected as president.
“I don’t know if that’s going to be successful or not, but it’s the only place that she kind of lets the guard down, lets the hair down and really shows who she is and how she feels,” he said.
One voter on “The Morning Meeting” recently said, “She’s fake, she’s scripted, she gives a lot of word salad” when asked what she finds most troubling about Harris.
When radio host Charlamagne Tha God brought up criticism about Harris sounding “scripted” during their recent town hall, the vice president responded, “That would be called discipline.”
“The reality is that there are certain things that must be repeated to ensure that I have everyone know what I stand for and the issues that I think are at stake in this election,” she added. “And so it requires repetition.”
As her campaign comes to its end, Harris has changed her messaging from promoting joyfulness to attempting to characterize Trump as a danger to the United States, The New York Times reported. Pollster Frank Luntz said Tuesday that Harris will “fail” to win the election “if she’s just beating up on Donald Trump.”
Trump currently holds small leads over Harris in each of the seven top swing states, according to the RealClearPolling averages.

The Daily Caller,New York Voter Delivers Two-Word Response When MSNBC Asks If ‘Threat To Democracy’ Attack On Trump Resonates,"A voter in New York needed only two words Monday when an MSNBC reporter asked if Vice President Kamala Harris’ attacks on former President Donald Trump as a “threat to democracy” resonated with him.
Harris and her running mate, Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, have escalated attacks on former President Donald Trump, with Harris labeling him a “fascist” during a CNN town hall and Walz comparing Trump’s Sunday rally at Madison Square Garden to a 1939 rally at the iconic venue held by the Nazi-sympathetic German American Bund. The voter took a few seconds to think before answering the unidentified MSNBC reporter’s question. (RELATED: ‘It’s Helpful If You’ll Answer The Question’: Harris Faulkner Chides Dem Guest For Spinning When Asked About Kamala Harris Comparing Trump To Hitler)
“How does that message resonate with you?” the reporter asked.
WATCH:
“It doesn’t,” the voter responded.
Harris trails Trump by 0.1% in the RealClearPolling average of polls from Oct. 11 to 26, with the former president maintaining that lead when Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein, independent candidate Cornel West and Libertarian candidate Chase Oliver are included in surveys.
“Why not?” the MSNBC reporter asked.
“Because it feels political to me, it feels like a line that is being used,” the voter explained.
Inflation, the cost of living and the economy were viewed as either a top issue or “very important” by over 80% of respondents to a CNBC poll conducted Oct. 15-19 that showed Trump leading Harris by 2%.
Republicans in the past have criticized Democrats over their portrayal of Trump as a “threat” to democracy, citing previous assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign.
A Secret Service agent thwarted a suspected assassination attempt on Trump in September by firing shots at Ryan Wesley Routh, who was allegedly lurking near Trump International Golf Club. The former president was shot in the right ear while giving a speech at a July 13 campaign rally in Pennsylvania, where a rally attendee was killed and two others wounded.

The Daily Caller,"Gun Range Organizer Says Reporter Got Shot Because He And Kunce ‘Didn’t Listen’ To Safety Advice, Messages Show","The man who set up the gun range for Democratic Missouri Senate candidate Lucas Kunce’s event, where a bullet ricocheted off a target and struck a reporter, appeared to claim that Kunce and the reporter ignored safety advice, according to messages in a private Facebook group reviewed by the Daily Caller.
Chad Everett Downs, the man who claims to have set up the gun range and who has told reporters he lives across the street from the range, commented on a story about the incident in a Facebook group. He said he was there and that Kunce and the reporter did not listen when they were told where they should stand while shooting. Downs, who may not be allowed to own a firearm due to felony charges, then said that it was perfectly normal to get hit with fragments while shooting steel.
Missouri court records show that Downs was charged with 17 counts of felony perjury in August and has been issued a criminal summons and waived his preliminary hearing, according to the Kansas City Star. “His ex-wife in a court filing earlier this month alleged the man owns or has access to guns in violation of his bond conditions,” the outlet states.
After a user asked if Downs was the person in a picture with Cunce and a KSHB reporter, Downs replied by saying, “Yeah. Those dudes were told where to stand. They didn’t listen.” Downs said when you shoot steel, “you always get frag. I’ve been hit probably 250 times.”
He then started arguing with another member of the Facebook group, saying: “so behind the firing line is bad?? Yeah your training sounds pretty intense. You’re basically a Navy Seal.” (RELATED: ‘Could’ve Killed Someone’: Conservatives Blast Dem Candidate For Gun Photo-Op That Injured Reporter With Shrapnel)

Kunce’s campaign has said, “Safety is important to us, which is why the range was set up and run by a NRA Training Counselor.” Downs’ Facebook account says he is a “NRA training counselor.”

The Daily Caller,Harris Touts Latest Celebrity Endorsement As Polls Indicate High Prices Remain Americans’ Top Priority,"Democratic presidential nominee and sitting Vice President Kamala Harris championed her latest celebrity endorsement Friday at a Texas campaign event centered mainly around abortion, despite voters’ insistence that the economy is their greatest concern as November approaches.
Singer Beyonce formally endorsed Harris at the rally where the two slammed the state’s 6-week abortion ban, according to Fox News. Harris has made abortion access a major component of her campaign, even though many of the latest polls show Americans care most about rising costs.
“I’m not here as a celebrity, I’m not here as a politician, I’m here as a mother,” Beyonce told the crowd of 30,000, according to Fox. “A mother who cares deeply about the world my children and all of our children live in. A world where we have the freedom to control our bodies.”
The economy remains the single most important issue for voters this election, far outweighing abortion, immigration and the environment, according to an October Gallup poll. Prices have risen more than 20% under the Biden-Harris administration, with inflation reaching a high of 9% year-over-year in June 2022 before slowly ticking back down.
Harris bashed former president and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump at the rally for appointing three conservative justices to the Supreme Court who later helped to strike down the landmark Roe v. Wade court case, returning the authority to create abortion laws to the states, Fox News reported.
“Texas, what we’re experiencing here is a health care crisis, and Donald Trump is the architect of it,” Harris said, according to Fox News.
Celebrity endorsements generally do little to affect Americans’ voting habits, according to a poll conducted in May by USA TODAY and Suffolk University. (RELATED: ‘Why Would Any Christian Vote For Her?’: Pro-Life Orgs React To Harris’ ‘Anti-Religious Freedom’ Abortion Stance)
Beyonce joins a growing list of celebrity endorsements the Democratic candidate has received, including from former president and first lady Barack and Michelle Obama and Taylor Swift.
The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

The Daily Caller,"Kamala’s Abortion Doctors Appear To Pass The Buck As Rally-Goer Suffers Medical Emergency, Video Shows","A group of abortion doctors on stage at Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris’s rally in Houston Friday appeared to pass the buck as a rally-goer suffers a medical emergency.
Video shows dozens of doctors wearing white coats appear to frantically look around as the crowd shouted for a medic. Dr. Richard Todd Ivy, the OB/GYN of 25 years standing at the podium, tried to continue his pro-abortion remarks before he acknowledged the Harris supporter’s health crisis.
“I think someone needs some medical assistance over here,” Ivy said, pointing his finger in the direction of the emergency.

The crowd cheered moments later, and one female physician told Ivy, “they’re okay. They’re okay.” Another voice was heard confirming, “they’re good” before Ivy continued his remarks.
It is unclear exactly who helped the rally-goer experiencing the health crisis.
Standing below a blue screen with the words “Vote for Reproductive Freedom,” the OB/GYN doctor moved on from the medical emergency to tell his audience that abortion access is a “healthcare crisis” in Texas. (RELATED: Social Media Erupts Over Video Appearing To Show Harris Supporter Screaming At Child In Stroller)
Harris has emphasized abortion as a closing message of her 2024 campaign. Former First Lady Michelle Obama took the stage Saturday with the vice president in Michigan and pointed the finger at men, claiming a Trump presidency would pose a danger to women on the issues of abortion and teen pregnancy.
“Do not, do not put our lives in the hands of politicians, mostly men, who have no clue or do not care about what we as women are going through, who don’t fully grasp the broad reaching health implications that their misguided policies will have on our health outcomes,” the former first lady pleaded in her speech.
Pop icon Beyonce introduced Harris at her Texas rally Friday. Although various news outlets led readers to believe Beyonce would sing a song — most likely Harris’s campaign walkout theme, “Freedom” — the musician only spoke into the microphone for five minutes.
Some rally-goers began to boo Harris as she delivered remarks as many attendees were dissatisfied that Beyonce did not give a musical performance. However, Harris repeated the same line she told protesters shouting “Jesus is King” earlier in October — to send her hecklers down the street for a smaller rally.

As the two filmed their three-hour unscripted discussion in Austin, Trump spoke about launching the U.S. Space Force during his first term before he highlighted billionaire Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Starlink endeavors. Trump noted Musk proudly endorsed him and urged Rogan — who he said is “not a Kamala person” — to do the same.
“He gave me the nicest endorsement too. Tough. He said, ‘The country’s gonna fail.’ You should do the same thing, Joe, because you cannot be voting for Kamala,” Trump said as Rogan broke out into laughter.
“Kamala! You’re not a Kamala person,” he told Rogan. “I know you. I’ve watched you! I know him better than he — you know what? Without speaking to you, I think I know you maybe almost as well as your wife.”

Harris backed out of an interview with Rogan on Thursday due to a scheduling conflict, Harris campaign spokesperson Ian Sams told MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes.
The Democratic nominee visited Texas on Friday, the same day as Trump. Harris held a rally with pop icon Beyoncé — who had previously been rumored to be appearing at the 2024 Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago.
Following the interview with Rogan which garnered 11 million YouTube views in 13 hours, Trump spoke at a Friday night rally in Michigan. He blasted Harris for putting on a star-studded show at the same time Israel was launching a strike on Iran in retaliation for its Oct. 1 missile attack.

The Daily Caller,Texas AG Reports ‘Sophisticated Actors’ Stealing Identities Of Others To Circumvent Campaign Finance Laws,"Republican Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced the findings Monday of an investigation into Democrat mega funder ActBlue following reports alleging that donors to the site were using other people’s identities.
Paxton enumerated his findings in the ongoing case in a press release. He said through a letter to the Federal Election Commission that potential donors can exploit existing election law loopholes to funnel millions of dollars worth of donations under other people’s names.
Paxton exhorted the FEC to close the existing loopholes to prevent any fraud.
“Our investigation into ActBlue has uncovered facts indicating that bad actors can illegally interfere in American elections by disguising political donations,” Paxton said. “It is imperative that the FEC close off the avenues we have identified by which foreign contributions or contributions in excess of legal limits could be unlawfully funneled to political campaigns, bypassing campaign finance regulations and compromising our electoral system. I am calling on the FEC to immediately begin rulemaking to secure our elections from any criminal actors exploiting these vulnerabilities.”

Paxton alleged that his investigation corroborated reports that illegal donors were stealing people’s identities to make payments of up to thousands of dollars. The donors would often give multiple times a day, he said.
The investigation also found that the actors involved in this alleged criminal scheme were highly sophisticated, to a degree that even Paxton’s civil investigators had a hard time tracing the transactions.
“The Attorney General’s civil investigators do not commonly see this kind of criminal-style evasiveness, and do not have the technical expertise to comprehensively review the tremendous scope of transactions at issue,” Paxton noted in the FEC letter. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: ActBlue’s New Security Measures Don’t Address Fundraising Loophole Flagged By GOP Lawmakers)
Election Watch is an organization dedicated to monitoring FEC data for so-called smurf accounts. A smurf is a donor account whose identity may have been stolen from an unwitting individual. According to Election Watch data, smurf accounts made over $2 billion in political donations using Texas residents’ identities from 2017 to April 2023. There were over 14 million transactions tracked from those accounts during that time, the data shows
Paxton recommended that the FEC mandate a cross check of all political donations using credit, debit, gift cards and prepaid cards to ensure that the donor identity matches the identity listed on the card. His letter also recommended that prepaid cards and gift cards should only be accepted if this cross check can be done with the entity that issued the card in question.
The ActBlue controversy has extended beyond the state of Texas and has garnered national attention in recent months. Republican Wisconsin Representative Bryan Steil sent a letter Sept. 18 directing five state attorneys general, including Paxton, to investigate ActBlue and its facilitating smurf donations.

The Daily Caller,Nebraska Senate Race Tightens As Election Day Draws Closer,"Republican Sen. Deb Fischer has a narrow lead in the Nebraska Senate race against independent opponent Dan Osborn with just eight days left until the election, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll released Monday.
Fischer is leading by two percentage points at 48% percent to Osborn’s 46%, according to the poll. Among likely voters surveyed in Nebraska, 5% either refused to answer or said that they were undecided voters, according to the poll.
Former President Donald Trump is leading in Nebraska by 15 percentage points at 55%, while Vice President Kamala Harris trails behind at 40%, according to the poll. Harris is leading among the state’s independent voters by 10 percentage points, according to the poll results.
“This race is neck-and-neck, but make no mistake, the momentum is on our side,” Osborn said in a statement shared with the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Deb Fischer has spent 12 years doing the bidding of her corporate donors while leaving hardworking Nebraskans behind, and in 8 days, Nebraskans will come together to fire her and her self-serving agenda once and for all.”
Democrats have led a push to flip the Senate seats in various red states, including Nebraska, Texas and Florida. Several far-left dark money groups have helped to fund Osborn’s senate campaign.

Nebraska’s Senate race is not the only race that has candidates neck-and-neck, with national polling averages for Harris and Trump remaining tight as the presidential race enters its final stretch.

The Daily Caller,‘Could’ve Killed Someone’: Conservatives Blast Dem Candidate For Gun Photo-Op That Injured Reporter With Shrapnel,"Conservatives and gun advocates criticized Democratic Missouri Senate candidate Lucas Kunce on Tuesday and Wednesday for a gun range photo-op that resulted in a reporter being injured by shrapnel.
Kunce, who is aiming to take Republican Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley’s seat in November, was at a gun range Tuesday with former Republican Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger when a TV reporter was wounded with shrapnel. In response, critics slammed Kunce and the photo-op, pointing out violations of gun safety, like shooting steel at too close of a range.

“There are at least two canisters of explosive Tannerite powder on the table, down range from where guns are being fired,” Davis said on X. “That could’ve potentially killed or seriously injured someone if someone shot it or if someone was stupid enough to be shooting close enough to steel for a ricochet to hit it.”
There appeared to be bottles of explosive compound Tannerite, which is commonly used on gun ranges but is kept at safe distances, on the table close to active gunfire, according to Kunce’s post on X. The manufacturer of the compound stresses that it should be stored safely when not in use and that misuse could result in “serious injury or death.”
Typically, Tannerite targets are placed downrange at a minimum of 100 yards, according to the manufacturer guidelines.
Kinzinger was also photographed using what looked to be a high-powered scope on short-range targets, according to Kunce’s post on X.

The Daily Caller,"Nearly 1 Million Illegal Migrants Benefiting From ‘Quiet Amnesty’ Under Biden Admin, House Report Reveals","Nearly 1 million illegal migrants in the United States have benefited from “quiet amnesty” by the Biden-Harris immigration court system, according to a report released Thursday.
Over 700,000 illegal migrants have had their cases administratively closed, terminated or dismissed, allowing them to remain in the country “indefinitely” without being subject to immigration consequences, according to a report released by the House Judiciary Committee, led by Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan. The findings, which the committee dubbed as “quiet amnesty,” come amid record levels of illegal immigration into the country under the current administration.(RELATED: Migration Crisis Fueled Rise In Tuberculosis Cases, Study Finds)
“For almost four years, Americans have watched as President Joe Biden and border czar Vice President Kamala Harris have abandoned the southwest border and welcomed nearly 8 million illegal aliens into the United States,” the report stated.
“Through administrative maneuvering at both the Justice Department and [the Department of Homeland Security], the Biden-Harris Administration has already ensured that nearly 1 million illegal aliens can remain in the United States without the possibility of deportation—and that trend shows no sign of stopping,” the report went on.
When a non-citizen enters the U.S. unlawfully, they can be placed into removal proceedings and eventually go before one of the roughly 700 immigration judges across the country.
Due to the unprecedented border crisis and wave of foreign nationals applying for asylum, the immigration court system has faced a massive backlog, the report detailed. The backlog grew from 1.2 million cases at the end of the Trump administration to nearly 3.5 million cases by the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 — marking a 175% increase.
The Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) additionally reported nearly 109,100 cases as “not adjudicated” in fiscal year 2023, meaning that the cases were completed but not adjudicated on the merits of the claims, according to the House report. There were 109,568 asylum cases not adjudicated in just the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, already surpassing the total previous fiscal year. (RELATED: ‘I Love Kamala’: Migrants Fear Trump Victory As Caravan Heads To US)
For comparison, there were just 12,960 total asylum cases reported as “not adjudicated” from fiscal years 2017 to 2020 — combined, according to the House report.
The Biden-Harris administration additionally failed to file the required documentation to begin immigration court removal proceedings for around 200,00 cases, resulting in the “overwhelming majority” of those non-citizens being able to remain in the country indefinitely, the report found.
“Instead of actually adjudicating illegal aliens’ cases based on the merits of aliens’ claims for relief — such as whether an alien has a valid and successful asylum claim — immigration judges under the Biden-Harris Administration have been tasked with rubberstamping case dismissals, case closures, and case terminations, all of which allow illegal aliens to remain in the United States without immigration consequences,” the report stated.
“This sort of quiet amnesty has become a staple of the Biden-Harris Administration’s immigration courts,” the report continued.
The Department of Justice, which oversees EOIR, declined to comment for this story.

The Daily Caller,Harris Does Damage Control After Biden’s ‘Garbage’ Comment Derails Her Closing Argument Speech,"Vice President Kamala Harris was forced to do damage control Wednesday after President Joe Biden called supporters of former President Donald Trump “garbage” while she was giving her campaign’s closing argument speech.
While on a get-out-the-vote call hosted by Voto Latino, the president responded to a joke made by comic Tony Hinchcliffe during a Trump rally in which he equated Puerto Rico to “floating island of garbage.” Biden called Trump a “failed businessman” with “no character” before going on to say the only garbage “floating out there is his supporters.” The vice president responded to Biden calling roughly half the country “garbage,” saying he had clarified the remarks and that she did not believe in criticizing people based on who they vote for.
“Listen, I think that first of all, he clarified his comments. Let me be clear, I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for,” the vice president began.
“You heard my speech last night and continuously throughout my career. I believe that the work that I do is about representing all the people whether they support me or not and as president of the United States I will be a president for all Americans whether you vote for me or not. I have that responsibility and that’s the kind of work I’ve done my entire career and I take it very seriously,” she continued.
The White House attempted to quell outrage over Biden’s comments Tuesday night, posting a written transcript of his comments, modifying “supporters” (as it was understood to many) to “supporter’s,” arguing that the president was addressing Hinchcliffe.
“[Biden] referred to the hateful rhetoric at the Madison Square Garden rally as ‘garbage,'” White House spokesperson Andrew Bates wrote in a tweet alongside the transcript.

The firestorm came as Harris was on stage at the Ellipse in the nation’s capital for her closing arguments in her campaign. The vice president attempted to draw on the location of her speech, the last place Trump spoke before the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol Riot, and the danger the former president poses to the country. Her remarks, in many ways, have been overshadowed by Biden’s comments. (RELATED: Harris Completes Pivot To Failed ‘Democracy’ Message With Speech At J6 Site)
A reporter followed up Wednesday, asking Harris if she sympathized with Americans who were offended by the president’s comments.
“I am running for president of the United States, I will be traveling to three states today to do what I have been doing throughout, which is talking with the American people about the fact that, first of all, I get it in terms of the concerns they have about challenges like the price of groceries,” Harris responded. “Second, my highest priority is to address that and to lift them up around their ambitions and aspirations and dreams and why I have a plan to strengthen the economy.”",2024-10-30
The Daily Caller,Trump Moves To Dismiss Election Interference Case Over Jack Smith’s Unlawful Appointment,"Lawyers for former President Donald Trump filed a motion Thursday to dismiss special counsel Jack Smith’s election interference case, arguing that Smith was illegally appointed and should no longer receive public funds, according to court filings.
The election interference case between Trump and Smith has escalated over the past month, with Judge Tanya Chutkan releasing a redacted version of Smith’s 165-page brief on Oct. 2, detailing the case’s evidence. Trump’s legal team now claims that the “unjust case” violates the “Constitution’s Appointments and Appropriations Clauses” due to Smith not being properly appointed “by law.”
“Even if Smith is a valid officer, which he is not, he is a principal rather than an inferior officer and his appointment is plainly unconstitutional because he was never nominated by the President or confirmed by the Senate. This conclusion follows from the lack of effective oversight over Smith, coupled with the extremely broad jurisdiction described in the appointment order,” the filing states. “In addition, unless and until he is removed, the duration of Smith’s tenure is governed by his subjective determination of when his so-called “work” is “concluded.” These features of Smith’s role also violate the Appointments Clause.”
In November 2022, Attorney General Merick Garland named Smith to oversee the case involving the former president, which his lawyer’s claim violated the appointments clause, according to the filing. They argue Smith, as a “private-citizen,” was appointed to “target President Trump, while President Trump was campaigning to take back the Oval Office from the Attorney General’s boss, without a statutory basis for doing so.”
On July 15, Judge Aileen Cannon, who oversaw Jack Smith’s second case against former President Trump regarding mishandling classified documents, granted a motion by Trump’s lawyers to dismiss the case on the grounds that Smith’s appointment as special prosecutor was unlawful. In support of their motion, Trump’s filing also cited U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’ written opinion on presidential immunity, in which he noted, “there are serious questions whether the Attorney General has violated [our Constitutional] structure by creating an office of the Special Counsel that has not been established by law.”
Trump’s lawyer referred to President Joe Biden’s recent remarks at New Hampshire’s Democratic National Committee office this week, where Biden called to “lock up” Trump before quickly clarifying he meant “politically lock him up.” (RELATED: Victor Davis Hanson Issues Dark Warning On What Dems Might Do If Trump Wins In 2024)
The legal team also called for Smith and his office to be cut off from “spending additional public funds,” claiming they violated the appropriations clause, which “does not apply in order to take more than $20 million from taxpayers—in addition to Smith improperly relying on more than $16 million in additional funds from other unspecified ‘DOJ components’—for use in wrongfully targeting President Trump and his allies during the height of the campaign season.”
Trump’s team asserts that Smith and his office have been “drawing funds from the Treasury without authorization by statute” and “spending money in violation” of the law.
During a Thursday interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt, Trump said he would fire Smith within “two seconds” if he wins the 2024 election, calling him a “crooked person.”
Trump’s lawyers had argued against releasing Smith’s new briefing on presidential immunity, however, Chutkan denied the request and released the remaining evidence. In an Oct. 18 written response Chutkan stated that withholding the special counsel’s evidence would amount to “election interference.”

The Daily Caller,ROOKE: Epstein World Goes All In For Kamala Harris,"Vice President Kamala Harris has some pretty interesting bedfellows — all reportedly connected to Jeffrey Epstein — backing her presidential campaign.
Billionaire Elon Musk sat down Oct. 7 with Daily Caller co-founder Tucker Carlson to discuss his views on the 2024 election. During the interview, Carlson asked Musk whether he thought former President Donald Trump would release the infamous Epstein List, which reportedly contains the names of famous politicians, celebrities and wealthy elites who visited Epstein’s island and participated in the illicit activities available there.
“I think part of why Kamala’s getting so much support is that if Trump wins, that Epstein client list is going to become public,” Musk said. “And some of those billionaires behind Kamala are terrified of that outcome.”

Musk said he thinks the possibility of this list being made public makes billionaires like Bill Gates and Reid Hoffman very nervous.
“[Hoffman] is terrified of a Trump victory,” Musk added. “I think he’s certainly ideologically not aligned with Trump anyway, but I think he is concerned about the Epstein situation.”

Trump’s lawyers exposed that Hoffman helped pay for the lawsuit by E. Jean Carroll, the New York magazine writer who sued Trump for rape and defamation. Hoffman’s spokesman admitted that the billionaire donated through a nonprofit to support a different public interest lawsuit being handled by Kaplan Hecker & Fink. Still, the spokesman added that it was unrelated to the firm taking up Carroll’s case against Trump. Trump’s lawyers, however, said the revelation of the grant raises “significant questions” about the allegations and their credibility.

Hoffman and his wife, Michelle Yee, have donated millions to support Harris. They gave $10 million this election to the Future Forward PAC, which supports Harris’ campaign, and $6 million to the Republican Accountability PAC, an anti-Trump PAC.
Calendar dates showed Gates met with Epstein and Hyatt hotel heir Thomas Pritzker (Democratic Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s cousin) in 2014 at the Park Hyatt Hotel near Central Park in New York. Gates claims he regrets meeting Epstein and that he was there to talk to him about potential philanthropy projects. However, his ex-wife, Melinda Gates, told Gayle King on CBS This Morning that his work with Epstein was “abhorrent” and was part of what led to their divorce. She said her now ex-husband had several meetings with Epstein.
“I did not like that he had meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, no. I made that clear to him,” Melinda Gates said, adding that she met with Epstein “exactly one time” to see what kind of man Epstein was.
“I regretted it the second I walked in the door. He was abhorrent. He was evil personified. My heart breaks for these women,” Melinda Gates told CBS.

Jobs made three donations to Harris’ campaign worth nearly $1 million in 2023, and Fortune Magazine dubbed her one of Harris’ “biggest bankrollers.”
Deceased billionaire James Simons, a hedge fund manager Epstein once praised as his “sole role model” in philanthropy, donated over $9 million to committees supporting Harris, with $6.6 million going to Future Forward before his death.
Harris has enough issues on her plate as it is. She’s struggling with black men and Hispanics and is trailing Trump in all swing states, according to the RCP average. Republicans are also breaking early voting records, and Democrats are panicking over Harris’ campaign strategy, as they should.

The Daily Caller,Black Caller Who Doesn’t ‘Trust’ Dems Clashes With Charlamagne Over ‘Not Voting’ Harris,"Radio host Charlamagne Tha God sparred with a black caller on Thursday about his refusal to vote for Vice President Kamala Harris, despite his disdain for former President Donald Trump.
While 92% of black voters supported the Democratic presidential candidate in 2016, that number has dropped to 78% in 2024, according to a recent New York Times/Siena College Poll. The caller argued on “The Breakfast Club” that Democrats have failed to earn his vote, pledging not to vote for Harris even though he views Trump as “Hitler Jr.” (RELATED: Harris Fails To Explain Flip-Flops, Says She Has No Regrets About Biden In First Interview)
LISTEN:
“I’m not voting for Hitler Jr. and if I had to be honest with you … I don’t trust the Democrats, bruh. As a black man in America, we done been lied to so long. Promises have never been kept,” the caller said. “I’ma just keep it a buck. I’m not voting this year … I don’t trust the Democrats and I damn sure ain’t voting for Hitler Jr. Whatever happens gon’ happen.”
“Well if you not votin’ and Hitler Jr. wins, then you know you gon’ have to blame yourself,” Charlamagne retorted. “You gon’ have to take some of the blame.”
Trump’s former White House chief of staff John Kelly told The New York Times and The Atlantic that the former president had “fascist” tendencies and allegedly praised former Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. The Trump campaign has denied the allegations.
“I think the Democrats should take the blame because they’ve let down the black community so long. Just like you said the other day Charlamagne, they keep comin’ at black men,” the caller said. “They send [former president] Barack Obama, I don’t why the hell every four years they send Barack Obama just to talk to black men and chastise us about voting but like you said, 52% of white women is what got Trump in office.
“So why ain’t nobody never comin’ at white people about voting? Why is it always up to black men? And then when they get in office, the things they promised us, it never comes to fruition,” he added. “I’m fatigued, Charla.”
Obama on Oct. 10 urged black men to back Harris while speaking at a Pittsburgh-area campaign office, asserting he thinks a reason for their reluctance is they “aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president.”
“I’m with you. I understand the fatigue, but you know, not voting is never an option for me ’cause I like to complain, you know what I mean? You really can’t complain if you don’t participate in the process,” Charlamagne said. “I gotta participate in the process.”

The Daily Caller,‘Serious Problem For Blacks’: Kamala Harris’ Dad Once Warned Against Mass Immigration,"Vice President Kamala Harris’ father, Donald Harris, once co-authored a treatise in which he argued mass immigration was dangerous for the United States, particularly for black Americans.
The 1988 book titled “Black Economic Progress: An Agenda for the 1990s” described immigration as “a particularly serious problem for blacks” due to there being fewer jobs available for working-class Americans, according to the New York Post. Donald Harris was reportedly a Marxist economist and currently has a strained relationship with his daughter, the sitting vice president, following his divorce from her mother and a difficult custody battle.
“Trends in international trade have moved against U.S. workers,” the treatise reads, according to the Post. “U.S. immigration laws have been modified in ways that increase the influx of low-skilled workers, who compete with native-born youths and low-skilled adult workers for low-skilled jobs.”
“This shift has been a particularly serious problem for blacks, who constitute a high proportion of the low-skilled adult workers,” the book continues, according to the Post.
Kamala Harris assumed the unofficial role of “border czar” under the Biden-Harris administration during which there were roughly 8.5 million migrant encounters along the U.S.-Mexico border. The vice president proclaimed in August her new-found support for the building of a wall along the southern border after repeatedly criticizing former President Donald Trump for his stance on immigration and previously referring to his plan for a wall as “un-American.”
An October House Judiciary Committee report revealed that nearly one million illegal migrants currently reside in the U.S. without consequences or fear of deportation under “quiet amnesty” due to their immigration cases being closed, terminated or dismissed.

The Daily Caller,"Trump Leading Harris in Key Swing State Two Weeks Before Election Day, Poll Finds","Former President Donald Trump is leading Vice President Kamala Harris in Georgia as election day draws closer, according to a Tuesday poll from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC).
Trump is leading at 47% while Harris is at 43%, which is outside of the poll’s margin of error of 3.1 percentage points, according to the AJC. Of likely voters that were polled, 8% said that they are still undecided.
Georgia is considered a key battleground state in the 2024 presidential election. The swing state began its first week of voting on Oct. 15 and set an early voting record as 196,000 residents cast their ballots, according to WALB.
There are more than seven million active voters in the state, according to WALB.
A Georgia judge decided on Oct. 15 to block a rule about the state hand-counting ballots on election day amid concerns that it could slow down announcing election results.
While Trump is leading across battleground states, the presidential race is still tight. The Republican candidate has a 1.2 point lead, pulling 48.4% support across seven top battleground states compared to Harris trailing behind at 47.2%, according to polling averages from RealClear Polling.
Harris is ahead of Trump nationwide, with a lead of 0.8 points at 49.3% compared to Trump’s 48.5%, according to national polling averages from RealClear Polling. (RELATED: Dem Senator Claims Major Swing State Faces ‘Voter Suppression,’ Despite Being Confronted On ‘High Turnout’)
Trump has made significant strides among black voters. The Democrats have been attempting to shore up support for Harris from black voters amid concerns of weak enthusiasm from the key voting bloc.
“The most recent polling shows what Team Trump already knew, Georgians from Catoosa to Camden County are tired of the cost-of-living skyrocketing and drugs flowing across the open border into our communities,” Morgan Ackley, Georgia Communications Director for the Trump campaign said in a statement shared with the Daily Caller News Foundation. “President Trump is winning or tied in every battleground, including Georgia, because his message is resonating with voters across the country. This November Georgia will say no to Kamala Harris and yes to Donald Trump and his America First policies.”

The Daily Caller,Supreme Court Won’t Block Pennsylvania Ruling Allowing Voters With Rejected Mail-In Ballots To Cast Provisional Votes,"The Supreme Court declined Friday to block a lower court ruling finding Pennsylvania voters whose mail-in ballots are rejected over errors can cast a provisional vote.
Justice Samuel Alito wrote the question is of “considerable importance” but noted that even siding with the Republican National Committee (RNC) at this time “could not prevent the consequences they fear” in a statement joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch.
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled 4-3 on Oct. 23 to allow voters a second chance to cast a provisional ballot in-person when their mail ballots are rejected, a decision Republicans argued “dramatically” changed the rules and “departed from the plain terms of the Election Code.”
Republicans asked the Supreme Court to block the ruling on Monday, writing in their petition that this is “the second consecutive presidential election in which the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has changed important election rules at the last minute.”
“Even if the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s decision does not change the outcome of any election, the question of whether the provisional ballots can be added to the vote total would remain a concrete dispute this Court can review,” the RNC argued in its emergency application. “Reviewing that court’s authority to do so — even after Election Day (when the pressure of an imminent election would be absent) — would provide invaluable guidance for future elections.’”
Alito wrote that the lower court’s decision “concerns just two votes in the long-completed Pennsylvania primary.”
“Staying that judgment would not impose any binding obligation on any of the Pennsylvania officials who are responsible for the conduct of this year’s election,” he wrote. “And because the only state election officials who are parties in this case are the members of the board of elections in one small county, we cannot order other election boards to sequester affected ballots.”
The Pennsylvania Democratic Party previously told the justices the RNC offered “no sound reason” to block the lower court decision. (RELATED: ‘Invites Fraud’: Key Swing State Could See Repeat Of 2020’s Ballot-Counting Chaos Thanks To Court Ruling)
“Put simply, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s holding that a voter whose mail ballot is not counted may exercise her statutory right to vote provisionally (rather than being disenfranchised altogether) was a straightforward and correct interpretation of Pennsylvania law,” the party wrote in its Wednesday filing.
“In an effort to cast the decision below as essentially lawless, the RNC quotes selectively from the Pennsylvania Election Code, abandoning any attempt to present accurately or fairly the actual interpretive problem the Pennsylvania Supreme Court faced,” attorneys for Butler County voters Faith Genser and Frank Matis argued in a court filing Wednesday.

The Daily Caller,Joe Scarborough Calls On Harris To Disavow Past Support Of Taxpayer-Funded Sex Changes For Prisoners,"MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough on Thursday urged Vice President Kamala Harris to renounce her previous support for taxpayer-funded sex changes for prison inmates.
Harris has previously indicated she supports tax-payer funded sex changes for transgender prison inmates and illegal immigrants. Scarborough, during a conversation with comedian Bill Maher on “Morning Joe,” said it should be “very easy” for Harris to reverse her position, which she espoused during her 2020 presidential campaign. (RELATED: Kamala Harris Co-Sponsored Bill That Would Force Schools To Let Male Athletes Compete In Girls’ Sports)
WATCH:
“Kamala’s big, I think, challenge here to win over the undecided voters is to convince them that she’s not part of what they suspect she might be, sort of a stealth version of the worst excesses of the left,” Maher said. “I said there’s a coalition of [former President Donald] Trump voters, people who really like him, they certainly are those, and then there’s people who don’t necessarily like him that much, but they still think he’s less crazy than stuff that strikes them as aggressively anti-common sense that takes place on the left, and that’s why they keep running that ad about sex changes in prison.”
Maher and Scarborough both noted they frequently see a Trump campaign advertisement alleging Harris backs these operations for prisoners and illegal immigrants during football games.
“By the way, it’s very easy to say: ‘Yeah, I said that in 2019. I was in a competitive’ — now she did say — I think she said this was the law under Trump too,” Scarborough said. “He didn’t change it, but it’s very easy to say, ‘I don’t believe that anymore.’ And on that issue, she should.”
When Fox News host Bret Baier recently inquired about her current stance on the operations for illegal immigrants, Harris stated, “I’ll follow a law,” asserting that it’s “a law that Donald Trump actually followed.”
Radio host Charlamagne Tha God in September said the Trump campaign ad “was effective,” particularly because of how it aired during football games, adding that he doesn’t want his taxes funding sex changes for these individuals.
CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten said Wednesday that he thinks a reason Harris is losing ground with independent voters is because they perceive her as “too liberal.” She currently lags behind Trump in all of the seven top battleground states, according to the RealClearPolling averages.

The Daily Caller,Democrats Fight To Make Elections Less Trustworthy,"Democrats are fighting to make elections less secure in multiple key states just days before the Nov. 5 election.
Election legislation has already been a focal point of the 2024 campaign, especially as the Republican National Committee (RNC) beefs up its election integrity department, but the battles are set to continue beyond Nov. 5. In the weeks leading up to the election, Democrats have signed legislation prohibiting voter identification while Biden-Harris’s Department of Justice has sued Alabama and Virginia for attempting to take illegal immigrants off their voter rolls.
“What’s so bizarre about that lawsuit, the two lawsuits that DOJ has filed … that is the exact opposite of what DOJ should be doing, it is a criminal violation of federal – in fact, it’s a felony for an alien to register to vote,” Hans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow focusing on election integrity at the Heritage Foundation, told the Daily Caller. (RELATED: Watch The Daily Caller’s Documentary ‘Rigged’)
“And so what the DOJ ought to be doing is going to Virginia and saying, ‘can you please give me the files of each of these voters so we can investigate and potentially prosecute them?’ And no, instead, they’re saying, ‘no, you have to keep on the voter rolls aliens who are breaking federal law,'” von Spakovsky continued.
In August, Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed an executive order to make the state more frequently remove noncitizens from the voter rolls. The DOJ then moved to sue the state on Oct. 12, alleging that the Virginia State Board of Elections had violated the federal National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), which states that voter rolls may not be cleaned up 90 days before an election. Biden’s DOJ further claimed that the executive order, signed 90 days out from Nov. 5, produced a “systemic removal” which can apparently cause voters to be confused and affect eligible voters. (RELATED: GOP States Remove Thousands Of Noncitizens Off Voting Rolls As Election Day Nears)
It’s stunning that, just 11 days before the presidential election, a federal judge is ordering Virginia to reinstate individuals who have self-identified as noncitizens on the voter rolls. Virginia is prepared to take this to the U.S. Supreme Court if needed! pic.twitter.com/fyjlWBUlnQ
— Glenn Youngkin (@GlennYoungkin) October 25, 2024
Similarly, Alabama was sued by the Biden-Harris DOJ after Secretary of State Wes Allen identified 3,251 registered voters that had been issued noncitizen identification numbers by the Department of Homeland Security and sought to remove them from the rolls. The DOJ alleged that, like in Virginia, it was too close to election day.
“The right to vote is one of the most sacred rights in our democracy,” Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division said in a statement. “As Election Day approaches, it is critical that Alabama redress voter confusion resulting from its list maintenance mailings sent in violation of federal law.”
In Virginia’s case, Biden-appointed U.S. District Court Judge Patricia Giles issued an order blocking Virginia’s efforts to remove the estimated 1,600 individuals that the state believes have “self-identified” as noncitizens. On Sunday, the Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares said he would be filing an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court in response.
A Trump-appointed judge sided with the DOJ in Alabama and ordered the state restore the voters who they had taken off the voter rolls as a result of Allen’s order.
In Texas, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott previously announced that his administration had purged more than 6,500 noncitizens from state voter rolls. The cleaning of the voter rolls is a result of a 2021 bill Abbott signed into law which instated numerous election security measures like uniform statewide voting hours, banned drive-through voting and gave more power to poll watchers.
“I was surprised they haven’t sued Texas yet. Texas also announced that he did take 6,500 aliens off the voter roll. I’m expecting Texas will get sued by DOJ also,” von Spakovsky told the Caller.

Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law on Sept. 29 that prohibits local governments from requiring identification to vote. The legislation was brought forward by Democratic state Sen. Dave Min after a ballot measure was presented in Huntington Beach that would require identification at the polls, according to Politico.
“Forbidding, actually forbidding it. The state has no ID requirement, and yet, when one town said, ‘Well, we really want to do this,’ they pass a law preventing that from happening. In general, every time states have tried to clean up their voter lists to take off people who have died and moved away, Democrats sue them so they want inaccurate voter lists,” von Spakovsky told the Caller.

About a week out from the election, political experts have started to discuss what the aftermath of a Trump victory could look like. From protests, to lawfare, to security concerns, the Daily Caller spoke to a variety of experts who predicted a dangerous and extreme response from Democrats if Trump wins. (RELATED: What Happens If Trump Wins?)
Von Spakovsky told the Caller he expects Democrats to claim voter suppression through lawsuits following a Trump victory. Mike Davis, a Trump-aligned lawyer and founder of the Article III Project, explained that even if Democrats prepare to sue, the state of election integrity is not close to what it was in 2024.
“President Trump learned his lesson from 2020 … He has hired a very good legal team led by David Warrington on his campaign, along with a very good legal team led by RNC Chairman Michael Whatley,” Davis told the Caller.
“That was the mistake in 2020: they didn’t get injunctions … They’re doing it this time,” Davis added, explaining that the RNC legal team has been far more proactive in the 2024 election cycle.",2024-10-28
The Daily Caller,How Unions Spent Millions Of Tax Dollars Boosting Democrats Ahead Of Election Day,"Six large public unions have funneled tens of millions of dollars, much of which came from taxpayer-funded dues payments, into aiding Democrats in their bid for power this election cycle.
A handful of large public-sector unions pumped well over $60 million into political organizations, with the lion’s share going toward helping Democrats win races at every level of government, according to the latest set of campaign finance disclosures.
The Daily Caller News Foundation included the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), the National Education Association (NEA), the American Federation of Teachers (AFT), the National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC) and the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE) in its analysis of campaign finance records. In 2020, these six labor organizations were the top political contributors among unions representing public sector employees, according to OpenSecrets.
Unions are legally prohibited from contributing membership dues directly to federal political campaigns, according to the Department of Labor. They can, however, donate revenue derived from membership dues to super PACs and 501(c)(4) advocacy organizations, both of which often work to elect candidates. (Stream The Daily Caller’s Documentary ‘Lawless’ HERE)
Indeed, some of the committees that received the most money from public sector unions were super PACs aimed at delivering legislative majorities and the White House to Democrats.
The House and Senate Majority PACs, committees working to elect Democrats to the upper and lower chambers of Congress, collectively pulled in about $15 million from public unions, according to campaign finance records. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which play similar roles, brought in just over $1 million from public-sector union PACs. Future Forward, the primary organization focused on delivering the White House to Vice President Kamala Harris, meanwhile, took in $3 million from public unions.
“Obviously, if you have government employees who are working, you are going to pay them,” Capital Research Center research director Michael Watson, an organized labor expert, told the DCNF. “If you then, on top of that, enact collective bargaining, their salaries that were paid for with taxpayer money are going to go to the union which is going to do union stuff, part of which is supporting liberal candidates.”
Watson went on to explain that taxpayers aren’t just seeing their tax dollars going to support partisan Democrats, but that those donations are also leading to officials being elected who then direct more public funds into union coffers.
“The double whammy is that those liberal politicians that the union is sending money to support, if they win, are then going to be negotiating with the unions,” Watson continued.
President Joe Biden, for instance, transferred $36 billion worth of public funds to bolster a union pension pool in December 2022, The Associated Press reported. The Biden-Harris administration is also pushing student loan debt forgiveness, a policy nonpartisan government analysts say could cost the public but is celebrated by public sector unions as a boon for their members.
Watson pointed to Democratic Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, a former union organizer, as a prime example of the taxpayer funds going through the cycle of being used by unions to support liberal politicians who then advocate for more taxpayer funds to flow to unions, thus expanding the amount organized labor can spend on political advocacy to reap even more rewards. Johnson is pushing against much of the city government to take out a $300 million loan to give Chicago teachers, who make an average of $93,000 per year, a 9% raise, The Economist reported.
The mayor’s push for increased teacher pay comes as the city’s public schools faced a half-billion-dollar deficit coming into this school year. The national SIEU and AFT, the second-largest teachers union in the country, collectively gave Johnson over $2.5 million this election cycle, federal campaign finance records show.
Other PACs that raked in considerable funding from public sector unions include pro-abortion committees like EMILY’s List, major liberal committees affiliated with American Bridge and Priorities USA as well as climate-focused organizations, disclosures show. The SEIU, AFT and NALC also put roughly $1.8 million into one of the committees that helped put on the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.
The NALC stood out from the rest of the unions in that, even though most of its political donations went to Democratic-aligned PACs, it made some contributions to right-leaning committees. PACs like the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the National Republican Congressional Committee, the Republican Mainstreet Partnership and Republican Kentucky Rep. James Comer’s leadership PAC collectively brought in hundreds of thousands of dollars from the NALC.
“What some unions, I think you’re seeing it more now with the Teamsters under their new leadership with Sean O’Brien and I think with what may be the case with the letter carriers, is that they are behaving more like a traditional special interest group,” Watson told the DCNF. “What the Teamsters under O’Brien and the letter carriers for a long time have been is ‘look, if you cover us on the issues that matter to us … if you’re scratching our back, we’ll scratch yours even if we don’t agree on any other policies.'”
Watson said the letter carriers are likely concerned with federal postal funding.
Of the funds not donated to explicitly Democratic committees, much of them went to other union political committees, which tend to spend primarily on supporting liberal candidates, disclosures show. Labor organizations can also internally spend funds on political activities, which means the full extent of public union political spending isn’t contained in records maintained by the FEC. The SEIU, NEA, AFT and AFSCME, for instance, launched a joint canvassing effort on Oct. 21 aimed at increasing voter turnout in swing states to support the Harris-Walz ticket, according to a press release.
“Every election cycle, union bosses flood the American political system with billions of dollars to push forward a radical political agenda that boosts union officials’ power over workers, and is directly contrary to the priorities and interests of millions of the members union bosses claim to ‘represent,'” National Right to Work Committee president Mark Mix told the DCNF. “This corrupt cycle of forced dues-funded political influence is especially egregious when it comes to government union bosses, who siphon dues out of taxpayer-funded salaries and use the money to elect politicians who are more loyal to their union backers than the voters they are supposed to represent. This doesn’t just harm taxpayers and voters who see bloated budgets and unaccountable elected officials, but also undermines the individual rights of government employees who are forced to accept unions’ monopoly ‘representation’ despite deep personal or ideological objections to union boss-advocated positions.”
The SEIU, NEA, AFT, AFGE, AFSCME and NALC did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s requests for comment.

The Daily Caller,EXCLUSIVE: ‘Way Too Liberal’: New Ad Slams Swing District Dem For Wanting To Serve Illegal Immigrants Gov’t Handouts,"A political action committee (PAC) released an advertisement Tuesday that highlights Pennsylvania Democratic candidate Janelle Stelson’s support for amnesty for illegal migrants and the costs to taxpayers that would come with it, the Daily Caller News Foundation has learned.
The Win It Back PAC (WIB PAC) launched the ad ahead of the Nov. 5 election between Republican Pennsylvania Rep. Scott Perry and Stelson — rated as a toss up by Cook Political Report as of Oct. 18. The ad, titled “Chef,” portrays Stelson as a “world-renowned” chef and liberal, serving tax credits, social security and healthcare to illegals at the expense of the Pennsylvania taxpayer. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Texas Republicans Press Biden-Harris Admin Over ‘Turning A Blind Eye’ To Non-Citizen Voters)
“Five-star reviews, a tasting menu to die for and a world-renowned chef: liberal Janelle Stelson,” the video says. “But the hottest restaurant in town is only for illegal aliens, and Pennsylvanians foot the bill.”
WATCH:
Stelson pledged her support for amnesty for some illegal immigrants during a March 27 interview, with the WIB PAC ad noting the policy would result in Pennsylvanians’ tax dollars going to government benefits for non-citizens.
“Tax credits for illegals, social security for illegals and the main course: gold-plated healthcare — compliments of the chef Janelle Stelson,” the video states. “Way too liberal and too expensive for Pennsylvania.”
Stelson reportedly outraised Perry by a massive $2.85 million to $900,000 in the last fundraising quarter. The candidates, super PACs and Washington-based political committees had poured over $14 million into the race as of Oct. 17.
Roughly 8.5 million migrant encounters occurred along the U.S.-Mexico border during the four fiscal years of the Biden-Harris administration, compared to approximately 3 million under former President Donald Trump. The National Border Patrol Council — a union representing about 18,000 Border patrol agents across the country — endorsed Trump during a campaign rally in Prescott Valley, Arizona, on Oct. 13.
The Stelson campaign didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Daily Caller,‘Harassed And Sued’: Turley Slams Biden-Harris Admin After Court Blocks State’s Effort To Clean Voter Rolls,"George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley criticized the Department of Justice Friday after a federal judge ordered Virginia to reinstate hundreds of non-citizens to the voter rolls.
A federal judge ordered Virginia to halt its effort to remove non-citizens Friday, granting an injunction requested by the Justice Department in a suit filed Oct. 12. Turley said the DOJ had previously approved the law’s use in the past under Democratic governors. (RELATED: ‘This Is Ridiculous’: Leo Terrell Rips DOJ For Going After State That Removed Non-Citizens From Voter Roll)
“The Biden Administration argued that some or many of these were citizens who simply had bureaucratic problems or errors when they were at the DMV filling out forms. But the problem is that Virginia is a little different from Alabama,” Turley told “America’s Newsroom” co-hosts Bill Hemmer and Dana Perino. “As Gov. [Glenn] Youngkin pointed out, this was approved by the Department of Justice years ago under then-Gov. [Tim] Kaine, who ironically is on the ballot this election. And they say this has been used within the 90 days before an election, which is that critical so-called quiet period. And so the state is saying look, this is a rather odd timing of the events. Department of Justice green-lights this law, no objection in past years used by Democrats allegedly even during this period and suddenly when we use it, when we remove non-citizens, it becomes a problem.”
WATCH:
“Virginia was saying that these are basically actions that have been taken on the books for years,” Turley said. “When the DMV kicks back information to us saying that someone has identified themselves correctly or incorrectly as a non-citizen, that person then has 15 days to correct that and even if they don’t correct that, they can file provisional ballots so that their vote will count as they continue that effort. But this federal judge is saying no, just put them back on the voting rolls.”
Youngkin criticized the court’s ruling in a statement released Friday, telling Fox News host Harris Faulkner the state would appeal.
“What the governor is saying is look, this is information supplied by the voter. It’s an automatic system. Keep in mind, Virginia doesn’t know who these people are gonna vote for. It’s not like there’s an effort to target one group,” Turley said. “This is an automated system that kicks over and says there is an anomaly here, a conflict, this person has identified themselves as a non-citizen. Many may have done it incorrectly or there might be an error and why they have these belts and suspenders, but part of the problem the states have here is that they feel like they’ve been harassed and sued by the Biden Administration at every turn over voter ID and other laws.” (Watch The Daily Caller Documentary “Rigged”)
“A new poll just came out that showed that over 80% of American citizens support voter ID and citizenship proof for voting. Over 80%,” Turney continued. “I mean, how many issues in today’s politics can you name where there is over 80% of agreement?”

The Daily Caller,‘Completely Fabricated Persona’: Woman Doug Emhoff Allegedly Slapped Breaks Silence,"An ex-girlfriend who Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff allegedly slapped in a fit of jealousy broke her silence on the matter Thursday.
Emhoff’s ex-girlfriend, who asked the Daily Mail to use the alias “Jane,” confirmed allegations from three friends that Vice President Kamala Harris’ now-husband “slapped [her] so hard [she] spun around” during a celebrity event in 2012.
“What’s frightening for a woman that’s been on the other end of it, is watching this completely fabricated persona being portrayed,” Jane said.
Doug Emhoff’s ex-girlfriend speaks out telling how Kamala’s husband forcefully slapped her for flirting with another man https://t.co/hATb8qcMx4 pic.twitter.com/h5jLEwseXe
— Daily Mail Online (@MailOnline) October 24, 2024
Jane told the outlet she and Emhoff, whom she started dating in March 2012, took a “fairytale” trip to the amfAR gala dinner south of France on May 24, 2009. A long taxi line outside the Hotel du Cap around 3 a.m. prompted Jane to try to pay a valet $100 to let her and Emhoff skip the line — but she alleged a drunken Emhoff reacted violently when he incorrectly assumed she was flirting with another man.
“As I’m talking to him, Doug got out of the line, comes up, turns me around by my right shoulder. I’m completely caught off guard. I’m not bracing,.I’m in four inch heels, wearing a full-length gown, and it’s between 2-3 a.m.,” Jane said.
“He slaps me so hard I spin around, and I’m in utter shock,” she alleged. “There had been no fight, no argument. It had been a completely fantastic event. I am so furious. The only thing I could think to do was slap him back. I slapped him on one side, and on the other cheek with the other hand.”
“In that moment, his mask had dropped and I saw his dark side,” Emhoff’s ex-girlfriend alleged, later adding that Emhoff said they were “even” the day after.
Jane said Emhoff confided in her in April 2012 that the nanny he had an extramarital affair with and impregnated before his 2009 divorce filing, Najen Naylor, accused him of causing her to miscarry their baby. She said Emhoff’s admission made her rethink their relationship, according to the outlet. (RELATED: From #MeToo To #NotYou: Where Are All The Feminist Celebrities On Emhoff?)
Psaki Tells Emhoff He’s Reshaping Masculinity
“All I did was ask him one question, and he told me the whole story,” Jane told the Daily Mail. “Without skipping a beat, and staring straight ahead at the road, he tells me he had an affair with his daughter’s teacher and that subsequently she claimed that she was pregnant. He’s telling me this very casually like it’s no big deal.”
Jane told the outlet Emhoff admitted to yelling at Naylor but did not say whether he struck her, according to the outlet. She said Emhoff told her in a matter-of-fact manner that he “got really angry” at his then-pregnant mistress, who threatened a lawsuit over accusations that he caused her miscarriage.
Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) records obtained by the Daily Mail show that police were called to the house where Naylor lived at 8:14 p.m. on June, 28, 2009. The call was deemed a priority level three, a “life threatening emergency, lights and sirens on.”
Emhoff Condemns Toxic Masculinity In 2023
Emhoff’s accuser told the outlet she was initially hesitant on speaking out publicly and has been telling the same story years before the vice president’s husband became famous.
“He’s being held out to be the antithesis of who he actually is. And that is utterly shocking,” she added.
Emhoff And Jill Biden Kiss
None of the female celebrities supporting Harris have spoken out against Emhoff’s alleged misconduct — a stark departure from 2016’s #MeToo movement. Popular singers including Taylor Swift, Pink and Ariana Grande and Hollywood icons such as Oprah Winfrey and Jennifer Lopez continue to advocate for Harris despite her husband’s alleged misdeeds.
While ignoring Emhoff’s accusations, many female celebrities, including Olivia Rodrigo, Jennifer Lawrence and Billie Eilish, exert their feminist energy toward promoting Harris’s pro-abortion agenda.",2024-10-24
The Daily Caller,Swing State Republicans Are Leaning Into Ballot Harvesting — And It Seems To Be Working,"LAS VEGAS, Nevada — For thousands of attendees at a Trump rally Thursday in Las Vegas, volunteers stood ready to collect mail-in ballots on-site.
The strategy is a major shift for Nevada Republicans, who opposed the legalization of ballot harvesting in 2020. Now, conservative activists and GOP operatives are leaning into the new rules, asking voters to bring ballots to rallies and doing whatever it take to make it easy for Republicans get their votes in early.
“We don’t like early voting, but it’s how the game is,” Turning Point Action Las Vegas field representative Schayden Gorai told the Daily Caller News Foundation, explaining these are “the rules that the Democrats have set.”
Early voting numbers have been strong for Republicans, who lead Democrats by nearly 24,000 votes between in-person and mail ballots as of Friday morning. If Democrats can’t change the current margins, which have them up in mail ballots but trailing Republicans by 25% for in-person early voting, longtime Nevada political reporter and editor of The Nevada Independent Jon Ralston wrote Thursday night the party is in “big, big trouble.”
Take a deeper look at Nevada — and what it could mean for the rest of the country.
Ds aren’t showing up for @KamalaHarris. If that happens around the country, the missing red wave of 2022 could show up in 2024 as a tsunami.

Former President Donald Trump — and others who spoke at the Turning Point sponsored rally Thursday, including Vivek Ramaswamy, Charlie Kirk and Tulsi Gabbard — urged supporters in the crowd to get out early and bring others along.
Prior to the rally, a text blast was sent out letting attendees know about the ballot drop off option. Fliers and other messaging likewise encouraged supporters to bring their ballots.
Republicans launched the new approach when Trump spoke in Reno earlier this month. Now that more people know about the option, campaign staff say the method is gaining some traction.
“We had a whole envelope full of ballots dropped off today, which is really exciting to see,” Halee Dobbins, GOP communications director for Nevada and Arizona, told the DCNF during the rally. “The margins are always close, but we don’t want to leave one vote on the table.” (RELATED: Tailgates, Apps And Marylanders: Conservatives’ Strategy To Win In Southern Pennsylvania)
While many voters maintain reservations about mail ballots, the messaging is landing with some.
Jennifer McGrath, a Las Vegas resident of two years who has volunteered for the Trump campaign, appreciates the convenience of dropping off her ballot while she’s already at the rally. She said it helps her avoid the risk of an issue coming up on election day that prevents her from making it to the polls.
“I also received a receipt which lets me know how to check on the status of my ballot,” she said. “That way within about 48 hours I will know that my ballot has been delivered to the vote center and counted.”
The collection at the rally is only part of a broader strategy Turning Point calls “ballot chasing.”
“We’ve hired full time staffers here, especially in congressional district three, in our low propensity targeted districts and precincts to help to get out that vote,” Gorai said.
At around 20 “Super Chase” events in the past month, volunteers and staffers partnered together to door knock and ensure voters have what they need.
“That might be taking them to the polls, helping them to get the ballot in the mail, helping them to take that to a drop box, whatever it might look like,” Gorai said. “Whatever is easier for the voter is how we approach that ballot.”
While I was in Summerlin assisting voters and knocking on doors, I asked @Lexieeebb to help me with folks who have reached out way across town, to pick up their ballots!

While there has been a more aggressive effort to secure ballots, those working with the Trump campaign believe the GOP’s election integrity efforts have also given voters the confidence to turn out in greater number.
The state party has pushed poll watchers to Clark and Washoe county locations and launched a hotline in southern and northern Nevada.
“I think just having a presence, Republican voters knowing that there are volunteer poll watchers at these locations monitoring the process, I think it really helps those folks,” Nevada GOP executive director Alex Watson told the DCNF. “Just knowing that we have people there that have the best thoughts in mind for the election, making sure it’s safe, secure for everybody.”
Nicole Kelly, a political and election law attorney who served as the Republican National Lawyers Association’s Nevada Political Director in 2022, told the DCNF that highlighting how GOP lawyers are involved in the process has given voters faith issues will be handled in timely manner, not just after election day.
Nevada State Democratic Party spokesperson Carlos Perez criticized Republicans in a statement to the DCNF for “participating in the same legal process they’ve been telling lies about for years.” (RELATED: Election Litigation Could Shape The Race In Battleground States. We Won’t Know Until The Votes Are Cast.)
“As we’ve said all along, this election will be close and Nevada Democrats will continue to use every tool at our disposal to ensure we elect Democrats up and down the ballot,” Perez said.
Watson believes the main driver of Republicans turning out to vote early is genuine enthusiasm.
“People want to go out and vote for the president,” Watson said. “We’re seeing the messaging really hitting on like the economy and inflation, and I think that’s been a winning message for us, especially in this state. We’re a tourism-based economy, so we get hit hard when the inflation is high and the economy is bad.”
Trump voters who spoke with the DCNF at the rally and early voting sites consistently named the economy and immigration as top concerns. Multiple who voted early said they just wanted to get it out of the way.
One first-time voter said she has been a long-time Trump supporter but choose to finally vote because it’s been “so bad” the last three years. “We need to make a change,” she said.
A 32-year Democrat who has lived in Las Vegas for nearly four decades told the DCNF he switched his registration this year to vote for Trump in the caucus.
Republicans messaging aims to motivate voters by assuring them their vote will make an impact and making sure they understand how crucial it is in a swing state like Nevada.
“You’re at the center and at the heart of this election,” Republican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio told Las Vegas voters Thursday. “I truly believe that how this state goes is how the election is going to go.”

The Daily Caller,Trump Leading Harris In State GOP Hasn’t Won In Nearly 25 Years: POLL,"A poll released late Sunday revealed Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump holds a slight lead in New Hampshire, a state Republicans haven’t won in 24 years.
Friday polling showed the former president remained three points behind Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in New Hampshire but has since flipped the lead, now ahead 50.2% to 49.8%, according to the NH Journal. The last time the state voted red was for former President George W. Bush over then-Democratic nominee Al Gore.
“There’s a reason Kamala Harris has been spending money in New Hampshire,” Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokesperson and New Hampshire native, told the NH Journal. “She’s on defense and knows President Trump is on the path to victory. To my fellow Granite Staters who want to keep our beautiful state safe, business-friendly, and free — get out and vote for President Trump. Kamala Harris is a radical liberal who would destroy New Hampshire and America forever.”
Republican gubernatorial candidate Kelly Ayotte also holds a lead over Democratic nominee Joyce Craig in the state by nearly four percentage points, polling at 51.9% to Craig’s 48.1%, according to the NH Journal.

Trump lost the state in his election bids in both 2016 and 2020, with President Joe Biden winning the state by over 7% in 2020.
Recent polling shows Trump leading Harris by two points nationally, 47% to 45%, according to The Wall Street Journal. Harris’ favorability among voters has also fallen from 50% in August to 45% in late October with her approval rating as vice president falling to just 42%, her lowest since announcing her presidential campaign.
The economy remains the most important issue for voters in New Hampshire, with 34% reporting it as their top issue this election, according to an earlier Emmerson College poll. New Hampshire voters were also 54% less likely to vote for a candidate that supported men competing in women’s sports, the NH Journal poll found.

The Daily Caller,"‘Reeks Of Corruption’: Son Of High-Ranking Dem Raked In Hundreds Of Thousands From Dad’s Campaign, Lobbyists","The son of Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Richard Neal — leader of the House Ways and Means Committee — raked in hundreds of thousands of dollars in consulting fees from his father’s campaign and pressure groups who were actively lobbying his dad on tax policy, according to Politico.
Richard Neal’s son Brendan Neal launched a one-person public affairs firm offering “political advice, lobbying and strategic communications” in 2020, roughly one year after his father became the ranking member on Ways and Means — the sole congressional committee with jurisdiction to introduce federal tax legislation, Politico reported.
Brendan Neal went on to receive a total of $196,340 from his father’s campaign for “strategic consulting services,” $20,000 from Van Heuvelen Strategies, which had interests in at least six different Ways and Means issues, and $252,500 from a client of a lobbyist who was simultaneously working for Blackstone to protect the carried-interest rate, which allows individuals working in the financial industry to pay a lower tax rate. (RELATED: DC Councilman Who Claimed Jews Controlled The Weather Charged With Bribery)
“Lobbyists sending huge amounts of money to the son of a particularly powerful politician, who has a great deal of control over tax policy, just reeks of corruption,” Morris Pearl, chair of Patriotic Millionaires — a coalition of wealthy Americans concerned about income inequality — told Politico. “Almost anyone, including the clients of the lobbyists who are concerned about tax policy, would conclude that these lobbyists are trying to curry favor with Representative Neal for their clients.”
Richard Neal’s office has claimed the congressman was unaware his son was employed by lobbying firms with tax issues being decided by his committee, and that the two do not discuss official business, according to Politico.
“Congressman Neal has been clear – Brendan has never lobbied his office on Ways and Means Committee business,” Neal campaign spokesman Joshua Carp told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “With early voting started, while his political opponents are manufacturing distractions, he remains clear-eyed about what’s really important in the stakes of this election — fighting to lower costs for working families, for a woman’s right to choose and to preserve Social Security. That’s what’s on that ballot and why he’s traveling from Pittsfield to Pittsburgh campaigning for Kamala Harris.”
“I’m proud of my work advocating for causes like LGBT suicide prevention, the opioid crisis, climate change and American industry,” Brendan Neal told the DCNF. “I’ve always followed ethics rules. I don’t lobby my father and we don’t discuss my business.”

The Daily Caller,‘Not That Persuasive’: Dem Super PAC Raises Alarm Bells About Harris Campaign’s Closing Strategy,"A leading Democratic super PAC warned that Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign’s strategy of characterizing former President Donald Trump as fascist could be a mistake as election day draws near, The New York Times reported Sunday.
Harris referred to Trump as a fascist during a CNN town hall Wednesday, following comments from former chief of staff John Kelly claiming Trump expressed admiration for Adolf Hitler. Now, Future Forward — a Democratic super PAC that raised hundreds of millions this election cycle — is urging Democrats to not focus too narrowly on claiming Trump is a fascist after internal testing revealed the line of attack is not very effective, according to the NYT. (RELATED: Soros-Funded Group Backs Maricopa DA Candidate Who Helped Murder Accomplice Evade Child Sexual Abuse Charges)
“Attacking Trump’s Fascism Is Not That Persuasive,” a Future Forward email obtained by the NYT states. The report discussed what messages have been most effective in internal testing.
More broadly, the Future Forward analysis found attacks on Trump’s character were less persuasive than concentrating on Harris’ economic policies and pro-abortion stance, the NYT reported.
“Purely negative attacks on Trump’s character are less effective than contrast messages that include positive details about Kamala Harris’s plans to address the needs of everyday Americans,” the email obtained by the NYT said.
Following the Democratic National Convention, Harris’ team said they planned to shift away from the “threat to democracy”-argument President Joe Biden frequently used against Trump, according to the NYT. However, as Harris has slid in the polls in recent weeks, her campaign has revived some of the attacks on the former president’s character, issuing an advertisement describing him as “unhinged” and “unstable.”
Harris also plans to deliver her closing argument address at Ellipse park near the White House — the same place where Trump delivered a speech on Jan. 6, 2021 — in an apparent reference to the Jan. 6 capital riots, according to CNN.
Future Forward is the single largest super PAC in American politics, controlling a $700 million war chest that includes multi-million dollar donations from LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The group, founded by a team of Obama campaign veterans, aims to use data science, political science and testing to improve advertising performance.
Trump currently leads Harris by approximately 0.5% in Pennsylvania, 1.5% in Arizona and 2.3% in Georgia, according to RealClear Polling averages from early-mid October. Trump leads by 0.1% on a national basis after being down by nearly 2 full percentage points in the category in September.
The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The Daily Caller,‘Invites Fraud’: Key Swing State Could See Repeat Of 2020’s Ballot-Counting Chaos Thanks To Court Ruling,"LAS VEGAS, Nevada — Nevada’s mail-in voting rules mean final results in close races may not be available on election night.
In 2020, the Associated Press did not call the presidential race in Nevada until four days after the election. While a repeat scenario is not top of mind for every voter, several who spoke with the DCNF at early voting locations were troubled by the current system.
“We need to make sure we don’t have fraudulent ballots coming in or ineligible voters sending in stuff well after the election,” Joe, a Trump voter who has lived in Las Vegas for 10 years, told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “So I think everything needs to be in by Election Day.”
The Nevada Supreme Court ruled Monday that mail-in ballots without any postmark can still be counted if they are received within three days of the election.
“If a voter properly and timely casts their vote by mailing their ballot before or on the day of the election, and through a post office omission the ballot is not postmarked, it would go against public policy to discount that properly cast vote,” the court determined.
Under state law, ballots postmarked on or before election day can also be counted up to four days after.
“Requiring ballots to be postmarked on or before election day is a critical election integrity safeguard that ensures ballots mailed after election day are not counted,” Republican National Committee spokesperson Claire Zunk said in a statement to the DCNF. “It is also a requirement of Nevada law. By allowing Nevada officials to ignore the law’s postmark requirement, the state’s highest court has undermined the integrity of Nevada’s elections.”
In 2022, slightly more than half of Nevada’s votes were cast using mail-in ballots, according to a report from the U.S. Election Assistance Commission.
Hans von Spakovsky, senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation’s Edwin Meese III Center for Legal and Judicial Studies, said whether the race is called that night depends on how many ballots come in after Election Day.
“We won’t really know because there is no way to predict that,” he told the DCNF. “But it is a monumentally stupid decision that invites fraud by bad actors who may try to gather up ballots that have not been voted and then submit them after Election Day as they see the preliminary, unofficial results.”
Nevada Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar did implement several measures to speed up the process this year, including allowing tabulation of early voting returns beginning at 8 am on Election Day. Mail ballots can be counted beginning 15 days before the election, according to guidance given to the counties. (RELATED: Swing State Republicans Are Leaning Into Ballot Harvesting — And It Seems To Be Working)
“This year, the country will be looking to Nevada to determine the winner of the Presidential election,” Aguilar wrote in May. “Voters deserve available results on election night; releasing results sooner will increase transparency, help us combat misinformation and alleviate pressure on election officials.”

Zach, a Democrat who is supporting Vice President Kamala Harris because of abortion, felt for the first time this cycle that he needed to vote in-person. While he does not believe the laws need to be changed, he told the DCNF he was “nervous” about sending his mail-in ballot, especially after fires were set to dropboxes in Portland, Oregon, and Vancouver, Washington.
“I don’t want to risk that,” he said.
Edward, a Trump voter whose top issues were immigration and reducing the deficit, told the DCNF he was “very concerned” by late results from mail-in ballots. “That needs to go,” he said. “It needs to be in-person and show an ID. And it should get done the same day by 10 o’clock.”
“You should vote either in-person or by the day and show who you are,” Angela, a Trump voter, told the DCNF. (RELATED: Pro-Palestine Messages Reportedly Found On Devices At Ballot Box Fires)
George Guthrie, spokesman for Washoe County’s election office, told the DCNF the results are unofficial until certified by the board of county commissioners on Nov. 15. Before that date, it’s difficult to estimate “when every vote is counted,” he said.
“I can say however the office is confident in having the majority of our results released on Election Night when all polls are closed across the state,” he said, explaining in-person votes from election day and early voting, as well as mail ballots processed to that point, will be counted. However, not all votes will be received on election night as “ballots are most likely in the mail in transit to our office.”
Washoe County is a swing county with the second greatest population in the state.
In the more populated Clark County, where Democrats typically lead, the elections department did not respond to multiple requests for comment about the anticipated timeline for results.

Despite lingering concerns about the new rules, Republicans in the state have leaned into ballot harvesting, which became legal in 2020, and pushed supporters to vote early. During a Trump rally last week, some voters took advantage of a return for mail-in ballots offered on-site.
The party has seen great success in early voting, surpassing previous years. Republicans lead by over 40,000 votes as of Wednesday morning.

The Daily Caller,Chuck Schumer Reportedly Promises To Pass Bill Against Campus Antisemitism After Election,"Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has reportedly promised Jewish leaders he will try to pass the Antisemitism Awareness Act by the end of the year, Axios reported Tuesday.
The bill is meant to protect Jewish students on campus by adding protections to anti-discrimination laws after countless incidents of harassment and violence have been reported since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war in late 2023, sources told Axios. Schumer reportedly plans to attach the act to the National Defense Authorization Act, which is responsible for setting the national defense budget for the Department of Defense, which will be voted on after the Nov. 5 election.
The act passed the House in May with some bipartisan support, though many objected to the bill’s language defining antisemitism, arguing it was too broad and would not do enough to solve the rampant antisemitism crisis, according to Axios. The bill also divided many Democrats who oppose the bill’s defining statements like “denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination” and “drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis” as antisemitic.
Pro-Israel groups have grown frustrated with Schumer’s inability to get the bill through the Senate, Axios reported.

The Daily Caller,Pro-Palestine Messages Reportedly Found On Devices At Ballot Box Fires,"Devices recovered at two ballot box fires in the Pacific Northwest reportedly both contained pro-Palestinian messaging, according to The New York Times.
The words “Free Gaza,” were emblazoned on the devices that presumably caused the fires Monday in Portland, Oregon, and Vancouver, Washington, an anonymous source within the Portland Police Department (PPD) told The New York Times. The Portland Police Department (PPD) confirmed that the incidents are connected, but have yet to determine the motive.

“There was enough evidence collected at all three scenes that lead us to believe that all three incidents are connected, and we cannot get into more detail,” Mike Benner, spokesman for the Portland Police Bureau, said on Monday according to The New York Times.
There was a third device that did not explode at another ballot box in Vancouver, according to The New York Times. All three devices were sent to the terrorist explosive device analytical center in Huntsville, Alabama, another PPD source told The New York Times.
After the October 7th attacks by Hamas against Israel, protests erupted in the United States demanding a ceasefire in the region and humanitarian support for people in Gaza. Some of the protests resulted in violence.

In Portland, most of the ballots were undamaged due to the on-board fire suppression system, according to The New York Times. In Vancouver, hundreds of ballots were destroyed in the blaze.
While Washington and Oregon are not considered competitive states in the presidential election, Portland is electing a new mayor and a congressional race between Democrat Marie Perez and Republican Joe Kent in southwest Washington is extremely competitive, according to FiveThirtyEight polling averages.
Last election, Perez beat Kent by only 3,000 votes, according to The New York Times in August.
People who brought their ballot to the box were asked to request replacements, according to The New York Times. Clark County, which contains Vancouver in its boundaries, will place observers at 22 ballot boxes for 24 hours a day for protection.
Benner told the Daily Caller News Foundation that the device in Portland was recovered for forensic analysis and will be “examined for any unique writings or markings.”
The Vancouver PD deferred to their press release and directed the DCNF to the FBI regarding specific details of the investigation.

The Daily Caller,Nathan Wade Remembers Childhood Visits To White House But Not Key Details About Trump Case Meetings,"Former special prosecutor Nathan Wade admitted to several meetings with the White House in his deposition released Monday but could not recall key details about the events.
While he fondly recalled summer vacations to the White House as a child, Wade was unable to remember central details about meetings he took while serving as special prosecutor on the case against former President Donald Trump, including who he met with, where the meetings occurred, how they were set up, and what the purpose was, according to the transcript released by the House Judiciary Committee Monday.
Billing statements that became public after a Trump co-defendant filed a motion to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis over her romantic relationship with Wade, whom she appointed to work on the case, revealed Wade met with the White House several times in the months prior to Trump’s indictment. Wade confirmed having May and November meetings in 2022, but could not remember whether he traveled to participate.
“Have you ever visited the White House?” the committee asked Wade. (RELATED: Judge Tosses Two Counts Against Trump In Fani Willis’ Indictment)
“As a kid, I can remember my dad — my dad and mom taking me to the White House on summer vacations,” he said. Wade later stated he never attended meetings at the White House in his capacity as special prosecutor.
Wade also could not recall details about an event listed as “Witness interview; conf call D.C.; team meeting” from September 2022, which he billed $6,000 for completing.
At one point, Wade could not confirm whether “D.C.” referred to the District of Columbia or an individual who shared those initials.
“I’m fairly comfortable saying that I would have meant District of Columbia, but there is a remote possibility that I meant someone with the initials D.C.,” Wade said.
During his deposition, Wade also admitted he had no prior experience prosecuting Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) cases before taking the position, explaining RICO expert John Floyd “spent hours” teaching him about the law.
“I went to what you would — what I would call RICO school to learn about what it is, what it means, and how it works,” Wade said. “It’s a very complicated legal concept, but the dubbed godfather of RICO, the gentleman who wrote the book…spent hours and hours teaching me RICO, if you will.”
Wade was initially awarded a contract with a higher hourly rate than Floyd, the Daily Caller News Foundation reported earlier this year. He stepped down from the case in March after a judge made it a condition of allowing Willis to stay.
Willis’ office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Daily Caller,‘You Do Not Understand Regular People’s Concerns’: GOP Candidate Blasts Former Biden Official Opponent During Debate,"Republican congressional candidate Lily Tang Williams of New Hampshire lit into Democratic congressional candidate Maggie Goodlander during a Thursday debate, WMUR reported.
Williams and Goodlander had sharp exchanges during the forum over the economy after the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that only 12,000 jobs were created in October earlier Friday. Williams called out Goodlander over her net worth, noting that the Democratic nominee had portrayed herself as a renter in a previous campaign pitch. (RELATED: ‘You’ve Lied To Us’: Chris Sununu Blasts Kamala Harris For ‘Absolutely Condescending’ Campaign)
“You’re worth $20 million or $30 million,” Williams said. “How did you know about regular people’s suffering? Do you go shopping, go to warm up, buy food? I talked to those people.”

“And you pretend to be a renter in Nashua moving back a few months ago to run for this open seat with millions of dollars from Washington, D.C. insiders, and the millions, millions of dollars,” Williams continued. “I don’t have money to run TV ads. You’re pretending to be poor, complaining rent is so high, you couldn’t save that apartment for other people to rent in Nashua, just go back to your $2 million home import business. Please don’t say that because you do not understand regular people’s concerns.”
Goodlander, a former White House aid and Department of Justice official under President Joe Biden, is married to Jake Sullivan, who currently serves as the president’s national security adviser.
Since Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris took office in January 2021, prices rose by over 20%, while the Consumer Price Index (CPI) reached a high of 9% in June 2022. By comparison, the CPI grew 1.4% year-over-year in January 2021, when Trump left office, while the average price for a gallon of gas was under $2.25, according to GasBuddy.com.
Biden’s approval rating on the economy was only 39.8% in the RealClearPolling average, while only 36% gave him good marks on inflation and only 34.8% approved of his handling of immigration, all of which have been issues emphasized by former President Donald Trump in the campaign.
Harris trails Trump by 0.3% in the RealClearPolling average of polls from Oct. 11 to Nov. 1, with the two deadlocked when Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein, independent candidate Cornel West and Libertarian candidate Chase Oliver are included in surveys.

The Daily Caller,CNN’s Harry Enten Says ‘Movement’ Toward Trump ‘Among A Key Bloc’ In Crucial States ‘Gives Democrats Some Agita’,"CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten said Wednesday that he thinks former President Donald Trump’s gains with independents in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are making Democrats uneasy.
Trump currently holds narrow leads over Vice President Kamala Harris in all three states, according to RealClearPolling averages. Enten, on “CNN News Central,” noted Trump is now slightly leading among independents in these battleground states, a shift from 2020 when he trailed President Joe Biden with this demographic. (RELATED: Former Clinton Pollster Says Harris’ ‘Inauthenticity’ Is ‘The Larger Problem She Faces’ In Election)
WATCH:
“What do we know about independents, right? Center of the electorate. You go last time around Joe Biden won these voters by 11 points. You look at September of 2024, a month ago, Kamala Harris was up five points among independents. You look now though, look at this. She’s only up by two points among a key bloc, center of the electorate, down nine points from where Biden was at the end of the 2020 campaign,” Enten told host John Berman. “Of course, this is a national picture … What is going on in those key battleground states, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, the Great Lakes, that blue wall, right?”
“Joe Biden, last time around, won ’em by five points over Donald Trump. Look at where we are today. This is the type of movement Donald Trump likes to see in the center of the electorate, up by a point. Now, of course, that’s well within any margin of error, right? But again, it‘s the movement. It’s the trend, Mr. Berman, that we’re looking at,” he added. “And when you flip a group from going plus five Biden to now plus one Trump. That’s the type of movement Donald Trump loves to see, and it’s the type of movement that I think gives Democrats some agita.”
Enten also asserted presidential candidates who win with independent voters typically secure an election victory, though not always.
“Why are we seeing this movement in the electorate, perhaps away from the Democrats towards Donald Trump? And this is true overall, this is true among independents as well. View as too liberal, right? Are you out of the mainstream, perhaps? 38% said that of Joe Biden back in 2020, now that number is up to 48% for Kamala Harris versus the 40% or so who see Trump as too conservative,” he added. “The bottom line is Harris may be a little bit too out of the mainstream, at least compared to Donald Trump when we’re talking ideologically speaking.”
Harris supported many left-wing policies during her 2020 presidential bid, but reversed some of her stances since launching her 2024 campaign in July. Her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, also has a far-left record on issues such as immigration and transgender policy.
Trump also currently leads Harris in the other four top swing states, according to the RealClearPolling averages. Journalist Mark Halperin asserted Tuesday that Trump will be president-elect on Nov. 5 if the present early voting trajectory persists.
“Make no mistake, if these numbers hold up in the states where we can understand even partially what the data is like, we’ll know that Donald Trump’s going to be president on Election Day,” he said.

The Daily Caller,Stray Bullet Strikes TV Reporter At Democratic Senate Campaign Event,"A stray bullet hit a Missouri TV reporter Tuesday during a campaign event for Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Lucas Kunce.
Kunce was campaigning at a private shooting range when a bullet appeared to ricochet off a target and strike KSHB-TV reporter Ryan Gamboa, according to The Kansas City Star. Kunce was the only person shooting when the injury occurred and he immediately offered aid to the reporter.

The Daily Caller,Tucker At Trump Rally: ‘They Went Out Of Their Way To Humiliate You And Spit On You And The Graves Of Your Ancestors’,"Political commentator Tucker Carlson warmed up the crowd Wednesday at a rally for former President Donald Trump in Duluth, Georgia, warning Democrats that “dad” is coming home.
Carlson delivered an impassioned rebuke of the Democratic Party, telling Trump supporters in the room that they are the American majority rather than a hated minority.
He ripped Democrats who support tearing down statues and allowing illegal migrants to pour into the U.S., declaring that the majority of America will tolerate this no more.
“They went out of their way to humiliate and spit on you and the graves of your ancestors,” a fiery Carlson said in his speech.
Carlson said Trump, who he likened to a father coming home from work, would give the Biden-Harris administration a “spanking” if he wins the 2024 election.
“If you allow your hormone-addled 15-year-old daughter to, like, slam the door of her bedroom and give you the finger, you’re gonna get more of it. And those kids are gonna end up in rehab!” Carlson explained. “It’s not good for you and it’s not good for them.”
“There has to be a point at which dad comes home,” he stated as the crowd erupted in a standing ovation. “Yeah, that’s right! Dad comes home. And he’s pissed!”
Carlson said while “dad” is actually not pissed and still loves his children, “dad” is greatly disappointed in his children and must let them know.
“And when dad gets home, you know what he says? ‘You’ve been a bad girl. You’ve been a bad little girl and you’re getting a vigorous spanking,'” Carlson said.
CNN’s Brian Stelter reported that the crowd shouted, “Daddy’s home” and “daddy Don,” as Trump took the stage.
After Tucker Carlson likened Trump to “daddy” tonight, and said a reelected Trump would need to give the media and Democrats a “spanking,” the rally crowd “went wild,” @alaynatreene reports.

“To allow millions of people, mostly young men with no skills and no English, into our country illegally and then fly them around at our expense and give them phones and put them on welfare programs that American citizen can get. It is the most insulting-” Carson said, causing the audience to boo the Biden-Harris administration’s role in the border crisis.
“Yeah, boo. But it’s worse than boo,” he remarked. “It’s the biggest crime in the history of the United States of America.”",2024-10-24
The Daily Caller,Scientist Buried Study Of Puberty Blockers For Kids Because She Didn’t Like The Results,"A doctor studying the effects of puberty-blocking drugs on children is reportedly withholding publishing data because the findings may be used by critics who support bans on the procedure.
Doctor Johanna Olson-Kennedy, a leading physician at one of the country’s largest youth gender clinics, led a two-year federally funded study in 2015 that followed 95 children receiving hormone blockers as part of sex-change procedures to monitor changes in mental health, according to The New York Times. Olson-Kennedy reportedly feared that in light of recent attempts to limit the procedure, the results of the study showing no improvement to mental health outcomes may reveal that “we shouldn’t use blockers because it doesn’t impact [the kids],” according to the NYT.
“I do not want our work to be weaponized,” Olson-Kennedy told the NYT. “It has to be exactly on point, clear and concise. And that takes time.”
The doctor argued that the findings of the study were neutral because the kids were “in really good shape when they come in, and they’re in really good shape after two years,” but earlier published findings from the study reveal that at the beginning of the study, roughly one-quarter of children reported symptoms of depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation, while nearly 8% had previously attempted suicide. The study did not show improved trends, Olson-Kennedy told the NYT.
Dr. Olson-Kennedy hypothesized that the study would reveal hormone blockers “decreased symptoms of depression, anxiety, trauma symptoms, self-injury, and suicidality, and increased body esteem and quality of life over time,” in the children, but insisted the results did not show the expected improvements because the kids had “good mental health on average,” according to the NYT.
“They’re not in any concerning ranges, either at the beginning or after two years,” she told the NYT.
Olson-Kennedy is a staunch advocate for sex-change treatment for youth, testifying in favor of the practice in multiple lawsuits. States like Idaho and Texas have banned sex-change operations and hormone blockers for children.
The study cost taxpayers $9.7 million, the NYT reported.
Around 121,882 children ages 6 to 17 were treated for “gender dysphoria” from 2017 to 2021, increasing by 70% from 2020 to 2021, according to Reuters. At least 4,780 minors have been put on puberty blockers within that time frame. (RELATED: Child Sex Change Bans Are Making Real-World Impact In Red States, Study Finds)

The Daily Caller,"Overregulation In Childcare Tied To Families Having Less Kids, Report Says","Families in states with highly regulated childcare systems are more likely than in less strict states to have fewer kids than they desire in connection with the increased cost of childcare, an October report found.
Strict regulations on childcare, such as increased educational requirements, more training hours for employees and limited child-to-staff ratios, are meant to improve the service and appeal more to parents but often increase costs, likely factoring into parents’ decisions to have more kids or not, according to a report by West Virginia University’s Knee Regulatory Research Center.
“Childcare challenges facing U.S. families are making news headlines as a ‘classic’ example of market failure,” the report reads. “With wages that are too low relative to prices, it is easy to assume that the childcare market simply cannot clear. This prompts calls for greater intervention in the form of subsidies. However, a subsidy approach misses the key role that the regulatory environment of the childcare market plays in raising costs. Though well-intended, the regulatory framework cripples progress towards affordability, availability, flexibility, and quality for American families seeking childcare solutions.”
The average fertility gap in the U.S. — the difference between desired family size and actual family size — is 0.8 kids but is lower by between 0.025 and 0.029 in states with less restrictive childcare regulations, the study found. The study predicted that if Massachusetts, the state with the highest regulations, such as requiring more staff per student and more education for employees, adopted the same policies as Louisiana, the state with the lowest regulations, the total fertility rate in the state would increase by 14%.
“Childcare workers and parents bear the weight of licensing regulations and administrative costs,” Anna Claire Flowers, co-author of the report and PhD fellow with the Mercatus Center, said in a statement. “High-quality care is the goal, but some measures have been shown to boost prices much more than quality. Regulation on childcare affects entrepreneurial decisions in the industry and influences parents’ labor market decisions. While not the only major player, childcare regulation is one piece of the policy puzzle that can make it more or less difficult for families to find compatibility between work responsibilities and raising children.”
States like those in New England generally have stricter regulations and higher-than-average fertility gaps, the report found. States like Texas, Nevada and Arizona had some of the least strict childcare regulations and fared better than the national average for fertility gap rates. (RELATED: Kamala Harris Voted Against Trump-Era Bill That Expanded Child Tax Credits She Champions)
Childcare costs rose nationally by 32% from 2019 to 2023, outpacing the 20% rise in overall prices within that same time frame.

The Daily Caller,EXCLUSIVE: Dem Congresswoman Was A Fixture At Events Honoring Chinese Communist Party Officials,"New York Democratic Rep. Grace Meng has repeatedly met with visiting Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials and intel personnel alongside a civic association she was listed as belonging to for years, a Daily Caller News Foundation investigation discovered.
The six-term congresswoman has publicly toasted CCP intel chiefs, awarded congressional commendations to Communist Party bosses and received numerous gifts during more than a dozen events welcoming Chinese government delegations to New York City since 2008, according to a DCNF review of hundreds of Chinese government, media and civic association reports.
Meng attended all these events alongside leaders of the Henan Association of Eastern America (HAEA), a Chinese civic group she joined in 2008 as “deputy chairwoman,” the DCNF previously reported. After being elected to Congress in 2012, Meng continued to meet with Chinese officials and maintained an “honorary” role in HAEA, raising concerns among China experts over her connections to CCP intelligence operations and an accused Chinese agent.
“It’s extremely troubling that a sitting Democrat in Congress has literally welcomed Chinese Communist Party influence into our country,” Indiana Republican Rep. Jim Banks told the DCNF. “This deserves further investigation, and at the least shows the dangers of United Front groups; why members of foreign influence operations must follow the law and register under FARA; and why the worst groups like the Henan Association should be designated as foreign missions of Communist China.”
‘Targeted By The CCP’
The vast majority of Meng’s meetings with Chinese communist dignitaries emerged from her relationship with HAEA, an ethnic association based in New York City that federal prosecutors have linked to CCP influence operations, according to The Wall Street Journal. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Alleged Chinese Spy Spent Years Rubbing Elbows With Dem Congresswoman)
For over a decade, Meng’s photo was prominently featured at the top of HAEA’s home page until the entire website was deleted on Sept. 26, following DCNF reports on her years-long involvement in the organization. The links above point to screenshots made by web.archive.org.
Meng recently denied having ever held any official position with HAEA when asked about it by the WSJ, claiming she only ever had an “honorary title.” Meng also claimed she had “no recollection” of a 2008 video in which she identified herself as HAEA’s “deputy chairwoman.”
However, Meng disclosed her HAEA affiliation on several other occasions, including in statements Meng made to the organization posted to its website in January 2009. She has similarly indicated she belongs to the group several other times.
HAEA’s leadership includes multiple individuals who simultaneously hold positions with the All-China Federation Of Returned Overseas Chinese (ACFROC), which is an “agency” of a Chinese influence and intelligence service called the United Front Work Department (UFWD).
ACFROC’s records identify HAEA’s president, Zhang Fuyin, as an “overseas advisors,” and reports with photos from ACFROC and HAEA likewise identify several other HAEA leaders, including its chairman, as ACFROC officials.
The WSJ recently identified Zhang as an unindicted, and unnamed, co-conspirator in the U.S. Department of Justice’s (DOJ) indictment of Linda Sun, the former director of operations for Meng’s 2012 congressional campaign. The indictment alleges Sun and her husband acted as unregistered agents of China while Sun worked for two New York governors. Sun and her husband have pleaded not guilty.
Following the indictment, the WSJ reported Sun had met the “heads of key groups identifiable in the indictment as being United Front-linked,” naming HAEA and another New York Chinese association.
Zhang and HAEA’s deputy chairman, Sydney Li, who also serves as Meng’s congressional aide, visited China together in April 2019, during which Li presented a letter from Meng to the Henan provincial chairwoman of ACFROC, the WSJ recently reported. The 2019 trip is referenced in the DOJ’s indictment of Sun, though Zhang and Li are not named.
But that’s not the only time Meng’s letters have been hand-delivered to CCP officials. Li has hand-delivered letters from Meng to CCP intel and Propaganda Department officials on at least five occasions, according to photos and Chinese-language media reports reviewed by the DCNF.
In one instance, Li presented a letter on behalf of Meng to a visiting Henan Propaganda Department official in September 2018, according to Chinese-language news outlet Sina. In another, the Sichuan provincial branch of ACFROC announced Li had delivered a letter from Meng to its Deputy Party Secretary in June 2019.
Li also attended two meetings in Shenyang, China in 2017, ACFROC social media posts show. In March 2017, Li met with UFWD and ACFROC officials, and in July he sat down again with ACFROC officials. During both meetings, Li expressed his willingness to help, either by promoting economic development in northeast China or by assisting ACFROC to expand in the U.S. through unspecified means.
The DCNF found no evidence indicating Meng disclosed her position as HAEA’s deputy chairwoman on her congressional “Calendar Year 2012 Financial Disclosure Statement,” which required her to list executive positions from that calendar year and the year prior regardless of whether or not income was earned.
Meng’s office, HAEA, Zhang and Li did not return multiple requests for comment.
“The Chinese Communist Party is always working to extend its reach to American soil,” Michigan Republican Rep. John Moolenaar, chairman of the House Select Committee on the CCP, told the DCNF. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Dem Rep Once Praised High-Ranking Chinese Communist’s ‘Leadership,’ Unearthed Footage Shows)
“As part of its mission to subvert the United States, the CCP uses its main influence arm, the United Front, to target American elites, including in business and in the public sector. That’s why the Select Committee has worked on a bipartisan basis to expand awareness of United Front work among Members of Congress, as well to highlight the danger United Front work poses to our country and to communities often targeted by the CCP.”

‘Glory For The Motherland’
Meng recently acknowledged attending Chinese civic association events “to wish them happy Lunar New Year or whatever the occasion is,” the WSJ reported. Yet, posts on HAEA’s website and Chinese-language news articles reveal that prior to joining Congress, Meng also met with at least half a dozen high-level CCP delegations while serving as HAEA’s deputy chairwoman.
The first meeting occurred less than two weeks after Meng won the Sept. 9, 2008, New York State Assembly Democratic primary, when China’s then-premier, Wen Jiabao, visited the state to attend a United Nations summit.
Photos show HAEA members — including Meng’s staffer, Li — lining the streets of New York City on Sept. 23, 2008 to welcome Wen Jiabao. That day, prominent members of various Chinese civic associations — including Meng and HAEA’s chairman — were photographed together with Wen Jiabao during a meeting at the Waldorf Astoria.
At the event, Wen Jiabao urged ethnic Chinese living overseas to serve “the motherland,” according to China News Service, a state-run media outlet controlled by the UFWD.
“Chinese from the mainland, Hong Kong, and Taiwan are all members of one Chinese ethnicity, all are leaves on the motherland’s great tree, whose roots are connected in the motherland’s soil and nobody can split them — this is a blood tie,” Wen Jiabao told the assembled Chinese civic leaders. “Overseas Chinese need to unite, make progress and win glory for the motherland.”
“Grace Meng’s actions are extremely suspicious,” China expert Gordon Chang told the DCNF. “It’s time to convene a grand jury.”
After meeting Wen Jiabao, Meng attended several back-to-back HAEA banquets for visiting CCP delegations, according to the organization’s website.
On Dec. 15, 2008, HAEA hosted a welcome dinner for Henan provincial officials visiting New York to “strengthen ties” with HAEA. Photos from HAEA’s website show Meng delivered a speech during the dinner beside the delegation’s head, who, among other roles, was chairman of a Henan UFWD affiliate tasked with subverting foreign leaders called the Chinese People’s Association For Friendship With Foreign Countries (CPAFFC).
The following week, Meng attended a welcome banquet in Queens, New York on Dec. 22, 2008 for ACFROC’s chairman, Lin Jun, which the DCNF recently reported. Footage from the banquet shows Meng praising “our Chairman Lin” for his leadership.
Two months later, the Henan CPAFFC chairman who’d led the Dec. 15, 2008 delegation returned to New York in February 2009 with his boss, Henan’s governor. HAEA leaders welcomed the CCP delegation at JFK Airport, where they had a stretch Hummer limousine waiting. Meng was photographed two days later at a farewell banquet for the delegation on February 12, 2009.
One snapshot shows Meng, Henan’s CPAFFC chairman, the Henan governor, and HAEA leaders under a banner written in broken English that read: “Welcome The People’s Government of Henan Province Delegation Visit New York!” Several Chinese civic leaders who’d been present when Meng met Premier Wen Jiabao and ACFROC’s Chairman Lin also appear in these event photos.
Later in 2009, HAEA’s photos show that Meng accepted a gold engraving from a high-ranking CCP official — the deputy mayor of Shangqiu, Henan — during a November 2009 welcome banquet for his visiting delegation.
Meng and HAEA welcomed a sixth CCP delegation in July 2011, which was led by a former CPAFFC and UFWD official, who then oversaw “discipline inspection work” for Henan’s Foreign Affairs Office. China’s Commission For Discipline Inspection serves as the Party’s internal police and plays a key role in a Ministry of Public Security initiative that forcibly repatriates Chinese nationals back to China to face charges for alleged crimes, according to the DOJ.
“Very few Americans are aware of the hostile work of the UFWD, whose responsibilities are to gather intelligence on elite leaders, manage their relations with them and gain influence over them, that essentially involves weaponizing corruption, so they can advance their political, ideological, economic, and security objectives,” Joseph Cella, a former U.S. ambassador and co-founder of the Michigan-China Economic and Security Review Group, told the DCNF.
“The propaganda of the CCP is sophisticated and impactful, and one of gravest threats to our national security is when it is manifested through the capture of government elites, through the UFWD,” Cella said. “In this threat environment emanating from the CCP, our posture must be commensurate to provide for our common defense and protect our national security.”

‘Too Many Suspicious Contacts’
One month before HAEA celebrated the launch of Meng’s 2012 congressional campaign, her title was changed from “deputy chairwoman” to “honorary chairwoman” — a position she was listed as holding up until the recent deletion of HAEA’s website.
While serving as honorary chairwoman, Meng attended at least six banquets in New York for high-level CCP delegations, according to a DCNF review of HAEA’s website, ACFROC announcements and Chinese-language news articles:
- December 7, 2012: Meng attended a HAEA banquet for a visiting Henan CPAFFC director and delivered a speech beside them, saying she hoped to travel to Henan in the future, according to HAEA’s website.
- February 17, 2013: Meng received calligraphy during a February 2013 HAEA banquet from a visiting Henan CPAFFC director, who led his provincial theatrical troupe to perform songs from a CCP Propaganda Department-awarded opera at the reception.
- February 7, 2014: Meng awarded a congressional commendation to the CCP official who’d given her a gold engraving in November 2009 during a HAEA banquet for Henan CCP officials and UFWD personnel, according to a HAEA announcement.
- August 15, 2015: Meng received a plaque during a HAEA banquet featuring the ACFROC chairs of Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces.
- August 2, 2016: Meng received calligraphy from a Linyi, Shandong CCP delegation that included personnel from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office, which later officially came under the control of the UFWD. During the event, Linyi’s Overseas Chinese Affairs Office and two New York Shandong associations jointly established a New York “talent recruitment work station,” which, according to Chinese espionage expert Alex Joske, are “often linked to the CCP’s United Front system.”
- September 11, 2016: Meng and HAEA members dined with the Henan provincial ACFROC chairwoman.
More recently, Meng and HAEA worked with Henan ACFROC to distribute medical masks to Queens’ residents during the COVID-19 pandemic in May 2020.
Footage shows Meng and HAEA leaders standing in front of a banner thanking Henan’s ACFROC for “donating personal protective equipment to New York.” Federal reports note that, during the pandemic, the UFWD orchestrated a global campaign to hoard medical supplies and the Chinese government donated such goods to countries with “political conditions, such as public statements of gratitude.”
Meng and HAEA leaders also banqueted with visiting Shandong CCP and intel officials in New York in March 2024, according to a DCNF review of a Chinese-language World Journal report and event footage.
The delegation was led by Shandong’s deputy governor, who was appointed UFWD chief of Qingdao city in March 2022. Meng sat beside the deputy governor during dinner and footage shows Shandong’s CPAFFC executive deputy chairwoman spoke with Meng while she ate.
“Meng has too many suspicious contacts and actions in her past, so we have to ask: Is she more loyal to America or China?” author Gordon Chang told the DCNF.

The Daily Caller,Trump Reveals New Tax Policy For ‘Family Caregivers’ During Raucous NYC Rally,"Former President Donald Trump revealed a new tax break for “family caregivers” during his speech to a packed rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City Sunday evening.
“I am announcing a new policy today that I will support a tax credit for family caregivers who take care of a parent or a loved one,” Trump said to a crowd of about 20,000 people during his rally at Madison Square Garden.
“It’s about time that they were recognized. They add so much to our country, and they are never spoken of ever, ever, ever, but they are going to be spoken of now. Thank you very much,” he continued.

During the Republican National Committee Convention in July, the party’s platform included strengthening Medicare and expanding support for family caregivers through “tax credits and reduced red tape.”
Vice President Kamala Harris has also highlighted the need for increased support for caregivers, which includes expanding Medicare to cover home care services, according to USA Today.
In addition to giving tax breaks to caregivers, he also has discussed other tax policies including plans to get rid of the federal income tax and replace it with tariffs as he recently discussed on the Joe Rogan Experience, as well as no tax on tips and overtime pay.",2024-10-27
The Daily Caller,Dem Super PAC Launches $100 Million Worth Of Pro-Harris Ads Amid Trump Polling Surge,"A Democratic super PAC is launching $100 million worth of advertisements in support of Vice President Kamala Harris Tuesday amid a recent surge in former President Donald Trump’s polling numbers, according to Politico.
The record-breaking ad buy aims to boost support for the Democratic nominee amid a recent slip in her polling performance, with Trump leading by 0.4% on a national basis after being down by nearly two percentage points in September, with a longtime member of Trump’s inner circle telling Axios, “We’ve never had data that looks this good.” The ads from super PAC Future Forward look to broadcast Harris’ closing message to voters and win additional support from specific cleavage groups like blacks, Spanish speakers and women who are pro-abortion.
“Donald Trump talks about black economic opportunity like it’s 1865,” one ad tailored toward African-American voters says, before listing off various cash sums Harris claims she’d distribute as president. (RELATED: Kamala Harris Appears To Propose New Race-Based Payments As Support From Black Men Lags)
The Harris campaign unveiled its “Opportunity Agenda for Black Men” on Oct. 14 which proposed to give one million “fully forgivable” $20,000 loans to black entrepreneurs, as well as “others who have historically faced barriers to starting a new business or growing an existing business.” A New York Times/Siena College poll released on Oct. 12 showed 78% of black voters supported Harris, well below the 90% of black voters who supported Biden in 2020.
Future Forward — which controls a $700 million war chest that includes multi-million dollar donations from LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg — also purchased ad space on Spanish-language radio, playing a song titled “Puro Engaño” that tries to tie Trump to Project 2025. The former president has said on multiple occasions that he has “nothing to do” with the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025.
Meanwhile, the PAC’s swing state advertisement “Who You Trust” suggests Trump will pursue an abortion ban and that losing access to abortion would take away “basic healthcare” from one in three American women. Trump has repeatedly stated that he does not support a national abortion ban.
The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Daily Caller,Harris Calls Rare Presser To Peddle Newest Contested John Kelly Attack On Trump,"Vice President Kamala Harris gave an unexpected address from her residence Wednesday to respond to former White House chief of staff John Kelly’s claims about how Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump would govern if reelected.
The New York Times and The Atlantic both published stories Tuesday detailing interviews with Kelly, who claimed that the former president said Hitler “did some good things,” wanted generals like the Nazi dictator had and would rule like a fascist. The Trump campaign denied the content of both stories.
Spokesperson Steven Chueng said the comments were “debunked stories,” adding that the former chief of staff “beclowned” himself. Harris waded into the dispute Wednesday, saying that Kelly’s statements made it clear the former president was “unhinged and unstable.”
“All of this is further evidence for the American people of who Donald Trump really is,” Harris said. “This is a window into who Donald Trump really is, from the people who know him best. From the people who worked with him side by side, in the Oval Office and in the Situation Room.
“It is clear from John Kelly’s words that Donald Trump is someone who, I quote, ‘certainly falls into the general definition of fascist.’ Who vowed to be a dictator on day one and vowed to use the military as his personal militia to carry out his personal and political vendettas,” she continued. (RELATED: CNN Guest Calls Out Selectively Edited Clip Of Trump Straight To Hosts Faces)
The Atlantic’s story containing Kelly’s comments also alleged that the former president disparaged a deceased veteran and her family. In addition to the Trump campaign, former officials, the deceased veteran’s family and their lawyer have all gone on the record to deny the story. (RELATED: The Atlantic’s October Surprise On Trump Implodes After Denials Galore From Everyone Involved)
“After having dealt with hundreds of reporters in my legal career, this is unfortunately the first time I have to go on record and call out Jeffrey Goldberg@the Atlantic: not only did he misrepresent our conversation but he outright LIED in HIS sensational story,” the family’s lawyer, Natalie Khawam, tweeted.

Vice President Harris is a fraud. I was in the White House at a senior level much longer than General Kelly. He is complicit in this fraud and has lied to the American people. His lies, as well as John Bolton’s, are a disservice to Nation at this critical time. So are the VP’s. https://t.co/2b77pMsVVl
— Keith Kellogg (@generalkellogg) October 23, 2024
Jeffrey Goldberg, the Editor-In-Chief of the Atlantic who wrote the Tuesday article, similarly published a story in September 2020 claiming that Trump canceled a 2018 visit to a French cemetery where American troops were buried and had called them “suckers” and “losers.” The credibility of the story, which is based on anonymous sources, has also come under fire. Former national security adviser John Bolton has denied Trump ever said the words, instead stating Trump didn’t make the trip for weather and security reasons.
Harris’ schedule was adjusted just an hour before her unexpected press conference to include that she would be giving remarks at her residence. The vice president spoke for just about three minutes and did not take any questions. Similar to Harris’ message Wednesday, Biden’s campaign message circled around calling Trump a threat to democracy. Before the president dropped out of the presidential race, senior Democrats alongside some of Biden’s aides were doubting the slogan, Axios reported.
Less than two weeks until the election, the vice president is trailing Trump in all seven top battleground states, according to the RealClear Polling averages.
“Donald Trump is increasingly unhinged and unstable, and in a second term, people like John Kelly would not be there to be the guard rails against his propensities and his actions,” Harris said.",2024-10-23
The Daily Caller,Democratic Sen. John Fetterman Calls Trump Support In Pennsylvania ‘Astonishing’,"Democratic Sen. John Fetterman told The New York Times in an interview released Saturday that 2024 Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump “one hundred percent” has a special connection with the people of Pennsylvania.
The Pennsylvania senator said he might not understand why Trump support is so intense in his state, but he nevertheless must acknowledge it exists.
“You can see the intensity. It’s astonishing,” Fetterman told reporter Lulu Garcia-Navarro.
NYT: “You’ve said that Trump has a special connection with the people of Pennsylvania.”
FETTERMAN: “100%… Anybody who spends time driving around, and you can see the intensity. It’s astonishing.” pic.twitter.com/gHfIE6Os7i

Fetterman said he encountered a large Trump merchandise shop while participating in an event in Indiana County, which he described as “very, very red.” He noted the dozens of T-shirts and bumper stickers featuring images of the Republican nominee.
“It’s the kind of thing that’s taken on its own life. And it’s like something very special exists there. And that doesn’t mean that I admire it. It’s just — it’s real,” Fetterman said.
Fetterman also said billionaire Elon Musk’s joining forces with Trump moved the needle for a lot of Pennsylvania voters. (RELATED: ‘You’re Not A Kamala Person, I Know You’: Trump Makes His Case To Joe Rogan On Why He’s A Better Candidate Than Harris)
“I was truly alarmed about that when he started showing up,” Fetterman told the outlet.
“Endorsements, they’re really not meaningful often but this one is, I think. That has me concerned,” he said of Musk.
Musk endorsed Trump shortly after the former president was shot in the ear at a July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The SpaceX and Tesla founder who also purchased Twitter first appeared on stage with Trump when he returned to Butler for an Oct. 5 rally.
Musk has since become a vocal campaign surrogate for Trump, holding multiple events in Pennsylvania in October. He also launched the America PAC which targets seven battleground states by encouraging residents to register to vote and to follow through by casting their ballots.
Musk is also offering $1 million to one person each day until Election Day who signs a petition pledging support for the First and Second Amendments.",2024-10-26
The Daily Caller,Scott Jennings Doesn’t Buy It When CNN Panelist Spins Biden Calling Trump Supporters ‘Garbage’,"Republican strategist Scott Jennings called out film executive Franklin Leonard Tuesday night after Leonard attempted to explain President Joe Biden’s comments characterizing supporters of former President Donald Trump as “garbage.”
Biden labeled the former president’s supporters during a virtual campaign event Tuesday in response to a joke stand-up comedian Tony Hinchcliffe told during Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden Sunday. Leonard cited Biden’s history of stuttering and claimed it was “very obvious” that Biden wasn’t stereotyping all of Trump’s supporters during an episode of “CNN NewsNight,” prompting Jennings to respond. (RELATED: ‘It’s Helpful If You’ll Answer The Question’: Harris Faulkner Chides Dem Guest For Spinning When Asked About Kamala Harris Comparing Trump To Hitler)
WATCH:
“Let me just accept the most charitable framing of this, which you just gave me,” Jennings responded. “Why is he sitting in front of a laptop at the exact same moment Kamala Harris is out on his backyard trying to give the closing argument to her campaign? What in the world is he doing?”
“I don’t accept your framing of it, personally, because I actually do believe he, Harris, the Democratic Party and most of their campaign do believe that half the country is garbage,” Jennings continued.
Biden’s comments came as Vice President Kamala Harris has escalated attacks on Trump in the closing weeks of the presidential campaign, devoting a major speech Tuesday to attacking the former president as a threat to democracy and portraying him as “unstable” days after she labeled the former president a “fascist” during an Oct. 23 town hall on CNN.
“Well, let me tell you something … I don’t know the Puerto Rican that I know — or a Puerto Rico, where I’m — in my home state of Delaware, they’re good, decent, honorable people,” Biden said. “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.”
CNN banned conservative commentator Ryan Girdusky after he jokingly referenced an Israeli operation that targeted the radical Islamic terrorist group Hezbollah after former MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan defended describing Trump supporters as Nazis during a fiery exchange.
“They’ve also said people who go to Trump rallies are Nazis and so it’s pretty apparent the disdain with which they hold half of the country in,” Jennings concluded.

The Daily Caller,"British Group With Ties To Harris, Democrats Aims To ‘Kill Musk’s Twitter,’ Documents Say","The United Kingdom’s Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) intends to “Kill Musk’s Twitter,” according to internal documents obtained by The DisInformation Chronicle and Matt Taibbi’s “Racket.”
Morgan McSweeney is a British political operative providing advice to Vice President Kamala Harris, according to the report. He was a former board member of the CCDH, according to InfluenceWatch. His LinkedIn page says he served as the organization’s company director until April 2020. McSweeney attended this year’s Democratic National Convention (DNC) to speak with members of Vice President Kamala Harris’ team, Politico reported.
The CCDH documents obtained by Chronicle reveal one of the group’s chief priorities was to “Kill Musk’s Twitter,” and the group also intended to meet with Democratic Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar’s team. “Kill Musk’s Twitter” is the first order of business in the CCDH’s monthly agenda plans which go back to January 2024, according to screenshots in the report.
Sen. Klobuchar’s office did not respond to the Chronicle’s request for comment.
Politico dubbed the UK’s left-wing Labour Party and the Democrats as “sister parties.” Recently, a Labour Party official announced on LinkedIn that about 100 current and former party staff would campaign on the ground for Harris, the Daily Caller News Foundation (DCNF) reported. The posts have since been deleted. (RELATED: State Department Worked With Fact-Checkers, Academics To Censor Conservative Media, Report Says)

The CCDH targets “disinformation” and is the means of communication for Labour’s think tank, Labour Together, according to the Chronicle. McSweeney was also previously director of Labour Together, according to his LinkedIn page.
Other objectives of the organization include “Trigger EU & UK regulatory action” and “Progress towards change in USA and support for STAR,” according to the documents.
STAR is a framework for policymakers to adopt for social media regulation, according to the CCDH’s site. STAR would create an “independent digital regulator” to enforce online safety mandates, documents from the organization read. The U.K. implemented the Online Safety Act, which faced criticism for potentially jeopardizing privacy, in 2023, WIRED reported.
The CCDH met with federal legislators while advocating for “change in USA” and pushing STAR, according to the Chronicle.

The Daily Caller,‘We Had A Bad Experience’: Chinese Officials Losing Sleep Over Thought Of Dealing With Second Trump Term,"Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials quietly believe that a second Donald Trump presidency would be more dangerous to them than a Kamala Harris administration, The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday.
The Biden-Harris administration’s relationship with Beijing has been marred with tensions in recent years over diplomatic, economic and national security disputes. But Chinese officials would seemingly still rather have Harris win in November over Trump because they worry that the former president will open up another trade war against China, officials told the WSJ. (RELATED: Biden Gets Ready To Exit Political Stage As Global Fires Rage — November’s Victor Will Have To Put Them Out)
“Chinese officials and scholars, in private conversations over many months, are largely exceptionally wary of a Trump victory,” Richard McGregor, China expert at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, told the WSJ.
Those worries are largely kept quiet. Publicly, Chinese officials maintain a stance of neutrality toward the U.S. elections. Chinese President Xi Jinping wrote in a letter last week that China had always handled relations with the U.S. with “mutual respect” and said that Beijing “is willing to work with the United States as partners and friends.”
“The presidential elections are the United States’ own affairs,” a spokesman from the Chinese Embassy in the U.S. told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “We hope that whoever gets elected will be committed to growing sound and stable China-U.S. ties.”
Beijing wants whoever the next president is to take a predictable stance toward relations and dial back the U.S.’ tough-on-China stance. Privately, officials felt that standard was better reflected in President Joe Biden over Trump and thought his reelection would be better for China, according to the WSJ.
After Biden dropped out of the race in July, Beijing felt the same about Harris, officials told the WSJ.
“Under Trump, we had a bad experience,” senior CCP diplomat Liu Jianchao bemoaned during a closed-door session with U.S. think tanks earlier in the year.
The concerns of a second Trump term among Chinese officials stem from fears he will launch a second trade war against China, as he did in his first term, according to the WSJ.
Trump issued a sweeping set of tariffs against China during his first term — adding a tax to imports coming in from the country — in a bid to encourage domestic U.S. investment and compel China to buy more American goods.
Xi and those and his orbit became exhausted in trying to maneuver the trade war and Trump’s demands, according to the WSJ. Trump has weighed the idea in his second term to issue a 60% tariff against incoming Chinese goods, which economists at UBS have predicted could mark a 2.5% blow to China’s GDP growth over a year-long period.
Trump has also recently weighed the idea of using the threat of tariffs to deter China from invading Taiwan, even musing that he would completely halt trade relations if the island is taken by force, which has been received extremely poorly in Beijing.
“I would say: If you go into Taiwan, I’m sorry to do this, I’m going to tax you”—meaning impose tariffs—“at 150% to 200%,” Trump told the WSJ in an interview on Thursday.
The Trump and Harris campaigns did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Daily Caller,"‘You’ll Bleep My F Words’: Gretchen Whitmer, Kamala Harris Go To A Bar For Post-Rally Beer","Vice President Kamala Harris and Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan went to a bar Saturday after a campaign event and appeared to begin talking about the presidential race when the pair realized press microphones could pick up their conversation.
Whitmer and Harris greeted locals at the bar before they sat to drink a beer and talk while patrons began watching and filming them on smartphones. The video, captured by C-SPAN, shows Whitmer offering to buy the vice president a beer, and Harris telling the bartender she’d have what Whitmer was having, after which the two began cackling. (RELATED: ‘The Dang Thing Would Explode’: Sen. John Kennedy Suggests Kamala Harris Could Break A Polygraph By Walking Near It)
WATCH:
“It’s an Oberon, and it’s made right here in Kalamazoo, which many are calling Kamala-zoo,” Whitmer told Harris. The governor then mentioned that Harris had a “great rally” that day, and “it feels better on the ground.”
At this point, Harris noticed that the reporters’ microphones could pick up on their conversation.
“Oh, we have microphones in here just listening to everything, I didn’t realize that,” Harris told Whitmer.
“You’ll bleep my F words, I hope,” Whitmer told the reporters.
“We just told all the family secrets. Shit,” Harris said.
Harris has backed away from left-wing positions on health care, gun control, illegal immigration, fracking, and environmental policy that she held during her campaign for the 2020 Democratic Party nomination for president primarily through statements by campaign aides to reporters, and struggled to answer when pressed on the changes during an Oct. 8 “60 Minutes” interview.
The vice president has also been vague on many policy details during her campaign. Her campaign posted an “issues” section on its website, but it appeared to be a cut-and-paste from the reelection site for President Joe Biden. (Watch The Daily Caller Documentary “Cleaning Up Kamala”)

The Daily Caller,Supreme Court Denies RFK Jr.’s Bid To Be Removed From Ballots In Two Key Swing States,"The U.S. Supreme Court rejected an emergency appeal Tuesday to remove Robert F. Kennedy Jr. from the presidential ballot in Michigan and Wisconsin.
The ruling keeps Kennedy on the ballot in the two critical swing states just days before Election Day, according to The Associated Press. Kennedy, who had originally been on the ballot due to his own presidential campaign, argued that being kept on the ballot in these states infringed upon his First Amendment rights.
However, officials from Michigan and Wisconsin countered that removing his name at this stage, with early voting already underway, would be logistically impossible and could disrupt the electoral process, the AP reported. The court issued no detailed explanation for its decision to deny Kennedy’s appeal, though Justice Neil Gorsuch dissented in the Michigan case.

In Michigan, Kennedy initially won an appeals court ruling but ultimately faced obstacles after state courts found he had missed the filing deadline to withdraw as the candidate for the Natural Law Party, which had advocated for his continued candidacy, AP stated. In Wisconsin, the courts determined that once a qualified candidate submits valid nomination papers, their name must remain unless they die before the election.
Kennedy has withdrawn from the ballot in other key battleground states, including Arizona, North Carolina and Nevada, and will not appear in other states like Florida, Ohio and Texas, CBS News reported. He missed qualification in New York and Georgia, with the Supreme Court denying his request to be reinstated in New York, and he chose not to appeal a Georgia court decision.
Kennedy, who ran as an independent, suspended his campaign in August and has now endorsed former President Donald Trump.

The Daily Caller,Kamala Harris Teases One Her First Executive Actions If She Makes It To White House,"Vice President Kamala Harris confirmed Friday her first potential executive order would be to eliminate college degree requirements for specific federal jobs if she is elected into office in November.
Harris has faced backlash since becoming her party’s presidential nominee for flip-flopping on a handful of left-wing policies she once campaigned on prior to 2020. However, during an event at an IBEW local union hall in Janesville, Wisconsin, Harris was explicitly clear on her intentions to eliminate “unnecessary degree requirements for federal jobs.”
“The press is always asking me, ‘What are you going to do on day one?’ One of the things I’m doing on day one — because I can do it by executive order — is I will eliminate unnecessary degree requirements for federal jobs,” Harris said. “And then I will challenge the private sector to do the same.”
Harris previously outlined a goal in September to reduce degree requirements for certain federal jobs to expand opportunities for individuals without a four-year degree, according to Reuters. Data from the U.S. Census Bureau, released in early 2023, indicates that over 62% of Americans aged 25 or older do not hold a bachelor’s degree, with three out of five of those without degrees comprising the voter base in 2020. (RELATED: Watch What Harris Says About Handling Internal Polls As Election Nears)
“And I will challenge the private sector to do the same,” Harris said at a Pennsylvania rally in mid-September.
The promise from the vice president comes after she previously told NBC News’ Yamiche Alcindor on Thursday that her first day priorities would revolve around her economic agenda, losing discussing how an “opportunity economy” will help Americans.
“Well, my first priority, which will be probably the package of bills, is about bringing down the cost of living,” Harris said. “So it’s about housing, it’s about child care, it’s about what we need to do to deal with grocery prices. So it’s not one, it’s a package that is with one singular purpose, bringing down the cost of living.”
While Harris has reportedly tried to distance herself from President Joe Biden, she continues to face challenges in explaining how her presidency would differ from his.
Voters consistently cite the economy, inflation, and immigration as top concerns in the election. Yet despite widespread disapproval of Biden’s performance, Harris recently told ABC’s “The View” that not “a thing” came to mind when asked what she would change from the past five years.

The Daily Caller,EXCLUSIVE: Matt Gaetz To Introduce Legislation That Would End Tax-Exempt Status For Non-Profits Abetting Border Crisis,"Republican Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz introduced legislation Tuesday that would end the tax-exempt status for non-profits abetting the U.S. border crisis.
The Daily Caller first obtained a copy of the bill, which is titled the “Helping Americans by Restricting Resources to Immigrant Services Act,” otherwise known as the HARRIS Act. The bill would specifically end the tax-exempt status of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), non- profits and other entities that could be aiding and abetting the border crisis by dedicating a “substantial” portion of their resources to goods and services for illegal immigrants.

The Daily Caller,Army Releases Heavily Redacted Report On Arlington Cemetery Altercation,"The Department of Defense (DOD) and Army released a report Friday disclosing the details of an altercation that occurred during former President Donald Trump’s August visit to Arlington National Cemetery.
Trump honored the 13 American service members killed during President Joe Biden’s August 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal on the three-year anniversary of the incident at a ceremony that later became controversial when reports surfaced that a physical altercation had occurred between a campaign official and an Arlington National Cemetery staffer over photo restrictions. The agency released the report in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request from American Oversight but details a multitude of exemptions to the request including laws protecting inter- and intra-agency communications and records pertaining to an ongoing investigation, leaving the report heavily redacted.
The report labeled the event a “simple assault” and said an action occurred with “both of [redacted] hands while attempting to move past” but that no medical attention was necessary following the incident. The documents contain a sworn affidavit taken at the time of the altercation but is entirely redacted, including the name of who gave the statement.
The individual involved chose not to press charges following the incident, the report says.
The incident occurred after a cemetery staff member attempted to enforce a rule prohibiting political activity and “was abruptly pushed aside” by a Trump campaign official, according to NPR.
“Participants in the August 26th ceremony and the subsequent Section 60 visit were made aware of federal laws, Army regulations and DoD policies, which clearly prohibit political activities on cemetery grounds,” the Army said in a statement after the incident, according to NPR. “An ANC employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside. Consistent with the decorum expected at ANC, this employee acted with professionalism and avoided further disruption. The incident was reported to the JBM-HH police department, but the employee subsequently decided not to press charges. Therefore, the Army considers this matter closed.”
Vice President Kamala Harris criticized Trump over the event, stating that the former president did not honor service members — a claim which several Gold Star families quickly rebuked by placing blame instead on Harris for her apparent lack of acknowledgment of the incident that killed the soldiers. The families requested Trump attend the event and take photos with them, Trump stated in a Truth Social post, and the families later confirmed to the Daily Caller.

The Daily Caller,Soros-Funded Group Backs Maricopa DA Candidate Who Helped Murder Accomplice Evade Child Sexual Abuse Charges,"The Democrat running for Maricopa County District Attorney previously defended a man indicted of sexually assaulting a mentally disabled child by suggesting that the 12-year-old girl made the story up for attention — and has managed to snag an endorsement from Soros-backed advocacy group.
In 2009, Tamika Wooten became Jacob Payne’s criminal defense attorney after he was accused of repeatedly sexually assaulting a child, court records show. Before Wooten represented him, Payne pled guilty to kidnapping in 2004 after he admitted to restraining a 19-year-old girl as an accomplice murdered her, receiving five years in prison for his crime. Wooten, while representing Payne in 2009, said that “children with learning disabilities fabricate stories to get attention” to discredit the young girl who accused the freshly-released convict of assaulting her.
Wooten, who is running a platform of putting fewer criminals in jail by prioritizing “alternatives to incarceration,” secured the endorsement of Our Vote Our Voice Arizona on Sept. 20. The Soros family’s Open Society Action Fund in 2023 gave just over $1 million to the group, a significant sum for an organization that has had an average annual revenue of roughly $2.5 million since 2020, according to tax documents. (Stream The Daily Caller’s Documentary ‘Lawless’ HERE)
The girl who accused Payne of sexual assault claimed that he had repeatedly groped her and forced her to engage in sex acts, according to court filings. Hospital staff found blood on her underwear after one such assault — she had not been menstruating at the time, per police testimony.
Three of the girl’s siblings told the officer who arrested Payne that they had witnessed their sister come out of the room Payne was in while buttoning up her pants, according to court filings. The girl’s older brother called their mother and told her that his sister had been molested. When confronted by the girl’s mother over the phone, Payne hung up and attempted to flee the apartment.
Wooten, who moved to stop prosecutors from referring to Payne as a “predator” or “pedophile,” argued that the girl’s family members may have “coached” her into accusing him of assault because of their “dislike” for the man, court documents show. Wooten also said that the young girl’s inability to remember specific details about the assaults was evidence of her fabricating the story.
The girl had previously made a false sexual assault claim against her father, which led her mother to initially dismiss her allegation against Payne. Her mother took her daughter seriously after her siblings corroborated her claims.
The jury ultimately found Payne not guilty.
Payne was indicted of sexually abusing a child again in 2013, this time being accused of molesting a six-year-old girl, according to court records. Prosecutors ultimately dropped the charges “in the interest of justice” but explicitly noted that their decision was not made because evidence was insufficient. He pled guilty to aggravated assault in 2020 and was then convicted of disseminating nude images he took of a woman without her consent in 2023.
The Soros family has made a broad effort to reform criminal justice in the United States away from incarceration and toward rehabilitation, spending tens of millions on criminal justice nonprofits and on electing left-wing prosecutors. Many large cities where the Soros network worked to install prosecutors aligned with their views saw considerable upticks in crime.
Many of the donors backing Vice President Kamala Harris also supported Soros’ efforts to elect liberal prosecutors.
Wooten, who has promised to fight mandatory sentencing laws, is running to unseat Republican Rachel Mitchell, who has focused on cracking down on organized crime and fentanyl, the Washington Examiner reported.

The Daily Caller,‘Greatest White Man That Ever Lived’: Charlamagne Claims ‘Trump Has Even Defied The Laws Of White Privilege’,"Radio host Charlamagne Tha God argued Friday that former President Donald Trump operates beyond what he called “the laws of white privilege.”
Vice President Kamala Harris said during a Thursday rally that Trump would seek revenge on his “enemies” if he wins a second term. Charlamagne, on “The Breakfast Club,” reacted to her remarks by agreeing, adding Trump would also likely focus on resolving his legal issues if reelected. (RELATED: Harris Campaign Backpedals From Economic Agenda For Black Men Days After Releasing It)
WATCH:
“I said that so long ago. Donald Trump will be in there looking for revenge. Not only that, he’s gon’ be in there, you know, pardonin’ his self, tryin’ to get out of all his legal trouble,” Charlamagne said before co-host Loren LoRosa cut him off to ask if Trump has the ability to pardon himself.
When radio host Hugh Hewitt asked Trump on Thursday whether he would pardon himself or fire special counsel Jack Smith upon beginning his potential second term in office, the former president asserted he would immediately fire Smith.
“I’m sure he can [pardon himself],” Charlamagne said. “There’s nothing that he can’t do.”
Smith is currently prosecuting Trump on four counts of allegedly conspiring to overturn the 2020 presidential election results on January 6, 2021.
“The law is some magical stuff when you ain’t black, ain’t it?” LoRosa asked.
“No. No. I’m telling you, Donald Trump different. Like, Donald Trump has even defied the laws of white privilege. I’ve never seen anything like it, ever,” Charlamagne answered. “Like, Donald Trump, he out white-mans the biggest white man. I’m not even joking; he’s the greatest white man that ever lived. He is the Frankenstein monster of white supremacy. I never seen anything like that.”
Judge Tanya Chutkan released redacted documents of Smith’s evidence against Trump on Oct. 18, consisting of four heavily redacted appendix documents totaling over 1,800 pages filed in the public docket. Trump objected to publishing the materials so close to the election, but the judge argued it would be “election interference” not to release them.
CNN senior legal analyst Elie Honig said on Oct. 18 that he couldn’t “think of any precedent where a court has released something … two weeks and change before our presidential election.”
Chutkan also published Smith’s lengthy motion on presidential immunity on Oct. 2, which described the evidence the special counsel plans to introduce at trial.

The Daily Caller,California Dems In Tight House Races Back Tough-On-Crime Ballot Measure That Newsom Opposes,"California Democrats in tight House races are backing a crime ballot measure despite Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom strongly opposing the initiative, according to the Los Angeles Times Thursday.
Although Newsom fiercely opposes Proposition 36, which increases penalties for retail and drug crimes, many Democrats in tight House races have thrown their support behind the measure, according to the L.A. Times. Proposition 36 is popular with the majority of Californians, with 73% of voters supporting the measure, according to a Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC) poll conducted Oct. 7 to Oct. 15.
Newsom said the measure would cause “mass incarceration” and that it was an “insult,” according to the San Francisco Chronicle. However, he also said that he does not have the “bandwidth” to actively campaign against the measure, according to the Sacramento Bee Sept. 20.
“I would think that a Republican opponent would love it if a Democratic candidate opposed Prop. 36 because it would make it very easy for them to paint them as soft on crime,” Jared Sichel, political strategist for Republican, conservative and independent candidates in Orange County told the Los Angeles Times. “If you are a Democrat that is opposed to Prop. 36, that will hurt you in November.” (RELATED: California Keeps Driving Up Gas Prices With ‘Layers And Layers’ Of Green Rules And Regs)
Democratic House candidates who support Proposition 36 include Adam Gray in the 13th Congressional district, Will Rollins in the 41st district, Derek Tran in the 46th district, Rudy Salas in the 22nd district and Joe Kerr in the 40th district, according to the L.A. Times. Most of the races take place in districts with a “healthy mix of Republicans and Democrats,” Sichel told the L.A. Times.
For example, the 13th district race between Gray and Republican Scott Baugh is within 3 points, according to a WPA Intelligence poll published Oct. 20. The race for the 22nd district between Salas and Republican incumbent David Valadao is currently tied, according to a September Emerson College poll.
Proposition 36 comes in the wake of discontent with the results of the 2014 Proposition 47, which downgraded the penalties for drug possession and theft under $950 from felonies to misdemeanors. The incarceration rate fell 8% the two years after Proposition 47 passed, according to a September PPIC study.
Crime has been a persistent issue in the state, with overall crime up 1.7% in 2023 and up 15.4% since 2019, according to the PPIC. Out of all property crimes reported in 2023, 63% were larceny theft, 15% were burglaries and 22% were auto thefts.
The homeless population in California grew from 118,552 in 2013 to 181,399 in 2023. The number of camps in San Francisco reached its highest point since 2020 of 523 sites recorded in September 2023.
Proposition 36 would largely roll back Proposition 47’s reforms, upgrading drug possession and theft under $950 to felonies. It would also increase jail time for repeat retail theft, and make the possession of fentanyl a felony.
“I fear I can’t do everything. I’ve got, trying to get Kamala Harris elected President of the United States, trying to get through these 900 bills,” Newsom said in a Sept. 19 press conference according to the Bee. “I just pray, I really do, that people take a good look at Proposition 36.”
Newsom’s office did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

The Daily Caller,"Kamala’s Last-Ditch Pitch To Black Men Is A Dream For Scammers, Fraudsters","Vice President Kamala Harris’s plan to offer $20,000 in forgivable loans to minority entrepreneurs is a golden opportunity for scammers and fraudsters, experts told the Daily Caller.
Harris announced the plan in early October as part of her “Opportunity Agenda for Black Men.” It promises to “ensure that Black men can build wealth and achieve economic success” by providing one million loans, fully forgivable and worth up to $20,000 each, to black entrepreneurs “and others who have historically faced barriers to starting a new business or growing an existing business.”
The loans would be in partnership with the Small Business Administration (SBA), which also oversaw the administration of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), a COVID-era program meant to give small businesses resources “to maintain their payroll, hire back employees who may have been laid off, and cover applicable overhead.”
That program, however, was the target of a sprawling fraud scheme which was “the single largest transfer of money to criminal groups in our history,” Haywood Talcove, the CEO of LexisNexis Risk Solutions Government, told the Daily Caller.
The rate of fraud under COVID-era payment plans like PPP was “conservatively 20 percent” and “probably closer to 35 percent,” Talcove told the Caller. Given the efforts of large transnational criminal organizations, Talcove said, it could be as high as 50 percent. If Harris’s plan saw similar rates of fraud, it would cost the taxpayer billions of dollars. (Stream ‘CLEANING UP KAMALA’ Now)
Of the potentially hundreds of billions of dollars Talcove estimates people stole through COVID programs, the government has only recovered $13 billion, he told the Caller.
In fact, PPP fraud, and exploitation of the similar COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL), has been so rampant that the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee (PRAC) extended the statute of limitation on the crime from five years to 10 in 2023.
In addition to the fraud perpetrated by transnational groups, who Talcove says come from countries like China, Russia, Nigeria and Romania, Americans appeared to exploit COVID relief extensively as well.
The government fully forgave PPP loans that went to alleged businesses such as “Free Money LLC,” an apparently New York-based company who had $15,000 in PPP loans forgiven in 2021, according to Pro Publica. (RELATED: Man Sentenced To 9 Years In Prison After Fraudulently Using $1.6 Million In PPP Loans On Cars, Rolex)
Other eyebrow-raising corporations to receive forgiveness included “Money Makes Money Inc.” and “Nig Corp.”

— Confirmed Miscer ⚔️🍁🔫 (@ManDaveJobGood) October 14, 2024
In 2023, the PRAC also found 69,323 potentially ineligible social security numbers who had received PPP loans, according to a report.
Harris’s new plan appears just as likely to fall victim to exploitation.
“Anytime you have a government-sponsored subsidy that is going to a massive amount of people, the probability for improper payments and fraud is 100 percent,” Talcove said.
“History has shown us that when big sums of money are quickly rolled out with inadequate oversight, we open the door to fraud and abuse,” Republican Texas Rep. Michael Cloud told the Daily Caller.
Criminals are already talking about how they’re going to exploit the program on platforms like Telegram, Talcove said.
Twitter users have also been quick to point out how easily they believe it will be to defraud the government.
“I think Kamala Harris just announced we can run the PPP loan scam again if she get in office,” one user wrote.

“$20,000 isn’t even enough money to launch a food truck, but it is just the right amount to buy a used car or nice vacation while being too small to justify any serious investigation into its misuse,” another said.

The federal government has taken almost no responsibility for the fraud.
Republican Kentucky Rep. James Comer and the House Oversight Committee, which Rep. Cloud is a member of, did probe COVID fraud and found close to $200 billion in stolen funds.
I will get the backs of America’s taxpayers.

— Rep. James Comer (@RepJamesComer) January 28, 2023
“The Biden-Harris Administration allowed fraud to run rampant in federal unemployment programs and is now moving fast to make the pandemic unemployment programs permanent,” Comer wrote in a report.
Despite the committee’s recommendations, which include prioritizing antiquated IT systems and verifying claimants’ proof of work, there is still a lack of federal accountability for the programs, Cloud told the Caller.
“A forgivable loan theoretically comes with conditions that must be met, such as job creation or measurable contributions to the economy, to be forgiven. In practice, though, many of these programs end up functioning like handouts because they lack the rigorous oversight needed to ensure real accountability,” Cloud said.
Talcove concurred. (RELATED: ‘Rigged’: Death Of The American Voter | WATCH NOW)
“When there’s an emergency, like there was with COVID, [the government says] we’ll go get the money later. We’ll stop the criminals later, right? But the fact of the matter is, pay and chase, it doesn’t work.”
“No one ever talks about the victim,” Talcove, who told the Caller his mother was a victim of stolen identity, said. “These are not victimless crimes. There’s somebody that needed the benefit, whose identity was purchased on the dark web for pennies that couldn’t get what they deserved.”
In addition to being vulnerable to fraud, Harris’ race-based plan is also “unconstitutional,” Rep. Cloud said.
“[It’s] a ridiculous thing to propose when our country is currently incredibly divided and all Americans are struggling to afford essentials under her administration,” he said.",2024-10-29
The Daily Caller,EXCLUSIVE: ‘A Planned Terror Attack’: House Republicans Target DHS For Accommodating Lebanese Nationals,"Republican Texas Rep. Brian Babin and a group of House Republicans sent a letter Tuesday to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), slamming them over a recent announcement that Lebanese nationals inside the U.S. will now be eligible for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and work authorization due to war in the Middle East.
The Daily Caller first obtained a copy of the letter, in which Babin and eleven other House Republicans condemn the Biden-Harris administration for their announcement of new actions to provide an immigration “reprieve” to Lebanese nationals and individuals having no nationality who last resided in Lebanon.
“While Israel is suffering weekly rocket bombardments from terrorists in Lebanon, the Biden-Harris administration has not only foolishly decided to hamstring our ability to deport Lebanese aliens, including those here illegally, but also offer them immigration benefits and work authorization. Just weeks ago, an ISIS terrorist – who this administration failed to properly vet and welcomed into our country with open arms – was caught planning an Election Day attack,” Babin told the Daily Caller.

The Daily Caller,"District Attorney Facing Recall Vote Backed Halting Death Penalty For Man Convicted Of Torturing, Killing Infant","A district attorney facing a recall vote in November backed removing a man from death row who was convicted of torturing and murdering an infant, according to the San Francisco Chronicle Thursday.
Alameda County District Attorney Pamela Price, who has received financial backing from left-wing billionaire George Soros, got Superior Court Judge Thomas Stevens on Oct. 14 to spare convict Michael Lopez’s life, giving him a lighter sentence, according to the Chronicle. His punishment was initially the death penalty for first-degree murder and torture after he was convicted in 2001, but it was reduced to 26 years to life for second-degree murder and lewd act on a child with a great bodily injury enhancement.
Deputy District Attorney Aimee Solway, who works in Price’s office, asked for the resentencing “in the interest of justice,” according to the Chronicle. Lopez, since he was arrested in 1999 and would have his current time in prison counted towards his sentence, may be eligible for parole if officials deem him worthy. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: House Oversight Republicans Demand Answers From FBI Over Revised Crime Stats)
Solway claimed in the most recent motion that prosecutors excluded jurors on the basis of race, that the case wasn’t consistent with past death penalty cases and that Lopez’s low IQ could’ve impacted his ability to care for the child, according to the Chronicle. He also cited Lopez’s clean disciplinary record in prison and the low likelihood that he would commit future crimes.
This is the fourth time Price asked Lopez to be resentenced, according to the Chronicle. Price promised when she was elected in 2022 to do away with the death penalty.
Price is currently facing a recall election as crime in the county continues to surge under her tenure, with violent incidents spiking in Oakland, the county’s largest city, by 21% during just the first ten months she was in office.
Current polling shows the recall effort remains close, with 41% supporting her and 37% supporting the recall, with a 4.9% margin of error, according to a July Binder research poll. Additionally, the recall campaign is outspending the anti-recall effort by over a three-to-one margin, according to KQED.
“In recommending this resentencing, the People in no way diminish the horror, pain and suffering which this child endured,” Solway said according to court documents obtained by the Chronicle.
Price’s office did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

The Daily Caller,"‘Don’t Have The Numbers’: Victor Davis Hanson Explains Why He Thinks Dems Are ‘Depressed,’ ‘Angry’ About Harris’ Polls","Hoover Institute Senior Fellow Victor Davis Hanson said Friday on his podcast that he believes Democrats are feeling more depressed and angry than usual because they fear they could be losing.
Polls between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have tightened with fewer than five days until Election Day. On “The Victor Davis Hanson Show,” the senior fellow called out a recent take from CNN’s senior reporter Harry Enten for claiming election polling could be underestimating Harris and noted that her campaign has shifted its resources from North Carolina to Virginia in search of a path to 270 electoral votes.
“My point is that I think that’s a standard response when they look at those internal polls. Now, why would I say that? They wouldn’t be shifting resources from North Carolina to Virginia,” Hanson said. “They’re ahead in Virginia, but if they were shifting resources from North Carolina to Virginia, then it would be because they’re behind in Virginia and they’re ahead, so far ahead in North Carolina, they don’t need it.”
“No, they’re shifting it because they’re behind in North Carolina, and their internal polls say they can’t win it. And I mean, internal polls that are specific, Latino groups, black groups, Asian women, men,” Hanson added. “They don’t have the numbers that they need to win that. So then they look at Virginia, and they have an alternate pathway to 270 and Virginia is absolutely central. While they’re still ahead, at the rate they’re losing in seven days, they will lose that state. So they’re putting resources in there.”
Hanson continued to state that while he believes Democrats like MSNBC hosts Mika Brzezinski, Joe Scarborough and Joy Reid are always angry, their anger has increased over the election despite Harris’ campaign message first centering on joy. (RELATED: ‘Whatever It Takes’: Political Strategist Says Dems Must Quit Coddling Biden Just To Make Him Feel ‘Included’)
WATCH:
“There wouldn’t be this sense of gaiety and happiness. I think it’s, I’m kind of worried about overconfidence in the Trump people and depression in the Harris [camp]. They didn’t, you know, even if you were out there and feel that the mail-in balloting, they master and they have machinations that will help them, they wouldn’t be just so depressed. They are depressed, they really are, and they’re angry,” Hanson said.
“You look at Brzezinski , you look at Joe Scarborough, her husband … then you look at Joy Reid, you look at Rachel Maddow and then you look at the [View] — they’re all angry. I mean, they’re angry people anyway, but they’re just really angry. They have these, they kind of remind me of the people, when they know they’re losing and they’re all in a room together and they’re just, they can’t face reality — fantasy,” Hanson said. I don’t know if they’re really losing, but I don’t think that they’re under-polled. I really don’t.”
While Trump had once been slightly leading across all seven key wing states in mid-October, Harris gained both Michigan and Wisconsin back over the last week, according to polling averages from RealClearPolitics. Data from the site currently shows the former president has a 0.3 point lead nationally, sitting with 48.4% and Harris behind at 48.1%.

The Daily Caller,EXCLUSIVE: Alyssa Farah Encouraged Cassidy Hutchinson To Leak To Reporters Amid Investigation,"Former Trump administration official Alyssa Farah Griffin suggested to star Jan. 6 investigation witness Cassidy Hutchinson that she leak to the media while the investigation was ongoing, texts obtained exclusively by the Daily Caller reveal.
Farah, a former Pentagon press secretary during the Trump administration, twice suggested to Hutchinson during active legal proceedings that she should give information to reporters. The pair also discussed ways to circumvent Hutchinson’s lawyer, Stefan Passantino, to communicate with former Republican Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney and the Jan. 6 committee, as first reported by Just The News.
“The alternative would be to just say fuck it and give it all to a reporter. Lol,” Farah texted Hutchinson after the latter asked if Cheney was still interested in working with her.
Shortly thereafter, in texts exclusively obtained by the Caller, Farah suggested that Hutchinson could coordinate with the committee to strategically leak some information to the press after testifying: “Btw, another idea.you could sit down and share it with the committee but then have the committee shares the big stuff you give them with press before your transcripts come out so it looks like it came from someone else.”
In later discussions, Hutchinson mentions that she is concerned with how to “reconfigure” her “reputation” within the media.
Passantino told the Caller he had no suspicions about such activity at the time and confirmed that he had never seen these specific messages between Hutchinson and Farah. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: House Republicans Call Out Cassidy Hutchinson’s J6 Testimony, Threaten Subpoena If She Does Not Produce Documents)
“This is the first I am seeing of some of these texts, but everything here is consistent with what I have been saying publicly and alleging in the various lawsuits I have filed over the past 18 months. I am surprised and pleased to see the facts coming to light,” Passantino told the Caller. (RELATED: iPhone Screenshot Undermines Cassidy Hutchison’s Claim That She Never Dated Matt Gaetz)
Hutchinson began the conversation by asking about a previous discussion the two apparently had, and if Farah had “touched base” with anyone about it.
“Hey! Yes. So I reached out to Liz. She agreed to keep our convo totally confidential. She said she admires you, and could tell that you wanted to the right thing from your testimony. Her one concern was so long ad you have counsel, she can’t really ethically talk to you without him. But what she suggests is a follow up with you, with your lawyer thats he and Dan George can lead. Probably can do without other members and Tim Does that help at all? I can tell she really wants to work with you and is just tryin to figure out the right way to do it,” Farah responded.
“I mean, do you think this is actually of interest to her at this point or is it moot Like have they moved beyond it,” Hutchinson replied.
“Oh it’s very much of interest. She basically just wants to structure it in a way you are comfortable and wants to make sure it’s clear, if you speak to them again, it’s them asking, not you, so you don’t get in trouble with trump world,” Farah said. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: House Republicans Demand Comms Between Cassidy Hutchinson, Fani Willis’ Office For J6 Investigation)
Hutchinson then described having trouble getting in touch with her attorney, before they discuss the prospect of leaking information to a reporter.
“My patience is razor thin,” Hutchinson said.
“Do you think your lawyer would drop you? I feel like you could represent yourself,” Farah asked.
“I never signed anything I asked several and he said it wasn’t necessary,that they had it taken care of So from a legal pov I’m not sure? But I’d assume??” Hutchinson responded.
“I just looked. I texted him Sunday morning to talk, he said he’d call that afternoon or Monday morning. That’s the last I heard from him despite following up every day since,” Hutchinson continued. “Am I overthinking this??”
“I’m sorry I’m not trying to be a nuisance,” she added.
Farah said she wanted Hutchinson to “be free” of the situation and proposed that she could potentially get immunity before sharing information with Cheney and the committee.
Hutchinson then asked if she may be asked to testify live.
“She was very clear they’d want to talk to you behind closed doors at least one more time before they’d put you up publicly,” Farah replied.
Hutchinson then asked if the committee would ask her to come back for more questioning, and claimed that Passantino would tell her to “go F myself” if she volunteered to do so.
“Ok that’s a good question. She was thinking she’d just ask you back for additional questions. But you probably don’t want them to go through Stefan? She is open to doing this anyway that’s like ethical/ legal,” Farah responded.
Farah went on to propose that her own lawyer may be willing to take on Hutchinson’s representation pro bono.
Days later, Hutchinson asked Farah to call her “asap” after she spoke to Passantino.
“dg called him Friday and asked about me coming in. Stephan gave me the weekend ‘to think on it’ He just said we will comply but he’s going to push back,” Hutchinson told Farah. “dg” seemingly refers to Dan George, a lawyer for the committee.
“Hmm ok. That was definitely at Liz’s direction. How do you feel about just doing it with Stefan but answering more questions? You can handle yourself and he’s just there as a figurehead,” Farah responded.
“And basically give ultimatum of a) we’ll come back but we need assurance she won’t be called in live (which I don’t think they’ll give) OR b) if you won’t give us an assurance, re-issue a subpoena,” Hutchinson said.
“He’s not against me complying. He’s actually sort of willing to do it be he thinks it builds my credibility as a witness. But he wants just enough from the committee to balance out the public backlash from the lawsuit and to frame me as super compliant/respectful of congressional subpoenas,” she continued.
“He’s going to call dan George this afternoon. Can you tip off Liz or Dan? And see their thoughts?,” Hutchinson asked Farah.
“I’m personally fine w just Liz and dan but I have a feeling he’ll want it structurally the same as my other Depos. But I haven’t gotten that far w him,” Hutchinson said.
“Does that make sense,” she asked.
“Yeah that all makes sense. I actually agree with Stefan’s approach and think it’s accomplished everyone’s goals. I am happy to tip liz off. And for what it’s worth I don’t think you are close to front in line to testify live But it might be worth asking for the commitment,” Farah responded.
“My guess is Stefan cares about protecting trump. You’re issues were more with meadows and folks around him. And you were simply being honest,” she added.
“Exactly. He doesn’t want me to stonewall the committee now, over this. I think he wants to balance the perception in Trump world if I just go back voluntarily vs. under subpoena,” Hutchinson said.
“But he’s probably going to be a bit less friendly to DG when he talks to him. He prob won’t outright tell him to re-subpoena me, so it may be helpful for DG to throw in (if they’d do that) ‘well if you don’t voluntarily come in, we’re likely reissue a subpoena’,” she added.
Hutchinson said their agreed-upon approach could help to “reconfigure” her “reputation” in the press. She then asked Farah to pass information to Cheney that her and her former lawyer do not plan to fight a subpoena, but that Passantino wants the committee to think they will.
“He talked to DG. Convo was consistent w/ what we discussed. SP told him we’ll need a subpoena to comply, but will ‘need to decide whether we’re going to fight it.’ (We’re def not going to fight it, but he wants the committee to think we will). Ir case you want to pass to LC or DG,” Hutchinson said.
Weeks later, Hutchinson texted Farah she felt like she could “drink myself into a coma.”
“Like I could drink myself into a coma,” Hutchinson responded. Farah said she thought the committee would make her testify live.
“Really?,” Hutchinson asked.
Hutchinson made headlines after testifying before the Jan. 6 committee. She claimed former President Donald Trump lunged for the steering wheel to reroute his car to the Capitol where protesters were gathering on Jan. 6. Sources close to the Secret Service have denied her claims. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Cassidy Hutchinson Begged Senior Trump Officials For ‘Financial Assistance’ After Being Subpoenaed By J6 Committee)
Hutchinson called the Jan. 6 committee “bs” in a text message obtained exclusively by the Caller and also begged former senior Trump officials for financial assistance and legal help in February 2022 after she was subpoenaed by the committee.

The Daily Caller,Kamala Harris Calls Trump ‘Fascist’ In CNN Town Hall,"Vice President Kamala Harris said Wednesday in a CNN town hall less than two weeks from the election that she thinks former President Donald Trump is a fascist.
CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked the vice president if she believed Trump was a fascist, pointing to Harris’ earlier remarks on several articles quoting former chief of staff John Kelly, who warned that the former president would rule as such in a second term. In her response, the vice president cited Kelly and former Trump officials’ comments who have previously warned about how Trump would act in a second term. (RELATED: Biden Campaigns On Trump Being A Threat To Democracy, But Voters May Not Be Buying It: POLL)
“You quoted General Milly calling Trump a fascist. You yourself have not used that word to describe him. Let me ask you tonight, do you think Donald Trump is a fascist?” Cooper asked.
“Yes I do,” Harris said without hesitation. “And I also believe that the people who know him best on this subject should be trusted.”

Both the New York Times and The Atlantic both published stories Tuesday, where Kelly claimed that the former president would rule like a fascist, said Hitler “did some good things” and wanted generals like the Nazi dictator. The Trump campaign denied the content of both stories.
More content of The Atlantic story has since been called into question. In addition to Kelly’s comments, the story also alleges that the former president disparaged a deceased veteran and her family. Both the Trump campaign, former officials to the president, the deceased veteran’s family and their lawyer have all gone on the record to deny the story.
“After having dealt with hundreds of reporters in my legal career, this is unfortunately the first time I have to go on record and call out Jeffrey Goldberg@the Atlantic: not only did he misrepresent our conversation but he outright LIED in HIS sensational story,” the family’s lawyer, Natalie Khawam, tweeted.

Harris gave an unexpected address from her residence Wednesday to address the stories about her opponent.
“All of this is further evidence for the American people of who Donald Trump really is,” Harris said. “This is a window into who Donald Trump really is, from the people who know him best. From the people who worked with him side by side, in the Oval Office and in the Situation Room.
“It is clear from John Kelly’s words that Donald Trump is someone who, I quote, ‘certainly falls into the general definition of fascist.’ Who vowed to be a dictator on day one and vowed to use the military as his personal militia to carry out his personal and political vendettas,” she continued.
Shortly after the vice president’s remarks, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that President Joe Biden also thought Trump was a fascist.
“You have heard from this president over and over again about the threats to democracy,” Jean-Pierre said. “And the president has spoken about that. You have heard from the former president himself, saying that he is going to be a dictator on day one. This is him, not us, this is him. And it’s not just us the White House saying this, you’ve heard it from officials, former officials who worked for the former president say this as well. So, you know, do we agree , I know that [Vice President Kamala Harris] just spoke about this, do we agree about that determination, yes, we do.”",2024-10-24
The Daily Caller,‘Difficult For Her To Win’: Mark Halperin Says ‘Data Everywhere’ Shows ‘Things Have Moved In Trump’s Direction’,"Journalist Mark Halperin said Friday that mounting “data” suggests former President Donald Trump is gaining momentum against Vice President Kamala Harris.
Harris currently trails Trump slightly in all seven top swing states, according to the RealClear Polling averages. Halperin, on his 2WAY platform, noted a lack of confidence among Democrats as Harris’ likelihood of defeating Trump in November appears unlikely. (RELATED: Biden Campaigns On Trump Being A Threat To Democracy, But Voters May Not Be Buying It: POLL)
WATCH:
“Unfortunately for blue America, there’s an asymmetry in what’s going on now. We could spend all day, the three of us, trying to get a Democrat on the phone who was super confident, like, ‘We’re going to win.’ We wouldn’t succeed in terms of political professionals, members of Congress, strategists,” Halperin said.” It would take us one call, random dial any Republican in our rolodex, to find someone who said, ‘Yeah, I’m pretty confident we’re going to win.’ Or more.”
“Okay, that’s an asymmetry. It’s just a reality. Some attribute it to cultural differences between the party and there’s something to that,” he continued. “There’s qualitative and quantitative data everywhere you look that things have moved in Trump’s direction and that it will be difficult for her to win, but not impossible. And that is causing a lot of tension in blue America.”
Halperin then pointed to The New York Times/Siena College’s last national poll of the 2024 election cycle, which the outlet published on Friday and found Trump and Harris tied at 48%. The previous NYT/Siena poll published on Oct. 8 found Harris leading Trump 49% to 46% nationally.
“The conventional wisdom has been, even though it may be false, that if Donald Trump is tied or within a couple points in the national poll, he’s going to win. Now The New York Times says it’s possible that Kamala Harris could win the electoral college and lose the popular vote,” Halperin said. “And we’ve talked about Trump over-performing from last time in the big blue states that could make him a bigger popular vote winner, but still lose the electoral college. Possible.”
The poll also found Trump drawing 42% of Hispanic voters and 11% of black voters. Halperin read from an X post from CNN senior political analyst Ron Brownstein reacting to the poll, which states it “shows Harris basically matching [President Joe] Biden winning 2020” percentages among whites, but “slipping” among minorities, particularly Latinos.
The analyst asserted this data “explains why less diverse Rustbelt states remain the most plausible path for her, as they were for Biden.”
The journalist also read from an X post from pollster and former Bill Clinton adviser Mark Penn, which states, “[The Wall Street Journal] and Forbes polls all show 3 to 4 point movements in the direction of Trump in the last few weeks. This is real movement and momentum going into the close. It is still close but this is a substantial move.”
Halperin also asserted Tuesday that Trump will be elected president on Nov. 5 if the current early voting trajectory “continues.”

The Daily Caller,CNN’s Harry Enten Dumps Cold Water On Theory Trump Will ‘Outperform His Polls’ For Third Time,"CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten on Tuesday suggested that former President Donald Trump is unlikely to “outperform his polls” for a third consecutive presidential election.
Prominent Trump critics, such as James Carville and Donny Deutsch have voiced concerns that Trump could exceed his projected poll numbers again, as he did in 2016 and 2020, which would increase his chances of defeating Vice President Kamala Harris in their tight race. However, Enten argued on “CNN News Central” that it “would be historically unprecedented” for polling to “underestimate” Trump for a third time. (RELATED: Prominent Election Expert Suggests Pollsters ‘Have No Idea’ If They’re Accurately Measuring Trump Support)
WATCH:
“Is there any precedent that the polls will underestimate Donald Trump once again? Because that’s all we hear about, ‘Oh, Donald Trump’s going to outperform his polls.’ So I went back and checked out whether or not a party outran the polls three presidential election cycles in a row in the key battleground states,” Enten told host John Berman. “It’s never happened. It’s never happened. Zero times, zero times since 1972. So if the polls are going to underestimate Donald Trump once again, that would be historically unprecedented.”
“Now maybe you want to make the argument that Donald Trump himself is historically unprecedented. But what normally happens is the pollsters catch on. ‘Hey, we‘re underestimating, we’re not taking into account some part of the electorate,'” he added. “They make adjustments and I think that helps to explain why we have never seen that the same party has been underestimated three times in a row in presidential elections at least over the last 52 years.”
Several pollsters recently told the Daily Caller News Foundation that they are unconvinced that 2024’s surveys will end up accurate. They said that although pollsters are working to avoid under-counting hard-to-reach Trump supporters, forecasting the breakdown of the electorate remains difficult due to the limitations of polling techniques in reaching groups like young men and non-college educated Americans.
“Donald Trump’s best polls in 2020 were eight points better than the poll averages in those states. So there was this idea, this universe, ‘Hey, maybe the averages are really underestimating Donald Trump,” Enten said. “This time around the question that I had was, are there still these polls that may indicate that the averages are really underestimating Donald Trump? This time around there’s really not the evidence for it.”
“The best polls for Trump actually only have him running about three points ahead of the polling average in the key Great Lake battleground states versus the eight last time around,” he added. “So last time around there was this group of pollsters that said, ‘Hey, wait a minute, the polling average may be underestimating Donald Trump.’ This time around, John, they simply put, do not exist.”
The data reporter also noted that the average 2022 midterm election poll in the Great Lake battleground states “underestimated Democrats by four points,” which could indicate pollsters have “been making adjustments” since 2020.
“The bottom line is this, dear audience and Mr. Berman: I think a lot of folks are sort of counting in that Donald Trump will in fact be underestimated by the polls. But when I’m looking at the evidence, I think you got to hold on a second,” Enten said. “Maybe that’ll happen. Maybe it’ll happen. But I think that there are folks who are underestimating the idea that maybe Kamala Harris will be underestimated by the polls at least a week out.”
Trump currently holds small leads over Harris in all of the top seven swing states, according to the RealClearPolling average.

The Daily Caller,Judge Declines To Recuse From Trump Assassination Attempt Case,"Judge Aileen Cannon declined Tuesday to recuse herself from overseeing the case against the man indicted in former President Donald Trump’s second assassination attempt.
Ryan Routh, who was indicted in September for attempting to assassinate Trump at his Florida golf course, moved to toss Cannon from the case because she was appointed by Trump, handled his classified documents case and has been spoken of favorably by him.
Cannon noted Tuesday she has “no control over what private citizens, members of the media, or public officials or candidates elect to say about me or my judicial rulings.”
“I have never spoken to or met former President Trump except in connection with his required presence at an official judicial proceeding, through counsel,” she wrote in the seven-page order. “I have no ‘relationship to the alleged victim’ in any reasonable sense of the phrase.”
Cannon faced calls for recusal from members of the media while handling the classified documents case, though a motion was never filed. She dismissed the case over special counsel Jack Smith’s unlawful appointment in July. (RELATED: Dems’ Attacks On Judge Overseeing Trump Classified Docs Case Don’t Add Up, Legal Experts Say)
“This case, like the prior cited cases involving former President Trump, were randomly assigned to me through the Clerk’s random case assignment system,” Cannon wrote in her order. “Period. I will not be guided by highly inaccurate, uninformed, or speculative opinions to the contrary.”
Cannon also wrote that going to high school with one of the prosecutors and attending his wedding nine years ago is not disqualifying.
“This factor does not supply a basis from which a reasonable observer — equipped with all of the facts and circumstances — would question my impartiality,” she wrote.
The government previously opposed Routh’s motion.
“Routh’s motion does not cite any authority mandating recusal in these circumstances, and does not present either facts or case law requiring recusal on this record in light of the controlling standard,” prosecutors wrote in an Oct. 21 court filing. “Judges are obligated to recuse only when there are proper grounds to do so.”

The Daily Caller,‘She’s Not Ahead’: Mark Halperin Says Dems ‘Scratching Their Heads’ Over Harris ‘Spending The Day In Washington’,"Newsmax political analyst Mark Halperin said Tuesday that Democrats are questioning Vice President Kamala Harris’ decision to stay in Washington, D.C., instead of campaigning in swing states.
Harris will be in Washington, D.C., to conduct interviews with Telemundo and NBC News, which are scheduled to air Tuesday evening, according to Reuters. Halperin, on “Wake Up America,” argued that with Harris trailing former President Donald Trump, the move raises concerns about her campaign strategy. (RELATED: Kamala Harris Used To Think Border Wall Was ‘Un-American.’ Now She Supports It.)
WATCH:
“Look, if she loses, there’ll be a lot of second-guessing of all sorts of decisions they made. And one of them will be what has been a light schedule. If she thinks she’s ahead — her campaign doesn’t think she’s ahead — but if they thought she was ahead, you could say she’s running out the clock, but she’s not ahead,” Halperin said. “And so it’s a choice they’re making. I think a lot of it has to do with the amount of preparation time she wants and requires for the interview she’s doing today, for the town hall she has coming up, but there is head-scratching amongst Democrats, two weeks to go, someone who’s fighting for the presidency, and she’s spending the day in Washington.”
“Again, a lot of Democrats also scratching their heads. You’d think it just, you know, jump on the Amtrak and go up to Philadelphia and do something. But the reality is, as Donald Trump proves when he does, you know, national events outside of the battleground states, that NBC News interview will get coverage everywhere,” he added. “And maybe she feels like that’s going to fill in the news cycle. But, like I said, if she loses, people are going to go over her schedule and wonder why she took so many days in Washington.”
Democrats, including some of Harris’ own staffers, recently raised concerns to Politico that the vice president’s light campaign schedule could damage the campaign in its final stretch. Trump is currently leading Harris in all of the top seven swing states, according to RealClearPolling averages.
Harris told “The View” on Oct. 8 that nothing “comes to mind” when asked how she would govern differently from President Biden, an answer Halperin said damaged her campaign.
“That one answer, I think probably, on balance, net did more harm for her than any good that’s come out of these interviews,” he asserted.

The Daily Caller,Liberal NGO Prepares ‘Quick Reaction Forces’ To Respond To Unrest At Election Facilities,"Common Defense, a left-leaning non-governmental organization, is preparing a coalition of “Quick Reaction Forces” in order to respond to potential escalation at polling locations, according to NPR.
Ahead of the election, Common Defense, which is made up of 40,000 veterans, is mobilizing its network to help “monitor extremist activity in swing states around the election,” according to NPR. After instructing members in “open source intelligence” to help predict unrest around polling locations, individuals are instructed by the organization to respond to escalation by filming video in an attempt to produce “accountability,” the outlet reported. (Stream Daily Caller’s latest documentary ‘Rigged’ HERE)
“We’re training a lot of folks in de-escalation,” Perry O’Brien, co-founder of Common Defense, told NPR. “We’re training folks in monitoring and capturing video for accountability.”
When a “crisis” unfolds, the “Quick Reaction Forces” will show up to polling locations “unarmed and in plainclothes,” the outlet reported.
Common Defense has been teaching members to review publicly accessible information — frequently found on social media — in a search for potential threats in swing states, O’Brien told NPR.
“That’s obviously the area that we’re anticipating a lot of these threats are going to come from,” he added.
A majority of registered voters, 76%, are concerned about “violence aimed at overturning the election results,” according to an AP-NORC poll published Monday. Eighty-two percent are worried about “violence targeting political figures or election officials,” the poll shows. (RELATED: Democrats Fight To Make Elections Less Trustworthy)
The Daily Caller spoke to various experts across the political field about what to expect in the event of a Trump victory. From protests, to lawfare, to Secret Service protection, they predicted a more extreme and dangerous response from Democrats in 2024 compared to 2016.

“In 2016, I just don’t think that the population was prepared for it, and that’s why we didn’t see wider-spread unrest, because nobody expected it to happen,” Richie McGinniss, a longtime video journalist who has covered social unrest for years, told the Caller. McGinnis was previously the video director for the Daily Caller.
“I hate to say it, but it’s going to be a lot worse [in 2024] than it was in 2016 if Trump wins,” he added, citing the past several years of “anti-Trumpism” that the nation has been steeped in.

The Daily Caller,"‘Untold Misery’: Trump Brings Out Gold Star Mother-In-Law, Angel Mom Ahead Of Harris Campaign’s Last Big Event","Republican nominee Donald Trump invited the family members of victims impacted by the policies of the Biden-Harris administration to his press conference Tuesday ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris’ major campaign speech in Washington, D.C.
The former president held a press conference at Mar-a-Lago where he invited angel mom Tammy Nobles, who lost her daughter to the brutality of an MS-13 member, and gold star mother-in-law Christy Shamblin who lost her daughter-in-law, Marine Sgt. Nicole Gee, during the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021. The victims came forward to link the tragedies to Harris’ policies before she gave a major speech at the National Mall Tuesday.
Nobles’ daughter, Kayla Hamilton, died on July 27, 2022, after 17-year-old MS-13 gang member Walter Martinez allegedly raped and strangled her to death with a telephone cord in Aberdeen, Maryland.
“I just wanted to say that [the Department of] Homeland Security did not do their job, Health and Human Services did not do their job, the Biden-Harris administration did not do their job,” Nobles said. “If they would have done their job, maybe that one phone call to El Salvador, maybe my daughter would still be alive today. Kayla was a very beautiful, young lady inside and out. She was independent, learning to become independent, she had two jobs, she overcame obstacles dealing with autism and was able to find the job that she loved. She loved animals, especially her cat Oreo and she cared about the homeless. She loved God, and she loved going to church and her life was just ripped from her 3 days after she celebrated her 20th birthday.”
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) confirmed that Martinez was involved with a violent MS-13 gang and resided in the U.S. illegally, according to WMAR 2 News. He reportedly entered the U.S. through Texas illegally in March 2022 before Border Patrol released him into Maryland to live with a sponsor.
Trump said Harris’ border and economic policies, along with her actions toward the Afghanistan withdrawal, are “disqualifying” for her to serve as commander-in-chief.
“Kamala’s cruel and immoral actions on our border are actually disqualifying in my opinion. She’s unfit, she’s an unfit person and she knows this is going on,” Trump said. “She didn’t call anybody, including the 13 soldiers that were so needlessly killed in Afghanistan with that horrible moment in time when our country just lost all respect from the whole world when that happened … Kamala has also caused untold misery through her destruction of our economy.”
Shamblin’s daughter-in-law, Marine Sergeant Gee, was one of the thirteen service members who died during the botched withdrawal of Afghanistan on Aug. 26, 2021, in which Harris had bragged about being the last person in the room during the administration’s decision to withdraw.
“[Gee] was the cornerstone of a very large family,” Shamblin emotionally said. “And instead of planning family gatherings, and holiday meals, and Christmases and baby showers, our family and thousands of other families plan outings at funeral gravesites and that’s where we as a family celebrate my daughter-in-law at Arlington National Cemetery because she is in the ground. Her story isn’t unique to our family, she’s just ours. There are thousands and thousands and thousands of wounded veterans who came home from that war who need our help and who are ignored by our current administration.”
The former president attended a ceremony honoring the 13 service members on the third anniversary of the withdrawal, while President Joe Biden and Harris were not in attendance.
Federal immigration law under the Biden-Harris administration allows the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to “parole” migrants instead of detaining them for “humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit,” which has been challenged by many Republican-led states.
Illegal encounters exceeded 2 million in the 2022, 2023 and 2024 fiscal years, largely surpassing encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border during the Trump administration, according to Customs and Border Protection (CBP).

The Daily Caller,Persistent Polling Issues Could Vindicate Republican ‘Bloodbath’ Election Prediction,"Some Republicans assume former President Donald Trump’s historic polling underperformance spells a bloodbath for Democrats in November. But the assumption’s accuracy, according to four center-right analysts, is muddled by new changes in methodology.
These analysts offered some insight into how the numbers might unfold, but conceded there’ll be no certainty until after Election Day. For them, 2024’s polling accuracy boils down to three main factors: demographic overcorrection, response bias and something called “recalled vote weighting.”
Current battleground aggregates place the former president even or ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris, bolstering Republicans who argue Trump will once again triumph due to polling error. Furthermore, some have taken to comparing recent polling to numbers from the same time during the 2020 and 2016 cycles, which shows Trump polling significantly ahead of his previous runs for president.
It’s not really that close Nate. https://t.co/oBZxpiWvfR
— Chuck Armstrong (@ChuckArmstron11) October 29, 2024
Polling averages placed President Joe Biden, for example, ahead of Trump by 8% in Michigan on Oct. 25, 2020, according to FiveThirtyEight — and Biden only won the state by 2.8%.
Harris led Michigan by 0.7% on the same day in 2024. With the same level of polling error, Trump would win the state by 5.1%.
But is it reasonable to expect the same level of polling error in 2024 — and Trump to sweep battlegrounds by five points or more?
Trafalgar Group founder Robert Cahaly doubts such dramatic margins, but said he still expects Trump to outperform October polling in an interview with the Caller.
“Is that possible?” he said. “Yes, but I think the likelihood is that he’s just going to overperform by about two or three points… It’s different in 2024, but we see a significant hidden [Trump] vote. We think that the places Trump is most likely to significantly overperform a poll are probably going to be Arizona and Michigan and Georgia.”
Trump is slated to outperform polls in these states, Cahaly argues, because his firm has found that undecided voters are breaking for the former president there. He added that pollsters struggle to capture Trump voters because they need to be “cajoled” into answering polls and assured of their anonymity, fearing social backlash.
There is some reason to doubt the notion that Trump’s true standing is so much higher than current numbers suggest; pollsters have identified and rectified many of the sources of their past error, with FiveThirtyEight even touting the 2022 midterm as the most accurately predicted cycle since “at least 1998, with almost no bias toward either party.”

“The reason they were really off, in my judgment, in 2016 is that they undercounted non-college-educated whites,” author and political consultant Ryan Girdusky told the Caller. “They had an over-response bias of college-educated white liberals.”
Pollsters generally didn’t account for voters’ education levels in 2016, a data point which hadn’t previously cleaved so sharply along partisan lines, according to a report from the American Association for Public Opinion Research. (RELATED: Trump Leading Harris In Key Swing State Two Weeks Before Election Day, Poll Finds)
Though firms had corrected the education oversight by 2020, polls still significantly underestimated Trump’s support in that cycle. Girdusky blames this on “partisan response bias,” the tendency of certain demographics to answer polls at a higher rate, and said that it could distort predictions for 2024.
“In July, when everybody on the planet was calling on Joe Biden to quit the race because he was going to lose, polls still showed him winning seniors, but he didn’t win them [in 2020],” he said. “That’s how overly large the response bias is among liberal seniors — the people who live to watch Rachel Maddow over and over.”
Some analysts doubt that the accuracy of 2022 polling necessarily guarantees similarly reliable predictions for 2024.
“It’s about the expanse of the electorate,” Mark Harris, the co-founder of ColdSpark, a political consulting firm, told the Caller. “The electorate gets much larger in a presidential election year, and the people who come into it are harder to get on the phone.”
He echoed concerns about response bias, noting that non-college-educated whites, who he said comprise about half of Pennsylvania’s electorate, are “just a lot harder” to poll.
But adjusting methodology for greater accuracy isn’t an insurmountable challenge. Private and internal polling, Harris argues, are usually pretty reliable — it’s the public pollsters who bear the lion’s share of the blame for past inaccuracies.
Universities and other public pollsters often can’t afford to conduct statewide surveys with large sample sizes, he explained, which forces them to artificially adjust, or “weight,” responses from under or overrepresented demographics — leading to less accurate predictions. Public pollsters also use online surveys, which is less “rigorous” than tactics employed by private firms, he argues.
“You could easily have [in a public poll], ‘Oh, we did 20 interviews with Republican women, and Trump’s only getting 60% of them…’ Well, if you extrapolate them up to be 40% of the sample, some weird, weird stuff is going to happen,” Harris said. “Anyone who does a lot of weighting is really gambling.”
“It’s just money,” he continued. “I have nothing against them. I get why they [weight their polls] — it’s still corners being cut.”

Though ongoing issues with response bias and overzealous demographic weighting suggest pollsters are still undercounting Trump’s performance, Republicans should temper their expectations. Harris emphasized that response bias diminishes in the weeks leading up to Election Day. He also cautioned against “recall ballot weighting,” where pollsters ask voters about their past votes and adjust their sample based on that information. This approach, he argues, overlooks the fact that “no two electorates are ever the same.”
Pollsters have increasingly employed this technique to ensure Trump supporters are adequately represented in their samples, aiming to correct their previous difficulty in fully capturing the former president’s support, according to The New York Times. Some critics say it could lead to an overrepresentation of Republicans in current polling.
Mark Mitchell, the head pollster of Rasmussen Reports, defended the practice in an interview with the Caller.
“There’s a ton of reasons in my state polling why Trump is going to outperform,” he said. “I’m leaning heavily to the recalled vote. That is going to make my numbers less sensitive to low-propensity and first-time voters. And everything we’ve seen tells us that those people are showing up and are raking right.”
Recall weighting, Mitchell explained, was actually diminishing what he believes to be the full breadth of Trump’s support in Rasmussen’s polling, adding that the former president would be “up four or five points in the national popular vote” without recall weighting.
“I’ve been showing Trump [ahead by] 2% in the national popular vote for months now,” Mitchell said. “That means he’ll probably sweep all of the battlegrounds, and nobody’s talking about that.”
Despite some advances in polling methodology, there remain several indicators that pollsters will again underestimate Trump’s support, though it seems unlikely that November will vindicate the same level of polling error the “bloodbath” narrative suggests — the unique dynamics of each election cycle continue to make precise predictions elusive.",2024-10-30
The Daily Caller,From #MeToo To #NotYou: Where Are All The Feminist Celebrities On Emhoff?,"None of the female celebrities who have endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris have voiced concerns about her husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, who allegedly has a history of misconduct against women.
Emhoff admitted in August to cheating on his first wife in 2009 with his daughter’s nanny, whom he allegedly impregnated, according to the Daily Mail. Once back on the dating scene, Emhoff, the “Dad-in-Chief,” allegedly slapped his then-girlfriend in a booze-fueled fit of jealous rage in 2012, three friends familiar with the alleged situation told the outlet.
Celebrities like Ariana Grande, Julia Roberts and Billie Eilish have made no mention of the allegations, yet have expressed their support of Harris. Oprah Winfrey also ignored the alleged situation, but has hosted a pro-Harris town hall alongside Jennifer Lopez and Meryl Streep.
Psaki Says Emhoff Reshaping Perception Of Masculinity
NEW: Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff accused of physically assaulting his ex-girlfriend, days after MSNBC host Jen Psaki said Emhoff was “reshaping masculinity.”
According to the Daily Mail, Emhoff hit a woman so hard that she physically spun around.

Megastar Taylor Swift also endorsed the vice president via Instagram in September, citing abortion rights as one of her top issues. Swift has not used the platform to promote Harris since her original endorsement, nor has she ever acknowledged Emhoff’s alleged behavior.
Other female celebrities, such as Olivia Rodrigo and Jennifer Lawrence, have also pledged their support for Harris, whom they hope will “restore reproductive rights.” They too have been silent in the wake of the allegations surfacing.
Some female celebrities, including “The Office” star Mindy Kaling and Grammy-winning singer Pink, appeared at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) to promote the vice president’s campaign in August. Neither of the celebrities have mentioned the allegations against the Second Gentleman. (RELATED: Harris Campaign Holds Rally In Swing State, Invites Pop Star With Ties To Diddy)
Emhoff, who several left-leaning media outlets characterized as a paragon of a new masculinity, was accused of “asshole behavior” and being “very flirty” at Venable LLP, a law firm he previously managed. Former colleagues of Emhoff who worked there alleged he was also routinely “inappropriate” and “misogynistic” during his tenure, the Daily Mail separately reported.
Many of these celebrities offered their labor or intellectual property in service of the Harris campaign — Beyoncé granted Harris the rights to her song, “Freedom,” for campaign advertisements; Anne Hathaway sang at a campaign fundraiser on Broadway; “Seinfeld” star Julia Louis Dreyfus promised to be “extra involved” in the Harris campaign — but none of them have made any mention of Emhoff’s alleged misdeeds.
Rapper Cardi B, an outspoken critic of President Joe Biden, said Harris should have been the nominee all along. Larger-than-life performer Lizzo joined Harris for a campaign event in Detroit. However, neither of the female musicians appear to have publicly voiced any concerns about the allegations against the Second Gentleman.
Among Harris’s high-profile supporters are former First Lady Michelle Obama, Jessica Alba, “Friends” star Jennifer Aniston, Jennifer Garner, Glenn Close, “Scandal” star Kerry Washington, Megan Thee Stallion, pop icon Cher and Barbra Streisand, none of whom have come out against Emhoff.",2024-10-23
The Daily Caller,"With McConnell MIA, His Potential Replacements Step In To Bolster Battleground Republicans","Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is catching heat on his way out of power for not sufficiently backing battleground-state Republicans with his financial war chest.
The Republican senators vying to replace him are battling to fill the vacuum, dumping big sums of money into key Senate races the GOP will need to win back the majority next week.
Texas Sen. John Cornyn, South Dakota Sen. John Thune and Florida Sen. Rick Scott have all announced they’re in the race to replace McConnell. Montana Sen. Steve Daines, Chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, was also floated as a possible candidate until he removed his name from the hat Wednesday.
“I’m appreciative of everybody who’s asked me to consider it, but I’m not going to run,” Daines said in an interview. “I’ve told others I’m not running for majority leader, and so it’s firm.”
McConnell has faced particular criticism for giving a financial cold shoulder to Scott and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who are both facing well-funded Democratic challengers in red states.
In Q3, Cruz’s opponent, Rep. Collin Allred, raised $30.3 million and Cruz raised $21 million. On top of that, last week, a Schumer-backed Democrat PAC made a $5 million ad buy for Allred. Despite this, Cruz remains slightly up in the polls. (RELATED: ‘Weaponized His Leadership’: Insurgent Senate GOP Forms Post-McConnell Plan)
As for Scott, in Q3 he raised $4.9 million. His opponent Debbie Mucarsel-Powell raised $15.1 million.
In those two tight and important races, Cornyn and Thune have used their campaign funds to help out Cruz and Scott.
According to a source familiar with Cornyn’s political operation, he has raised nearly $850,000 for Scott and more than $715,000 for Cruz’s races cumulatively. Cornyn announced last month that he has raised more than $400M for his colleagues, candidates, the NRSC, and his reelection efforts since 2002.
The source also noted that Cornyn was a special guest on a zoom for Cruz’s super PAC last week.
A source familiar with Thune’s campaign said Thune has raised six figures for Cruz and Scott through his Joint Fundraising Committees, directly from donors to their campaigns, to the NRSC for both candidates, and at events in D.C. and around the country.
“Outside entities affiliated with Thune have transferred $1.75 million to Cruz-affiliated entities and $500K to Scott-affiliated entities,” the source familiar told the Caller.
As of September, Thune had raised more than $28 million for Senate candidates and the NRSC and earlier that month Thune told his fellow GOP Senators that he will transfer $4 million from his campaign account to the NRSC. Thune also raised over $1.75 million for the Trump campaign and Republican candidates across the U.S. ahead of two September fundraisers.
Fundraising ability and political prowess come election time are viewed as key skills for the next Senate leader to have, adding extra emphasis to the efforts of Thune, Cornyn and Scott to help the party retake the majority. Scott previously served as Chair of the NRSC himself, a key fundraising position.
Another key factor in the race will be the highly-coveted endorsement of former President Donald Trump, who has yet to weigh in. Tension between Trump and McConnell has been a wedge in the Senate GOP, but the three current contenders to be the next leader have publicly backed Trump against Kamala Harris.
McConnell is the longest-serving party leader of all time in the Senate, and has been serving in the Senate since 1984. According to RealClearPolitics, McConnell is rated as Americans’ most disliked political leader, with favorability ratings lower than President Joe Biden’s. However, his grip on power within the GOP has remained ironclad for years.
Senate Republicans tell the Caller that whoever becomes the next leader must have a good relationship with Trump, unlike McConnell, in order for them to succeed. (RELATED: Senate Republicans Back Big Change To Prevent Repeat Of McConnell Era)
“If President Trump wins re-election, it will be crucial for him to have a good working relationship with members of Congress — especially leadership. It is absurd to argue that his opinion of who those leaders should be is irrelevant. That argument can only be made by people who fear the type of change agent Trump might endorse,” Republican Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson told the Daily Caller.
Another U.S. Senator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told the Caller that Senate Republicans’ main worry should be having someone like McConnell take his place. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: ‘This Is Our Opportunity’ — Top GOP Senators Game McConnell’s Ouster After Botched Border Deal)
“Mitch walks out while refusing to help Ted Cruz and Rick Scott in tight races that could determine who gets a Senate majority. He badmouths and undermines Trump right before the election. If either of the Johns want the top job, my concern is who will be a team player, and who will be McConnell part 2 and continue to sabotage the party,” the Republican senator said.
Despite saying they back Trump, both Thune and Cornyn have voting records that resemble McConnell’s. They have voted for most continuing resolutions and omnibus bills with McConnell, but against the Inflation Reduction Act and the Small Business COVID relief act of 2022 during the last Congress.
The pair also voted for the supplemental legislation that contained Ukraine funding during this Congress, and haven’t been shy about voting for massive appropriations bills. A majority of the bills they voted against were almost completely along party lines. The three also voted in favor of the 2024 NDAA, which extended FISA powers until April. All three have also been consistent supporters of providing additional aid to Ukraine.

The Daily Caller,"‘Shocking’ Number Of Americans Believe Speech Can Be ‘Violence,’ Poll Finds","A large majority of Americans believe words can be equated to physical violence, a poll released Thursday found.
In total, 80% of respondents at least slightly agreed with the statement that “words can be violence,” while 22% said it describes their thoughts “completely,” according to an October poll by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), which it described as “shocking.” Only 12% of Gen Z respondents disagreed that speech could be violence.
“Equating words with violence trivializes actual physical harm, shuts down conversations, and even encourages real violence by justifying the use of force against offensive speech,” Greg Lukianoff, FIRE President and CEO, said in a press release. “Free speech isn’t violence, it’s the best alternative to violence ever invented.”
Women were more likely to believe words can be equated to violence, with 86% responding in the affirmative compared to 73% of men, according to the press release. Democrats were more likely to agree with the comparison, totaling 89% compared to 73% of Republicans and 72% of independents.
Nearly 90% of Americans surveyed said they believe they should have the right to speak freely during a public comment session, over 70% said they believe they should have the right to criticize public officials during council meetings and 55% believe they should have the right to post mocking videos of political candidates to social media, FIRE found.
Many Americans in the poll reported having to censor their speech, with 85% doing so over the past month alone, while 38% are at least slightly worried about losing their job if someone complains about something they have said, the poll found.
Around 64% of respondents also said that free speech in the U.S. is heading in the wrong direction, with just over 40% saying the right to free speech is “not very” or “not at all” secure, according to the poll.
Events such as protests have raised questions nationally about what is considered free speech and where to draw the line. While countless protests nationwide have grown into violence and had to be forcefully broken apart, one federal judge recently found that an anti-Israel group had grounds to sue university officials for limiting their ability to protest.

The Daily Caller,‘It Doesn’t Affect Me’: Trump Reveals Who Wasn’t ‘Thrilled’ About His Team Up With RFK Jr.,"Former President Donald Trump told podcaster Joe Rogan that pharmaceutical executives were not “thrilled” that he teamed up with former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. during a Friday interview.
Kennedy endorsed Trump and announced the suspension of his campaign on Aug. 23, ten months after launching his independent bid, following his split with Democrats over issues including censorship, the war in Ukraine, illegal immigration, the party’s failure to hold primary debates and primary rules that gave President Joe Biden an advantage. When Rogan asked if anyone had urged Trump not to work with Kennedy, the former president revealed some pushback from pharmaceutical company executives. (RELATED: ‘Why Not?’: Trump Tells Rogan He’ll Use Tariffs To Eliminate Income Tax, Make America ‘Rich’)
WATCH:
“I would say that — and you know, I think in many ways they’ve done a good job and in many ways they’ve done a bad job — but I would say that Big Pharma wasn’t thrilled when they heard that,” Trump said, adding, “I’ve actually always gotten along very well with him [Kennedy], I’ve known him a long time.”
The social media platform Instagram banned Kennedy over his views on vaccines in February 2021, and ABC News edited out a portion of an interview where he discussed the COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy said Trump would “make America healthy again” during an August interview with Fox News host Shannon Bream.
“He’s a different kind of a guy,” Trump said of Kennedy. “He’s very smart, great guy, and he’s very sincere about this. I mean, he really is. He thinks— we spend a fortune on pesticides, on all this stuff, and then you end up— that chart is a terrible chart, the one previous. It’s such a bad chart when you look at where we are compared to other countries that don’t spend ten cents.”
The chart showed life expectancy compared to health expenditure per capita for a number of countries, including the United States, which fell largely behind other nations despite spending more on health care and services per capita.
“I’ve had some people who aren’t exactly thrilled,” Trump said, regarding Kennedy’s involvement with his campaign. “It doesn’t affect me,” Trump said about the criticism.

The Daily Caller,Social Media Erupts Over Video Appearing To Show Harris Supporter Screaming At Child In Stroller,"A video trending on social media appearing to show a Kamala Harris supporter screaming at a child in a stroller Friday in Houston sparked strong reactions from viewers, including the Trump campaign.
The video shows a white woman in a blue crop top and black shorts getting into the face of a little blonde girl as she seemingly yelled, “I don’t give a fuck, your dad’s a [bitch?]!” A black woman standing beside the apparent Harris supporter then yanks her away from the child’s face and appeared to confront her for lashing out at the toddler. A man in a blue shirt holding a microphone is next seen lifting the child out of the stroller after the supposed Harris supporter was chided by other rally-goers.
Amidst the reactions of the surrounding crowd, the man, using the microphone, then asks the woman, “Are you ashamed at all? Are you ashamed?”
“No,” she responds.
“Look at her face, everyone look at her face,” the man continued, referring to the girl viewers speculated to be his daughter.
“Why would you bring her here?” the woman appears to retort as the video ends.
Among the reactions from social media accounts was one from the Trump campaign, who put the apparent Harris supporter on blast for her alleged behavior. (RELATED: Democratic Senator Marvels That Trump Support In Key Battleground State Is ‘Astonishing’)
“What type of deranged lunatic would scream at an innocent child like this?” Trump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter). “Apparently a Kamala Harris supporter.”

The Daily Caller,Trump Within Striking Distance Of Harris In State GOP Hasn’t Won Since New Millennium,"Former President Donald Trump has closed within striking range of Vice President Kamala Harris in New Hampshire, a state the GOP hasn’t claimed in a presidential race since 2000.
A new Emerson College Polling/WHDH poll, conducted Oct. 21-23, shows Harris with a narrow lead of just three points over Trump, garnering support from 50% of likely voters compared to Trump’s 47%. Third-party candidates pull 2%, with 1% of voters still undecided.
This slim margin signals a more competitive race than many anticipated in the Democratic-leaning state as Trump gains momentum in a state that President Joe Biden carried by over 7% in 2020. Recent polling shows a noticeable shift among male voters in favor of Trump, while Harris maintains a lead among women similar to Biden’s in the last election.
“Harris’ margin among women is similar to that of Biden in 2020 — however, male voters have shifted about two points toward Trump,” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, said. “In addition, Harris is underperforming Biden’s 2020 support among independent voters, who break for Harris by 13 points, but broke for Biden by about double that amount.”

— The Hill (@thehill) October 25, 2024
Economic concerns dominate the political landscape in New Hampshire, with 34% of respondents identifying the economy as their top issue, followed by housing affordability at 26%, which may play into Trump’s hands as he campaigns on promises of financial recovery and job creation, pressing an agenda aimed squarely at discontent over inflation and rising costs, Emerson College Polling stated. For Harris, addressing these economic anxieties will be critical as she works to consolidate her base in New Hampshire. (RELATED: Voters Trust Trump Over Harris On Most Important Issue, New Poll Finds)
Other polls conducted recently suggest trouble for Harris as well, in a tight race for Arab American support, a new Arab News/YouGov poll shows Trump edging out Harris, with 45% backing Trump over Harris’s 43%. As the election nears, Harris’s team is reportedly concerned about her standing in key swing states like Michigan, where Arab American and Muslim communities could prove pivotal.
With just under two weeks until election day, Trump holds a slight 47%-45% lead nationally over Harris, according to a Wall Street Journal poll released Thursday. This shift follows August’s poll, where Harris held an advantage, now within the margin of error.

The Daily Caller,Chinese Student Accused Of Voting Illegally — And His Vote Will Reportedly Count,"Michigan officials have charged a Chinese national for allegedly voting in the 2024 elections illegally, and there is reportedly no way for election officials to remove his vote now that it’s been tabulated.
An unidentified University of Michigan student, who is described as a Chinese national and not a U.S. citizen, allegedly registered to vote and cast a ballot in the 2024 general election, according to a Wednesday statement from the Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson’s office and the Washtenaw County Prosecutor’s office. The announcement comes just six days from Election Day, with polls showing Michigan up for grabs. (RELATED: Biden-Appointed Judge Blocks Virginia Effort To Remove Non-Citizens From Voter Rolls)
“We are grateful for the swift action of the clerk in this case, who took the appropriate steps and referred the case to law enforcement,” read a joint statement from Benson and the Washtenaw County Prosecutor’s Office. “We are also grateful to law enforcement for swiftly and thoroughly investigating this case.”
“Anyone who attempts to vote illegally faces significant consequences, including but not limited to arrest and prosecution,” the statement continued.
The individual registered to vote on Sunday, signed a document which identified himself as an American citizen and entered his ballot into a tabulator, according to Benson’s office. However, the University of Michigan student later reached out to his local clerk’s office and asked if he could get his ballot back.
Despite it being an unlawful vote, the Chinese man’s ballot is expected to remain counted in the general election because there is no way for election officials to obtain it now that it’s been put through a tabulator, according to sources familiar with the state’s election laws that spoke with the Detroit News. This is reportedly because ballots are designed to not be tracked back to an individual voter.
A spokesperson for the Michigan Secretary of State’s Office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation on whether the vote could be removed before the conclusion of the general election.
The Chinese national has been charged with perjury, for making a false statement on an affidavit with the intention of securing voter registration, and for attempting to vote as an unauthorized elector, according to Benson’s office. The second crime is a felony that is punishable by up to four years in prison and a fine of $2,000.
News of the alleged incident comes as Michigan remains largely deadlocked in the polls between former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. The Real Clear Politics (RCP) polling average shows the two candidates statistically tied, Harris up by half a percentage point.
At the same time, GOP states have battled the Biden-Harris Justice Department in the courtroom over the ability to purge non-citizens from voting rolls. The Justice Department recently forced Alabama to reverse its efforts to clean voter rolls, while the Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed Virginia to keep the non-citizens they removed off the books.

The Daily Caller,‘Ask Yourself A Basic Question About Network Integrity’: JD Vance Calls Out CNN Host Over ‘Russia Hoax’ Coverage,"Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance called out CNN host Jake Tapper Sunday over coverage of the “Russia Hoax” when Tapper asked a slew of questions about recent comments made by the former president.
Former Trump chief of staff John Kelly told the New York Times that Trump meets the definition of a fascist in an article released Tuesday. Tapper repeatedly pressed Vance with questions likening Trump to the “dictator” Kelly claimed he would rule as, but Vance brought up CNN’s coverage of false claims of Russian interference in the 2016 election.
“Ask yourself a basic question on network integrity. You guys talked about the Russia Hoax non-stop,” Vance said.
“The FBI was investigating it!” Tapper interjected. “The FBI was investigating it so we were covering that—”
“And so you took the words of unnamed FBI agents and put them on your network as though they were the gospel truth. You did it again and again,” Trump’s running mate chided.
Vance admonished CNN for leading viewers to incorrectly believe former President Donald Trump conspired with Russian President Vladimir Putin to interfere in the 2016 election. Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign paid a tech firm that “exploited” access to Trump Tower and later at the White House in an attempt to link Trump to Russia.
Tapper said “no” various times as the GOP vice presidential candidate called out his network, repeating the argument that CNN covered the FBI investigation. (RELATED: DOJ Launches Russia Collusion Investigation in Alleged Effort To Combat Foreign Election Interference)
“Can we talk about the issues that Americans care about?” Vance asked.
“I’m talking about things that Donald Trump has said,” the CNN host rebutted. “If you have an issue with whether or not he’s talking about the economy enough, that’s between you and your running mate. I’m talking about things he has said this week.”
Vance assured Tapper that Trump talks at length about topics concerning the American people at every single campaign rally, including remarks on energy, housing, and the border.
“Kamala Harris and her media allies — and I would put CNN in this category,” Vance said, prompting an immediate rejection from Tapper of CNN’s alliance with Harris.
“You guys seem to care more about Donald Trump’s past than the future of the American people. We’re running this campaign on making the American Dream affordable,” Vance added.",2024-10-27
The Daily Caller,Bomb Threat Forces Swing State County GOP Headquarters To Close,"The Republican committee headquarters in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, was forced to close its doors on Saturday after staff received a bomb threat by phone, according to a press release.
Pennsylvania’s GOP stated that an “angry” caller made a “profanity-laced bomb threat” to the Montgomery County office around 11:07 a.m. The state GOP noted that this incident isn’t isolated, as the party has experienced an increase in violent threats since September.
“Nothing will stop us from working to elect those who will put our country back on track,” Republican Party of Pennsylvania Chairman Lawrence Tabas wrote.
“And there should be unanimous agreement that political violence has no place in our elections, especially after an innocent Butler County husband and father lost his life to political violence,” Tabas added. “We emphatically urge Pennsylvanians to voice their opinions by voting, not violence and intimidation.”
In early September, an Erie County GOP staffer allegedly received death threats from a state resident, who threatened to kill the worker if they did not respond. (RELATED: ‘It’s Horrible’: Undecided Pennsylvania Voter Panel Unanimously Opposes Harris Calling Trump ‘Fascist’)
“I will KILL YOU IF YOU DON’T ANSWER ME!” “GONNA F***ING FIND YOU AND SKIN YOU ALIVE AND USE YOUR SKIN FOR F***ING TOILET PAPER, YOU F***ING KKK**T!” the test message stated, according to the press release.
Later, on Oct. 10, protestors “forcibly entered” the Delaware County Republican headquarters, reportedly threatening to “kill staff” and refusing to allow them to leave the building, according to the press release. During the incident, two female volunteers told authorities they felt threatened by the four protestors, the Mainline Times & Suburban reported.
“This type of harassment — a descent into threats or intimidation — ought to have no no place in our community,” Republican Party officials told the outlet at the time. “We condemn it in the strongest possible terms, and call on our friends across the aisle to do the same.”
By Oct. 17, an unspecified number of GOP-affiliated individuals received an anonymous letter warning that if former President Donald Trump wins this November, their “property” and family “may be impacted,” the press release reported.
“Should your candidate win…we know where you live, you are in the data base. In the dead of a cold winters night, this year, or next and beyond, there is no knowing what may happen. Your property, your family may be impacted…” the letter stated. “You tread on me at your peril, motherf****r. We look forward to visiting in the future.”
The state’s GOP noted local police departments, Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s Election Integrity Task Force and the FBI have been made aware of the threats.
Shapiro’s office and the FBI did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

She said, ‘You’re welcome,’ you know? ‘I call that discipline.’ And it made me think about something,” Charlamagne told Couric in response to her question about his perception of Harris’ authenticity during their town hall. “I think that we’ve seen such a lack of discipline since [former President] Donald Trump came on the scene that we forgot what that looks like.”
“So when you have a politician who is in an interview or in a conversation and they’re being disciplined, as she says, and getting their message across and telling us what their policies are and, you know, detailing their policies, it’s kind of like, ‘We want to be entertained,’ right? And that’s not what I think we need from our politicians,” he added. “So, to say, do I think she was being authentic? Yeah, I think she was being authentically who she is, which is a very disciplined, seasoned veteran politician.”
Voters have criticized Harris for how she answers questions on the campaign trail, with Couric echoing some of their sentiments in response to Charlamagne.
“I have to beg to differ with you on that point. I think that she takes a really long time to get to her point, and that she does rely on talking points too often. I think she’s gotten much better than she used to, but it’s almost as if she’s afraid to say something that will later come back to haunt her,” the journalist said. “And I find the fact that she just doesn’t really articulate to me her true policy position and that she isn’t really directly answering the questions a lot of times.”
“That’s been my experience and my experience watching her. I just wish she would say, ‘This is our plan,’ or, ‘You’re right, a lot of illegal immigrants have come into this country during the Biden administration, but this is why, and this is what I want to do about it moving forward.’ You know?” she continued. “I don’t find her explanation of policy that compelling compared to, say, someone like [former President] Bill Clinton or [former President] Barack Obama.”
Charlamagne acknowledged he “can understand” Couric’s views on the vice president.
Journalist Mark Halperin said recently that Harris’ “lack of decisiveness” remains her primary weakness.
That, to me, is her Achilles’ heel; that is the thing that bedevils her,” Halperin said. “Because public speaking — she’s not a stupid person — public speaking on tough questions, even if they’re not asked in a tough way, involves on-your-feet, making decisions about what to say. And you don’t want to annoy anybody or anger anybody or commit a political error.”

The Daily Caller,Harris Completes Pivot To Failed ‘Democracy’ Message With Speech At J6 Site,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Vice President Kamala Harris used her closing argument, one week out from the election, to complete a messaging pivot at the Ellipse, where Trump once addressed his supporters hours before the Jan. 6 Capitol Riot.
Harris, surrounded by her usual “freedom” signage, told tens of thousands of her supporters that Trump was “obsessed with revenge,” is a “petty tyrant” and would seek to use the military against his enemies if elected to the White House on Nov. 5. The vice president, adding that the former president was “out for unchecked power” and had an enemies list, further drew on the location of her speech within the first few minutes of her closing argument to try to prove Trump is such.
Harris’ closing arguments displayed a larger campaign message in the final weeks of the election, one that has shifted from one of “joy” to that of calling Trump a fascist, “unhinged,” “unstable” and unfit to lead.
“Look, we know who Donald Trump is. He is the person who stood at this very spot nearly four years ago and sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol to overturn the will of the people in a free and fair election,” Harris said.
“Donald Trump has told us his priorities for a second term. He has an enemies list of people he intends to prosecute. He says one of his highest priorities is to set free the violent extremists who assaulted those law enforcement officers on January 6th,” the continued.
Harris’ final message is one that closely mirrors President Joe Biden’s campaign messaging of pinning Trump down as a “threat to democracy,” which often touched on the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot to illustrate their point.
The Daily Caller spoke to several rally goers at Harris rally, some of who echoed the vice president’s message that “democracy” was on the line in the 2024 election and feared a dangerous Trump if he was elected.
“I think it’s our democracy [that is at stake,]” Jason Vaughn, a nurse practitioner from the south visiting D.C. for the rally and work, told the Caller, “I believe Trump is a fascist.”
“I think he has figured out that he has all this power, and the Supreme Court has told him he can do whatever he wants, and I think he is going to run with that if he is around. It’s do or die,” Marcus Reed, a government employee who lives in D.C., told the Caller.
While her supporters worried about the potential of Trump with unchecked power, the vice president told them in her speech that he could weaponize the military against them.
“Donald Trump intends to use the United States military against American citizens who simply disagree with him. People he calls — quote — ‘the enemy from within.’ This is not a candidate for President who is thinking about how to make your life better,” she said.
“This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power,” Harris continued.
Biden’s messaging reportedly made top Democrats anxious as it wasn’t landing with voters, but still the campaign continued with it. At one point, Biden met with historians to help frame his speeches around “the ongoing threats to democracy and democratic institutions both here in America and around the world, as well as the opportunities we face as a nation,” the White House previously said.
It’s something Biden has continued to parrot despite dropping out of the race. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Wednesday that the president thinks Trump is a fascist.
“You have heard from this president over and over again about the threats to democracy,” Jean-Pierre said. “And the president has spoken about that. You have heard from the former president himself that he is going to be a dictator on day one. This is him, not us. This is him.”
About an hour before, Harris had unexpectedly given remarks from her residence in response to a report from The New York Times and The Atlantic. Both outlets conducted interviews with former Trump chief of staff John Kelly, who said the former president “met the definition of a fascist” and admired figures like former Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler.
The Atlantic article citing Kelly’s comments additionally alleged that Trump disparaged a deceased veteran and her family. The Trump campaign alongside former officials, the deceased veteran’s family and their lawyer have all gone on the record to deny the story.
Harris has repeatedly spoken about Kelly’s comments anyways.
“It is clear from John Kelly’s words that Donald Trump is someone who, I quote, ‘certainly falls into the general definition of fascist.’ Who vowed to be a dictator on day one and vowed to use the military as his personal militia to carry out his personal and political vendettas,” the vice president said.
“Donald Trump is increasingly unhinged and unstable, and in a second term, people like John Kelly would not be there to be the guard rails against his propensities and his actions,” she continued.
Kamala Harris, who calls Trump a fascist, and Joe Biden, who calls Trump’s supporters garbage, have something to say about the divisiveness of Trump’s rhetoric.
— David Sacks (@DavidSacks) October 30, 2024
A few hours after her remarks and Jean-Pierre’s comments, the vice president said she believed Trump was a fascist.
“You quoted General Milly calling Trump a fascist. You yourself have not used that word to describe him. Let me ask you tonight, do you think Donald Trump is a fascist?” CNN host Anderson Cooper asked Harris.
“Yes, I do,” Harris said without hesitation. “And I also believe that the people who know him best on this subject should be trusted.”
But since Harris has pivoted to the message that seemingly played into Biden’s demise, her own party has started to fret about the vice president’s election chances.
“It doesn’t play well in communities that are struggling to make ends meet, and that’s the problem. They’re talking to the wrong people,” Sherry Gay-Dagnogo, a former state representative and Detroit school board member who is backing Harris, told Politico. “We can’t keep campaigning on modes of fear.”
I made a promise to the people of our country: I will fight for you, regardless of who you vote for, and be a president for all Americans. Here is my closing argument. https://t.co/rOqLcTB0TR
— Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) October 29, 2024
During her speech, the vice president drew parallels between the 2024 election to the American revolution, as in both situations, she argued power needed to be wrestled from a “petty tyrant.”
“Just like I always have. Nearly 250 years ago, America was born when we wrested freedom from a petty tyrant,” she said. “Across the generations, Americans have: Preserved that freedom. Expanded it. And in so doing, proved to the world that a government of, by and for the people is strong and can endure. And those who came before us — the patriots at Normandy and Selma. Seneca Falls and Stonewall. On farmlands and factory floors.”
“They did not struggle, sacrifice and lay down their lives, only to see us cede our fundamental freedoms, only to see us submit to the will of another petty tyrant,” Harris continued.
Taylor, a Maryland woman in case management supporting Harris at her D.C. rally, expressed fear at the thought of Trump being president. The Caller omitted Taylor’s last name for the sake of anonymity to allow her to discuss her views freely.
“It’s scary to think that Donald Trump will be back in office, and Project 2025, he is saying he isn’t using it but it was written, so that’s scary,” Taylor told the Caller.
Other Harris supporters at the Ellipse thought that the very rights they hold today could disappear if Trump reaches the White House again.
“Everyone’s freedoms,” a Maryland woman in the travel industry, given anonymity to speak freely, told the Caller. “Even the right to vote.”",2024-10-30
The Daily Caller,"‘Why Not?’: Trump Tells Rogan He’ll Use Tariffs To Eliminate Income Tax, Make America ‘Rich’","Former President Donald Trump said he would seek to use tariffs to potentially eliminate the income tax in a lengthy interview with podcaster Joe Rogan released Friday night.
Trump, who enacted tariffs on steel and aluminum in 2018 during his presidency, sat with the podcaster in a nearly three-hour long episode of The Joe Rogan Experience. Rogan asked Trump if he was “serious” about using tariffs to offset the elimination of income taxes. (RELATED: ‘He Saved The Steel Industry’: Steelworkers In Key Swing State Explain Why They Endorsed Trump)
WATCH:
“To me, the most beautiful word — and I’ve said this the past couple of weeks, in the dictionary today — is the word tariff,” Trump told Rogan. “It’s more beautiful than love, it’s more beautiful than any — it’s the most beautiful word. This country can become rich with the use, the proper use, of tariffs.”
Trump said he would impose a 200% tariff on John Deere’s tractors if it closed an American factory and moved production to Mexico in September.
“Did you just float out the idea of getting rid of income taxes and replacing it with tariffs?” Rogan asked. “Were you serious about that?”
“Why not?” Trump responded. “Our country was the richest, relatively, in the 1880s and 1890s, a president who was assassinated named McKinley, he was the tariff king. He spoke beautifully of tariffs. His language was really beautiful: We will not allow the enemy to come in and take our jobs and take our factories and take our workers and take our families unless they pay a big price and the big price is tariffs.” (Watch The Daily Caller Documentary “Cleaning Up Kamala”)
Vice President Kamala Harris has claimed in ads and in speeches that Trump’s plan to impose tariffs would act as a “national sales tax” and insisted that it would cost American families $4,000 a year in higher prices, the Wall Street Journal reported.

The Daily Caller,"Not To Be Outdone By An Insult Comic, Biden Calls American Voters ‘Garbage’","President Joe Biden referred to former President Donald Trump’s supporters as “garbage” Tuesday in a Zoom call with the organization Voto Latino following comments made at a Trump rally by a comedian.
The comments from the president were in response to those made by comic Tony Hinchcliffe on Sunday while speaking at a Trump rally in Madison Square Garden, where the comedian referred to Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage.” Biden attempted to clarify the comments in an X post Tuesday night after receiving backlash, claiming he was referring to the “rhetoric” put out by the comic and not Trump supporters.
“Donald Trump has no character. He doesn’t give a damn about the Latino community. He’s failed a businessman. He only cares about the billionaire friends he had and accumulated wealth for those at the top,” Biden said in the video.
“And just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a ‘floating island of garbage.’ Well, let me tell you something … I don’t know the Puerto Rican that I know — or a Puerto Rico, where I’m — in my home state of Delaware, they’re good, decent, honorable people. The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American. It’s totally contrary to everything we’ve done, everything we’ve been.”
Here’s the video: pic.twitter.com/7hNp3su8k2
— Gabe Gutierrez (@gabegutierrez) October 30, 2024
Biden addressed the backlash by condemning the rhetoric against Puerto Rico at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally as hateful. He clarified that he believed the alleged divisive language toward Latinos contradicts American values.
“Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage — which is the only word I can think of to describe it. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation,” Biden wrote on X.
In a statement reported by journalist Gabe Gutierrez, the White House further emphasized that Biden was referring to the comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who backs Trump and made disparaging remarks about Puerto Rico. (RELATED: Anti-Trump Journalist Claims Dem ‘Outrage’ Over Trump MSG Rally ‘Misses’ Point, Predicts Most ‘Diverse’ GOP Base Ever)
“There’s a lot going on. I don’t know if you know this, but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it’s called Puerto Rico,” Hinchcliffe said at the rally.
The White House initially released a transcript that showed Biden saying “supporters’,” with a plural possessive apostrophe. Later on, they updated the transcript to read “supporter’s,” implying that Biden wasn’t referring to millions of Americans, but only Hinchcliffe himself. Many on social media, however, weren’t buying it and accused the White House of incorrectly using an apostrophe.

Former Daily Caller reporter and now-CNN host Kaitlan Collins on her show Tuesday night doubted the idea that Biden meant “supporter’s” with an apostrophe.
“The White House is trying to say that what President Biden was saying — they’re putting an apostrophe there in ‘supporters,’ saying it’s the singular, I guess referring to the comedian,” Collins said. “I mean, it’s hard to really look at that when you can listen to it for yourself …”
Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro apparently criticized the attack as well on Collins’ show. “I would never insult the good people of Pennsylvania or any Americans even if they chose to support a candidate that I didn’t support.”

The Daily Caller,‘I’m Confused’: Harris Faulkner Calls Out Dem Who Claimed Economy Is Better Than It Was Four Years Ago,"Fox News host Harris Faulkner expressed confusion Friday when a former Democratic lawmaker claimed the economy was in better shape than it was four years ago.
The economy added only 12,000 jobs in October, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday, while also making downward revisions to job gains in August and September that totaled over 100,000. Faulkner asked former Democratic State Sen. David Carlucci of New York why Vice President Kamala Harris wasn’t acknowledging the pain Americans felt. (RELATED: ‘It’s Helpful If You’ll Answer The Question’: Harris Faulkner Chides Dem Guest For Spinning When Asked About Kamala Harris Comparing Trump To Hitler)
“We do have to talk about this, and I’m wondering why the vice president isn’t talking about this. Because I have to think they know before we do,” Faulkner said. “And so getting ahead of this with a more juicy message on I feel your pain, she’s got Bill Clinton, goodness gracious, take him with you. I mean, don’t let him talk about the border, though, because that’s gonna be a problem for Kamala Harris. But seriously, what’s going on in the last few days? That’s not what we’re seeing.”
WATCH:
Since President Joe Biden and Harris took office in January 2021, prices have risen by over 20%, while the consumer price index (CPI) peaked at 9% in June 2022. By comparison, the CPI grew by just 1.4% year-over-year in January 2021 when Trump left office, while the average price for a gallon of gas was under $2.25, according to GasBuddy.com.
“I think this is a winning issue for Kamala Harris,” Carlucci claimed, with Faulkner rebutting, “But she’s not leading in any of these polls.”
Carlucci claimed Harris was “neck-and-neck” with former President Donald Trump in terms of the economy, to which Faulkner responded, “Wait, 53 to 45, you think is neck-and-neck?”
“These are closer than what many people would have said if you only listen to one side and the rallies that Donald Trump does. He acts like the economy is in the toilet, but that’s just not true,” Carlucci claimed. “Yes, people are struggling, and Kamala Harris knows that and says that, but you’ve got to take it in its entirety. If we look at where we were four years ago, economists were saying we were headed towards a recession, possibly a depression.”
“Where we were four years ago was heading into 9% inflation, 9% inflation,” Faulkner responded. “So exactly four years ago, around the time of the election, what was being handed was 1.4%. So I’m confused. I don’t think you want to go back four years, ’cause that’s an easy conversation to have.”
Biden’s approval rating on the economy is only 39.8% in the RealClear Polling average, while only 36% gave him good marks on inflation and only 34.8% approved of his handling of immigration, all of which have been issues emphasized by former President Donald Trump in the campaign against Harris.

The Daily Caller,‘Stop The Crimes’: Congressional Leaders Reveal How They Will Usher Immigration Agenda Under Trump Admin,"Congressional leaders in both the House and Senate revealed what they have in store for border enforcement and immigration reform if former President Donald Trump reenters the White House.
Beefing up border security and cracking down on interior enforcement are all on the table if Trump is reelected in November, according to several GOP lawmakers who spoke with the Daily Caller News Foundation. Sen Ted Cruz and Rep. Troy Nehls of Texas, along with Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee, have zeroed in on the issue in Congress and say they are ready and waiting to assist the incoming Trump administration. (RELATED: NYPD Refused Detainer Request And Released Illegal Migrant Charged With Attempted Murder, ICE Says)
“Every day we hear about illegal aliens assaulting or murdering another American,” Cruz said to the DCNF. “I’ve been fighting for justice for Jocelyn Nungaray, a 12-year-old from Houston who was brutally murdered by two illegal aliens released into Texas under the administration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.”
“Next Congress I look forward to passing and to having President Trump sign into law my Justice for Jocelyn Act,” Cruz continued. “This legislation is aimed at ensuring that no child and no family ever again experiences what happened to Jocelyn.”
Nungaray was a 12-year-old Houston girl who was allegedly sexually assaulted and murdered in June by two Venezuelan men. Federal immigration authorities say the two men entered the United States unlawfully before their arrest for Nungaray’s brutal killing.
The Justice for Jocelyn Act would require the Department of Homeland Security to “exhaust all reasonable efforts” to keep an illegal migrant in custody before resorting to releasing them into the interior of the country, according to the legislation. Should an illegal migrant be released, however, the bill would call for continuous GPS monitoring until their removal from the country or the completion of their immigration proceedings.
The legislation also would empower federal immigration officials to immediately deport illegal migrants who violate their terms of their release — a proposal that could potentially prevent an incredible number of crimes by illegal migrants who repeatedly encounter law enforcement.
“Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have released dangerous illegal aliens into our country that have gone on to take the lives of American citizens,” Nehls stated to the DCNF. “I have introduced pieces of legislation that would remove illegal aliens who fail to comply with their release order and to improve the mandatory tracking and detention of illegal aliens for the entire process.”
“Too many Americans have lost their lives at the hands of illegal aliens that Kamala Harris and Joe Biden let into our country,” Nehls continued. “Congress must do everything to ensure that Americans are put first, not illegal aliens who shouldn’t even be here in the first place.”
Nehls, whose district largely covers the Houston suburbs, is a sponsor for the Justice for Jocelyn Act on the House side. Like Cruz, the Republican congressman has also ripped the Biden-Harris administration for the release of illegal migrants when there has been detention space available within Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) facilities.
“In a second Trump administration, the House Committee on Homeland Security will do everything possible to help the United States return to an era of secure borders and robust interior enforcement,” Green, who serves as chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, stated to the DCNF. “Ending the Biden-Harris border crisis will require two things — policy changes to end the flow of inadmissible aliens into our country, and more funding for interior enforcement to demonstrate that there are consequences to entering illegally.”
With Green as its chairman, the House Homeland Committee has remained one of the Biden-Harris administration’s fiercest critics, demanding answers on a slate of immigration-related controversies, such as the vetting process that went into the entry of an Afghan recently arrested for allegedly plotting an Election Day terrorist attack, the alleged failure of the administration to properly vet foreign nationals before they boarded domestic flights, the handling of unaccompanied alien children into the country, among numerous other border issues.
“While we don’t control the budget process, I believe that providing massive increases for ICE detention and removal operations will be paramount, and I will be vocal about their necessity,” Green continued.
All three lawmakers have also been presented with the 2024 Congressional Champions of Interior Enforcement award by the National Immigration Center for Enforcement (NICE) for their legislative efforts. NICE has championed hawkish border policy in Washington, D.C., and tracked data that demonstrates the consequences of lax enforcement — such as when the group collected data on how substantially fewer criminal illegal migrants are being removed from the U.S. under the Biden-Harris administration compared to Trump’s time in office.
There were 423,102 deportations of criminal aliens under the first three fiscal years of the Trump administration, with that number falling to 134,617 during the same time period under the current administration, NICE uncovered. Those numbers marked a 74% decrease in removals altogether.
NICE advocates for the end of catch-and-release of illegal migrants at the border, the abolition of sanctuary city laws, requiring all employers in the country to use E-Verify, among numerous other hawkish policies.
“President Trump will be ready, Congress just needs to provide the resources,” RJ Hauman, president of NICE, said to the DCNF. He added that more detention beds are needed and called for “immediate” GPS monitoring of every illegal migrant on the non-detained docket in order to properly conduct sweeping deportations.
“Our champions of interior enforcement will be sure to lead the charge on Capitol Hill,” Hauman said.
The lawmakers said they are ready to work with their allies and hit the ground running if Trump occupies the Oval Office in January.
“I am deeply grateful to the National Immigration Center for Enforcement for all their work pushing back on the open-borders, anti-enforcement policies of the Biden-Harris administration, and to inform the American people about the damage these policies have caused,” Green said of the organization. “I encourage my colleagues on the Hill to consider partnering with them in pursuit of creative and effective policy solutions to this self-inflicted crisis.”
“I’ve been proud to work with some great allies on this bill, including the National Immigration Center for Enforcement,” Cruz said, referring to his Justice for Jocelyn Act. “Together, we will act to stop the crimes enabled by this Biden-Harris administration.”

The Daily Caller,ROOKE: Media Hit On Trump Accidentally Confirms Harris Has Major Election Problem Brewing,"The Atlantic published a report Tuesday on former President Donald Trump that was supposed to make Americans believe he is a racist bigot and literally Adolf Hitler. But hidden inside the obvious hit piece was the truth about a critical demographic Vice President Kamala Harris is clearly worried about.
When a fellow soldier and his girlfriend murdered U.S. Army Private Vanessa Guillén in April 2020, Trump brought her family to the White House to pay respects and promised to help them with the burial.
“I saw what happened to your daughter Vanessa, who was a spectacular person, and respected and loved by everybody, including in the military,” Trump told Guillén’s mother, later adding, “If I can help you out with the funeral, I’ll help — I’ll help you with that,” he said. “I’ll help you out. Financially, I’ll help you.”
JUST IN: The sister of Vanessa Guillén absolutely rips The Atlantic after they released a hit piece on Trump about her sister’s de*th.

— Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) October 22, 2024
Over four years later, The Atlantic is now trying to turn Trump’s generosity into a hit piece by claiming that anonymous sources and one disgruntled ex-staff member informed them that Trump told his staff privately that he wouldn’t pay for Guillén’s funeral bill. The outlet even went as far as claiming that Trump said: “It doesn’t cost 60,000 bucks to bury a f*cking Mexican!” (ROOKE: Trump’s McDonald’s Visit Tears Down Thin Veil Covering Harris Campaign’s Greatest Weakness)
It was the last line that stood out the most. Not only have multiple people in the room and Guillén’s family denied the entire contents of the so-called report, but it seems to point to an issue Harris is having with a particular demographic that has recently shifted from Democrat to Republican — Hispanic voters.
Wow.
I don’t appreciate how you are exploiting my sister’s death for politics- hurtful & disrespectful to the important changes she made for service members. President Donald Trump did nothing but show respect to my family & Vanessa. In fact, I voted for President Trump today. https://t.co/o8cDrKOKBV— Mayra Guillen (@mguilen_) October 22, 2024
Why else would The Atlantic, a leftist rag owned by Harris’ BFF, Laurene Powell Jobs, publish such a thin story based on nameless accusers with the backdrop being that Trump hates Hispanics? They could have accomplished the same goal with just about any storyline during the Trump administration. Still, they chose the death of a Hispanic immigrant solider to drive home their point, which seems to be that Trump apparently hates Hispanics.
There are over 36 million Hispanics in the U.S. with the right to vote, representing nearly 15 percent of eligible voters, according to the Americas Society/Council of the Americas (AS/COA). President Joe Biden carried the majority of Hispanic voters in 2020, despite Trump seeing an increase among their demographic at the ballot box compared to 2016.

In the latest New York Times/Sienna Poll of registered Hispanic voters, Harris is well below the 66% Biden won in 2020. Just 56% of Hispanics told the poll they were voting for Harris, while 37% said they were voting for Trump. Considering that Biden won in 2020 due to a coalition of Hispanic, Black and Asian voters, Harris being so far behind Biden’s numbers is likely worrying her and other Democrats. The last Democrat presidential candidate to fall below 60% was John Kerry. (ROOKE: In Fewer Than 10 Words, Brian Stelter Lays Bare Democrats’ White Liberal Ignorance Problem)

Harris is losing critical demographics, like Hispanics and blue-collar workers, that Democrats have counted on in past elections, with only 13 days until Nov. 5. The desperation is evident with the hit piece attempting to portray Trump as a Hilter-esque bigot who hates Hispanics. The Atlantic’s ties to Democrats and Harris only further confirm the suspicion that they need as many Hispanics as possible to break from Trump’s camp and vote for Harris.

The Daily Caller,Blue State To Offer Free Birth Control Using Multimillion Dollar Taxpayer Fund,"Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer launched a new program in her state Wednesday offering free birth control to all residents.
The “Take Control of your Birth Control” program will provide Michiganders with condoms, over-the-counter oral contraceptives and emergency contraception starting in November until supplies run out, according to a press release. The program is being administered by Michigan’s Department of Health and Human Services, which was awarded $5.6 million in taxpayer funds to expand family planning services, according to the state’s budget.
“Everyone, no matter how much money they make, deserves to make their own decisions about their own reproductive health and future,” Whitmer said in the press release. “With our family planning initiative, ‘Take Control of Your Birth Control,’ we are building on our work to protect reproductive freedom for all Michiganders. By expanding access to essential family planning tools, we are underscoring our commitment to ensuring Michiganders, along with their families and trusted health care providers, can make their own decisions about their own bodies and lives.”
The Biden-Harris administration on Monday called for private insurance companies to cover the cost of over-the-counter birth control through the Affordable Care Act, which Whitmer praised on X in an announcement for the new Michigan program. (‘Buy Votes’: Michigan Republicans Blast State Dems For Trying To Keep Residents On Dole As Election Looms)

The Daily Caller,Republicans Outpacing Democrats In Early In-Person Voting In Blue State,"Republicans are beating out their Democratic counterparts in New Jersey early in-person voting as of Tuesday, according to data analyzed by Associated Press election researcher Ryan Dubicki.
GOP voters who have already cast their ballots in person in the state total 144,105, compared to 139,524 votes from Democrats, according to the data analysis. Democrats have historically dominated early voting, with many party leaders pushing for supporters to vote early in previous elections.
“What we’re seeing is phenomenal,” New Jersey Republican gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli said Wednesday on “Fox & Friends First,” Fox News reported. “Republicans are finally embracing the opportunity to vote early. The return rate on vote-by-mail ballots has been fantastic. Local Republican organizations are doing a great job in getting the word out.”
The last time New Jersey voted for a GOP presidential candidate was in 1988, when Republican Vice President George H. W. Bush beat Democratic Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, according to Fox News.
Despite the strong showing, New Jersey Democrats are still leading Republicans in mail-in ballots as of Saturday, with 357,924 cast by Democrats, 121,003 by Republicans and 108,270 by unaffiliated voters, according to the New Jersey Globe. New Jersey voters cast a total of 589,353 ballots by mail as of Saturday morning, according to the Globe.

Former President Donald Trump drew nearly 100,000 attendees to a New Jersey campaign rally in May. Several GOP leaders in swing states have adopted a strategy often used by Democrats of encouraging voters to cast their ballots early.
Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have been locked in a tight presidential race with just six days remaining until Election Day. Trump is leading nationally by 0.4 percentage points at 48.4% to Harris’ 48.0%, according to polling averages from RealClear Polling.
Of registered voters in New Jersey, 55% said they plan to vote or have already voted for Harris, while 35% said they would vote or already have voted for Trump, according to a Rutgers-Eagleton Poll published on Oct. 30.

The Daily Caller,Panelist Tells Mark Halperin He Will ‘Not Be Stunned’ If Trump Narrowly Wins State GOP Hasn’t Won Decades,"Radio personality Michael Graham told journalist Mark Halperin Monday that he will “not be stunned” if Republican nominee Donald Trump narrowly wins New Hampshire in the 2024 election.
Graham cited a New Hampshire Journal/Praecones Analytica poll from Sunday finding Trump with a 50.2% to 49.8% lead over Vice President Kamala Harris in New Hampshire, saying that the state could be a hit or miss for the former president. Graham said on Halperin’s “The Morning Meeting” that New Hampshire is the one state in New England that may fare positively for Republicans, as enough voters may turn out in the state to vote for Trump.
“Believe it or not, in a state the Democrats have carried 7 of the last 8 times, the Granite State, Donald Trump has a massive 50.2% to 49.8% lead… A month ago, the polling, Saint Ann’s and some and others had Trump losing by about 6.5 [points], and then last Thursday, Emerson came out and Trump was at 50%-47%, losing by 3 [within] margin of error, Graham said, citing the poll. “And then I of course, everyday, tune in go ‘The Morning Meeting’ and I heard Sean’s [Spicer] reporting and I got then umbers and I was stunned.”
Graham further said that “subterranean” issues, including whether to permit transgender athletes in women’s sports, is having a major effect on voters in New Hampshire and may help Trump in November. (RELATED: ‘Difficult For Her To Win’: Mark Halperin Says ‘Data Everywhere’ Shows ‘Things Have Moved In Trump’s Direction’)
“I think the two things that are moving in these purple-y states, the big one is Kamala Harris is failing the audition, or the job,” Graham said. “She’s just failing. And I think the other one is, you guys have picked up on these subterranean issues that are having effects that people aren’t looking at like these fights over trans issues, guys and girls sports, New Hampshire has been ground zero for that…. If you said Trump’s gonna lose New Hampshire by ten [points], I would not be stunned. If you told me Trump was gonna win New Hampshire by 1 [point], I would not be stunned.”
Former Trump-era White House press secretary Sean Spicer said he has talked to many New Englanders who had not previously supported Trump are now backing the former president because they are “pissed off” by the status quo.
Republican gubernatorial candidate Kelly Ayotte is leading her Democratic opponent Joyce Craig 51.9% to 48.1%, according to the New Hampshire Journal/Praecones Analytica poll. The poll surveyed 622 registered voters in New Hampshire between October 24-26 with a 3.93% margin of error.
A Republican presidential nominee has not won New Hampshire in a general election since former President George W. Bush secured a victory in 2000. Former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton narrowly beat Trump in New Hampshire 46.8% to 46.5%, while President Joe Biden won by a 7-point margin, 52.7% to 45.4%, against the former president.

The Daily Caller,NEW WSJ POLL: TRUMP TAKES LEAD NATIONALLY,"Former President Donald Trump has taken a narrow lead over Vice President Kamala Harris with less than two weeks until election day, according to a Wall Street Journal poll published Thursday.
Trump has pulled out in front with a 47-45 lead, a change from the Journal’s polling in August, which had Kamala ahead by two percentage points. The two percentage points are within the poll’s margin of error.
Harris’s favorability and job performance numbers have dropped since August while Trump’s job performance numbers has risen. In August, half of voters viewed her favorably. Now, as of late October, 45 percent view her favorably compared to 53 who view her unfavorably, according to the poll.
Harris is also seeing her worst job performance ratings as vice president since WSJ started asking voters about her performance. Fifty-four percent of voters disapprove of her performance compared to 42 percent who approve.
Exclusive: Trump has taken a narrow lead against Harris in the final weeks of the presidential race https://t.co/fUBlHlSvDb
— The Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) October 24, 2024
Ad blitzes and “the performance of the candidates” have contributed to the shift, the outlet reported.
“Voters are finally getting to know her,” Republican pollster David Lee, who ran the poll with Democrat Michael Bocian, told the WSJ. (RELATED: Wall Street Billionaires Are Starting To Bet On A Trump Win)
“The definitional period is coming to an end, and more people are unhappy with what they have learned about her than what they know about President Trump,” Lee said.
Issues that voters appear to trust Trump over Harris on include the economy and immigration. Voters approve of Trump over Harris on the economy by 12 points compared to 8 in August, according to the poll. On immigration, they trust him by 15 points, a leap from the 7-point lead he had over Harris in August.
The Journal’s poll results match other recent polls. While Real Clear Politics’ (RCP) national polling average still has Harris ahead by a hair – 0.2 percent – the four most recent polls all have Trump ahead by at least a two percent margin.
CNBC and Forbes/HarrisX, which polled likely voters as opposed to the registered voters that CNBC and WSJ polled, both have Trump ahead by two percent nationally.
Rasmussen’s Wednesday poll has Trump up by three percent.
While RCP’s average has Trump slightly behind nationally, he’s ahead in every key battleground. Overall in the swing states he’s up 0.9 percent. In Georgia he’s ahead by 2.2 points. In Wisconsin and Michigan he’s edging Harris by 0.2 percent.
Trump is also dominating in the betting markets. He has a 59 percent chance of winning versus Harris’ 40.1 percent chance, according to the RCP betting average.
Polymarket, the world’s largest prediction market, has Trump’s odds at 61.1 percent.
The shift is a far cry from early August, when Harris jumped out to a significant lead over Trump by most indicators. Harris’ current 0.2 percent lead in the RCP average is her lowest leading margin since she jumped ahead of Trump on Aug. 5.",2024-10-24
The Daily Caller,"Gen Z DNC Delegate Rejects Democrats, Says She’s Joining Republican Party","A former Democratic National Convention (DNC) delegate released a video Friday declaring her rejection of the Democratic Party as she crossed the political aisle.
Audrey McNeal, a 22-year-old woman who previously was a DNC delegate for both 2020 and 2024 elections, revealed on X she will be voting for the Trump-Vance ticket as she has joined the Republican Party.
“In 2020, I was elected at 18 to become one of the youngest delegates to the Democratic National Convention on behalf of my district. And in 2024, I was elected again to return to the DNC as a delegate,” McNeal said. “But this year, I’m casting my ballot for Donald Trump.”

McNeal said she was elected in March and wanted to go to the DNC to seek answers on free speech, the border and the economy. The former DNC delegate explained that she became disillusioned after attending the DNC.
“After reflecting on my time at the DNC, I realized it was no longer the party of free speech and civil liberties that it used to be,” McNeal said.
“In fact, Patrick Henry once said that the liberties of a people never were, nor ever will be secure when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them,” she added. (RELATED: ‘You’re Not A Kamala Person, I Know You’: Trump Makes His Case To Joe Rogan For Why He’s The Better Candidate)
President Joe Biden endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris immediately after dropping his reelection bid July 21. Despite prominent Democrats like former President Barack Obama initially suggesting an open primary system be used to determine the party’s replacement candidate, Democratic leaders eventually decided to skip the democratic process and place Harris at the top of their 2024 ticket.
“For the rulers of the Democratic Party elite to install Kamala Harris as the presidential nominee via stripping the vote of 14 million Americans, including their own delegates such as myself, well that was a decision in a transaction that was concealed,” McNeal said.
“And now I’m happy to say that in officially joining the Republican Party as a constitutional conservative,” the former DNC delegate announced.
Before she denounced the Democratic Party, McNeal told GPB in August that it was “empowering” to be among other young delegates at the DNC.
#ICYMI This year, 15 of Georgia’s 123 DNC delegates are under 35.

“We all have a common experience coming to the DNC, being really young, having very passionate dreams that we want to see and kind of just being there for each other when it comes to, like, supporting each other’s campaigns or going to caucus events together,” the former DNC delegate said at the time.

The Daily Caller,‘He’s Not Helping’: Ex-CNN Analyst Says Biden’s Call To ‘Lock’ Trump ‘Up’ Is ‘Absolutely Bad For Kamala Harris’,"Former CNN political analyst Chris Cillizza said Wednesday that President Joe Biden’s comment about having to “lock [former President Donald Trump] up” is damaging to Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign.
Biden made the “lock him up” remark Tuesday at New Hampshire’s Democratic National Committee office, referencing the tight race between Trump and Harris and claiming the former president believes he is immune from “physically eliminating” threats. Cillizza, on his YouTube channel, said while he does not believe Biden is deliberately undermining Harris, his comment will likely give Trump a boost in his efforts to defeat her. (RELATED: Former Clinton Pollster Says Harris’ ‘Inauthenticity’ Is ‘The Larger Problem She Faces’ In Election)
WATCH:
“Now, Biden, probably realizing what a dumb thing he had just said, added, ‘Politically lock him up. Lock him out, that’s what we have to do.’ Yeah, that’s the ticket,” Cillizza said. “Uh, come on, man, like we, ‘Politically lock him up,’ what the hell does that mean? When the president of the United States says, ‘We gotta lock him up’ about the former president of the United States, who has premised almost his entire political life on the idea that the Democrats and the ‘deep state’ are trying to lock him up, I mean, it’s really not good.”
“If the Trump campaign is smart, this will be in a Trump campaign ad. It affirms for the Republican base everything that Donald Trump is saying — that secretly the Democrats, from Joe Biden on down, including Kamala Harris, are just out to get him, right? He has said this for years,” he added. “And when the president of the United States says, ‘We gotta lock him up,’ and then says, ‘Politically lock him up,’ yeah, it’s just not good. Look, do I think this ends the race? No, of course not. Do I think Trump would be smart to put it in an ad? Yes, as I said, I do.”
Four criminal indictments were brought against Trump in 2023 involving alleged election interference and mishandling of classified documents. Trump repeatedly characterized the Manhattan case against him as “election interference,” referring to it as a “Biden witch hunt” and the “Biden Case.”
WATCH:
“I do not think Joe Biden is running a secret conspiracy to make Kamala Harris lose, but I do think that when you say things like ‘We gotta lock him up,’ ‘gotta lock him up’ about Donald Trump two weeks before an election, it affirms everything Donald Trump has been arguing,” Cillizza said later. “It makes the Republican base even more rabid to turn out, right? As if they weren’t rabid enough — they’re pretty rabid to turn out. They’re going to be even more rabid, so he’s not helping.”
“I get it, but like, he needs to not really do anything like this again. Like, it is absolutely bad for Kamala Harris, and I bet when her campaign read the ‘We gotta lock him up’ thing, they were like, ‘Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe,'” he added.
Biden presently has no intentions of appearing alongside his vice president on the campaign trail before Nov. 5, three White House officials and three Harris campaign officials recently told NBC News.

The Daily Caller,EXCLUSIVE: GOP Lawmakers Urge Biden Admin To Investigate Dem Rep With Deep China Ties,"Republican lawmakers called on the Biden administration to launch an investigation into a Chinese civic association linked to a New York Democratic congresswoman on Wednesday, according to a letter exclusively obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation.
Reps. Jim Banks of Indiana, Carlos Gimenez of Florida, Robert Wittman of Virginia and Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik of New York urged Secretary of State Antony Blinken to designate the New York-based Henan Association Of Eastern America (HAEA) as a “foreign mission,” citing “its recently reported leading role in Chinese Communist Party (CCP)-led influence operations against American officials,” according to the letter. The lawmakers also asked Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate HAEA’s current and former leaders, including New York Democratic Rep. Grace Meng, who was listed as the group’s “deputy chairwoman” before she launched her congressional campaign in 2012.
“A future Democrat Congresswoman opened the door to the CCP with the help of the United Front, the CCP’s overseas influence operations,” Banks, a member of the House Select Committee on the CCP, told the DCNF. “Groups like the Henan Association can’t be allowed to wage political warfare against the U.S. on our soil any longer.” (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Dem Congresswoman Was A Fixture At Events Honoring Chinese Communist Party Officials)
“The State Department must designate the Henan Association as a foreign mission,” the letter reads. “Under the Foreign Missions Act, an organization should be designated by the State Department as a ‘foreign mission’ if the entity is involved in the activities of a foreign government or is ‘substantially owned or effectively controlled’ by a foreign government.”
Federal prosecutors recently indicted Meng’s former congressional campaign director, Linda Sun, and her husband, Chris Hu, for allegedly acting as unregistered agents of China while Sun worked for New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The Wall Street Journal subsequently reported Sun had met the “heads of key groups identifiable in the indictment as being United Front-linked,” naming HAEA and another New York Chinese association.
The so-called “United Front” strategy is a “unique blend of engagement, influence activities, and intelligence operations that the CCP uses to shape its political environment, including to influence other countries’ policy toward the PRC and to gain access to advanced foreign technology,” according to a 2023 report from the House Select Committee on the CCP.
United Front work is conducted “by an extensive and well-documented network of organizations operating in parallel to the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) foreign ministry and intelligence services that seeks to influence universities, think tanks, civic groups, other prominent individuals and institutions, and public opinion broadly,” that House committee’s report states.
“Sun allegedly used the Henan Association as her intermediary in conducting official business with, and receiving direction from, PRC officials,” the lawmakers stated in their letter. “A Henan leader is named as one of the unindicted co-conspirators in Sun’s agent activities.”
The WSJ previously identified HAEA’s president, Zhang Fuyin, as one of Sun’s two alleged co-conspirators. Meng’s longtime congressional staffer Sydney Li, who is HAEA’s deputy chairman, has also interacted with CCP official and Chinese intelligence personnel, the WSJ reported.
The WSJ reported that during a 2019 China trip, Li hand-delivered a letter from Meng to a CCP intel official alongside Zhang, and the DCNF identified four more instances in which Li gave letters on behalf of Meng to either CCP intel or Propaganda Department personnel.
The lawmakers’ letter also asked the State Department to “review all hometown associations similarly tied to United Front activities for potential designation as foreign missions.”
“Outposts of our Chinese enemy should not be allowed in our country, but if they must be here we must require them to register,” Gordon Chang, China expert and author, told the DCNF.
The letter sent Wednesday also presses the DOJ to “investigate all current and former leaders and associates of the Henan Association for potential FARA violations and prosecute any offenders accordingly.”The Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) “requires certain agents of foreign principals who are engaged in political activities or other activities specified under the statute to make periodic public disclosure of their relationship with the foreign principal, as well as activities, receipts and disbursements in support of those activities,” according to the DOJ.
Between 2008 and 2012, HAEA identified Meng as its “deputy chairwoman,” but began listing her as “honorary chairwoman” in February 2012, the month before she launched her congressional campaign, the DCNF reported. Meng’s photo was prominently displayed at the top of HAEA’s homepage for over a decade beside the organization’s chairman and president until the entire website was deleted on Sept. 26, following DCNF reports on her years-long involvement with the group.
The WSJ recently reported Meng denied ever having held any official position with HAEA, claiming she only held an “honorary title,” despite a 2008 video in which she introduced herself as HAEA’s “deputy chairwoman.”

Meng has participated in more than a dozen events alongside HAEA leaders welcoming various CCP delegations to New York, during which she’s toasted CCP intel personnel, awarded congressional commendations to Communist Party leaders and received several gifts, the DCNF reported, with perhaps the most recent instance occurring in March 2024.
These interactions extend back at least as far as 2008, the DCNF found, and include Meng’s participation in a December 2008 welcome banquet in Queens, New York for the chairman of the All-China Federation Of Returned Overseas Chinese (ACFROC), who Meng referred to as “our chairman” and praised for his “leadership,” footage shows.
The DOJ has characterized ACFROC as an “agency” of a Chinese intelligence service called the United Front Work Department (UFWD).

The DOJ also alleges that ACFROC hired Meng’s former campaign director, Sun, as its “committee member” in September 2019.
Multiple HAEA leaders, including its president, Zhang, as well as the organization’s chairman are ACFROC members, the DCNF discovered.
“The Biden-Harris DOJ must force foreign influence groups to register to FARA, and groups like the Henan Association should be classified as foreign missions of China,” Banks told the DCNF.
Meng and HAEA did not respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

The Daily Caller,Virginia Asks Supreme Court To Let It Remove Noncitizens From Voter Rolls,"Virginia asked the Supreme Court Monday to block a lower court order to return over a thousand alleged noncitizens to the voter rolls.
Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares vowed to file the emergency appeal Sunday after an appeals court upheld a ruling preventing officials from removing roughly 1,600 individuals who the state says “self-identified” as noncitizens.
“The injunction, which prohibits the application of a law that has been on the books since the Justice Department precleared it in 2006, will also irreparably injure Virginia’s sovereignty, confuse her voters, overload her election machinery and administrators, and likely lead noncitizens to think they are permitted to vote, a criminal offence that will cancel the franchise of eligible voters,” the state argued in its petition.
U.S. District Court Judge Patricia Giles, a Biden appointee, issued an order Friday blocking Virginia’s efforts to remove noncitizen voters within 90 days of the election. (RELATED: Biden-Appointed Judge Blocks Virginia Effort To Remove Non-Citizens From Voter Rolls)
The Department of Justice (DOJ) sued Virginia Oct. 12 over Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s executive order to more frequently remove noncitizens.
🚨 BREAKING: Last night, Virginia filed an emergency stay in the US Supreme Court.
Americans citizens — and no one else — should determine American elections.

“The Department of Justice pulled this shameful, politically motivated stunt 25 days before Election Day, challenging a Virginia process signed into law 18 years ago by a Democrat governor and approved by the Department of Justice in 2006,” Miyares said in a statement Friday.
“More concerning is the open practice by the Biden-Harris administration to weaponize the legal system against the enemies of so-called progress,” Miyares said. “That is the definition of lawfare. To openly choose weaponization over good process and lawfare over integrity isn’t democracy: it’s bullying, pure and simple, and I always stand up to bullies.”
A federal judge blocked Alabama’s efforts to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls earlier in October.

The Daily Caller,"‘You Don’t Need To Interrupt’: Sparks Fly Between Scott Jennings And WaPo Columnist Over Trump, IVF","Republican strategist Scott Jennings clashed with Washington Post columnist Catherine Rampell Monday night over former President Donald Trump’s support of in-vitro fertilization (IVF).
Trump vowed to make IVF free if elected during an August campaign event in Michigan. Rampell expressed skepticism about Trump’s position while on a panel during “CNN News Night.” (RELATED: ‘I’ll Have To Speak Up’: Scott Jennings, David Axelrod Get Into Verbal Brawl Over State Abortion Law)
“Donald Trump’s not running for state representative in any particular state. He is running for president, and he’s made his position on this very clear,” Jennings said. “He’s got a very moderate, center-right, long-standing Republican position that goes back to Reagan. He’s pro-life, he believes in some moderate limits on weeks. He believes in the three exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother. He has been a champion, a champion for IVF.”
WATCH:
“He has not. I’m sorry, I need to interrupt —” Rampell said before Jennings interjected. “He absolutely has. You don’t need to interrupt because you‘re wrong. He has been a champion in the party for speaking for IVF.”
Trump called for IVF to be protected after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled on Feb. 16 that frozen embryos resulting from successful IVF procedures would be viewed as unborn children during a case involving three families suing a medical facility that destroyed the embryos. The Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal by the medical facility on Oct. 7.
“People watching, I wrote about this like two weeks ago, you can look at —” Rampell said, as Jennings interrupted, saying, “I listen to what he says all the time. He has —”
“I look at his record. I look at his record,” Rampell responded as someone else tried to cut in, later adding, “Look at his actual record. For example, his recent statement saying, ‘Oh, we‘re going to make insurers cover IVF,’ you know that he led the initiative to repeal ObamaCare, which got rid of all essential health benefits, all requirements for insurers to cover any sort of health care. That would include IVF.”
Rampell cited legislation proposed by Democrats to protect IVF, which Jennings dismissed as a “sham vote.”
Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina also introduced legislation to protect access to IVF and other fertility treatments shortly after the Alabama Supreme Court’s ruling.

The Daily Caller,Joe Rogan Speculates ‘The Government Was Involved’ In JFK Assassination Following Trump Interview,"Podcaster Joe Rogan speculated the United States government was involved in the assassination of former President John F. Kennedy Saturday in a brief discussion on his podcast following his interview with former President Donald Trump.
Trump promised to declassify the remaining files during his Friday interview with the top-rated podcaster, repeating a vow made during a May 2023 interview with The Messenger. Rogan said that Trump’s explanation that some of those named in the files were still alive pointed to potential government participation in the Kennedy assassination. (RELATED: Tucker Carlson Reveals Why He Thinks The Biden Admin Won’t Release JFK Assassination Docs)
“I said okay so that’s why you wouldn’t release it because some of the people that are going to be implicated are still alive so what that’s saying to me is that the government was involved,” Rogan said.
At the start of his post-interview discussion, Rogan said he was looking forward to the release of the files.
“I don’t want to get involved in a podcast where there’s a lot of shit I want to get to,” Rogan said. “I want to know what the fuck is in the JFK files.”
During the Friday interview, Trump named former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as one of those who counseled him against fully releasing all the documents at the time.
“I opened them up partially. I was met with — from good people, I mean, you know, look at me, good people, people that were well-meaning, Mike Pompeo was one of them, he’s a good person. Uh, they called me they said ‘Sir, would rather, have you not.’ After — and I did open them, but I was asked by some people not to open them,” Trump told Rogan during the Friday interview.
WATCH:
“There’s a Martin Luther King file too by the way that they’d like to see, I don’t know if you know but there is that, but JFK in particular,” Trump continued. “So they call me, a lot of good people call me, people that I, you know, that you would find reasonable people and they asked me not to do it so I said, well, we’ll close it for another time. But if I win, I’m going to open them up.”
Trump declassified over 2,800 documents in 2017 relating to the Nov. 22, 1963, assassination. President Joe Biden released additional documents in 2021 and 2022, but critics accused Biden of not being fully transparent.
Trump explained that one of the reasons that he had been asked to not completely open the files was due to the effects it might have on people who were still alive.
“Living people that formerly worked for the government?” Rogan asked.
“For the government and living people who were somehow involved,” Trump responded.
The National Archives released additional documents on June 30, 2023.
“Why didn’t you open it up the first time?” Rogan asked earlier. “What was the hesitation?”
“Addresses, people that are still living, there are people that are affected, um and there could be some national security reason that for you know that I don’t have to necessarily know about, but some very good talented people asked me not to do it,” Trump explained. “I opened it up and then they said would it be possible for us to do that a different day?” (RELATED: Who Shot JFK? Left-Wing Actor Vows To ‘Name Names’ In New Podcast)
Trump said he would not hesitate to declassify the documents if returned to office in the Nov. 5 general election.
“It’s a cleansing, you know, it’s really a cleansing, so I’m going to do it,” Trump told Rogan. “I’m going to do it immediately, almost immediately, upon entering office.”

The Daily Caller,Biden-Harris Admin Make Yet Another Attempt At Student Loan Cancelation As Election Nears,"The Biden-Harris administration proposed rules for a new student loan cancelation program Friday that could forgive the debt of up to 8 million borrowers facing “financial hardship.”
Americans facing medical debt, high childcare costs and low income could qualify under the new parameters, according to the Department of Education (DOE). The Biden administration’s previous attempts at student debt cancelation programs have all been stalled after facing constitutional concerns.
“For far too long, our broken student loan system has made it too hard for borrowers experiencing heartbreaking and financially devastating hardships to access relief, and it’s not right,” Miguel Cardona, U.S. Secretary of Education, said in a press release. “The rules proposed by the Biden-Harris Administration today would provide hope to millions of struggling Americans whose challenges may make them eligible for student debt relief. President Biden, Vice President Harris, and I will not stop fighting to deliver student debt relief and create a fairer, more just, and more affordable student loan system for all borrowers.”
The program would allow for two separate pathways to debt cancelation, the first would give Secretary Cardona the authority to relieve a borrower’s debt without them submitting an application if the education department determines there to be an 80% chance of the borrower defaulting within two years. The second pathway requires the borrower to submit an application after which the department can “holistically assess whether a borrower is highly likely to be in default or experience similarly severe negative and persistent circumstances” from paying off the loans.
The Education Department would then be permitted to waive some or all of the borrower’s debt if it determines there to be “persistent financial burdens” affecting the borrower.
Biden’s previous attempts at canceling student debt have all fallen flat, with the Supreme Court shooting down one program in 2023 after it was determined the education secretary lacked the authority. A later version that would have cut payments and interest rates based on a borrower’s income level has been halted by a Missouri court over similar constitutionality concerns.

The Daily Caller,Supreme Court Allows Virginia To Remove Noncitizens From Voter Rolls,"The Supreme Court allowed Virginia on Wednesday to remove individuals identified as noncitizens from the voter rolls.
The justices paused a lower court order preventing officials from removing around 1,600 individuals who the state said “self-identified” as noncitizens.
Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Ketanji Brown Jackson and Elena Kagan would not have granted Virginia’s request, according to the order.
BREAKING: The Supreme Court allows Virginia to remove individuals identified as noncitizens from the voter rolls. pic.twitter.com/OKlMKqdTJl
— Katelynn Richardson (@katesrichardson) October 30, 2024
U.S. District Court Judge Patricia Giles, a Biden appointee, ruled Friday that Virginia must stop its efforts to remove noncitizen voters within 90 days of the election and restore registered voters removed under the program. When an appeals court upheld the decision on Sunday, the state quickly filed an emergency application with the Supreme Court. (RELATED: Election Litigation Could Shape The Race In Battleground States. We Won’t Know Until The Votes Are Cast.)
“The injunction, which prohibits the application of a law that has been on the books since the Justice Department precleared it in 2006, will also irreparably injure Virginia’s sovereignty, confuse her voters, overload her election machinery and administrators, and likely lead noncitizens to think they are permitted to vote, a criminal offence that will cancel the franchise of eligible voters,” the state argued in the emergency application filed Sunday.
We are pleased by the Supreme Court’s order today. This is a victory for commonsense and election fairness. I am grateful for the work of Attorney General @JasonMiyaresVA on this critical fight to protect the fundamental rights of U.S. citizens. Clean voter rolls are one…
— Glenn Youngkin (@GlennYoungkin) October 30, 2024
Republican Virginia Gov. Genn Youngkin wrote on X that the order is “a victory for commonsense and election fairness.”
“Clean voter rolls are one important part of a comprehensive approach we are taking to ensure the fairness of our elections,” he wrote.
The Department of Justice (DOJ) initially sued Virginia on Oct. 12, alleging the state violated the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) by making changes to the voter rolls within 90 days of the election when the “risk of disfranchising eligible voters is greatest.” Youngkin signed an executive order in August requiring election officials to expedite the removal of ineligible noncitizen voters from the voter rolls.

The Daily Caller,Kari Lake Receives Good News In Her Bid To Add GOP Seat To Senate: POLL,"A Tuesday Data Orbital poll showed Arizona Senate Republican candidate Kari Lake pulling ahead of Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, breaking with recent data showing Lake trailing by a significant margin.
The Data Orbital survey, which consisted of responses from 550 likely voters and had a margin of error of 4.26%, found Lake receiving 45.2% support while Gallego received 44.5%, potentially representing a huge shift in the swing state race that has seen the Democratic candidate maintain a steady lead. However, the poll result could also be an outlier, with a Tuesday CNN survey of 781 likely voters finding Lake trailing by roughly 8%, and RealClear Polling (RCP) showing Gallego leading by 4% on average. (RELATED: Ted Cruz Pulls In Front Of Dem Challenger In Competitive Senate Race: POLL)
Lake has consistently underperformed former President Donald Trump, with Trump leading Vice President Kamala Harris by an average of 2.5% in the Grand Canyon State, according to RCP. The Democrats have spent $88.2 million on advertising for the Senate race since Labor Day, compared to just $29.7 million for Republicans, Politico reported on Oct. 18.

LAKE: “ I’m not working together with you, I’m going to beat you.” pic.twitter.com/wMbC7iGF4O
— Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) October 6, 2023
Lake’s platform emphasizes border security, fresh water access, energy independence and reducing inflation, among a variety of other policy initiatives.
Immigration has been a hot-button issue in the Arizona senate rate, with Gallego adopting a more centrist stance on the matter since his campaign began. In August 2023, the Democratic congressman voiced support for Title 42, a Trump-era public health order that expelled certain migrants, marking a major shift from 2015 when he introduced legislation that would eliminate the term “illegal alien” from federal law.
The Democratic congressman has tried to distance himself from the Biden-Harris administration on the immigration issue, remarking in August that the White House hasn’t done enough in support of border security.
“I think there’s a lot of Democrats that don’t understand you can be for border security and for immigration reform,” Gallego told Axios.
Another key issue in the Arizona senate race has been abortion, particularly after the Arizona Supreme Court on April 9 permitted an 1864 law to be enforced that effectively banned abortion except when the life of the mother is in danger. When Gallego stated that Lake was “incredibly thrilled” to ban abortion, Lake responded by noting the Democratic congressman had left his wife when she was nine months pregnant.
A report released by the Washington Free Beacon on Oct. 17 found that Gallego not only filed for divorce from his wife when she was “likely to give birth any day,” but also wanted her to pay his attorney’s fees.
“The momentum is with President Trump and Kari Lake, and with record Republican early voting numbers, we are confident that Arizonans will deliver both Trump and Lake a victory one week from today on November 5th,” a Lake spokesperson told the DCNF.
The Gallego campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Daily Caller,House Panel To Refer Andrew Cuomo Be Prosecuted Over Report On COVID-19 Nursing Home Deaths,"A House subcommittee is set to refer former Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo to the Justice Department for potential prosecution over allegations that he lied to Congress about his role in shaping a New York state COVID-19 report on nursing home deaths, The New York Times reported Wednesday.
The move, set to be finalized on Thursday, represents a sharp rebuke from the Republican-led House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic, which claims Cuomo engaged in a “conscious, calculated effort” to avoid accountability for thousands of nursing home deaths that occurred during the pandemic, according to NYT. The referral letter was signed solely by Subcommittee Chairman Ohio Republican Rep. Brad Wenstrup, with the ranking Democrat Rep. Raul Ruiz of California declining to endorse it.
The subcommittee’s referral focuses on Cuomo’s closed-door testimony, where he reportedly denied reviewing a state health department report that redirected blame from his administration for nursing home fatalities, NYT reported. However, NYT recently revealed that Cuomo not only reviewed the report but also contributed to early drafts, and this new evidence, drawn from congressional records and emails, adds to the scrutiny of Cuomo’s pandemic management.

— Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) October 30, 2024
Cuomo’s legal team sent its own letter to the Justice Department on Wednesday night, alleging that the subcommittee misused government resources and accusing Wenstrup and others of political bias. The letter, drafted by Cuomo’s attorney Sarah A. Sulkowski, criticizes the subcommittee for conducting a partisan investigation, allegedly in coordination with Fox News personality Janice Dean, whose husband was involved in a dismissed lawsuit against Cuomo.
Cuomo’s handling of the pandemic has been marred in controversy, with his early daily briefings garnering widespread praise, but his policies, particularly around nursing home deaths, coming under fire, NYT stated. This includes the March 2020 order requiring nursing homes to readmit COVID-19-positive patients and the ethics board’s order for Cuomo to return a $5 million advance from his memoir, which the former governor has contested in court.
Cuomo testified before Congress on June 11 regarding his 2020 directive. The testimony also addressed allegations that his administration intentionally underreported COVID-19 nursing home deaths by altering classification methods, as first reported by Daily Caller News Foundation in May 2020 following an investigation.
The former governor’s directive led to the deaths of over 4,000 residents, according to the state attorney general’s report in 2021. Attorney General Letitia James reported that some of these deaths occurred in facilities with no prior COVID-19 cases before the order took effect. (RELATED: Andrew Cuomo Says Trump Civil Fraud Case ‘Should Have Never Been Brought’)
This latest controversy emerges as Cuomo eyes a potential return to politics, with speculation swirling around his interest in running for New York City mayor next year. New York City Mayor Eric Adams is embroiled in his own scandal as he faces federal bribery charges.

The Daily Caller,‘The Million Dollar Question’: CNN’s Harry Enten Says He Can’t Tell Who ‘Lower Turnout’ Helps In Election,"CNN Senior Data Reporter Harry Enten admitted Monday that he could not figure out which candidate would benefit from “lower turnout” in the 2024 election.
Former President Donald Trump leads Vice President Kamala Harris by 0.1% in the RealClearPolling average of polls from Oct. 11 – 26, and maintains that margin when Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein, independent candidate Cornel West and Libertarian candidate Chase Oliver are included in surveys. Enten noted that the number of Americans certain to vote was down from 2020. (RELATED: MSNBC Guest Claims Kamala Harris Running ‘One Of The Most Perfectly Executed Campaigns’ In American History)
WATCH:
“Remember 2020 had record turnout. Feelings towards voting, certain to vote, back in 2020 at this point, 88% of registered voters said they were certain about where are we today? It’s just at 81%, John, it’s a seven-point drop,” Enten told “CNN News Central” host John Berman. “But that’s not the only polling metric in which I‘m looking at. How about extremely motivated to vote at this point in 2020, it was 73%. You look now, it’s just 65% again, a high single digit drop, eight points in this particular case, but it’s not just the polling, right.”
In a CNN poll conducted Oct. 22-23, Trump and Harris are tied at 47% each, a situation that persists with West, Stein and Oliver as options. Berman asked Enten who would be hurt more if turnout dropped.
“This is the million-dollar question and the million-dollar answer is one that probably satisfies neither side. Harris versus Trump margin, lower turnout may not benefit either side,” Enten said. “You know, if you look at the broad universe of registered voters you see Harris up by a point well within the margin of error nationally, if you look at likely voters, it’s still Harris by a point.” (Watch The Daily Caller Documentary “Cleaning Up Kamala”)
Harris and her running mate, Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, have escalated attacks on former President Donald Trump, labeling him a “fascist” during a CNN town hall and Walz compared Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden to a 1939 rally by the Nazi-sympathetic German-American Bund.

The Daily Caller,Trump Slated For Joe Rogan Podcast Appearance,"Former President Donald Trump is scheduled to appear on popular podcast host Joe Rogan’s “The Joe Rogan Experience” on Friday, a source familiar with the former president’s schedule confirmed to the Daily Caller News Foundation.
Rogan will interview Trump at his studio in Austin, Texas, Politico first reported on Tuesday, citing an individual granted anonymity to discuss the situation. The podcast host has never had Trump on his show and previously said in 2022 that he wasn’t “interested in helping him” by offering him a platform.

Spotify previously broadcast Rogan’s podcast exclusively, but episodes are now released on YouTube as well, based on his February $250 million Spotify deal, The Wall Street Journal reported. He has over 17 million YouTube subscribers and over 14 million followers on Spotify.
Vice President Kamala Harris is also discussing an appearance on “The Joe Rogan Experience” to target male voters, Reuters reported on Oct. 15. There was no appearance officially scheduled at the time, two sources familiar with the situation told the outlet.
Rogan also said in 2023 that he would vote for Trump over President Joe Biden.
Trump has a 51% to 40% advantage among male voters, while Harris holds a 53% to 38% advantage among women voters, according to a recent New York Times/Siena College poll. The former president currently leads Harris in all seven top swing states, according to the RealClearPolling averages.
Journalist Mark Halperin asserted Tuesday that Trump will secure victory on Nov. 5 if the current early voting trajectory holds.

The Daily Caller,Joe Rogan Says Harris Campaign Blew ‘Opportunity’ For Podcast ‘When She Was In Texas’,"Popular podcast host Joe Rogan said on Wednesday that Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign missed a chance to record an episode of “The Joe Rogan Experience” while she was in Texas, where his studio is located.
Rogan posted on X Tuesday that the Harris campaign wanted him to “travel to her” for an interview, but that he deeply believes it would be optimal for the vice president to appear in his Austin studio. Rogan said on a Wednesday episode of “The Joe Rogan Experience” that he extended an “open invitation” to the Harris campaign during her visit to Texas for a rally on Friday, but that she did not take him up on it. (RELATED: Psaki Weighs In On Joe Rogan, Says Tech Platforms Need To Be ‘Doing More’ To Curb ‘Misinformation’)
WATCH:
“She had an opportunity to come … You could look at this and you could say, ‘Oh, you’re being a diva,’ but she had an opportunity to come here when she was in Texas. And I literally gave them an open invitation,” Rogan said. “I said, ‘Anytime.’ I said, ‘If she’s done at 10:00, we’ll come back here at 10:00.’ I go, ‘I’ll do it at 9:00 in the morning, I’ll do it at 10:00 p.m., I’ll do it at midnight if she’s up, she wants to, you know, drink a Red Bull and fuckin’ party on.'”
Former President Donald Trump appeared on the podcast Friday, recording a three-hour episode that has over 40 million views on YouTube as of Wednesday.
“She actually reached out when she found out that he was coming on, so their camp reached out to me. So I said, ‘Great, I would love to talk to her.’ But it was very difficult to tie it down … If I go somewhere, then there’s going to be other people in the room, and they want to control a lot of things, I’m sure, according to the Bret Baier interview on Fox, like, people were waving him off,” he added. “That’s a distraction.”
“Like, my whole goal with her and with him is just talk. Just sit, have a conversation like a human being,” Rogan said. “You find out things about people, you get a sense of them, at least, a real sense. That was it. I don’t give a fuck what we talk about. I really don’t. I just want to talk to you. Who the fuck are you?”
The Harris campaign had previously considered doing an appearance on “The Joe Rogan Experience” to target male voters that she has been struggling with, Reuters reported on Oct. 15. Trump has an 11-point lead over Harris among male voters, while the vice president holds a 15-point advantage over the former president with female voters, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll released in early October.
Harris and Trump are currently locked in a tight race across the top seven swing states, with the former president slightly ahead in five, according to the RealClearPolling averages.

The Daily Caller,‘You’ve Lied To Us’: Chris Sununu Blasts Kamala Harris For ‘Absolutely Condescending’ Campaign,"Republican Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire accused Vice President Kamala Harris of lying to the American people for three and a half years about the economy as part of an “absolutely condescending” campaign Tuesday.
The Biden-Harris administration has been heavily criticized for sky-high inflation that has led prices to rise by over 20%, with the consumer price index (CPI) reaching a recent high of 9% in June 2022. Sununu said to host Kate Bolduan on “CNN News Central” that Harris’ “condescending” campaign was pushing voters to former President Donald Trump. (RELATED: ‘She Should’ve Been There’: CNN Guest Says Kamala Harris ‘Blew It’ By Skipping Al Smith Dinner)
“People are tired of wokeism. They’re tired of being told that Biden and ‘Bidenomics’ work,” Sununu said. “They’re tired of these lies out of Washington that in these ads and all this talk that basically says, hey, your lived experience isn’t real, don’t worry, you haven’t trouble paying the bills? No, no, we told you ‘Bidenomics’ worked for you.”
WATCH:
“It’s absolutely condescending for the Harris campaign to keep pushing that kind of message. And that’s exactly why you’re seeing those independents that you guys were just talking about. That’s why you’re seeing that swing,” Sununu continued. “It’s not, but just you’re too liberal, it’s that you‘ve lied to us for three-and-a-half years, you’ve gaslighted us telling us that our lived experiences aren’t real.”
Biden’s approval rating on the economy was only 39.8% in the RealClearPolling average, while only 36% gave him good marks on inflation and only 34.8% approved of his handling of immigration, all of which have been issues emphasized by former President Donald Trump in the campaign.
“So again, with all due respect to those two, they clearly have some personality issues with the former president. Don’t blame them for that,” Sununu said regarding former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. “A lot of people do, get in line, take a ticket on that one. But at the end of the day, I think this is where the election is going to go in the next two weeks.”
Trump trails Harris by 1.1% in the RealClearPolling average of polls from Oct. 8 to 22, with the gap decreasing to 1.0% when Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein, independent candidate Cornel West and Libertarian candidate Chase Oliver are included in surveys.

The Daily Caller,‘Something Has To Be Done’: Trump Pledges Compensation Fund For Victims Of Migrant Crime,"Former President Donald Trump unveiled a new proposal on Tuesday, pledging to establish a “compensation fund” for victims of migrant crime in the United States.
Speaking to the public during a press conference at Mar-a-Largo, Trump highlighted the growing threat of Tren de Aragua and other international crime syndicates being imported into the U.S. through mass illegal immigration. The Republican candidate pledged to dismantle these migrant gangs and use their seized assets to create a compensation fund for the victims of their crimes. (RELATED: NYPD Refused Detainer Request And Released Illegal Migrant Charged With Attempted Murder, ICE Says)
“Today, I’m announcing that for the first time, under my administration, we will be seizing the assets of the criminal gangs and drug cartels, and we will use those assets to create a compensation fund to provide restitution for the victims of migrant crime,” Trump said. “And the government will help in the restitution.”
“But something has to be done, and we’re going to get it done,” he continued.

The campaign pledge came as the presidential election reaches its final days, and border security has remained a top issue for voters.
There were roughly 8.5 million migrant encounters along the U.S.-Mexico border during the four fiscal years of the Biden-Harris White House, according to the latest data from Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The number of illegal border crossings in fiscal year 2024 were the second worst in U.S. history — only surpassed by fiscal year 2023.
The wave of illegal immigration has been followed by growing reports of criminal activity by Tren de Aragua, an international gang that originated in Venezuela. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) suspects that roughly 600 individuals in the U.S. could have potential ties to the Venezuelan gang, but experts predict that number is likely much higher.
The murders of Jocelyn Nungaray, Rachel Morin and Laken Riley are high-profile examples of numerous victims, allegedly at the hands of illegal migrants, in recent times. Their cases have not only kept border security on the forefront of public debate, but have spawned new laws or legislative proposals across the country.
Trump, who has long championed immigration enforcement, has continued to make the issue a hallmark of his campaign.
[Vice President Kamala Harris’] borders are the worst in the history of the world,” Trump said at his Tuesday press conference. “There’s never been a border in the world like this.”
“It’s at a level that we’ve never seen before,” he continued. “If you look at Venezuela, their crime is way, way down, and you go to Caracas and you wouldn’t recognize it … because they are taking all their criminals — they’re all coming — they’ve taken their drug dealers and put them into the United States.”

The Daily Caller,New Poll Spells Major Trouble For Harris With Unlikely Demographic,"Former President Donald Trump is maintaining a small lead over Vice President Kamala Harris among an unlikely demographic as her campaign reportedly worries about her chances in key swing states, according to a new Arab News/YouGov poll obtained by Semafor.
In a new Arab News/YouGov poll, 45% of Arab American voters said they are more likely to vote for Trump, compared to 43% who said they will likely vote for Harris. More Arab Americans, 39%, think Trump will “successfully resolve the Israel-Palestine conflict,” compared to Harris who has 33% of the community’s support on this question, the poll shows. Two weeks before the election, the Harris campaign is worried about the vice president’s chances in the “blue wall,” such as Michigan, where the Muslim community is prominent, three sources with knowledge of the campaign’s strategy told NBC News. (Stream Daily Caller’s latest documentary ‘Cleaning Up Kamala’ HERE)
“There has been a thought that maybe Michigan or Wisconsin will fall off,” a senior Harris campaign official told NBC News, emphasizing that there are real concerns over her path to victory if Michigan goes for Trump while Wisconsin and Pennsylvania stay blue.
Of likely Arab American voters, 4% of respondents said they would cast their vote for third-party candidate Jill Stein and 6% said they were still undecided, according to the poll.

Muslim Americans in Michigan are making an effort to flip the state for Trump in protest of the Biden-Harris administration’s Middle East policy. One activist organization, Drive for 75, has calculated that if 75% of its community can turn out to the polls then the vice president has a 99.9% chance of losing, Rex Nazarko, who is heading up the effort, previously told the Daily Caller. (RELATED: ‘We’re Desperate’: Socialists, Muslims Band Together To Deny Harris The White House)
“What was a guarantee for [a Harris loss] to happen? We tried with different percentages and different turnouts, and with the 75% number, again, accounting only for the Muslim community, not other communities, not other allies, not other progressives. It essentially guaranteed a 99.9% likelihood of the vice president losing the election in Michigan, if 75% of [the community turned out],” Nazarko told the Caller, explaining that they ran numerous mathematical simulations to inform their strategy.
“We ran that simulation 10,000 times, and almost every time that was the case. So that’s how we got the Drive for 75 call to action and idea,” he explained.
As a part of the effort to flip the state, Muslim activist organizations are pushing their community to vote for Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein, or even Trump, they told the Daily Caller. Abandon Harris, one of those groups trying to spoil Harris’ election chances, threw its support behind Stein, who also has the backing of some socialist groups in the U.S. due to her anti-capitalist economic positioning.
“We need to be clear about what our goals are, we are not in a position to win the White House. But we do have a real opportunity to win something historic. We could deny Kamala Harris the state of Michigan,” Kshama Sawant, a former Seattle City Council Member and self-described socialist, said to cheers at a recent rally for Stein.
A Harris campaign spokesperson denied NBC News’ report that there were concerns over their ability to win Michigan.
“We absolutely are competing to win Michigan,” Harris campaign spokeswoman Lauren Hitt told NBC News, pointing to the vice president’s recent stops in the state. “We think we will win Michigan.”
The vice president has recently campaigned across key swing states including Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin alongside former Republican Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney.
Alongside Cheney, her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney previously endorsed Harris, though the endorsement might not have the positive effect the campaign is hoping to have, one Michigander told the Caller.
“Here’s the new thing going around, people are saying that, ‘hello, she’s been endorsed by Dick Cheney.’ That tells you everything you need to know about this woman: that her intentions are war,” Vice chair of the 12th Congressional District Republican Committee Stephanie Butler, who is married to a Muslim, told the Caller.

Trump took to TruthSocial Monday to give a message to Arab and Muslim American voters ahead of the election on Harris’ Middle East policy.
“Arab Voters are very upset that Comrade Kamala Harris, the Worst Vice President in the History of the United States and a Low IQ individual, is campaigning with ‘dumb as a rock’ War Hawk, Liz Cheney, who, like her father, the man that pushed Bush to ridiculously go to War in the Middle East, also wants to go to War with every Muslim Country known to mankind,” Trump wrote.
“If Kamala gets four more years, the Middle East will spend the next four decades going up in flames, and your kids will be going off to war, maybe even a Third World War, something that will never happen with President Donald J. Trump in charge. For our country’s sake, and for your kids, Vote Trump for PEACE!” the former president wrote.",2024-10-22
The Daily Caller,Megyn Kelly Reveals Her ‘Single Issue’ To Bill Maher,"Former Fox News host Megyn Kelly told HBO host Bill Maher Friday night that child sex changes were almost her “single issue” in the presidential election.
Polling shows that a majority of voters favor banning sex change procedures for children. Kelly said children undergoing sex-change procedures was “the issue of our time” during her appearance on “Real Time With Bill Maher.” (RELATED: ‘Not Enough Evidence’: President Of Medical Society Explains Why He Won’t Do Sex Change Procedures On Kids)
WATCH:
“Almost equally important, maybe as important, is what we are doing to our children with this trans insanity,” Kelly, who revealed in a September 2021 interview that she pulled her sons from a school where they were asked weekly about whether they were sure they were boys, told Maher. “I mean, this is almost my single issue. We are chopping off the healthy body parts of young children.”
When an audience member reacted to Kelly’s comments, she responded, “100% we are doing that.”
“Well, we are definitely doing that,” Maher noted.
The United Kingdom banned the use of puberty blockers in July, as European countries are backing away from immediately pushing children into so-called “gender-affirming care.” Kelly said that doctors often carried out child sex changes “without any inquisition” before warning the audience she was about to “deliver a truth bomb.”
“Kids who are suffering from bullying, or who have been sexually assaulted, or who are going through normal puberty and feel uncomfortable in their bodies will say to their parents, I’m not sure, maybe I am gender confused,” Kelly explained. “They will send them in to a psychiatrist or psychologist who are told by our organizations, the American Psychiatry Association and all the others that run their licensing, you must affirm, affirm is the only standard. And so the child gets told, you’re right, you’re secretly a boy or vice-versa, and the child gets put on puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones, which sterilize the child … We’re talking about nine, ten, eleven year olds, who cannot give informed consent.”
“It’s the issue of our time, with respect to children and women’s rights,” Kelly added later, with Maher conceding, “We’re the only country that still does it this way.”
Kelly told Maher that other countries previously used the same “gender-affirming” approach currently used in the United States, but “then they realized there’s no evidence it helps, and there’s a lot of evidence it hurts, then they stopped.” (Watch The Daily Caller Documentary “Do No Harm”)
Maher also referenced Dr. Johanna Olson-Kennedy, who revealed to the New York Times Wednesday that she did she did not publish the results of a $9.7 million taxpayer-funded study on the effects of puberty blockers on children because she feared the results would boost arguments made by opponents of sex-change procedures for children.

The Daily Caller,‘It’s Horrible’: Undecided Pennsylvania Voter Panel Unanimously Opposes Harris Calling Trump ‘Fascist’,"A focus group of eight undecided Pennsylvania voters on Thursday unanimously expressed disapproval of Vice President Kamala Harris referring to former President Donald Trump “as a fascist.”
Harris said during a CNN town hall Wednesday that she thinks Trump is “a fascist” in light of former White House chief of staff John Kelly telling The New York Times and The Atlantic that the former president exhibited “fascist” tendencies and allegedly praised Adolf Hitler. Three of the voters, featured on journalist Mark Halperin’s 2WAY platform, commented that Harris’ remarks were off-putting or unlikely to help her win the November election, while none of the eight raised their hands when Halperin asked if the vice president should be campaigning on this issue. (RELATED: Biden Campaigns On Trump Being A Threat To Democracy, But Voters May Not Be Buying It: POLL)
WATCH:
“In the last few days, the vice president has started to talk about Donald Trump as a fascist, as someone who’s spoken approvingly of Hitler. Raise your hand if you’ve heard about those comments,” Halperin directed, with all eight confirming they had. “Okay. What do folks think, is that something that’s persuasive to you, is that something that you’ll factor into your vote?”
“To me, it’s horrible that she’s saying that about him. If he was saying that about her, everybody would be up in arms,” a voter named Linda Wright answered. “I just don’t think that’s right.”
Halperin asked for more voter input, specifying that Harris was espousing the rhetoric “based on accounts of people who’ve worked with President Trump.”
“She obviously thinks it’s going to help her. I don’t think it does it all,” a voter named Josh Cantor asserted. “I don’t know why, if it was Kelly who heard the president say that, I’m not saying he did or he didn’t, I don’t think he’d lie — I think you said that, Mark, on an episode — but I think that he had a responsibility to resign the day that was said if that’s true. I don’t think that’s the case.”
“I think part of the reason why I’m being pushed towards Trump so strongly is that I find that the Democrats and the left just keep going straight to Hitler all of the time with everything,” a voter named Karsten Chu said. “And if it’s not the left pushing Hitler, it’s the right pushing Stalin so it’s like we’re fighting World War II every single day for every single election so it’s so exhausting. I think it just detracts from — it pushes me away from their position and it, you know, it’s so hyperbolic that it makes it impossible to have good discussions and I think it ruins the discourse.”
Halperin then asked voters to raise their hands if they believe “it’s valuable” or “important” for Harris to be promoting the allegations against Trump, with not a single participant raising their hand.
The Trump campaign has denied the allegations against him, including Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung telling the NYT that Kelly’s alleged White House recollections are “debunked stories” and asserting the former White House chief of staff had “beclowned” himself.
Harris now slightly trails Trump in each of the seven top battleground states, according to the RealClear Polling averages. Trump is only leading the vice president by .6% in Pennsylvania.

The Daily Caller,ROOKE: Trump’s Greatest Campaign Surrogate Is None Other Than Joe Biden,"Poor Vice President Kamala Harris just wants to win the presidential election, but unfortunately, her commander-in-chief, President Joe Biden, is too busy working to get her opponent elected. At least, that’s what it seems like.
Republicans woke up Wednesday morning thinking, “Hey, that Joe Biden character ain’t half bad!”
On Tuesday night, while Harris was set to give her closing arguments for the 2024 election, she was upstaged by Biden, who simultaneously held a virtual meeting with the organization Voto Latino. During the call, Biden called Trump voters “garbage,” sparking a wildfire of backlash. It wasn’t only conservatives who were angry; Democrat Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro also denounced the rhetoric live on CNN. While the White House has attempted to clean up Biden’s statements with claims of a missing apostrophe, the damage has been done.

Instead of the Democrat lackeys in corporate media being able to fawn all over Harris’ speech, they are left cleaning up Biden’s mess. The late-night shows and media events over the next week should have been about Harris, but Biden stripped that from her. Republicans will do their best to keep this in the news as long as possible to keep the Harris campaign on defense. (ROOKE: Harris Campaign’s 11th Hour Looks Like A Nightmare)

Biden apparently wants to be a bigger part of Harris’ campaign, but her team is blowing him off, according to Axios. “Harris’ campaign keeps responding: ‘We’ll get back to you,'” three people familiar with the situation told the outlet.
Biden didn’t take the Harris shove-off lying down. He decided to do his own thing, like schedule the get-out-the-vote event he attended Saturday in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
The move to create his own campaign schedule might explain how he ended up calling Trump supporters “garbage” while Harris was giving her closing address in his backyard. This isn’t the first time Biden stole the limelight from the Harris campaign, however.

On Oct. 4, Biden entered the White House briefing room for the first time during his presidency, forcing all corporate media to turn their attention and live broadcasts to Washington, D.C. His impromptu press conference came at the worst time for the Harris campaign. (ROOKE: These Are The Early Results That Will Tell Us The Winner On Election Night)
It just so happened that when Biden walked into the room, Harris was set to speak at an event in Michigan, promoting the end of the longshoreman strike to Michigan union workers. What would have been a slam dunk for the Harris campaign became a nothing burger. Hardly anyone in America knew she was there or connected her with ending the strike.
“We were about to actually go live with Vice President Kamala Harris, who is speaking right now in Detroit, Michigan. And apparently, she is talking about this port strike ending,” CNN host Boris Sanchez lamented on air. “She’s trying to appeal to union workers, and yet you have the President of the United States come out, clearly overshadowing her answering significant questions. Is that a communications mistake? Is the left hand not talking to the right hand in this situation?”
CNN was about to take Kamala Harris LIVE when all of a sudden Joe Biden simultaneously takes the podium from the White House:

It happened again a few days later when Harris was scheduled to appear live on The View. As Harris sat down with the host, Biden held another press conference. Commentary Magazine editor and New York Post columnist John Podhoretz mused that it’s almost like Biden might be mad at her for taking his spot in the presidential race.
“What is going on between Biden and Harris? He has a press conference at the same moment she’s on The View. Her campaign is complaining about DeSantis and he’s praising DeSantis,” Podhoretz said. “Why, it’s almost like she staged a coup against him and he is working against her from the sidelines!”

But don’t worry. While it may seem like Biden is secretly working for the Trump campaign to ruin all of Harris’ speaking events and make Democrats look unhinged, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates wants everyone to know Biden and Harris are great friends who talk all the time and coordinate on everything campaign-related. (ROOKE: Epstein World Goes All In For Kamala Harris)
‘We are in close touch with the campaign to determine when, where and how the president can be helpful,” Bates told Axios.
Maybe Bates should have a little talk with the Harris campaign because, according to Axios’ sources, her team finds Biden to be a “political liability” and wants nothing to do with him.

The Daily Caller,Democrat PAC Publishes Internal Trump Campaign Emails Leaked By Iranian Hacking Group,"A Democratic Political Action Committee (PAC) published internal Trump campaign emails after an Iranian hacking group reportedly leaked them, Reuters reported on Friday.
The hackers recently started trying to pass off the emails to various media outlets, who were uninterested in publishing the material, according to Reuters. But the hackers finally found one willing individual in recent weeks: Democrat political operative David Wheeler, who posted the emails to the website of his PAC, American Muckrakers. (RELATED: UK Socialist Leader Insists He’s Still Good Friends With Trump After Party Staffers Plan Trip To Help Harris)
When asked why he published the material, Wheeler told Reuters he wanted to “expose how desperate the Trump campaign is to try to win.” He would not discuss how the material originated Some of the emails include correspondence between campaign operatives leading up to the election.

— Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) September 19, 2024
The Department of Justice (DOJ) charged the supposed Iranian hackers — a group known as Mint Sandstorm —in September for working on behalf of the Islamic regime and using fake identities. The DOJ said the group was made up of three operatives who collectively go by the name “Robert.”
“Robert” was also responsible for leaking intel Trump campaign research documents about Vice Presidential candidate J.D. Vance.
Reuters reached out to “Robert” asking about the DOJ’s allegations. In response, “Robert” asked Reuters, “Do you really expect me to answer?!”
Iran has been involved in various election interference schemes, ranging from cyber warfare attacks to assassination attempts against Trump. Iran has a particular disdain for Trump because he authorized the killing of former top Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in 2020.
There have been two near-successful attempts on Trump’s life in recent months, although the individuals involved in those incidents were not tied to Iran.
Iran has denied that it’s involved in any sort of election interference, with the country’s mission to the United Nations (UN) telling Reuters that such claims were “fundamentally unfounded, and wholly inadmissible.”
For its part, the Trump campaign did not ever specifically comment on the leaked Vance research documents but said in early October that Iran’s cyberwarfare operations were “intended to interfere with the 2024 election and sow chaos throughout our democratic process.”
American Muckrakers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Daily Caller,Harris Faulkner Chides Dem Guest For Spinning When Asked About Kamala Harris Comparing Trump To Hitler,"Fox News host Harris Faulkner called out former Democratic Rep. Patrick Murphy of Pennsylvania Monday when he failed to respond to a question about Vice President Kamala Harris comparing former President Donald Trump to German dictator Adolf Hitler.
Harris has escalated attacks on former President Donald Trump, labeling him a “fascist” during a CNN town hall, while her running mate, Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, compared Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden to a 1939 rally at that venue by the Nazi-sympathetic German-American Bund. Faulkner asked Murphy about the line of attack Harris and Walz were using, but Murphy digressed to discuss a joke about Puerto Rico at Trump’s rally. (RELATED: MSNBC Guest Claims Kamala Harris Running ‘One Of The Most Perfectly Executed Campaigns’ In American History)
“I think Donald Trump in the rally yesterday, again puts out speakers that demean our fellow Americans,” Murphy said during the episode of “The Faulkner Focus.” “I mean, you know, Harris, I served in the military. People in Puerto Rico are American citizens. In fact, the people who lived there per capita have more Medal of Honor recipients that served in the military than from my home state of Pennsylvania and your home state. And so, when you disparage fellow Americans, it’s just wrong. It is absolutely wrong.”
WATCH:
“So, look, I want to give everybody a chance to say what they are thinking. It’s helpful if you’ll answer the question and I really do want to know about the closing argument comparing Trump to Hitler,” Faulkner said, mentioning a reporter’s question to Harris about people comparing Trump’s rally to the Nazi event in a video clip she played before asking Murphy about the vice president’s comments. “Like, now you’ve got a reporter who seems to be playing tee-ball, teeing that up as almost like a softball question now, so she can tee off on it and if I’m wrong about that, please tell me how this is different than just letting her talk about it, because it felt like an entrée to do that.”
Trump has survived three previous assassination attempts. A Secret Service agent thwarted the apparent assassination attempt on Trump by firing shots at Ryan Wesley Routh, who was allegedly lurking near Trump International Golf Club on September 15.
Trump was shot in the right ear while giving a speech at a July 13 campaign rally in Pennsylvania. During his 20216 presidential campaign, a 20-year-old man from the United Kingdom tried to take a police officer’s gun in order to shoot Trump during a June 2016 campaign event in Las Vegas.

The Daily Caller,"NYC Mayor Eric Adams Undermines Harris’s ‘Fascist’ Accusation Against Trump, Makes Call To ‘Dial Down The Temperature’","New York City Mayor Eric Adams differed Saturday with Vice President Kamala Harris’s Wednesday labeling of former President Donald Trump as a fascist.
Adams — together with Deputy Mayor Chauncey Parker, New York City Police Department (NYPD) interim commissioner Tom Donlon and other NYPD leadership — was speaking at a security briefing ahead of former President Trump’s Sunday rally at Madison Square Garden.
Adams, when asked by Politico political reporter Emily Ngo if he believed Trump was fascist, said, “My answer is ‘no.’ I know what Hitler has done, and I know what a fascist regime looks like.”
Adams also claimed some political leaders in New York City had “hurled” the terms “fascist” and “Hitler” at him.
“I think — as I’ve called over and over again — that the level of conversation — I think we could all dial down the temperature,” he continued.
“There’s no agency in the world better prepared to ensure the safety of this event than the NYPD,” Parker added.
In response to critics who demanded Trump not hold the rally, Adams said, “I strongly disagree. This is America, this is New York and I think it’s important that we allow individuals to exercise their right to get their message clear to New Yorkers. And our job as a city and as a police department is to make sure that you do that in a peaceful way.”
“I think that we must be extremely cautious of— the heat we turn up today, pre-election, is going to have to be the heat we’re going to have to govern in,” Adams added.
During a Wednesday presidential town hall event, Harris, when asked by CNN’s Anderson Cooper whether she thought Trump was a fascist, said, “Yes, I do. Yes, I do. And I also believe that the people who know him best on this subject should be trusted.”
Harris was referencing Trump’s former chief of staff, John Kelly, and the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, retired General Mark Milley. (RELATED: Kamala Harris Calls Trump ‘Fascist’ In CNN Town Hall)
Kelley called Trump a fascist during recent interviews with The New York Times. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung fired back, saying Kelly had “beclowned” himself. Trump also responded, labeling Milley a “lowlife,” “a total degenerate” and a “bad general,” CBS News reported.
Thirteen former Trump administration officials have openly backed Kelly’s claim, according to Politico.
Milley called Trump “the most dangerous person to this country” and “a fascist to the core,” according to an upcoming book by Washington Post associate editor Bob Woodward. Milley also feared being court-martialed should Trump become president again, the Guardian reported.
Trump had confirmed in early October that his campaign rented the iconic Madison Square Garden for the major rally. The arena previously hosted a number of key political events in U.S. history, including the 1976, 1980 and 1992 Democratic National Conventions as well as the 2004 Republican National Convention, according to The Associated Press. In 1892, former President Grover Cleveland accepted the Democratic nomination for president during a speech at the venue. Cleveland was ultimately elected as the first president to serve nonconsecutive terms, a distinction Trump hopes to emulate.
Trump and Adams both attended the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in New York City on Oct. 17 to benefit charity. As part of the annual event’s lighthearted proceedings, Trump made several jokes about the absent Harris as well as prominent Democrats seated nearby on the dias, including Adams and indictment over bribery charges.
“You’re peanuts compared to what they’ve done to me.”

The Daily Caller,EXCLUSIVE: Tim Walz Welcomed Chinese Communist Party Officials Into His Nebraska Classroom,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, welcomed Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials into his Nebraska classroom while working as a teacher in the 1990s, a Daily Caller News Foundation investigation found.
In February 1996, a delegation of three “educators” from southeast China visited Walz’s Alliance High School social studies class “to study the education system,” according to an unearthed Alliance Times-Herald article. However, the delegation included CCP officials who at the time worked for an institute serving a Chinese influence and intelligence agency, according to a DCNF review of Chinese government records.
Walz’s longstanding relationship with China has come under increased scrutiny following Vice President Kamala Harris’ August selection of the two-term governor as her running mate. Media reports have since revealed Walz not only misrepresented key details about his China travels, but also appointed a member of a political faction loyal to the CCP to Minnesota’s executive branch.
Neither Walz’s office nor the Harris-Walz campaign responded to multiple requests for comment. (RELATED: Tim Walz Appointed Member Of Political Party ‘Loyal’ To Chinese Communists To State Board)
Republican lawmakers have been demanding answers from federal authorities about the governor’s ties to the communist nation.
Kentucky Rep. James Comer, House Committee on Oversight and Accountability chairman, sent a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray in August requesting information on “any Chinese entity or individual with whom Mr. Walz may have engaged or partnered.”
“Governor Tim Walz’s documented relationships with Chinese Communist Party affiliated entities and officials bears hallmarks of a CCP infiltration and influence campaign,” Comer told the DCNF.
“FBI briefers recently informed the Oversight Committee that the Bureau’s Foreign Influence Task Force investigates CCP subnational influence operations and activity that is similar to how China has engaged with Governor Walz,” Comer said. “The American people deserve to fully understand how deep Governor Walz’s relationship with the CCP goes and the Oversight Committee will continue to press for answers.”
‘Engagement With The CCP’
During a weeks-long tour of U.S. schools, the three members of the Chinese delegation stopped at the rural Nebraska high school where Walz taught social studies, and where he and his wife had been running a program taking students to China.
“Four years ago we had some Alliance High students in China. We’ve had some each year (since),” the designated interpreter, Ning Ziheng, stated during the 1996 visit, Alliance Times-Herald reported.
Identified as being affiliated with Macao Political Institute, Ning Ziheng served as interpreter for Ye Guoqiang and Yi Hongtao, both of whom were members of the Guangzhou Institute of Physical Education, according to the local paper. Located in Guangdong province, the Guangzhou Institute of Physical Education is the “only sports university of higher education in South China,” its archived website states.
While the DCNF found no evidence that Ning Ziheng is a CCP member, the other two had been members of China’s ruling party for decades, according to a DCNF review of Chinese government and academic records.
An archived version of Yi Hongtao’s profile on the Guangzhou Institute of Physical Education website states he joined the CCP in 1976. At the time of the 1996 visit, Yi Hongtao served as the director of the Foreign Affairs Office at Guangzhou Institute of Physical Education and later as a member of the institute’s CCP committee, according to Chinese government records.
A 2021 social media post from the Guangzhou Institute of Physical Education announced that the other delegation member, Ye Guoqiang, had been a CCP member for 56 years — indicating he joined decades before the 1996 Nebraska visit.
Chinese government reports from Guangdong province state Ye Guoqiang served as deputy party secretary in Guangzhou Institute of Physical Education’s CCP committee. Between 1992 and 1997, the institute’s CCP committee published reports authored by Ye Guoqiang, indicating he served as deputy party secretary at the time of the 1996 Nebraska visit.
“Our main purpose is to learn something about education in the states,” said Ning Ziheng of the 1996 trip, according to Alliance Times-Herald. “We will compare it to China and see how we can improve our own education system.”
Alliance High School’s superintendent, Bill Gannon, invited the Chinese delegation to visit the school, Alliance Times-Herald reported. Gannon could not be reached for comment.
“The current school board and administration did not work with Mr. Walz,” Troy Unzicker, superintendent of Alliance Public Schools, told the DCNF by email. “I personally do not know Mr. Walz, so I would be of no help. I am not aware of anyone in the school system that was involved with this.”
During their two days in Alliance, the delegation reportedly first stopped by the Central Elementary School English class of Walz’s wife, Gwen, before visiting Walz’s social studies class. Alliance Times-Herald reported that after visiting Walz’s classroom, the Chinese delegation was slated to watch Alliance High School’s basketball team practice and also had plans to visit local ranches.
“It is interesting to see so much open space. It [America] impresses us a lot,” Ning Ziheng said, according to Alliance Times-Herald. “We think this area is more agricultural. We like this kind of environment.”
Before visiting Nebraska, the delegation toured an unspecified Los Angeles high school, according to Alliance Times-Herald. During a third leg of the trip, the delegation reportedly aimed to visit the University of Northern Iowa.
Ye Guoqiang and Yi Hongtao could not be reached for comment.
‘Grooming, Wooing, And Romancing’
The Guangzhou Institute of Physical Education where the three members of the delegation worked — or had worked previously — is listed as a member unit of a Chinese influence and intelligence service, Chinese government records reveal.
The Guangdong provincial branch of the Chinese People’s Association For Friendship With Foreign Countries (CPAFFC) has repeatedly listed the Guangzhou Institute of Physical Education as a “group member,” including at the time of the 1996 Chinese delegation visit to Nebraska during CPAFFC’s 6th and 7th congresses, which lasted between 1995 and 2005.
Federal authorities characterize CPAFFC as an “affiliate” or “subordinate” of a Chinese influence and intelligence service called the United Front Work Department (UFWD). In 2020, the State Department warned that CPAFFC is a “Beijing-based organization tasked with co-opting subnational governments” that has “sought to directly and malignly influence state and local leaders to promote the PRC’s global agenda.”
Over the years, CPAFFC has held numerous sports events for visiting foreign groups at Guangzhou Institute of Physical Education, and, as recently as 2023, reselected the institute as a member unit.
At the time of the Chinese delegation’s 1996 Nebraska visit, the dean of Guangzhou Institute of Physical Education was a CCP official named Chen Shuhua, who then also served as a Guangdong CPAFFC director, Chinese government records show.
Walz had met Chen Shuhua in China at least once before the Chinese delegation’s 1996 visit, and the DCNF discovered that several trips Walz led to China also visited the institute.
A 1995 Alliance High School yearbook pictures Walz, Chen Shuhua and Ning Ziheng together during the school’s second trip to China sharing “a toast of health and prosperity.” The yearbook photo’s caption identifies Chen Shuhua as “President of Guangzhou Institute of Physical Education” and Ning Ziheng as an “Associate Professor of Sports Psychology and main host for the China Trip.”
Walz and his wife met Ning Ziheng as early as 1992, according to a May 26, 1993 Alliance Times-Herald article concerning a then-upcoming trip to China led by Walz.
“The two have been in contact with Mr. Ning Ziheng in regard to this program since August of 1992,” Alliance Times-Herald reported.
“The group is headed for China, with a special invitation from the Chinese government,” the Star-Herald reported on July 25, 1993. “Walz got the idea while working as a teacher in China three years ago. A friend helped contact the authorities, and funding came through the government this April.”
During this 1993 trip, Walz also apparently took his students to Guangzhou Institute of Sports Education and met with Ning Ziheng, according to a review of local Nebraska newspapers.
“Most of the group’s time will be spent at Guangzhou University, where the students will play sports and take classes in Chinese culture,” the Star-Herald reported.
On Aug. 19. 1993, the Alliance Times-Herald reported students had visited “the University of Guangzhou,” with “Mr. Ning” serving as the trip’s tour guide.
“My favorite thing about the trip was the people!” one trip participant told the paper. “Everybody really liked our guide, Mr. Ning. He was the kind of person who nobody could walk away from without being his friend.”
Walz “knew some Chinese officials who agreed to help set up the tour,” Omaha World-Herald reported in August 1993, with the Star-Herald later reporting that the trip had been “arranged by a friend of Walz in China’s foreign affairs department.”
The Omaha World-Herald reported Walz led his 1993 trip participants to Guangzhou’s Shamian Island.
The tiny, roughly 75-acre island is home to the headquarters of Guangdong CPAFFC, according to its archived website. Today, the Guangdong Foreign Affairs Office shares a website with Guangdong CPAFFC.
The Alliance Times-Herald reported that in 1993 Walz’s group visited the White Swan Hotel, which is located less than 1,000 feet from Guangdong CPAFFC’s headquarters on Shamian Island.
“The White Swan Hotel, a five star hotel, was an interesting place to visit,” one trip participant said, according to Alliance Times-Herald.
In 1994, Walz again helped lead a trip to China and took students to play sports at the “Guangzhou Institute,” the Chadron Record reported.
Walz also continued to bring students to China to meet with Ning Ziheng after he and his wife moved to Minnesota in 1996 to begin teaching at Mankato West High School, the DCNF found.
One undated photo posted by the “Mankato West High School Alumni For Walz” Facebook group shows Ning Ziheng and Walz with students in front of the Ruins of St. Paul’s in Macao, China.
Ning Ziheng also apparently visited Walz in Minnesota on April 4, 1998, according to a photo included in a May 2021 social media post by Chinese-language news outlet Today Macao. The photo appears to show Ning Ziheng beside Walz at Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, playing miniature golf.
“Began golfing under a friend’s guidance,” the photo’s caption reads.
Ning Ziheng has since become a semi-professional golfer and has starred in short films about teaching golf to his sons, produced by the propaganda departments of the General Administration of Sport of China, All-China Sports Federation and the Chinese Olympic Committee.
An undated photo included in an April 2021 Today Macao social media post taken at an unspecified location pictures Walz with Ning Ziheng’s two sons.
Ning Ziheng now serves as a professor of Health Sciences and Sports at Macao Polytechnic University where Walz disclosed previously working as a fellow.
Ning did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
“The Communist Party’s United Front Work Department has been grooming, wooing, and romancing Tim Walz for four decades,” China expert and author Gordon Chang told the DCNF. “We cannot allow our enemy to take over the core of our government.”
‘An End In Itself’
Walz’s relationship with CCP officials may cause him to overlook inappropriate ties between other U.S. lawmakers and CCP officials, says Steve Yates, senior research fellow for China and National Security Policy at the Heritage Foundation.
“For decades many American leaders — whether from academia, business or government — argued that engagement with the CCP was a necessary means to the desirable end of reaching the Chinese people and achieving a better and safer future together,” Yates told the DCNF. “An elegant and tempting ideal.”
In the last three months, the House Oversight Committee has sent multiple letters to federal authorities concerning Walz’s close relationship with China and its political mechanisms. An August 2024 letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray requests information pertaining to matters such as “any warnings or advice the FBI may have given to Governor Walz about U.S. political figures being targeted by or recruited for CCP influence operations.”
More recently, Comer sent a subpoena to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, alleging that whistleblower disclosures notified “the Committee of serious concern among Department of Homeland Security (DHS) personnel regarding a longstanding connection between the CCP and Minnesota Governor Timothy James Walz.”
Walz was recently also forced to admit he’s made several false statements concerning his China travels, following a bombshell September 2024 report from Minnesota Public Radio.
Walz previously stated he’d traveled to China “about 30 times,” however, when pressed, a Walz spokesman told Minnesota Public Radio that the actual number of trips was “closer to 15.”
Minnesota Public Radio’s report also revealed that Walz was not in Hong Kong in May 1989 as the Tiananmen Square protests were intensifying as previously claimed. Rather, Walz was still in Nebraska at that time and didn’t travel to China until August 1989 to begin teaching at the No. 1 Middle School in Guangdong province’s city of Foshan, located directly southwest of Guangzhou.
Walz called himself a “knucklehead” and admitted he “misspoke” when a moderator asked him about the discrepancy during the CBS vice presidential debate.
Tim Walz on His China Trips: “I got there [China] that summer and misspoke on this.” pic.twitter.com/03UIFK1F1Y
— DC Shorts (@theDCshorts) October 2, 2024
Walz has also attended several events organized by members of a CCP intel-tied nonprofit in recent years, and, while serving as governor, appointed a member of a political faction loyal to the CCP to a state board on Asian-American affairs, the DCNF reported.
“Over such a long period of time, responsible leaders would ask, who did you end up engaging and empowering and to what actual end?” Yates said. “Walz cannot afford to ask these questions, because for him, engagement with the CCP was an end in itself. He cannot point to where his counterparts are today and say they are making China or the U.S. a better or safer place courtesy of his decades of friendly engagement with the CCP.”

The Daily Caller,ROOKE: Political Earthquake Set To Rock Harris Campaign. There’s No Time Left To Stop It,"Democrats are waking up to the nightmare that the 2024 election is not trending well for Vice President Kamala Harris.
While there are different avenues for both presidential candidates to win enough Electoral College votes to take the White House, Harris must win the three states that make up the “blue wall:” Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. These states, also known as the “Rust Belt,” flipped to Trump in 2016 but went blue in 2020 with President Joe Biden and are still Harris’ best chance of winning in 2024.
🚨Blue Wall danger: Worry grows among top Dems that Harris is stuck, even sliding a bit, after strong convention & debate
•Her media blitz, spending advantage & largely favorable coverage don’t seem to be moving the needle much, if at all, these Dems say https://t.co/SkRtsv2xlt

Pennsylvania will likely be crucial to Harris’ victory with its 19 Electoral College votes. Still, Harris’s path in Pennsylvania is not trending as well as it did for Biden, reportedly keeping local Democrats up at night.
“The registration gap between Republicans and Democrats has absolutely collapsed in Pennsylvania over the course of the past few years, and particularly in 2024. And a significant number of those registrations that are changing are Democrat to Republican,” Charlie Gerow, a longtime political operative in Pennsylvania, told Politico. (ROOKE: Trump’s McDonald’s Visit Tears Down Thin Veil Covering Harris Campaign’s Greatest Weakness)
“Early voting is another indication. Democrats have always dwarfed Republicans because Republicans prefer to vote in-person and most of them do. But Republicans have caught on to the fact that if you bank your vote, it’s guaranteed to be cast. And so the Republican request for mail-in ballots is way, way up this year and the Democrats’ numbers simply aren’t as good.” Gerow added.
2/.@stranter at @DecisionDeskHQ wrote this in an email to friends/clients earlier this week:
“1 month ago today, our PA polling average had Harris at +1.1, and today, it’s Harris +0.3 — this trend, while slight, is consistent across all the upper Midwest states where Harris…

Philadelphia City Councilmember and chair of “Black Men for Harris Pennsylvania,” Isaiah Thomas, admitted that Gerow was correct. This is problematic for Democrats as they watch Harris’ slim lead in the state collapse.
“I want to be very clear: What Charlie talked about is definitely something that’s extremely alarming and concerning. It’s a pattern that existed long before I became a member of city council,” Thomas told Politico, adding that is why the Harris Campaign has stepped up its ground game in the state.
“I think that there are warning signs around voter participation,” Thomas said.
“The concern is there. Just because I’m confident that we’re going to win doesn’t mean that I go to sleep every night without a high level of anxiety. The anxiety is there. The fear is there,” he added.
Chris Cuomo: “Harris is not a godsend, alright? You people didn’t even like her six months ago. Now, all of a sudden, she’s black female Jesus, the way Obama was black Jesus.

Democrats and Harris have reason to be concerned. Not only are Republicans gaining on Democrats in voter registration, but the deadline to register new voters in Pennsylvania ended Monday night. Couple that with Republicans’ mail-in ballot returns outpacing their 2020 numbers, and Democrats’ fears are justified.

The Daily Caller,A Democrat-Aligned Foreign Influence Network Pressured America To Ignore The ‘Ethnic Cleansing’ Of Christians,"Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday accused Vice President Kamala Harris of inaction as Christian Armenians faced ethnic cleansing at the hands of Muslim Azerbaijanis last year — inaction that was spurred by a network of Azerbaijani foreign agents with ties to the Democratic Party.
On Sept. 19, 2023, Azerbaijan invaded the autonomous region of Nagorno-Karabakh, inhabited primarily by Armenian Christians, beginning a swift offensive effort that led to almost all 120,000 inhabitants of the territory fleeing westward for fear of death. Shortly after the Azerbaijani military launched its assault, foreign agents paid by various arms of Azerbaijan’s government began blasting out thousands of emails to lawmakers and key players in the Biden-Harris administration attempting to squash domestic backlash to the attack on Armenian Christians, according to Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) records.
While Azerbaijan currently retains six U.S. firms to do its bidding, BGR Government Affairs and the Friedlander Consulting Group did the heavy lifting running cover for the Caucasian oil state following its invasion of Nagorno-Karabakh, FARA filings show. In the months following the offensive, BGR sent hundreds of emails, arranged meetings and made phone calls advocating for Azerbaijani interests. Friedlander Consulting, meanwhile, sent thousands of emails and organized meetings between key policymakers and members of the Azerbaijani government in the wake of the attack.
Both Mark Tavlarides, the primary BGR lobbyist working for Azerbaijan, and Ezra Friedlander, the head of Friedlander Consulting, have considerable ties to the Democratic Party. (Stream The Daily Caller’s Documentary ‘Lawless’ HERE)
Tavlarides served in the Clinton administration first as a legislative staffer in the Department of Defense and later as director of the White House National Security Council, according to his LinkedIn page. He has also donated nearly $30,000 to primarily Democratic political committees this election cycle, disclosure forms show.
Friedlander, meanwhile, has a history of working in Democratic politics in New York City, according to his company biography, and often reposts pro-Democratic messaging on his X account. Friedlander emphasized that his firm is “fully bipartisan and has reached out and worked with the entire spectrum of ideological and geographical political establishment to a fault.”
“These men, women and children, terrified for their lives, left behind entire worlds: their schools and shops; their fields, flocks, and vineyards; the cemeteries of their ancestors,” Harvard University professor Christina Maranci wrote of the exodus of Armenians spurred by the Azerbaijani offensive. “The United States and the European Union speak loftily of universal human rights, but did nothing for nine months while the people of [Nagorno-Karabakh] were denied food, medicine, fuel, and other vital supplies.”
Friedlander, whose firm receives $41,666 per month to represent the Azerbaijani government, started his public relations campaign for the country just days after it began to push ethnic Armenians out of their homes — setting up a meeting between House Republican Policy Committee Chairman Gary Palmer of Alabama with the Azerbaijani ambassador on Sept. 27, 2023, to discuss “developments in the South Caucasus,” disclosures show. The following day, Friedlander began working to arrange meetings between Azerbaijani embassy staff and various congressional offices, including, among others, those of Republican Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance and Democratic Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, who sits on the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Vance, in an October 2023 congressional memo, raised concerns over the “the rapid overthrow of the ceasefire agreement in Nagorno-Karabakh by Azerbaijan and the exodus of an ancient Christian community.”
Friedlander’s actions were preceded by Democratic New Jersey then-Sen. Robert Menendez introducing a Senate resolution on September 21, 2023, requesting humanitarian assistance for displaced Armenians, calling for the United States to sanction the Azerbaijani officials who orchestrated the attack and laying out actions to deepen America’s strategic ties with Armenia. The Azerbaijani foreign agent acted quickly, emailing virtually every Senate office eight days later urging them to oppose the resolution eight days after it was introduced, disclosures show.
It is unclear what Friedlander sent to these senators, however, as there are no emails included in his firm’s FARA disclosures that mention the Senate resolutions or that match the date of those communications. Regardless, the resolution never made it out of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, according to legislative records.
The resolution, which was co-sponsored by a bi-partisan coalition of senators, pointed out how Azerbaijan had indiscriminately used rockets and cluster bombs against civilian targets and maintained a blockade that stopped roughly 90% of food from entering Nagorno-Karabakh. In addition to killing Armenian civilians, the invading Azerbaijani forces also destroyed Armenian churches and desecrated cultural heritage sites.
“The notion of Christians being persecuted in the Karabakh region or any other region in Azerbaijan is false,” Friedlander told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Even the Prime Minister of Armenia publicly stated that literally days after the mass exodus last September. The guilty party was the illegal separatists who encouraged the Armenian population to leave. The world has forgotten that it was the Armenians who illegally occupied Karabakh although it is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan and in fact hundreds of thousands of Azerbaijanis that were forcefully expelled from Armenia and from Karabakh are still listed as international displaced persons by the UN, which issued four resolutions calling on Armenia to leave Karabakh.”
In one communication to policymakers, Friedlander stressed that Christians in Azerbaijan are allowed to celebrate Christmas in Azerbaijan. Freedom House, however, gave Azerbaijan a religious freedom score of zero in 2023, pointing out that faith groups must register with the government and are subject to surveillance. Members of religious communities that attempt to operate without government approval have been subject to torture and imprisonment.
Tavlarides, the Azerbaijani foreign agent working for BGR, began his work for the country in November 2023, reaching the staff managers of the House and Senate Foreign Affairs Committees to discuss the Armenian Protection Act of 2023, legislation that would bar Azerbaijan from receiving U.S. security aid for the next two years, disclosures show. The legislation passed the Senate by unanimous consent shortly after but has since stalled in the House amid an aggressive lobbying campaign from Friedlander.
“This bill actively harms the normalization process between Azerbaijan and Armenia,” a mass email Friedlander sent to hundreds of House offices in February reads. Friedlander went on to deny that Azerbaijan engaged in ethnic cleansing and to remind lawmakers of Azerbaijan’s close relationship with Israel.
Tavlarides is a donor to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and Friedlander is a practicing Jew who frequently posts about his support for Israel. Israel and Azerbaijan have a strong strategic relationship, with the latter providing the former with oil in exchange for guns.
In addition to attempting to influence lawmakers on behalf of the Azerbaijani government, Friedlander and Tavlarides also worked to influence the Biden administration’s response to the Nagorno-Karabakh crisis, according to disclosures. The latter sent Assistant Secretary of Defense Rheanne Wrikkala an email in February expressing opposition to Senate Resolution 540, which would have requested that the Secretary of State provide a report investigating if Azerbaijan has engaged in human rights abuses and assessing if security assistance to the Caucasian nation should continue.
Tavlarides’ letter stressed Azerbaijan’s support of Ukraine and Israel, the country’s history of cooperation with the United States and the importance of America maintaining commitment to its allies, without mentioning the humanitarian abuses in Nagorno-Karabakh, disclosures show. He sent similar communications to a number of House offices. Tavlarides also reached the State Department on behalf of the Azerbaijani government in January, asking it to oppose amendments to the Fiscal Year 2025 National Defense Authorization Act that would restrict military assistance to the country, probe its relationships with Iran and Russia and call on it to release all prisoners of war and captured civilians.
Tavlarides also attempted to arrange a meeting between the Helsinki Commission, a U.S. agency that handles some European diplomatic affairs, and the Embassy of Azerbaijan, records show.
Friedlander, meanwhile, contacted the State Department in early 2024 and the Department of Veterans Affairs in 2023 to provide them with information about Azerbaijani cultural events, according to disclosures.
Tavlarides and Friedlander often extended offers to connect government officials with Azerbaijani diplomats at the end of their emails. Tavlarides did not respond to a request for comment.
Even as Azerbaijan escaped sanction for its invasion of Nagorno-Karabakh thus far, it has continued to expand its influence network in D.C., FARA filings show.
As the House considers legislation to strip Azerbaijan of American military aid, the country’s embassy hired Skyline Capitol to represent it in June, agreeing to pay the firm $50,000 per month for its services. Skyline Capitol is led by the recently-retired Republican former Utah Rep. Chris Stewart, who sat on the House Foreign Affairs and the Intelligence Committees. Stewart’s firm specializes in defense and foreign affairs lobbying.
After leaving Congress, lobbyists tend to leverage the connections they made while on the hill to deliver better representation to their clients which, in this case, happens to be a nation experts have accused of ethnic cleansing.
“Foreign governments don’t deserve a veto over U.S. human rights policy — a core American value,” Armenian National Committee of America executive director Aram Hamparian told the DCNF. “Azerbaijan, in particular, should not be allowed to enforce a gag-rule against American condemnation of its ethnic cleansing of at-risk Armenian Christians.”
Azerbaijan is allegedly asking lobbyists not to represent it without registering under FARA, which would mean that the American public would not be privy to what agents of the foreign nation were saying to officials, Politico reported Thursday night. Two lobbyists, speaking anonymously, said they had declined to work with the country because they believed it was prompting them to violate federal law.
A representative from the Azerbaijani Embassy stressed that the country’s “work with the companies is within the respective U.S. legislation.” They also accused Armenia of ethnic cleansing and argued that Azerbaijan has a tradition of multiculturalism and religious tolerance.
The Department of Defense, White House and BGR did not respond to the DCNF’s requests for comment. The State Department declined to comment.

The Daily Caller,Left-Wing Dark Money And Unions Team Up To Enshrine Abortion In Florida’s Constitution,"As election day approaches and polls narrow, out-of-state groups are pouring tens of millions into Florida to enshrine abortion as a right in the state’s constitution.
Massive Democratic-aligned dark money networks, the Soros family, D.C.-based liberal advocacy groups and public-sector unions have rallied behind Floridians Protecting Freedom (FPF), spending millions to support the group’s effort to repeal Florida’s prohibition on abortion after fetal heartbeats are typically detected, campaign finance records show. FPF is the primary group supporting an initiative on November’s ballot to amend the state’s constitution by creating a constitutional right to terminate one’s pregnancy.
To be added to the state’s constitution, the amendment would need to attract 60% support on election day. A poll in June found that 69% of voters supported that amendment, though an October poll recently found that just 60% of voters reported supporting the abortion initiative, according to the Tallahassee Democrat. (Stream The Daily Caller’s Documentary ‘Cleaning Up Kamala’ HERE)
“Now, just barely reaching the 60% it needs to pass, it looks like the fate of abortion in Florida will come down to turnout on Election Day,” University of North Florida political science professor Michael Binder told the Tallahassee Democrat.
While FPF brands itself as “grassroots,” it has been relying on deep-pocketed out-of-state liberal organizations to shore up pro-abortion turnout ahead of election day. All told, out-of-state groups have spent well over $40 million boosting the pro-abortion amendment, dwarfing outside spending from pro-life organizations opposing it.
Sixteen Thirty Fund, for example, donated $304,300 worth of research services to FPF in July, according to campaign finance records. Arabella Advisors, a shadowy D.C.-based consulting firm, manages Sixteen Thirty Fund as part of a multi-billion dollar dark money nonprofit network. Sixteen Thirty Fund and the rest of the nonprofits under Arabella Advisors’ umbrella have spent hundreds of millions of dollars over the years pouring money into Democratic political committees, funding climate lawsuits, bankrolling left-of-center activist groups and paying for voter mobilization efforts targeted at left-leaning demographics.
In addition to conducting research for FPF, Sixteen Thirty Fund also donated $1 million to the pro-abortion campaign on May 31, records show. New Venture Fund and Hopewell Fund, two other nonprofits managed by Arabella Advisors, collectively donated about $11.8 million to FPF between Oct. 7 and Oct. 8.
The Tides Foundation, another large liberal grantmaker that has been accused of dealing in dark money, donated about $3.5 million to FPF between December 2023 and September, according to state records. Tides, which is based in San Francisco, directs its funds towards mobilizing pro-Democratic voters and pro-abortion activism, among other left-of-center initiatives.
Liberal dark money groups have supported similar abortion ballot measures in Ohio and Michigan. Many Democratic strategists see November’s abortion referendums as an opportunity to sway voters to their side in the presidential election.
“Dark money” typically refers to organizations that involve themselves in political campaigns without disclosing donors’ identities. None of the nonprofits in Arabella’s network nor the Tides Foundation publicize the identities of donors, despite the organizations being involved in electoral politics.
“Florida regularly rejects the dark money D.C. establishment, and unsurprisingly, these groups are spending tens of millions in an attempt to turn Florida into California and buy influence,” a spokesperson for the campaign opposing the abortion amendment told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “But no amount of money will convince Floridians that non-doctors should be able to perform abortions up until the moment of birth, that a child can undergo an abortion without parental consent, or that taxpayers should pay for abortions, which Amendment 4 would allow.”
Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has said that Amendment Four would legalize abortion “until the moment of birth.” The text of the amendment prohibits the state’s legislature from restricting abortion before fetal viability, which is generally considered to occur around 24 weeks and would give healthcare providers the right to perform an abortion at any point in a pregnancy if they believe doing so would “protect the patient’s health.”
At 23 weeks, an unborn child is about a foot tall and has arms and legs, according to the United Kingdom’s National Health Service.
Working hand-in-hand with Democratic dark money operations, public unions have been using dues collected from taxpayer-funded salaries to fight for a constitutional abortion guarantee in Florida, according to campaign finance records. Various branches of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), which represents public-sector workers, have pumped considerable funds into FPF from outside of Florida.
Chapters of the SEIU in New York, Connecticut, D.C., California and Washington state collectively gave over $1 million to FPF, records show. The SEIU represents both public and private sector employees.
Federal law prohibits unions from contributing membership dues directly to political campaigns, according to the Department of Labor. They can, however, contribute revenue from membership dues to political committees like FPF. Under current Supreme Court precedent, public employees cannot be compelled to join a union and pay dues as a condition of employment.
Though it is cashing massive checks from out-of-state unions and dark money behemoths, FPF is adamant that it is running a “grassroots” operation.
“We will work every day to build on the already unprecedented grassroots support this campaign has received from allied organizations, volunteers, and funders to educate voters and strengthen public support ahead of the election,” an April press release from the group reads. The term “grassroots” appears multiple times on the organization’s website, with FPF touting purported organic local support for its efforts.
The New York-based Soros family, one of the largest funders of liberal campaigns across the country, pumped $5.5 million into FPF’s self-described grassroots campaign between September 2023 and September 2024, records show. Planned Parenthood Action Fund and Reproductive Justice for All, two of the largest pro-abortion groups in the country, both of which are headquartered outside of Florida, have donated $2.5 million to FPF. Other D.C.-based activist groups have donated over $16 million to FPF this election cycle.
Florida Freedom Fund, a PAC founded by DeSantis to fight the abortion initiative, by contrast, has only raised a couple hundred thousand dollars from out of state organizations, campaign finance records show. Florida Voters Against Extremism, another group opposing the amendment, has also raised just a few hundred thousand from out-of-state groups, much of which came from Catholic organizations.
FPF did not respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

The Daily Caller,"Arizona Ballots Marred In Mailbox Fire, Authorities Say","More than a dozen ballots in Arizona were destroyed Thursday after a United States Postal Service (USPS) mailbox was set on fire, according to authorities.
Twenty electoral ballots were damaged by the fire set outside a post office in Phoenix just prior to 1:30 a.m., officials said, according to Fox 10 Phoenix.
Democratic Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego announced later Thursday after 2 p.m. that police had arrested a suspect with the assistance of “federal partners.” The identity of the suspect was not disclosed.

The Phoenix Police Department directed the Daily Caller to a media advisory identifying the suspect as 35-year-old Dieter Klofkorn. He allegedly said he committed the arson because he wanted to be arrested. Klofkorn claimed his actions were not motivated by politics or the 2024 election, according to the advisory.
The flames were put out by firefighters responding to the scene, Fox 10 Phoenix reported. Additional pieces of mail were reportedly also disfigured by the fire.
“The Postal Inspector took possession of the damaged ballots and mail,” Phoenix Fire Department Capt. Rob McDade stated. “The Phoenix Fire Investigations Task Force, which includes Phoenix Police detectives and Phoenix Fire investigators, are working with US Postal Inspectors.”
Investigators acquired surveillance footage from the scene, Phoenix police said. The area where the fire was lit has since been reopened following a temporary blockade, Fox 10 Phoenix reported. (RELATED: Elon Musk To Award One Person $1 Million Every Day Before Election Day)

“We are waiting for details from law enforcement. We encourage all voters who used that mail box in the last 36 hours to check the status of their ballots at https://BeBallotReady.Vote,” the statement said.
Richer’s statement urged Arizona voters to check their ballots’ status online and said Friday, Oct. 25, is the last day they can request a replacement ballot.

Biden made the comment during a Tuesday Zoom call with the organization Voto Latino after comedian Tony Hinchcliffe referred to Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage” at Trump’s Sunday Madison Square Garden rally. Luntz, on “CNN News Central,” argued Biden’s remark holds greater weight than Hinchcliffe’s because he is the president, adding that it was “inappropriate” even if people interpret it differently.

WATCH:
“It’s gonna be huge because this is not some comedian saying something stupid and offensive at a rally where he should have been just basically disinvited. This is the president of the United States endorsing his vice president saying something, and I know that there’s different interpretations about what he said,” Luntz said. “It’s still inappropriate. He still shouldn’t be doing it and I’ve watched Trump already seize this.”
“The basket of deplorables was significant, was meaningful in 2016. In 2024, I can promise you that this is gonna drive Trump turnout,” he added. “He’s doing it already … I’m sure there’s going to be ads on as soon as tonight about this. This may be a turning point for those final 3%, and that’s all it is, who still need to be persuaded.”
Trump currently leads Vice President Kamala Harris slightly in five of the top seven battleground states, with Harris only holding narrow advantages in Michigan and Wisconsin, according to RealClearPolling averages.
“And just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a ‘floating island of garbage.’ Well, let me tell you something … I don’t know the Puerto Rican that I know — or a Puerto Rico, where I’m — in my home state of Delaware, they’re good, decent, honorable people,” Biden said Tuesday. “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American. It’s totally contrary to everything we’ve done, everything we’ve been.”
Biden tried to clarify his comments in an X post Tuesday night following criticism, claiming he was referencing Hinchcliffe’s “hateful rhetoric” rather than all Trump supporters.
The White House first published a transcript that recorded Biden saying “supporters’,” with a plural possessive apostrophe. It subsequently changed the transcript to read “supporter’s,” suggesting that Biden was only referring to Hinchcliffe.

The Daily Caller,Health Department In Idaho Reportedly Becomes First In The Nation To Ban Vaccine,"A regional health department in Idaho overseeing six counties appears to be the first across the U.S. to cease to provide COVID-19 vaccines, according to Boise State Public Radio (BSPR).
The board of Southwest District Health (SDH) voted 4-3 on Oct. 22, 2024 to remove the vaccines from its offices after receiving around 300 public comments against the vaccines and anti-vaccine presentations from several doctors, Boise State Public Radio reported.
The decision appears to be a nationwide first. “I’m not aware of anything else like this,” Adriane Casalotti, chief of government and public affairs for the National Association of County and City Health Officials, told The Associated Press (AP).
Dr. Perry Jansen, a district staff physician and medical director, did not support the decision. “We really serve as a safety net provider for people who can’t get health care in any other way, largely because of finances,” Jansen told the board in his pre-voting presentation, according to BSPR. “We’re able to offer free and discounted services for people who don’t have access through private care.”
“Our request of the board is that we would be able to carry and offer those [vaccines], recognizing that we always have these discussions of risks and benefits,” Jansen added, according to AP. “This is not a blind, everybody-gets-a-shot approach. This is a thoughtful approach.”
Four critics of the COVID-19 vaccine — Dr. Peter McCullough, a Texas-based cardiologist, pediatrician and former Washington State University medical associate professor Dr. Renata Moon, Florida-based gynecologist Dr. James A. Thorp and Idaho pathologist Dr. Ryan Cole — made presentations at the board meeting, according to BSPR. All four reportedly have had run-ins with health authorities over their criticisms of COVID-19 vaccines. (RELATED: ‘Scientific And Public Health Failure’: Fauci Admits COVID Shots Didn’t Have A Chance Of Controlling The Pandemic)
Dr. John Tribble, the only physician on the SDH board, reportedly invited the presenters. “[Patients] show up at the door, trusting us, and we continue to break that trust by saying, tacitly or otherwise, that these things, there’s no risk from these,” he added, according to BSPR. (RELATED: FACT CHECK: Have 1 Billion People Died Since The Development Of The COVID-19 Vaccine?)
Board chair Kelly Aberasturi questioned the board’s authority to remove access to the vaccines for everyone in its jurisdiction as many of those who need the vaccines reportedly obtain referrals from doctors.
“So now, you’re telling me that I have the right to override that doctor? Because I know more than he does?” Aberasturi said, according to BSPR. “It has to do with the right of the individual to make that decision on their own. Not for me to dictate to them what they will do. Sorry, but this pisses me off.”
Health departments have stopped offering the vaccine because of cost or low demand rather than “a judgment of the medical product itself,” Casalotti told AP.
SDH is one of Idaho’s seven public health districts and serves Adams, Canyon, Gem, Owyhee, Payette and Washington counties, according to its website. Demand for COVID-19 vaccines across the six counties plunged from 1,601 in 2021 to 64 in 2024 at the time of writing, AP reported. While the vaccines are no longer free, they are inexpensive but not subsidized by the SDH, BSPR reported.
Other vaccines and treatments may also be blocked following the SDH’s decision, Aberasturi told AP. Idaho reportedly has the highest childhood vaccination exemption rate in the U.S.
A rare September 2023 measles outbreak sparked an SDH scramble to contain it. Cases of the childhood disease of whooping cough spiked from 10 in 2023 to 171 in 2024 at the time of writing across the SDH and another health department, the SDH said in early September.",2024-11-02
The Daily Caller,EXCLUSIVE: Jim Jordan Demands File On Afghan National Charged With Attempting Terror Attack On Election Day,"House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan sent letters Tuesday to the State Department and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) demanding information about the Afghan man with reported ties to ISIS who allegedly planned an Election Day terrorist attack in the U.S.
The Daily Caller first obtained copies of the letters to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. In the letters, Jordan demands the following:
- Case history documents and information, including, but not limited to, the alien’s immigration history, immigration benefits applications, the alien file (A-file) or consular file (including all consular notes), and immigration detention status and history.
- Documents sufficient to show the time, date, and place of any and all of the alien’s entries into the United States.
- Documents sufficient to show the alien’s processing by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials, including whether CBP officials were alerted to derogatory information about the alien and what questions were asked of the alien during the screening process.
- A briefing regarding the immigration issues, including processes and procedures, concerning this case.
The Department of Justice (DOJ) announced earlier in October that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) arrested 27-year-old Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, who was living in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. He was charged him with conspiring and attempting to support ISIS with violent acts scheduled for the upcoming U.S. elections in November.

“Aliens who intend to commit terrorist activities exploit vulnerabilities in our nation’s immigration system to the detriment of those in the United States. The Biden-Harris Administration’s border and immigration policies only increase the likelihood that such aliens will successfully enter and remain in the U.S. Pursuant to the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee on the Judiciary is authorized to conduct oversight of federal immigration policy and procedures,” Jordan wrote in the letter.

The Daily Caller,‘What Are You Talking About?’: Chris Cuomo Fires Back At ‘Unserious People’ Calling Him ‘Racist’ For Harris Criticism,"NewsNation host Chris Cuomo on Tuesday pushed back against racism accusations after his recent criticism of Vice President Kamala Harris.
On the Oct. 22 episode of “The Chris Cuomo Project,” Cuomo claimed Harris is neither a “godsend” nor “black female Jesus” and accused her supporters of trying to stifle criticism to improve the vice president’s chances against former President Donald Trump in November. In Tuesday’s episode, Cuomo denied being “racist” and doubled down on his critiques of Harris and her supporters. (RELATED: Kamala Harris Used To Think Border Wall Was ‘Un-American.’ Now She Supports It.)
WATCH:
“I am being accused of being racist by some unserious people because I said Kamala Harris went from being someone ‘you people don’t like and never talked about’ to being ‘black female Jesus,'” Cuomo said Tuesday. “All right, where am I coming from on that? … One, ‘you people’ isn’t black people — I would never do that. I am an ally of the black cause in America … the idea that I was saying ‘you people’ about blacks is not true.”
“And by the way, blacks aren’t the people who motivated Kamala Harris’s candidacy — party officials are, who believe that they couldn’t pass over a black female and hew to their diversity-by-identity mandate,” he continued. “So my point was, when [President Joe] Biden said he was going to run again, which no one really thought he should, why didn’t they say, ‘No, you got Harris’? Because they didn’t have confidence in Harris. And when it was ‘Biden’s on the down, Biden’s on the down,’ how come people weren’t talking about Harris? Because Harris wasn’t popular with them, that’s why.”
Harris’ popularity was below 40% before she launched her presidential campaign on July 21, after Biden dropped out and endorsed her, according to the FiveThirtyEight polling average.
“But now that she has to be their pick, in their estimation, and they completely didn’t allow any kind of process within the party for that — which I think hurt Harris — now they can’t say anything bad about her,” Cuomo added. “And if you say anything critical of her, you’re some kind of traitor and you’re empowering Hitler. And that’s what I’m getting hit with, but that’s not true.”
“Kamala Harris is not a godsend. Of course, Trump isn’t a godsend, but Kamala Harris isn’t a godsend. She is not beyond criticism,” he said. “What are you talking about? That is not how you win, okay, by trying to punish or censor or degrade anyone who questions what you’re about.”
The clip of Cuomo criticizing Harris posted by the Daily Caller News Foundation went viral, receiving three million views on X. HuffPost subsequently published a piece on Wednesday saying Cuomo’s analysis was a “hot take that is yikes.”
One X user responded to the clip by accusing Cuomo of “racism and misogyny,” calling it “so fucking gross.” Another accused Cuomo of referring to “Black folks” when he said “you people.”
Trump currently has narrow leads over Harris in all of the top seven battleground states, according to the RealClearPolling average.

The Daily Caller,Wall Street Billionaires Starting To Bet On Trump Win,"Hedge fund managers are preparing for a potential Trump win in November, loading up their portfolios with stocks that would benefit from a Trump victory, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported Wednesday.
The outlet identified sectors like the private prison industry and cryptocurrency as ones that would stand to benefit from a Trump win, and highlighted large rises in the stock prices for corporations within those industries as proof.
Investors like Third Point’s Dan Loeb cited Trump’s proposed tariffs as reasons to be optimistic about a Trump presidency’s impact on the stock market.
The tariffs “will increase domestic manufacturing, infrastructure spending, and prices of certain materials and commodities,” Loeb wrote in a letter to investors, the WSJ reported. “We also believe that a reduction in regulation generally and especially in the activist antitrust stance of the Biden-Harris administration will unleash productivity and a wave of corporate activity.”
Trump’s odds on betting markets have been steadily growing since the start of October. At the month’s start, election forecaster and betting hub Polymarket had Trump at a 49 percent likelihood of winning with Kamala Harris at 50 percent. By Wednesday Trump had surged to a 62 percent likelihood versus Harris’ 38 percent.
That shift in odds, WSJ reports, has made the election more of a priority for investors. (RELATED: Trump Leading Harris in Key Swing State Two Weeks Before Election Day, Poll Finds)
The Trump trajectory may have led to recent declines in the Chinese yuan and Mexican peso, Barclays’ global head of foreign-exchange and emerging-markets macro strategy Themos Fiotakis told the WSJ.
The U.S. Dollar, meanwhile, has risen sharply in concurrence with Trump’s betting odds, according to the Journal’s Dollar Index.

Betting against the yuan and the peso and on the U.S. dollar “is no longer a cheap no-brainer like it was two or three weeks ago,” Fiotakis told the Journal.
While most of the inventors the Journal cited seemed to be keen on a Trump win, not all of them were betting his victory would benefit the economy. Some, like RBC BlueBay’s Mark Dowding, appear to be making bets banking on the Trump tariffs increasing inflation, WSJ reported.",2024-10-23
The Daily Caller,‘I’ve Heard It All Before’: Scott Jennings Lists Republicans Who Democrats Compared To Hitler In The Past,"Republican strategist Scott Jennings said Wednesday night that he’s “heard” comparisons of prominent Republicans to German dictator Adolf Hitler going back to the George W. Bush administration during a panel on CNN.
Vice President Kamala Harris used a Wednesday press conference to highlight claims from an article in The Atlantic that former President Donald Trump expressed a desire for generals like those who served under Hitler. Jennings told Jamal Simmons, a former aide to Harris, that he was “calloused” to Hitler comparisons. (RELATED: ‘You Don’t Need To Interrupt’: Sparks Fly Between Scott Jennings And WaPo Columnist Over Trump, IVF)
“Now, I’m calloused on this Hitler business because I lived through the Bush years and I used to peer out my window onto Pennsylvania Avenue and I saw everybody marching around in their brown uniforms, signs up, ‘Bush is Hitler, Bush is Hitler,’” Jennings said. “And then they did it to John McCain. They did it to Mitt Romney. They’ve done it to Donald Trump. Even did it to Paul Ryan, I recall at one point. So I’ve heard it all before.”
WATCH:
Prior to listing Republicans who Democrats had compared to the Nazi leader, Jennings noted that vulnerable Democratic Senators were touting their ability to work with Trump.
“It probably will shock Kamala Harris and the rest of her campaign staff to learn that there are incumbent Democrat U.S. senators in this country right now running television ads touting all their work with this modern-day Hitler,” Jennings said, later adding, “I mean, if he were really Hitler, if he were really a threat to democracy, not a single Democrat in this country would be running ads touting their work with Donald Trump.”
Jennings then said that anti-Israel protests on college campuses where demonstrators made statements like “resistance is justified” and chanted “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,” a slogan that has connotations of wiping out Israel, made antisemitism appear to be coming from left-wing sources. (Watch The Daily Caller Documentary “Poisoned Ivies”)
“I think the reason Democrats are freaking out about it right now is because what they have learned is that it‘s not Republicans who are the Hitlers or the Nazis, it‘s actually emanating from within their own party,” Jennings said. “If you want to find Hitler-ish, Nazi-esque antisemitic tendencies, look on the left, not on the right.”
When Simmons claimed Jennings was trying to dodge the point about Trump, Jennings cut him off.
“She literally spoke in front of the Naval Observatory today, ‘Trump is Hitler,’” Jennings said in reference to Harris.

The Daily Caller,Brawl Nearly Erupts After Rudy Gobert Gets Embarrassed By Christian Braun Who Clearly Debunks ‘White Men Can’t Jump’,"Christian Braun is an instant legend for this.
The Denver Nuggets guard put down an absolutely ferocious dunk which posterized Minnesota Timberwolves center Rudy Gobert before, to add insult to injury, Braun taunted him right in front of his face. The scene almost led to an all-out brawl in a rematch of last season’s Western Conference Semifinals. (RELATED: Celtics’ Jayson Tatum Gets Blasted By His Former Teammate Grant Williams Like They’re In The Middle Of A Football Game)
During the fourth quarter of Friday night’s game, Braun found space to run down a lane towards the basket, where he was met by the four-time NBA Defensive Player of the Year. Usually, this ends up being a catastrophe for the opposing offense, but Braun managed to land a vicious dunk on Gobert, sending the Target Center into a complete frenzy.
Braun got hyped following the dunk, shouting and walking right into Gobert, taunting him. The T-Wolves’ big man wasn’t pleased whatsoever, giving Braun a shove to get him away.

While attempting to buy a parking pass, Paul Gavenonis allegedly spoke about climbing on top of a tall building during Trump’s Saturday rally at Penn State’s Bryce Jordan Center, FOX43 reported. A concerned worker told authorities that the 74-year-old began talking about using a gun to take down the GOP nominee, Penn State University Police said.

The suspect allegedly thought aloud about how he could not bring a firearm to the rally because “students will see it,” according to the outlet.
U.S. Secret Service agents and law enforcement confronted Gavenonis about his alleged threats, which he initially brushed aside, the outlet reported.
“Look at me — I’m not gonna shoot anybody,” Gavenonis said before allegedly confessing that he was “probably” threatening Trump. (RELATED: Trump Tombstone On Display In Art Gallery)
Gavenonis allegedly said “frankly, I hope somebody would get him” in reference to the former president as he was being directed into the police car.
