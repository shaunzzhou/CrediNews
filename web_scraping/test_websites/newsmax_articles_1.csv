News Max,"Harris Tries Out New Ways of Reaching Voters, but She's Running Out of Time","Inside a small community theater in suburban Detroit, Vice President Kamala Harris was asked at a recent forum to talk about her life for the benefit of voters who are still getting to know her.
It was the type of question typically asked of a new candidate. But here was Harris getting it less than two weeks before the Nov. 5 election and after millions of people already had voted. Her response underscored perhaps the defining challenge of her campaign for the White House.
“How much time do we have?"" Harris quipped.
The fact is, not much.
Any candidate’s most valuable resource is time, and from the start, Harris has been historically constrained. The Democratic nominee has been running for only three months after Democratic President Joe Biden dropped out of the race, and Harris still is confronting voters who say they want to learn more about who she is or how she will govern.
Her public events have tended toward large rallies where crowds ride high on vibes and Harris delivers variations on her standard stump speech. In the past week or so, though, she has added events in more intimate settings, lower-key church services and black box theater sit-downs where the conversations can be more revealing.
“I have lived a full life,” Harris told the Michigan audience. “I am a wife, I am a mother, I am a sister, I am a godmother. I love to cook.”
Harris, 60, is a relative newcomer on the national political stage.
Much of her career, as she often reminds voters, was outside of Washington, in California as a prosecutor and state attorney general. That was followed by a four-year stint in the Senate and a flame-out in the 2020 race for the White House. Her time as vice president boosted her profile, but nothing like what a traditional candidate would have at this stage in the race.
“Harris, comparably, is still such a relatively unknown quantity as a candidate,"" said Kevin Madden, a political strategist who worked on three presidential campaigns. ""It takes years to build up the kind of national profile that can withstand the brutality of a presidential campaign.""
Biden ran several times before he won the nomination and had three decades of public service on his resume, including eight years as vice president. Democrat Barack Obama started to build his profile during John Kerry's presidential campaign in 2004 and the midterm elections in 2006 before his two-year quest for what would be his first term in the White House. On the Republican side, the Bush family brand was built through multiple presidential campaigns over two decades.
“It was always going to be a major, major challenge to build and execute a presidential campaign unique to Harris in the space of 108 days,” Madden said.
Republican Donald Trump, meanwhile, is a known quantity. He had near-universal name recognition even before his 2016 campaign, owing to his time in reality television.
To Harris and her aides, the shortened campaign has offered advantages and challenges. But with no way to change the reality of that political timeline, they can only try to make the most of it.
That makes for an endless series of tough choices: where to go, what to talk about, with whom to speak. Those challenges come into focus in the final weeks of any campaign, but for Harris they have been a central feature in her sprint.
Aides have framed the campaign in different phases.
In the opening days, Harris prioritized locking down the nomination and staving off any would-be challengers. Then she shifted to trying to introduce herself on her own terms to the public. That meant talking about her biography, but also her governing philosophy, particularly on economic issues, as potential voters complained they did not know what she was about.
Along the way, she has returned to Washington for duties associated with her office, trying to play up the government's competence in response to natural disasters and to show her national security credentials in approaching wars overseas.
“The hill was a little steeper for her to climb because of the truncated nature of the race, but that’s why she’s doing everything she possibly can,” said Eric Schultz, who served as deputy White House press secretary under Obama.
In recent weeks, Harris has spoken more frankly about the summer Sunday when Biden dropped out of the race and handed her the keys to the campaign. She offered voters a new glimpse into her faith, looking to harness a profound political moment into an opportunity to connect with voters.
“It was an extraordinary day that Sunday when the president called me, and I instinctively understood the gravity of the moment, the seriousness of the moment,” she said during a CNN town hall.
So she called her pastor, she said. “I needed that spiritual kind of connection, I needed that advice, I needed a prayer."" She added she prays every day.
The event in suburban Detroit was one of three in crucial Midwestern states this past week in which Harris, joined by Liz Cheney, a prominent Republican critic of Trump who has endorsed the Democrat, answered questions from a moderator and audiences of undecided voters. It was a different version of the vice president from the one seen in her rallies, more relaxed and talkative.
Rita Peterson, 48, said she came away impressed by Harris' ability to connect.
“I think when you come from a place of joy and you come from a place of wanting to work together to move forward, I think there are a lot of people who want to be a part of that and want to move forward together,” she said.
In the closing days of her campaign, Harris is zeroing in on drawing a contrast with Trump. She will return to the site near the White House where Trump helped incite the mob on Jan. 6, hoping it will crystalize for voters the fight between defending democracy and sowing political chaos.
She will give a speech at the Ellipse on Tuesday — one week before Election Day — to urge the nation to “turn the page.”

News Max,Biden Admin Races to Spend Climate Cash,"Fearing that Donald Trump could kill off green initiatives if he wins the U.S. election, President Joe Biden's administration is racing to spend the tens of billions of dollars it had earmarked for climate action.
Trump, who is running against Vice President Kamala Harris to succeed Biden, has put the president's climate and energy agenda in the crosshairs on the campaign trail.
Biden is facing the prospect that a Republican-controlled Washington could roll back or curtail a signature achievement - his climate and social spending law - meaning billions in clean energy funding could hinge on who wins the Nov. 5 election.
""The Biden-Harris administration is trying to get this money out the door and get it fully obligated,"" said Katie Harris with BlueGreen Alliance, a coalition of union and environmental groups.
""It's quite the undertaking,"" she said.
As it stands, while billions in climate funding have been allocated since Biden signed the ""Inflation Reduction Act"" two years ago, there is still a sizable chunk on the table and precious little time to get it out.
BlueGreen's Harris said it would be ""messy"" for Republicans to roll back funding without controlling both the White House and Congress - but said Trump could certainly try to slow things down.
JOBS BOOM
The original $380 billion price tag for the clean energy provisions of the IRA now tops $1 trillion over 10 years, according to estimates, due in large part to the greater-than-expected popularity of tax credits for things such as wind and solar power.
The credits have helped spur more than $200 billion in private sector investment in electric vehicles and batteries alone, said David Kieve with EDF Action, the political arm of the environmental advocacy group.
""The sooner we see people showing up to work in clean energy jobs created by the Inflation Reduction Act, the harder it's going to be to get rid of any of it because people will see it working better in their communities,"" he said.
The Energy Department released a recent report that found clean energy jobs grew in 2023 at double the rate (4.2%) of jobs in the rest of the economy (2%), adding 142,000 new jobs.
Trump has vowed to rescind unspent funding in the IRA, dismissing spending tied to what he calls the ""Green New Scam"" as inconsequential.
House Speaker Mike Johnson has said he was interested in cutting some IRA spending but suggested he wouldn't necessarily favor a wholesale repeal.
No congressional Republicans voted for the law, but nor are they unified in their opposition.
Eighteen House Republicans wrote to Johnson in August to argue against repealing the law's clean energy tax credits.
""Repealing energy tax credits...would undermine private investments and stop development,"" they said.
""A full repeal would create a worst-case scenario where we would have spent billions of taxpayer dollars and received next to nothing in return.""
Repeal would require support from Congress, but Trump could rewrite or delay implementation rules to try to gum up the rollout.
""Not only does it take some time to kick in, tax credits are over a decade,"" Kieve said. ""Anything that calls into question some of that regulatory certainty damages our ability to move forward quickly and to benefit economically.""
PRAYERS FOR STAFF?
Since Biden signed the measure into law, federal agencies have kicked into overdrive to stand up the law, taking an estimated 350 actions - maybe more - linked to implementation.
""There's just been this really quick ramp-up (on) Inflation Reduction Act funding in 2024,"" said Tom Taylor of Atlas Public Policy, which runs the Climate Program Portal that logs spending from the IRA and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).
As of early September, $61 billion in climate funding has been awarded, much of it allocated this year, with about $33 billion, or 35%, in remaining funding, according to forthcoming projections from the group.
That total does not include the tax credits, direct federal spending, or a separate loan program so it constitutes a ""subset"" of the overall climate-related funding in the IRA, Taylor said.
""There's going to be a lot of intense work, I think, to get as much funding out the door as possible,"" Taylor said. ""But based on the current rate of awarding funding, there's no way that they will get all the funding out the door by the end of this administration.""
Among recent spends, the Environmental Protection Agency said it had awarded $27 billion for a ""greenhouse gas reduction fund.""
""That pot of money is just so large and has the potential to roll out all over the country...but I would wonder what kind of shenanigans might be attempted,"" said BlueGreen's Harris.
For now, it's up to the Biden administration to head off the prospect of ""shenanigans"" as best - and quickly - as it can.
""Everyone should say a prayer for agency staff,"" Taylor said. ""They're going to have a busy few months.""

News Max,Trump Blames Lack of Security for Smaller Wisconsin Venue,"Former President Donald Trump has attributed the downsizing of a recent rally in Wisconsin to insufficient security, claiming that the White House prevented a more extensive gathering by failing to provide necessary support.
During a live broadcast on Newsmax, former President Donald Trump, speaking to a crowd in Saginaw, Michigan, voiced his frustration over inadequate security at a recent Wisconsin rally. Originally planned as a large outdoor gathering, the event was scaled down due to what Trump described as insufficient security arrangements.
""I just left Wisconsin. We, four days ago — five days ago — we had a sort of a rally. It wasn't supposed to be. Sixty thousand people showed up in Wisconsin, but the White House wouldn't give us proper security coverage.""
According to Trump, the campaign had anticipated a much larger turnout, but with limited security personnel, the event was moved to a smaller indoor venue.
""So, we end up in a room of about 900 people. You have 60,000 people, 50-60,000 people outside waiting, but they don't want that because they don't want crowds,"" Trump continued.
He labeled the situation a ""disgrace"" and assured his supporters that those unable to attend in Wisconsin remained enthusiastic.
""To those people in Wisconsin that didn't make it, I think they love us. And I think they're going to vote,"" he added.
Multiple sources told CBS News that the planned rally was initially set for an outdoor location at an airport in Wisconsin. However, due to security concerns, the venue was switched to a smaller indoor arena in Prairie du Chien.
The Secret Service, responsible for overseeing security at such events, indicated they were short-staffed, partly due to the annual United Nations General Assembly in New York. The gathering requires additional security resources to protect foreign dignitaries visiting the U.S.
Trump also used the moment to highlight his standing in the polls, claiming, ""By the way, we're up in all of the polls. We're up in every swing state. Doing great.""

News Max,NY Times/Siena Poll: Harris Leads Trump by 3 Points,"Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris leads Republican Donald Trump by 3 points head to head nationally, four weeks away from Election Day, according to the latest New York Times/Siena College poll released Tuesday.
Harris leads Trump 49% to 46%, with 5% refusing to answer or responding ""don't know.""
It's the first time Harris has led in the poll since becoming the Democrat nominee in July, according to the Times. Trump and Harris were tied at 47% each in the NYT/Siena survey in mid-September.
Among independents, however, Trump leads Harris 48% to 47%, according to the poll results. Harris, meanwhile, pulls in 9% of those surveyed identifying as Republican.
Harris also owns a 3-point lead over Trump in a multicandidate field, 47% to 44%, according to the survey. The NYT/Siena poll is in line with the RealClearPolitics national polling average, which shows Harris with a 2-point lead on Tuesday.
In the NYT/Siena poll, Trump leads Harris on the issue of the economy, the No. 1 issue among those surveyed.
Nearly half of those surveyed (47%) said the country's current economic conditions are ""poor,"" and nearly one-third (28%) said the economy was their No. 1 issue in next month's election, more than double the second-biggest issue, abortion (14%), according to the poll.
To that end, Trump leads Harris 48% to 46% as the candidate who would ""do a better job of handling the issue you think is most important,"" according to the survey.
Despite a 3½-year run as vice president in the Biden administration, Harris leads Trump on a question of being the change candidate, 46% to 44%, according to the survey. However, Trump leads Harris 48% to 45% on the question of being a ""strong leader.""
The New York Times/Siena College nationwide poll of 3,385 likely voters was conducted from Sept. 29 to Oct. 6. The margin of sampling error is +/- 2.4 percentage points.

News Max,Biden: 'I Don't Believe There Is Going to Be an All-Out War',"President Joe Biden said on Thursday he did not believe there is going to be an ""all-out war"" in the Middle East, a region that has been on edge amid Israel's assaults in Gaza and Lebanon and escalation of the U.S. ally's tensions with Iran.
The president said that such a war can be avoided but more needed to be done to ensure that.
Asked how confident he was that such a war can be averted, he paused and told reporters: ""How confident are you it's not going to rain? Look, I don't believe there is going to be an all-out war. I think we can avoid it.""
He added: ""But there is a lot to do yet, a lot to do yet.""
When asked if he would send American troops to help Israel, he responded: ""We have already helped Israel. We are going to protect Israel.""
Tensions between Iran and Israel have been high as Israel has been weighing options to respond to Tehran's ballistic missile attack on Tuesday, which Iran had carried out in response to Israel's military action in Lebanon.
The latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict was triggered by Palestinian Hamas militants' Oct. 7 attack that killed 1,200, with about 250 taken as hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Israel's subsequent assault on Hamas-governed Gaza has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health ministry, and displaced nearly Gaza's entire population, caused a hunger crisis and led to genocide allegations that Israel denies.
Israel's recent military action in Lebanon has killed hundreds, wounded thousands and displaced a million. Israel says it is targeting Lebanese Iran-backed Hezbollah militants.

News Max,Americans in Puerto Rico Can't Vote for President. Their Anger at Trump Is Bubbling Up Anyway.,"A comic calling Puerto Rico garbage before a packed Donald Trump rally in New York was the latest humiliation for an island territory that has long suffered from mistreatment, residents said Monday in expressions of fury that could affect the presidential election.
Puerto Ricans cannot vote in general elections despite being U.S. citizens, but they can exert a powerful influence with relatives on the mainland. Phones across the island of 3.2 million people were ringing minutes after the speaker derided the U.S. territory Sunday night, and they still buzzed Monday.
Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris is competing with Trump to win over Puerto Rican communities in Pennsylvania and other swing states. Shortly after stand-up comic Tony Hinchcliffe said that, “I don’t know if you guys know this, but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it’s called Puerto Rico,” Puerto Rican reggaeton superstar Bad Bunny announced he was backing Harris.
Hinchcliffe's set also included lewd and racist comments about Latinos, Jews and Black people, all key constituencies in the election.
Milagros Serrano, 81, has a son who lives in the swing state of Pennsylvania and said the entire family was outraged by the comedian’s comments.
“He can’t be talking about Puerto Rico like that,” she said as she left for a medical appointment. “He’s the one who’s a piece of garbage.""
Puerto Rico became a U.S. territory in 1917, and the first large wave of migration occurred after World War II to ease labor shortages. There are now more Puerto Ricans in the U.S. than on the island.
Those who stayed behind say they often feel like second-class citizens because they can't vote in presidential elections and receive limited federal funding compared with U.S. states.
That festering resentment erupted when Trump visited Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria slammed into the island as a powerful Category 4 storm in 2017. Photographed lobbing paper towels into a crowd -- the image is oft cited by Trump critics as evidence of callousness -- he also challenged the storm’s official death toll, with experts estimating that nearly 3,000 people died in the sweltering aftermath.
After Sunday's rally, a senior adviser for the Trump campain, Danielle Alvarez, said in a statement that Hinchcliffe’s joke did “not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign.”
José Acevedo, a 48-year-old health worker from San Juan, shook his head as he recalled the feelings that coursed through him when he watched the rally.
“What humiliation, what discrimination!” he said early Monday as he waited to catch a public bus to work.
Acevedo said he immediately texted relatives in New York, including an uncle who is a Republican and had planned to vote for Trump.
“He told me that he was going to have to analyze his decision,” Acevedo said, adding that his relatives were in shock. “They couldn’t believe it.”
The comments dominated local news sites late into the night and prompted Jenniffer González, Puerto Rico’s representative in Congress for the pro-statehood New Progressive Party and a Trump supporter, to call them “despicable, misguided and disgusting.”
“They do not represent the values of the GOP,” she said.
Politics in Puerto Rico are defined by the island’s political status, so it’s common to see Democrats and Republicans be members of the same local party.
Meanwhile, Gov. Pedro Pierluisi, a Democrat, wrote on Facebook: “Garbage is what came out of Tony Hinchcliffe’s mouth, and everyone who applauded him should feel ashamed for disrespecting Puerto Rico.”
González, who beat Pierluisi in their party's primary, is leading in the polls as the Nov. 5 election looms.
Sonia Pérez, a 58-year-old parking lot attendant, said she hasn’t voted for a governor in years but is so angry about the comedian’s comments and González’s support for Trump that she plans to reject González and the other candidate representing the two main parties that have long dominated in Puerto Rico.
“It is outrageous that in the 21st century there is so much racism against Latinos when we have contributed so much to the country and it is not recognized,” she said.
Hinchcliffe’s comments also prompted reaction from Puerto Rican stars including Ricky Martin, who previously endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. He posted a video of the crude joke and wrote, “This is what they think of us.”
Outraged Puerto Ricans posted pictures of their island and its bright turquoise waters on social media with captions including: “I live where you vacation” and “Proud to be from the garbage island.”
Michael Meléndez Ortiz, a 33-year-old unemployed janitor, said he and a friend thought the video was fake at first because they were so taken aback by what the comedian said.
“We must be respected,” he said. “We are good and upstanding people.”

News Max,"Adams' Fundraising Stalls After Indictment, May Lose Funds","New York Mayor Eric Adams' fundraising has stopped following his federal indictment, threatening his access to vital public matching funds for his 2025 reelection campaign. Despite a significant financial lead over challengers, his legal troubles cast uncertainty over his political future, Politico reported.
Adams, known for his impressive fundraising ability, has seen a notable drop in contributions since his recent federal indictment. In the past 2 1/2 weeks, Adams' campaign has received just a $250 donation, marking a dramatic slowdown for the mayor.
His latest filing with the New York City Campaign Finance Board, covering the past three months, shows that he raised $212,416, a significant dip from his usual fundraising pace.
This drop contrasts sharply with the fundraising surge experienced by former President Donald Trump, who raised over $15 million following his conviction. Trump has aggressively sought donations by leveraging his legal battles, a strategy that Adams has not employed.
Adams' campaign lacks a dedicated website for contributions, and his team does not engage in standard email or text fundraising solicitations. Instead, his efforts have been focused on in-person events, such as a recent fundraiser hosted by his brother at a Chinese restaurant in Queens and a birthday party in Manhattan.
Adams is also raising money for his legal defense fund, though those donations have similarly slowed. A quarterly report on that fund is expected soon, but insiders familiar with the situation have noted a pause in solicitations after the indictment.
Despite the recent decline in contributions, Adams' campaign remains financially robust. His team reported raising $4.14 million for his reelection and still holds $3.11 million in cash. This gives him a substantial advantage over his declared opponents, including City Comptroller Brad Lander and former Comptroller Scott Stringer, who have raised $967,381 and $591,116, respectively.
However, Adams' legal troubles could jeopardize the public matching funds his campaign anticipates. The Campaign Finance Board has not yet decided whether to grant Adams the $4.35 million his team says it has qualified for.
The mayor is accused of running an illegal straw donor scheme, and board officials are expected to factor in the indictment when reviewing his eligibility for public funds. Even if Adams does qualify, the board has already flagged a third of the matching fund claims as ""invalid.""
Adams has refunded nearly $83,000 in donations during this period, a higher-than-usual amount that raises further questions about the status of his fundraising operation. In contrast, Lander is on track to receive as much as $3.49 million in public funds by December, while Stringer expects $2.47 million.
Adams' financial lead could be threatened if his opponents receive matching funds. Lander's campaign is optimistic about the situation.
""With Brad's strong fundraising and major questions swirling around Eric Adams' ability to qualify for matching funds due to his federal indictment, Brad Lander has raised the most money — and has the most to spend — of any candidate for mayor,"" said Lander senior adviser Rebecca Rodriguez.

News Max,"Biden Warns of Threat From Milton, Condemns Misinformation","President Joe Biden warned on Wednesday that Hurricane Milton carried incredible destructiveness, as he urged people to take safe shelter and condemned misinformation about the storm as un-American.
“It’s harmful to those that need help,” Biden said of misinformation on the storm and the government's response.
Biden also said former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, was spreading misinformation about the federal hurricane response.
Trump, who is running against Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, has sought to portray the Biden-Harris administration's response to recent storms as ineffective.
“It is dangerous – it is unconscionable, frankly, that anyone who would consider themselves a leader would mislead desperate people to the point that those desperate people would not receive the aid to which they are entitled, and that’s why I call it dangerous,” Harris said, according to CNN.

News Max,Trump Gains Momentum in Swing State Polls as Race Tightens,"Former President Donald Trump is seeing an uptick in key battleground state polls, with Vice President Kamala Harris' early leads fading as the presidential race narrows in its final weeks, The Hill reported.
As the 2024 presidential election nears its final stretch, polls in crucial swing states show a shift toward former President Trump. Polling averages from The Hill and Decision Desk HQ (DDHQ) indicate a tightening race, with both Trump and Vice President Harris having an equal chance of victory. Harris' initial post-debate boost has dissipated, leaving both campaigns in a dead heat.
Trump's polling surge has raised concerns among Democrats, especially given his history of outperforming expectations. However, Harris' team remains hopeful that issues like abortion will energize her base.
Arizona
The Hill/DDHQ average shows that Trump currently leads in Arizona by 1.7 points. Recent polls have solidified his lead, including a New York Times/Siena College poll showing him ahead by 6 points. This marks a significant shift from 2020 when President Biden narrowly won the state. Meanwhile, Arizona's Senate race, featuring Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego and Republican Kari Lake, is drawing attention, though Harris faces an uphill battle here.
Georgia
Trump holds a 1.9-point lead in Georgia, his largest lead among battleground states. This marks a reversal from earlier polling, which had Harris ahead. A recent Quinnipiac poll showed Trump up by 6 points. Early voting began this week with record turnout, and Harris is set to campaign alongside former President Obama to boost Black voter turnout.
Michigan
In Michigan, Trump holds a narrow 0.7-point lead in The Hill/DDHQ average, while other polling sources show Harris with a slight edge. Concerns over the Biden-Harris administration's stance on Israel may affect Arab American voters in the state, while labor support remains a question mark. Both candidates are effectively tied in recent polls, keeping Michigan highly competitive.
Nevada
Nevada is also closely contested, with Harris leading by just 0.2 points in the Hill/DDHQ average. The state's six electoral votes are crucial, and service industry workers play a key role. Although polling has been sparse in recent weeks, a Trafalgar poll shows Harris up by only 1 point, making Nevada a battleground to watch.
North Carolina
Trump leads by 1 point in North Carolina. Early voting began Thursday, with a record-breaking 353,000 ballots cast on the first day. Harris leads by 3 points in one Quinnipiac poll, but other surveys show Trump with a slight edge. Trump's visit to flood-hit Asheville may have affected voters' views in the state.
Pennsylvania
Pennsylvania, with 19 electoral votes, is critical. Harris holds a slim lead of 0.3 points in the Hill/DDHQ average. Democrats argue that GOP-leaning polls are skewing the numbers, but a New York Times/Siena poll gives Harris a 4-point advantage among likely voters. Both campaigns are investing heavily in the state, with nearly $300 million spent on political ads.
Wisconsin
In Wisconsin, Trump holds a slight 0.5-point lead in the Hill/DDHQ average, with Harris' former 5-point lead eroding. Recent polls favor Trump, making Wisconsin a key battleground.

News Max,NY Times: US Business Can't Afford Trump,"The New York Times published an editorial Saturday warning ""American business leaders cannot afford to stand passive and silent"" and recommending they ""defend American democracy by publicly opposing"" former President Donald Trump's candidacy.
""Donald Trump and his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, have sketched out versions of their parties' traditional positions on issues like taxation, trade and regulation that are well within the give-and-take of politics. In this election, however, stability itself is also at stake,"" the editorial board wrote.
""Mr. Trump denies the legitimacy of elections, defies constitutional limits on presidential power and boasts of plans to punish his enemies. And in these attacks on America's democracy, he is also attacking the foundations of American prosperity,"" the editorial read.
The Times then called out business leaders who support the former president.
""Some prominent corporate leaders — including Elon Musk, a founder of Tesla; the investors David Sacks and Bill Ackman; and the financier Stephen Schwarzman — have been supportive of Mr. Trump's candidacy. Beyond pure cynicism, it's nearly impossible to understand why,"" the editorial read.
Noting that ""business leaders ... may be skeptical of Ms. Harris' policies, uneasy because they don't feel they know enough about how she would govern or worried that she may not be open to hearing their concerns,"" the editorial board warned they should be ""afraid of the consequences"" should Trump win.
Noting Trump ""again refused to commit to accepting the results of the 2024 election,"" the board wrote, ""That comes on the heels of remarks in which he declared that he regards his political opponents as an 'enemy from within' and that he would consider deploying the military against them merely for opposing his bid for the presidency.""
While the former president ""may seem like a novelty in American politics,"" the board wrote, Trump ""is a familiar type.""
""[P]opulists often win elections by promising pro-business policies that will unleash economic growth. Once in office, however, they don't just fiddle with the knobs; they break the machinery,"" the editorial read.
""They undermine economic stability by attacking and delegitimizing people and institutions, inside or outside the government, who might challenge or correct bad economic decisions,"" the board wrote, likening Trump to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The board quoted a recent Harvard Business Review article, ""Populists undermine the operating environment capitalism depends on — most notably, free competition and a predictable rule of law,"" and called out Trump's ""attacks on the integrity of federal data and on government experts,"" calling them ""examples of the ways in which he already pursues these strategies.""
""Business leaders often say they hate uncertainty about taxes and regulation even more than they hate taxes and regulation. Mr. Trump is the personification of uncertainty,"" the board wrote, noting ""a populist's favor is capricious; there's no way to predict who might end up on a Trump enemies list or why.""
""Even by a traditional policy scorecard, Mr. Trump would do damage to American business,"" the board wrote, calling out the former president's plans for tariffs and mass deportations, his desire to advise the Federal Reserve, and his proposed tax cuts, saying they would increase the federal debt.
The board concluded by asking if the former president ""ever takes the long view"" or ""ever put the American public interest first,"" writing that Trump ""is not running as a champion of business"" but as a ""tribune of populist grievance"" and calling on all Americans to ""publicly oppose his candidacy.""

News Max,Bill O'Reilly to Newsmax: 'Stunning' Harris Agrees With Biden's Policies,"Appearing on Newsmax on Thursday, former news anchor Bill O'Reilly expressed shock at Vice President Kamala Harris' recent claim that she would not change any of President Joe Biden's policies and said the administration's track record has been disastrous by ""every measure.""
While on ""Finnerty,"" O'Reilly, author of ""Confronting the Presidents"" and a registered independent, described the Biden-Harris administration as one of the worst in U.S. history, criticizing its handling of immigration, inflation, and foreign policy.
In his book, O'Reilly said, he ranked Biden as the second-worst president.
""The reason I have Biden so far down the list of bad presidents is that he created the problems,"" he said.
""Biden created the open border. It was his order that allowed between 10 and 15 million foreign nationals to come into this country unattended. That's insane.
""He created inflation by putting up regulations that made it more difficult for the gas and fossil fuel industry to market their product, which then ignited the price rises in food and gasoline at the pump. He did it,"" O'Reilly said.
""He surrendered in Afghanistan. He's the commander in chief. He didn't have to do that, which emboldened our enemies all over the world.
""This guy has been such a disaster as a president. It's stunning. To have Kamala Harris say she wouldn't do anything differently is even more stunning,"" he said.
""Because I'm not a partisan. I'm not a Republican. I'm a registered independent. But I do look at facts. And when I'm hearing this, 'Oh, there was nothing wrong with the Biden administration. It was great.' No, it wasn't by every measure,"" he said.

News Max,ABC Poll: Harris Regains 4-Point Lead Among Likely Voters,"Vice President Kamala Harris has resurged to a national lead outside the margin of error among likely voters (51%-47%) in the latest ABC News/Ipsos poll, but the race remains a statistical tie among registered voters.
Notably, the national popular vote of a democracy does not decide the election in America's constitutional republic, putting the race on the individual states.
With registered voters remaining with a statistical tie at 2 points (49%-47%), the get-out-the-vote campaigns in key battleground states in the Electoral College will decide the race in the final two weeks before Nov. 5 Election Day.
""In one potential indicator of turnout, the candidates are close in voter enthusiasm — 88% of Harris supporters are enthusiastic about her, as are 85% of Trump's about him,"" according to ABC News' analysis. ""In another, Harris maintains a slight edge in voter contact, with Americans overall 5 points more apt to have been contacted by her campaign than by Trump's.
""In the seven battleground states, though, it's a nonsignificant 4 points — and the 50-47% race there remains the equivalent of a dead heat.""
ABC News' analysis admitted ""some pro-Harris groups showing a bit more propensity to vote"" expands her statistical tie among registered voters to a lead outside the margin of error among likely voters. Also, the margins of the polls move on independent voters, which are statistically tied among registered voters but surge to Harris by 4 points among likely voters.
The ABC News poll two weeks ago has shown Trump surging ahead, but Sunday's edition showed a wobble back to Harris.
Trump leads on these issues (among registered voters):
- Trump up 12 points on immigration.
- Trump up 8 points on the economy overall.
- Trump up 7 points on inflation.
- Trump up 7 points on war in the Middle East.
Harris leads on these issues (among registered voters):
- Harris up 15 points on abortion.
- Harris up 11 points on mental sharpness needed to serve as president.
- Harris up 10 points on healthcare.
- Harris up 8 points on ""protecting American democracy.""
- Harris up 6 points on helping the middle class.
The importance on economy or inflation have waned 7 points since September, according to ABC News, but those remain the top concerns in this election for 90% and 85% of registered voters respectively.
Early voting has been heavily siding with Democrats, as the 8% of adults and 10% of registered voters who have said they have already voted have gone with Harris 62% over Trump 33%.
The largest margins for Harris come among Black voters, as she leads by 70 points among all Black adults and 83 points among Black likely voters (90%-7%).
Langer Research Associates and Ipsos conducted the poll for ABC News among 2,808 adults, 2,392 registered voters, and 1,913 likely voters. The results have margins of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points for adults and registered voters and 2.5 points for likely voters.

News Max,"Trump Will Become First Major 2024 Candidate to Visit Majority-Arab Dearborn, Mich.","Donald Trump is set to visit Dearborn, Michigan — the nation’s largest Arab-majority city — on Friday, according to a local business owner who first insisted the former president call for peace in Lebanon before hosting him.
Metro Detroit is home to nation's largest concentration of Arab Americans, with a large chunk of them living in Dearborn. The city — which President Joe Biden won by a 3-to-1 margin — has been roiled by political turmoil, with many upset with the Biden administration's handling of the Israel-Hamas war.
While Vice President Kamala Harris has been working through surrogates to ease community tensions, Trump’s visit will mark the first by either candidate, according to a local leader, Osama Siblani. Earlier this year, Harris met with the city's Democratic mayor, Abdullah Hammoud, though their discussion took place outside Dearborn.
Sam Abbas, the owner of The Great Commoner in Dearborn, told The Associated Press that Trump was set to visit his restaurant.
“We expect some remarks around ending the war and bringing peace to the Middle East,” said Abbas. “I’m not here to get political. I’m not here to tell people which way I’m voting. I am simply here because our family is being slaughtered and we just want to end the war. Stop the bombing.”
Israel invaded Gaza after Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack and last month launched an invasion of Lebanon to suppress Hezbollah, the militia that has continuously launched rockets into Israeli territory. At least 43,000 people have died in Gaza, according to Gaza’s health ministry, which does not distinguish in its death toll between combatants and civilians.
The Trump campaign declined to comment on the visit. It follows Trump’s rally in Michigan last week, when he brought local Muslims up onstage with him. Trump has also received endorsements from two Democratic mayors of Muslim-majority cities.
While many Democratic leaders in the community have not endorsed Harris, they are still deeply negative toward Trump and say his endorsements don’t reflect a majority of the community. They also remember his call for a “total and complete shutdown” on Muslims entering the country and his travel restrictions on visitors from Muslim-majority countries. And some point out that Trump has suggested he would give Israel even more leeway to attack its rivals in the region.
Even so, Democrats worry that traditionally loyal voters may shift to Trump or third-party candidates like Jill Stein — or skip the top of the ballot altogether. This could prove pivotal in Michigan, a state both parties see as a toss-up.
Abbas said Trump allies had reached out to him several weeks ago about hosting Trump in Dearborn. Before hosting Trump, Abbas said he wanted to see a statement from Trump that he said showed Trump “has the intentions of ending the war and helping us rebuild Lebanon and helping the displaced and the injured.”
That statement came Wednesday, when Trump posted on X that he wanted to “stop the suffering and destruction in Lebanon.”
“I will preserve the equal partnership among all Lebanese communities,” Trump said on X. “Your friends and family in Lebanon deserve to live in peace, prosperity, and harmony with their neighbors, and that can only happen with peace and stability in the Middle East.”
Once Trump put out the statement, Abbas said he agreed to host the event. He expects close to 100 people from the community.
“He’s coming to us to basically tell us, look, I did what you guys asked. My intentions, my true intentions are to bring peace and to end the war,” said Abbas.

News Max,YouGov Poll: Harris Leads Trump by 2 Points Nationally,"Vice President Kamala Harris leads former President Donald Trump nationally by 2 percentage points among registered voters according to an Economist/YouGov poll released Wednesday.
Harris leads Trump 48%-46% among registered voters with 3% still undecided. Among likely voters, Harris’ lead increases from 49%-46%. When asked, regardless of prefered candidate, who the respondents felt would win the election, 39% felt Trump would win compared to 36% for Harris with 25% not sure.
The survey also found:
- 65% feel the country is on the wrong track.
- Only 38% are extremely enthusiastic about voting in this coming election.
- 41% plan to vote in person on Election Day.
- 30% felt they were better off four years ago.
The survey was conducted on Oct. 19-22 among 1,422 registered voters and carries a margin of error of 3.2 percentage points.

News Max,Gov. Noem to Newsmax: Biden Shows True Colors With 'Garbage' Quip,"Republican South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem told Newsmax on Wednesday that President Joe Biden's comments referring to supporters of former President Donald Trump as ""garbage"" just ""revealed what his true thoughts are.""
On Tuesday, video surfaced of Biden speaking at a Voto Latino get-out-the-vote call where he said, ""Donald Trump has no character. He doesn't give a damn about the Latino community. Just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage. The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.""
Noem told ""Rob Schmitt Tonight"" the comments merely illustrate what ""Biden and Harris and the Democrats really do think about Trump supporters.""
""I think what's shocking to everybody is that they were so dumb to actually say it this close to the election,"" she said. ""And then I also think that the media trying to spin it the way that they are ... they must think we're all idiots. To think we would actually fall for the fact that they weren't referring to Trump supporters.""
Noem added although the comments were revealing, there are ""bigger issues to talk about in this election.""
""At the end of the day, people are suffering, and they need a better economy and more money in their pockets,"" she said.

News Max,Trump Team Rips Judge's Document Dump,"After a federal judge ordered the release of some 1,900 additional documents related to former President Donald Trump's Jan. 6 case, the Trump campaign on Friday blasted the move.
""With just over two weeks until Election Day, President Trump is dominating this race and crazed liberals throughout the deep state are freaking out,"" campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told a media outlet.
Cheung added: ""As mandated by the Supreme Court's historic decision on presidential immunity and other vital jurisprudence, this entire case is a sham and a partisan, unconstitutional witch hunt that should be dismissed entirely — as should all of the remaining Democrat hoaxes.""
On Friday morning, before the records were released, Trump appeared on ""The Dan Bongino Show,"" calling special counsel Jack Smith a ""sick puppy."" Trump also ripped U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan as ""the most evil person."" He added, ""They all said, 'Well, make sure you don't get Chutkan.' And who did I get? I got Chutkan.""
The unsealed evidence was heavily redacted and mostly contained material that had already been made public. Other pages were blanked out and marked ""sealed.""
Smith's court filing didn't introduce much new information, but it provided accounts of Trump's conversations with his family and close aides. A compilation of the evidence was submitted alongside the filing, but its public release was postponed to allow the former president time to challenge it.
Trump's legal team argued that none of the documents should be made public before the Nov. 5 election and managed to delay the release by a week. However, they ultimately decided not to appeal Chutkan's decision to release redacted versions of the evidence.
Trump has pleaded not guilty to four criminal charges in the case, in which he is accused of conspiring to overturn the 2020 election.
Newsmax reached out to the Trump campaign for comment.

News Max,Fmr Va. Gov. James Gilmore to Newsmax: Debates Are 'Setup' Against GOP,"Election-year debates, such as this week's between vice presidential nominees JD Vance and Tim Walz, are a ""real problem"" as the national news networks are setting them up to go against Republican candidates, former Virginia Gov. James Gilmore told Newsmax on Thursday.
""This is a real problem when these debates are bequeathed to the national news media like CBS,"" Gilmore said on Newsmax's ""Wake Up America."" ""This debate was a setup. The last question that was asked just demanded that Vance either break from [Donald] Trump, the ticket leader or look bad. That was what the goal was.""
Up until that point, Vance, a GOP senator from Ohio, and Walz, the Democrat governor of Minnesota, were being civil, but with the last question, Walz ""becomes an attack dog,"" said Gilmore.
That, the former governor said, ""indicated to me that that last question was a setup and that he knew that was coming.""
""He was trained on what his answer was going to be,"" he said. ""The national news people just don't have the credibility anymore to do this. These ladies who were on there, they're basically liberal teleprompter readers. This is not what we should be doing in the future.""
Meanwhile, Gilmore said it isn't known whether the Vance-Walz debate changed anything as far as the upcoming election is concerned, but he still believes the event was important.
""Vance had been under tremendous attack for weeks and weeks and weeks, saying that he was unqualified, that he was crazy, that he was extreme, and he presented himself very, very well,"" said Gilmore. ""This was also Walz's first opportunity to say anything nationally. Nobody really knows Walz, and I'm not sure that the debate has cleaned that up for him.""
Gilmore added that he believes Vance won the debate, ""mainly because he came across as presidential or vice presidential, and I thought he did a very good job.""
But he also said he thinks the topics in the debate were ""skewed,"" toward the Democrats' platform.
""There was no longer a question about crime,"" he said. ""It was, instead, Let's blame guns. And then there was no longer a question about debt and inflation. It was, Well, how can we give away money to first-time homeowners? Give away money? How can we do these things while ignoring the national debt, which is a national crisis right now?""
And those ""liberal setups"" put the Republican Party, not just candidates, at a ""disadvantage,"" said Gilmore.
""The public shouldn't have a debate where one side is put at a disadvantage,"" he said. ""That's what happens in these debates.""

News Max,Trump Again Tries to Move N.Y. Case to Federal Court,"Donald Trump's lawyers pushed Monday to transfer to federal court the case in which he was convicted in a New York state court on charges involving covering up a payment paid to an adult film star, a move that would give him the ability to end the prosecution if he regains the presidency.
His lawyers renewed the request in a brief filed with the Manhattan-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals as they appealed U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein's Sept. 3 ruling rejecting the shift to federal court. Trump was convicted in May of 34 felony counts of falsifying documents.
In their brief, Trump's lawyers cited the U.S. Supreme Court's July 1 decision that former presidents cannot be prosecuted for official actions taken in office. In the case, they said, jurors had improperly seen evidence of Trump's official acts as president.
His lawyers said the state charges intruded on the authority of the presidency under the U.S. Constitution.
Trump is the Republican candidate facing Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris in the Nov. 5 election. If he wins, he could seek to pardon himself for any federal crime or have his new Justice Department leadership dismiss any criminal cases pending against him in federal court. State criminal charges are beyond the reach of presidential pardon authority or Justice Department action.
Under U.S. law, civil or criminal cases pursued against federal officials may be moved to federal court if they relate to do their duties in office.
Trump's lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove wrote that prosecutors' ""use of official-acts evidence in grand jury proceedings and at trial violated the Constitution and threatens the ability of all future Presidents to fulfill that role.""
Trump was convicted by a jury in May of falsifying business records to cover up a payment of $130,000 made by his former lawyer Michael Cohen to adult film actress Stormy Daniels for her silence before the 2016 election about a sexual encounter she has said she had with Trump a decade earlier. The case was brought by the office of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat.
Trump denies the encounter with Daniels. He has vowed to appeal the verdict after his sentencing, which is scheduled for Nov. 26.
The Supreme Court's immunity ruling, arising from an appeal related to federal criminal charges against Trump over his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden, held that evidence of a former president's official acts cannot be used in criminal cases about otherwise personal conduct.
Trump's lawyers have argued that the Supreme Court's decision meant the case should be dismissed. Trump pleaded not guilty in the Manhattan case and the federal election-related case.
Hellerstein denied Trump's request to move the case to federal court, finding that the trial dealt with ""private, unofficial acts, outside the bounds of executive authority.""
If the 2nd Circuit rules against Trump, he could ask the Supreme Court — whose 6-3 conservative majority includes three justices he nominated — to hear the matter.
A spokesperson for Bragg's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The 2nd Circuit has not given Bragg's office a deadline to respond to Trump's brief.

News Max,Rep. Meuser to Newsmax: Pennsylvania Counties Shift Red,"Pennsylvania, which will be instrumental in picking the next president, is seeing a shift in many counties from blue to red, Rep. Dan Meuser told Newsmax on Thursday.
The Pennsylvania Republican, who spoke Wednesday at a rally held by GOP vice presidential candidate Sen. J.D. Vance in Williamsport, told Newsmax's ""Wake Up America"" that ""the results of this election are going to determine the direction of this country.""
He noted that in Luzerne County, where he lives, the Republicans' numbers climbed from being at ""negative 20,000 Republicans"" to being up over 1,000, meaning a ""21,000 vote swing in general.""
And statewide, Republicans are up almost 420,000, ""so we're very happy about that,"" Meuser said.
Further, there are ""many metrics on our side,"" he said, as the race is not just about voters being remorseful over Vice President Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden's administration, but also enthusiasm for former President Donald Trump,"" he added.
""They have a terrible record, and here we have Kamala saying how I can't think of a thing different I would do, and she can't because she doesn't think much, frankly,"" said Meuser. ""And secondly, she doesn't have any new ideas except price controls and silly things like that.""
Harris also has an ""ideology"" where Biden had more of a middle-of-the-road approach.
""That's why Pennsylvania liked him for decades,"" he said. ""But he turned into an extreme liberal. Kamala is a radical ideologue … she is going to be spending if she, God forbid, gets in, spending on go green, or else taxes [which are a] tax on the corporations. She's going to kill American manufacturing.""
But Americans must understand that you ""get what you vote for,"" said Meuser, including on open borders and ""outrageous spending.""
""This is serious stuff,"" he said. ""That's what's on the ballot.""
Meanwhile, the polls remain tight between Harris and Trump, but it's important for Republicans to keep registering voters and getting people to send in their ballots, said Meuser.
""Early voting is happening right now,"" he said. ""I've already voted in person, and it was a good experience. So we're pushing that you might as well vote early. Let's bank your vote.""
Meuser said that the more that voters know Harris ""the less they like her, the less they trust her.""
Trump, meanwhile, ""delivers for all Americans,"" said Meuser. ""He knows what he's talking about, and he knows how to execute his plans. He knows how to get things done and get results.""

News Max,Trump in Michigan: Disaster Relief Money Spent on Illegals,"During a Thursday rally in Saginaw, Michigan, former President Donald Trump expressed frustration over the Federal Emergency Management Agency's lack of funds, attributing the shortfall to spending on illegal migrants instead of critical domestic needs like disaster relief.
The rally, broadcast live on Newsmax, featured Trump criticizing the Biden administration's handling of Hurricane Helene's destruction.
""Can you imagine another four years like we've lived the last four?"" Trump asked the crowd.
He pointed to recent natural disasters, saying the federal government cannot provide adequate aid.
""People are dying in North Carolina,"" he said. ""They're dying all over those five or six states. They're dying, and they're getting no help from our federal government because they have no money.
""Their money's been spent on people that should not be in our country.""
He added, ""If lyin' Kamala [Harris] gets four more years, instead of a golden age, America will instead be plunged into a dark age. Your family finances will be permanently destroyed. Your borders will be gone forever.""
Trump continued his critique of immigration policies, claiming that the nation's borders are effectively nonexistent.
""When you think of it, right, we don't have any borders,"" he told the audience. ""You're a border state now. You know they're welcome. Congratulations. Tens of millions more illegal aliens will invade our cities and towns.
""Medicare and Social Security will buckle and collapse from the weight of all of these people becoming proud members of our Social Security system. Isn't that nice?"" he asked.
Trump's comments come amid growing concerns about the federal government's ability to meet the needs of communities affected by Hurricane Helene, which has killed more than 160 people.
Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas acknowledged on Wednesday that FEMA does not have enough money to support the hurricane victims, according to Newsweek.
At least $640 million of FEMA's funding is currently being spent on addressing the needs of communities facing an influx of migrants.

News Max,McDonald's: 'We Open Our Doors to Everyone',"Following former President Donald Trump's brief stint behind the counter at a Pennsylvania location, McDonald's reaffirmed its commitment to political neutrality, clarifying that the fast-food giant does not endorse political candidates.
McDonald's reiterated its stance on political neutrality after Trump made an appearance at a Pennsylvania franchise, briefly working at the drive-thru window and making fries. Responding to the incident, the fast-food giant emphasized that it does not endorse any political candidates and aimed to distance itself from any political implications of the visit.
""As we've seen, our brand has been a fixture of conversation this election cycle. While we've not sought this, it's a testament to how much McDonald's resonates with so many Americans,"" the company said in a statement released Monday. ""McDonald's does not endorse candidates for elected office, and that remains true in this race for the next President. We are not red or blue — we are golden.""
Trump's appearance at a Bucks County location on Sunday involved him briefly serving customers in the drive-thru lane, a move that quickly garnered attention. The company clarified that the request for the visit came through the local franchisee and was handled per McDonald's core values.
""Upon learning of the former President's request, we approached it through the lens of one of our core values: we open our doors to everyone,"" the statement continued. ""It's with that same approach that franchisees have invited Vice President [Kamala] Harris and [Minnesota] Governor [Tim] Walz to their restaurants in order to share how McDonald's provides meaningful pathways to economic opportunity and feeds and fosters local communities.""
The visit came weeks after Trump taunted Harris for her experience working at McDonald's during her college years. Harris says she had worked at a McDonald's while earning her degree at Howard University, an experience she has frequently referenced in her political campaigns to connect with middle-class voters.
The Harris campaign launched an advertisement in August highlighting her working-class background and her time at McDonald's. The ad aimed to appeal to middle-class voters and emphasized her journey from student worker to public office.
In the Monday statement, McDonald's acknowledged its longstanding relationship with political figures but reiterated its nonpartisan stance.
""Though we are not a political brand, we've been proud to hear former President Trump's love for McDonald's and Vice President Harris' fond memories working under the arches.""
In April, consumers worldwide, particularly in Arab and Muslim-majority countries, boycotted the brand over what they see as support for Israel — a claim the chain's management denies.
This backlash followed a decision by Israel's franchisees to provide free McDonald's meals to Israeli soldiers after the Hamas-led terror attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed roughly 1,200 people in Israel and resulted in 253 hostages being taken, CNBC reported.

News Max,Judge Directs Prosecutors to Turn over Info Related to Pence Documents Probe,"The federal judge overseeing the election interference case against Donald Trump directed prosecutors Wednesday to search for and provide to the former president's lawyers any Justice Department information related to a separate investigation into Mike Pence's handling of classified documents.
Trump's lawyers had argued that that information could be relevant to their defense to the extent it shows that Pence, Trump's vice president, had “an incentive to curry favor with authorities” and implicate Trump while facing his own investigation into the retention of classified documents in his Indiana home.
Special counsel Jack Smith's team has said it had no involvement in the Pence investigation and has “no discoverable information” on the case ""beyond what has been publicly reported.” But U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan ordered Smith's team to look for and produce any additional records on the investigation, noting that defense lawyers are entitled to cite evidence of a witness's uncharged conduct as a way to undermine that witness's credibility.
“Defendant is correct that information suggesting a potential witness’s motives for implicating him may be material,” Chutkan wrote.
The judge's order, though, mostly rejected the categories of evidence that Trump had sought from prosecutors, saying his lawyers failed to make the case that the information was relevant to his defense against charges that he illegally schemed to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.
That includes a wide swath of documents related to that election and the Jan. 6, 2021, riot including information related to security at the Capitol and any details about undercover government agents who may have been there.
Trump also unsuccessfully sought a complete version of the U.S. intelligence community's assessment that Russia had interfered in the 2016 presidential election, as well as information regarding foreign actors’ efforts to influence the 2020 election to support the defense’s argument that “Trump and others acted in good faith even if certain reports were ultimately determined to be inaccurate.”
But the judge said details about foreign entities working to influence the American public in 2020 had no bearing on the current case.
“Whether Defendant sought to undermine public confidence in the election to legitimize or otherwise further his criminal conspiracies does not depend on whether other nations also tried to achieve similar results for their own purposes,” the judge wrote.
Pence appeared before a grand jury investigating Trump in April 2023 after a federal appeals court rejected an effort by Trump's lawyers to block his testimony on executive privilege grounds. That June, Justice Department officials informed his lawyers that he would not face any criminal charges following the discovery months earlier of about a dozen documents with classified markings at his home.
No evidence has ever emerged to suggest that Pence intentionally hid documents from the government or even knew they were in his home, so there was never an expectation that he would face charges.
The two other buckets of information that Chutkan directed prosecutors to produce relate to any details Pence was given during a meeting with military officials about security measures that would be in place at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and information that Trump's director of national intelligence reviewed before he was interviewed by prosecutors.
It's unclear when or even if the election interference case will reach trial in light of a Supreme Court opinion from July that conferred broad immunity on former presidents and narrowed the scope of allegations against Trump.
Chutkan is now tasked with determining which of the prosecution's claims against Trump can remain part of the case and which must be discarded, a process that will almost certainly result in further appeals.
If Trump is elected, his new attorney general will presumably seek the dismissal of the case.

News Max,Rep. Kelly to Newsmax: Trump Shows Resilience in Return to Butler,"Former President Donald Trump is set to return to Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday, rallying supporters at the very spot where he survived an assassination attempt in July.
Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., called the visit a testament to Trump's ""strong leadership.""
""This is a different person. This is a strong leader,"" Kelly, who was present at the rally and is chairman of the congressional investigation into the incident, told Newsmax's ""American Agenda.""
""I think he wants to make a statement to the American people: Look, I'm not worried about me. I'm worried about you.""
The congressman praised Trump's tenacity, noting the former president's consistent refusal to ""back away from everything"" despite challenges.
Kelly elaborated that Trump's return to Butler signifies unfinished business, as he plans to deliver the message he couldn't complete on that fateful day in July.
""'I am going to go back to the spot where my life was almost taken. I'm going to deliver the message that I wasn't able to deliver that day and wasn't able to complete,'"" Kelly quoted Trump as saying.
Anticipation for the rally is high among Trump's supporters in the Butler area. Kelly mentioned that ""thousands and thousands"" are expected to gather to hear Trump speak.
""It's going to be a big day for Butler,"" Kelly stated. ""They're all looking forward to seeing the president come back and finish his speech.""
The rally is expected to include a moment of reflection for the late Corey Comperatore, who was shot and killed in the July attack. Kelly noted that Comperatore's family, including his wife, Helen, and his daughters, will be honored during the event.
According to Kelly, Trump's resolve to speak once more from the same spot is a testament to the strength that has defined his career: ""He doesn't ever seem to tire. He doesn't ever seem to back away ... he just goes straight at it.""

News Max,Karoline Leavitt to Newsmax: Dems 'Despise' Trump Supporters,"Karoline Leavitt, the national press secretary for former President Donald Trump’s reelection campaign, hit out on Wednesday at Democrats for their rhetoric about Trump and his supporters.
President Joe Biden this week replied to former President Donald Trump’s supporters following controversial at his Madison Square Garden rally where a featured speaker called Puerto Rico ""a floating pile of garbage,"" saying, ""The only garbage I see floating out there is his [Trump’s] supporters.""
Leavitt told Newsmax during an appearance on ""Newsline"" that ""This is what the Democrat Party has become.""
She added, ""They not only hate Donald Trump, they despise the tens of millions of great Americans who support him.""
Leavitt compared the remark to 2016 Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s ""deplorables"" comment.
""In 2016, Hillary called them deplorable. Today you have Joe Biden calling them garbage. You have Tim Walz calling them Nazis. Over the past couple of weeks, Kamala Harris has likened them to fascists.""
Leavitt said that ""none of these assaults are true,"" adding, ""President Trump’s supporters are great Americans. They are law enforcement officers, moms and dads, business owners, Border Patrol agents, veterans who served honorably in our great country, and if the Democrat Party just took one second to maybe try and understand why tens of millions of Americans are supporting President Trump, maybe they would have a chance at winning this election.""
She continued: ""But they hate him so much they can't even attempt to do that. So they vilify half of the country and their closing argument in this election is that President Trump is going to bring this country backward when Americans know that's not true, he is going to move this country forward.""

News Max,"Fmr Vatican Diplomat, Pope Critic: Harris 'Infernal Monster'","Republicans have long worried about the historically low percentage of Catholic voter turnout, and a former Vatican ambassador and staunch Pope Francis critic is urging that to change.
Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, Italy's apostolic nuncio to the U.S. during the Obama administration (2011-2016) is urging Catholic Americans to turn out to vote to bring Trump back to the White House over an ""infernal monster"" in Vice President Kamala Harris.
""The choice is between a conservative president, who is paying with his very life for his fight against the deep state, and an infernal monster who obeys Satan,"" Viganò wrote in an ""open letter to American Catholics"" this week.
""For a Catholic, there can be no question: voting for Kamala Harris is morally inadmissible and constitutes a very grave sin. Nor is it morally possible to abstain, because in this war declaring oneself neutral means allying oneself with the enemy.""
Trump is the answer to protect America's traditional Catholic ideals, he added.
""In Kamala Harris' America, Catholics — but also Protestants — are considered fundamentalists to be marginalized and eliminated, and their children are considered the property of the state, which arrogates to itself the right to lead them astray from an early age in both body and soul,"" Viganò wrote. ""Trump's America can become great and prosperous again.
""Harris' America is destined for invasion and for moral, social, and economic destruction: the most ferocious dictatorship.""
While Trump is not ideal on protecting the unborn or support for IVF, Harris is the ""threat to democracy"" that Democrats have been attempting to pin on Trump, Trump represents a vote for religious liberty, according to Viganò.
""In this election you must choose between two radically opposed ways of conceiving the government of your nation: you are called to choose between democracy and dictatorship, between freedom and slavery,"" his missive began.
""On one side we have candidate Donald J. Trump, who, despite serious problems in his positions, especially in the matter of abortion and assisted procreation, has as his objective the common good and the protection of the fundamental freedoms of citizens.
""In Donald Trump’s America, every Catholic can practice their Faith and educate their children in it without interference from the State.
""On the other side we have a candidate and a party that promotes everything that directly opposes the Faith and Morals of the Catholic Church.""
America has unraveled under the Biden-Harris administration, he warned.
""Look at your country! Your cities have become dumps filled with derelicts and criminals, drug dealers and addicts, prostitutes and robbers,"" he wrote. ""Your schools are dens of indoctrination and corruption from kindergarten onwards. In your courts, criminals are acquitted and innocents are imprisoned: new ideological crimes are prosecuted, while illegality is tolerated and encouraged.
Harris exposed the anti-religion agenda last week when she said a Jesus supporter was ""at the wrong rally,"" Viganò wrote.
""At that point, dear American Catholics, you will not only have to go to a different rally — as Kamala would like — in order to say 'Christ is the Lord,' because saying that will be considered hate speech, and praying in front of an abortion clinic an act of terrorism,"" he wrote. ""Do not think that these are remote hypotheses: wherever the woke left takes power, it establishes the most vicious, anti-human, and anti-Christian dictatorship that humanity has ever known.
""And we know that every time the left has come to power, it has never left through democratic means.""
Trump is ""the only possible"" answer in this election, he concluded.
""Candidate Donald J. Trump, while certainly taking some serious critical positions that a Catholic cannot agree with, represents for us, dear American faithful, in this specific historical moment, the only possible choice to counter the globalist coup that the woke Left is about to implement definitively, irreparably, and with incalculable damage for future generations,"" he wrote.
""Voting for Donald Trump means firmly distancing ourselves from an anti-Catholic, anti-Christian and anti-human vision of society. It means stopping those who want to create a hellish dystopia that is even worse than the one announced by George Orwell.""

News Max,GOP Slams Labour Party's Harris Campaign Efforts,"High-profile supporters of former President Donald Trump are blasting efforts by a U.K. Labour Party official to send operatives to campaign on behalf of Vice President Kamala Harris in the United States, The Hill reported.
On Friday it was revealed that the U.K.'s Labour Party had been attempting to organize a group of current and former party members to travel to swing states in the U.S. to support the election efforts of Harris. Sofia Patel, Labour's head of operations. started the controversy in motion with a public solicitation on LinkedIn.
""I have nearly 100 Labour party staff, current and former, going to the US in the next few weeks, heading to North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Virginia. I have ten spots available for anyone available to head to the battleground state of [North] Carolina - we will sort your housing,"" Patel wrote in the now-deleted post.
Many conservatives have called out Patel's efforts as foreign meddling in the affairs of the United States.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk called the Labour Party's efforts ""illegal."" Rep. Mike Collins, R-Ga., wrote the move was ""election interference from foreign nationals"" and called for an investigation.
Rep. Majorie Taylor Greene posted on X, ""Foreign nationals are not allowed to be involved in anyway in U.S. elections. Please go back to the UK and fix your own mass immigration problems that are ruining your country.""
The Hill reported that under federal election law, foreigners are banned from ""participation in decision-making"" and ""providing substantial assistance."" The volunteers from the Labour Party would be traveling at their own expense yet would stay in accommodations provided by Democratic Party campaign volunteers, a source told The Hill.

News Max,Prosecutors Ask for Indefinite Delay in Trump Assassin Trial,"Federal prosecutors on Wednesday asked Florida District Judge Aileen Cannon for an indefinite delay in scheduling the trial of Ryan Wesley Routh, the would-be assassin of former President Donald Trump.
In a court filing obtained by ABC News, prosecutors requested the judge officially designate Routh's case as ""complex,"" citing the massive amount of evidence they've gathered in the 17 days since he was arrested after staking out Trump's Florida golf course in an apparent assassination attempt.
""Over the past two weeks, the United States has interviewed hundreds of witnesses,"" prosecutors said in the filing. ""It has also executed 13 search warrants in Florida, Hawaii, and North Carolina, and seized hundreds of items of evidence, including multiple electronic devices.""
There are more than 100 outstanding subpoena returns connected to the case and investigators estimated in the filing that they have ""thousands of videos to review"" from the electronic devices seized so far.
""All videos, still images, text files, and audio files constitute approximately 4,000 terabytes (4 million gigabytes) of digital review to complete,"" the filing says.
The FBI is also conducting forensics testing, including ""ballistics testing, and fingerprint and DNA comparisons,"" which will likely require that they prepare expert witnesses for Routh's eventual trial.
The filing reportedly noted that Routh's defense team did not oppose the government's request for an indefinite trial postponement.
Routh, 58, was arraigned in federal court in West Palm Beach, Florida, on Monday on attempted assassination charges. His attorneys entered a plea of not guilty on his behalf.
He had previously been charged with possession of a firearm as a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number in the Sept. 15 incident.
According to investigators, Trump was playing golf that Sunday morning when a Secret Service agent spotted the barrel of a gun poking out from the bushes near the sixth hole at Trump International Golf Club.
When the agent opened fire in the direction of the rifle, Routh fled the scene in his SUV. He was later arrested on I-95.

News Max,RFK Jr: Trump MSG Rally Was Opposite of Nazism,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is hitting back at Democrats who compared former President Donald Trump's rally at Madison Square Garden to a Nazi rally.
""There was so much joy in the room and optimism and patriotism and idealism about our country and it was the opposite of Nazism,"" Kennedy said in an interview Tuesday. ""The need to use that most invocative, and explosive, and incendiary, and poisonous reference and it's being used across the top ranks of the party, it's Hillary Clinton, it's Kamala, I think it's really, it's bad for our country.""
Kennedy, a member of the famous political dynasty, originally ran for president as a Democrat before deciding to run as an independent and later dropped out, endorsing Trump. He criticized comparisons of Trump to Hitler as dangerous, noting people have theorized on whether they would go back and kill Hitler when he was a child.
""So, when you compare an American political figure to Hitler, who is about to become president, the kind of people who are, you know, who are already a little unstable, you're really suggesting to them that this man should be killed before he gets into office,"" Kennedy said.
The rally came under fire after comedian Tony Hinchcliffe said Puerto Rico was a ""floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean.""
The Trump campaign has distanced itself from Hinchcliffe's comments.
Kennedy said people groaned in the crowd.
""No one was laughing,"" he said.
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate compared the rally to one held by the American Nazi Party at Madison Square Garden in 1939 that had a crowd of 20,000 supporters.

News Max,SCOTUS Won't Pause EPA Emissions Rule,"The U.S. Supreme Court declined on Wednesday to put on hold a new federal rule targeting carbon pollution from coal- and gas-fired power plants at the request of numerous states and industry groups in another major challenge to President Joe Biden's efforts to combat climate change.
The justices denied emergency requests by West Virginia, Indiana and 25 other states – most of them Republican led – as well as power companies and industry associations, to halt the Environmental Protection Agency rule while litigation continues in a lower court. The regulation, aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions that drive climate change, took effect on July 8.
The rule would require existing coal and new natural gas-fired plants eventually to reduce emissions including by capturing and storing carbon dioxide.
The EPA's new rule, issued under the landmark Clean Air Act anti-pollution law, was issued two years after a major ruling by the Supreme Court in 2022 undercutting the agency's power to issue sweeping regulations to force an electric-generation shift from coal to cleaner energy sources.
The EPA has said efforts to address climate change and its impacts such as extreme weather and rising sea levels must include the power sector because fossil fuel-fired plants make up 25% of overall domestic greenhouse gas emissions.
Notably, the rule mandates that coal plants operating past 2038 and certain new gas plants reduce emissions by 90% by 2032 including by using carbon capture and storage systems that extract carbon dioxide from plant exhaust and sequester it underground.
The EPA has called the technology proven and technically feasible. The rule's challengers have said it has not been shown effective at the scale predicted by the EPA.
The rule's requirements are ""really a backdoor avenue to forcing coal plants out of existence,"" West Virginia, a major coal producer, and other state challengers said in a written filing.
The Supreme Court's 2022 ruling was based on what is called the ""major questions"" legal doctrine embraced by its conservative justices that requires explicit congressional authorization for action on issues of broad importance and societal impact.
The states and certain other challengers contend that the EPA's new rule likewise implicates a major question and exceeds the agency's authority.
Numerous states and industry players filed multiple lawsuits challenging the rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which on July 19 denied requests to pause the regulation pending its review.
The case did not implicate a major question because the EPA's actions setting plant limits were ""well within"" its statutory authority, the D.C. Circuit stated.

News Max,911 Calls of Trump Butler Shooting Released,"On Wednesday, Pennsylvania officials released the 911 calls from the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump during his Butler, Pennsylvania, rally on July 13.
The Intercept posted a 10-minute compilation of the calls on Wednesday as well. The calls were released following a lawsuit issued by The Intercept and other news organizations.
One minute after shots rang out at 6:11 p.m. EST, rallygoers flooded Butler County emergency services with calls expressing fear. Although police and Secret Service agents identified the shooter 25 minutes before the gunshots rang out — at 5:46 p.m. EST, according to ABC News — 911 operators reassured concerned callers that law enforcement was aware of the situation and handling it.
In one of the 15 audio files released, a woman urgently told the 911 operator, ""Gunshot at the Trump rally."" The operator responded that police were on their way, to which the caller replied, ""Better get here quick."" Similar exchanges unfolded in other calls, where operators assured attendees that the situation was being managed.
Screams could be heard in the background of multiple calls, amplifying the tension. One woman told an operator, ""We are at the Trump assembly, and there's a guy shooting. He's been shooting up the place.""
The aftermath of the shooting resulted in the tragic death of Corey Comperatore, a 50-year-old firefighter, with two others injured — David Dutch, 57, and James Copenhaver, 74. As relatives frantically tried to locate loved ones, operators struggled to provide information. In one call, a woman said her husband had been shot but couldn’t determine which hospital he had been taken to for treatment.
Despite Butler County initially withholding the 911 recordings, citing concerns over law enforcement investigations, public pressure and legal challenges ultimately led to their release.
In light of the calls, body camera footage from Butler Township police, released earlier, showed police officers criticizing the Secret Service for failing to secure the building where the shooter had positioned himself. Footage from one bodycam shows an officer repeatedly saying, ""I f***ing told [the Secret Service] they need to post the guys f***ing over here.""

News Max,'Garbage' Comment Pushes Sidelined Biden Back Into Spotlight,"Joe Biden's ""garbage"" comment has pushed the previously sidelined president back into the spotlight, just five days before voters pick who the next U.S. leader will be, reports The Wall Street Journal.
Biden hasn't appeared at a campaign event with Vice President Kamala Harris since Labor Day and his suggestion Wednesday that supporters of former President Donald Trump are ""garbage"" miffed Harris. The Democrat nominee distanced herself from the comment and told reporters that she ""strongly"" disagrees with criticizing people based on who they vote for.
""I am sincere in what I mean: When elected president of the United States, I will represent all Americans, including those who don't vote for me, and address their needs and their desires,"" Harris said.
It was a difficult choice for Biden to step aside in July and fading on the sidelines while Harris campaigns has been trying, too, according to people close to him.
""Logically, he knows it's the right decision. As a human being with emotions, it's hard not to be there for the final hurrah,"" one person who has been in close contact with Biden's team told the Journal.
""It's sad to end on that note. He wanted to go out in a blaze of glory.""
The New York Times earlier this week reported that Harris' campaign views Biden as a liability in the final days and that officials on her team think holding joint events with Biden would ""only hurt her.""
Biden's team believe that the president has a place in her campaign.
""If I were running the Harris campaign, the last thing I would want to do is try to make this campaign about Joe Biden,"" Doug Sosnik, a veteran Democratic strategist who was a senior adviser to President Bill Clinton, told the Times. ""And of course I would not want him out campaigning.""
Andrew Bates, a White House spokesman, said in a statement that Biden ""knows that every president needs to 'cut their own path,' and he will continue to coordinate with the campaign on where and how he can be helpful, like he has done in recent days mobilizing the labor unions he has worked with for decades.""

News Max,Nevada Supreme Court Allows Unmarked Ballots to Count in 2024,"The Nevada Supreme Court ruled Monday to uphold a lower court's decision permitting mail-in ballots lacking a postmark to be counted if they arrive up to three days after Election Day, dismissing a GOP-led challenge in a high-stakes decision for the upcoming election, The Hill reported.
This ruling follows the court's affirmation of a lower court decision rejecting a Republican-led challenge to the current ballot-counting law.
The high court's majority opinion clarified that state law, which mandates counting mail-in ballots when a postmark is illegible or ""cannot be determined,"" also applies to ballots without a postmark.
This interpretation directly counters the GOP's argument that the rule should exclusively cover ballots with smudged or unreadable postmarks.
""If a voter properly and timely casts their vote by mailing their ballot before or on the day of the election, and through a post office omission the ballot is not postmarked, it would go against public policy to discount that properly cast vote,"" the court wrote in its majority opinion.
The high court added that distinguishing between unmarked ballots and those with illegible postmarks would be unprincipled, as the postmark date cannot be confirmed in both cases.
The court also addressed the broader GOP concerns regarding election security and voter fraud. In affirming the district court's ruling, the high court held that the Republican plaintiffs failed to provide sufficient evidence that counting unmarked ballots would increase the likelihood of fraud or compromise election security. Furthermore, the court dismissed claims of any partisan bias in processing mail-in ballots, rejecting the argument that such ballots would disproportionately benefit Democratic candidates.
The ruling was largely unified, with five justices joining the majority opinion.
Two other justices agreed with the outcome but offered separate opinions. One noted the plaintiffs' lack of evidence, while the other emphasized that modifying election rules so close to Election Day would not serve the public interest.
Nevada is considered a critical battleground state, with polling averages indicating a tight race. According to recent data from The Hill/Decision Desk HQ, former President Donald Trump holds a slim lead over Vice President Kamala Harris, with 48.1% support to her 47.2%.

News Max,Marc Lotter to Newsmax: Harris Needs More Than 'Canned Points' for Interview,"Marc Lotter, who served as special assistant to former President Donald Trump, told Newsmax that when Vice President Kamala Harris sits down with Fox News' Bret Baier on Wednesday night, she's going to need more than ""canned talking points"" to get through the interview.
""I expect it to be a tough interview,"" Lotter said during a Wednesday morning appearance on ""Wake Up America.""
""Look, Bret Baier is a journalist through and through. He plays it right down the middle, and he's going to be tough,"" Lotter continued. ""He's going to ask her very difficult questions. He's done the same thing to Donald Trump, too. And so this is not going to be an easy interview for her. She's not going to be able to come with just her canned talking points. And I really, really hope that if she says, 'I'm from a middle class family,' that Bret Baier is going to remove his glasses, put his hand on his nose like he often does, and just shake his head because that's not going to go well.""
Lotter also pushed back on ""60 Minutes"" anchor Chris Wallace's comments that Trump is scared to debate Harris again and is running a Biden-esque basement campaign this cycle.
""It really is [absurd], but it shows you that the corporate legacy media, they view everything through the lens of them,"" he said. ""He's [Trump] viewing it through the lens of the people. He's going to where they are, whether it is rallies, whether it is doing, say, nontraditional interviews and podcasts, things like that, he's going to see them. He's just not doing it the way they [legacy media] want it to be done via debates and via like '60 Minutes.' But Chris Wallace was right: If Donald Trump appears on a debate stage, appears on '60 Minutes,' the audience doubles because people want to see Donald Trump.""
As for Harris' interview on Fox, Lotter said that he doesn't expect it to move the needle much in the Democrat presidential nominee's favor.
""I think it's a very small percentage of people who haven't made up their minds yet, and I think it may be 3% or so, but if you haven't made up your mind, there's a reason for that,"" he said.
""I think it's because people are saying, 'OK, Kamala, I'll give you a chance to prove to me you can fix the economy, lower prices, secure the border. I don't like the way he tweets. I don't like what he says, but I can't afford not to give me a reason.'"" he continued. ""She hasn't been able to do so, and I don't think she'll be able to tonight. So, my guess is if there's 3% out there that's still undecided, two out of the three break for Donald Trump.""

News Max,Fewer than Half of Votes in '22 Election Were Cast in Person,"Fewer than half of all votes in the 2022 midterm elections were cast in person on Election Day, according to data compiled by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission's Election Administration and Voting Survey, reports the Washington Post.
The voting landscape changed after the COVID-19 pandemic, with many states making changes to voting procedures or policies. Voting by mail decreased in 2022 compared to the 2020 general election, though rates remained higher than pre-pandemic levels at 31.9%.
Almost half of all voters voted in person on Election Day, and more than two-thirds of voters cast their ballots in person (either on or before Election Day) for the 2022 general election.
The way people vote varies by geography, according to the Post.
In Washington state, nearly every voter cast their ballot by mail in the 2022 midterm elections. In Idaho, two-thirds of voters voted in person.
In-person voting rebounded in 2022 after decreasing in 2020, according to the EAVS, going from 30.5% to 49%. Voting by mail (43%-32%) and early voting (30.5%-22.2%) decreased during that same time span.
The Trump campaign has cast doubt on mail-in voting, with former President Donald Trump telling rallygoers in Pennsylvania in August that ""the elections are so screwed up.
""We have to get back in and we have to change it all. We want to go to paper ballots. We want to go to same-day voting. We want to go to citizenship papers. And we want to go to voter ID. It's very simple. We want to get rid of mail-in voting.""
In Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, in July, he said, ""the mail-in voting isn't working. It's corrupt. But until then, Republicans must win.""

News Max,Harris in Media Blitz With Election at One-Month Mark,"Vice President Kamala Harris, with her campaign against former President Donald Trump now at the one-month mark before the Nov. 5 election, will spend this week in a series of major media interviews, according to a senior campaign official.
With early voting underway nationwide, Harris will appear this week with radio host Howard Stern, Stephen Colbert on ""The Late Show,"" and ""The View,"" reported The Hill Sunday.
Her appearances come in addition to a sit-down interview with ""60 Minutes,"" which will be aired Monday, and her appearance on the ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast, being released Sunday.
The Harris campaign has come under fire from Republicans and former President Donald Trump's team for her lack of major media interviews. However, her campaign has been using more targeted interviews, including with local news outlets in the nation's battleground states, and she has sat for podcasts and radio interviews.
The upcoming interviews will reach a much wider audience. Millions of viewers watch ""The View"" and ""The Late Show"" daily, while Stern's YouTube page has more than 2 million subscribers.
Alex Cooper, the host of the ""Call Her Daddy,"" podcast, also has millions of followers through her social media.
Harris also plans to travel to Arizona and Nevada this week.
She'll be in a Univision town hall and make other campaign stops in Las Vegas on Thursday.
Friday, Harris will head to Arizona to campaign while urging voters to cast their ballots, with early voting starting in the state on Wednesday.
According to national polls, the presidential race between Harris and Trump is mostly neck and neck.

News Max,Trump: GOP the Party of Common Sense,"Thousands of MAGA fans traveled to the city of Coachella, California, not for the eponymous music festival by the same name, but to hear former President Donald Trump speak at the Indio fairgrounds in the desert on Saturday during a late-afternoon rally.
""We have to make California better,"" Trump told supporters in the rally, which aired live on Newsmax and simulcast on the Newsmax2 online streaming platform.
""The Republican Party will always put America first and lead us on to victories like you have never seen before. We've got a big victory because we've become the party of common sense,"" he told supporters before putting on a red MAGA hat, quipping, ""That sun is hot.""
Trump said the Californians in attendance have ""one of the worst governors.""
""California is a paradise lost, but we're bringing it back,"" he said.
""California stood as the beacon of what our country aspired to become. It really did. It had everything. It had the weather. It had the water. The state had the best schools, the safest communities, and a booming middle class.
""But all that was eradicated by decades of the very policies that Kamala Harris wants to now force upon America. I don't think it's going to happen,"" Trump said, before pointing to higher taxes, regulations, utilities, homelessness, crime, decay, and illegal immigration in the state.
""Other than that, I think you're doing quite well,"" he said, arguing the November election is a time to ""send a message that the people of California are not going to take it any longer.""
""Kamala Harris got you into this mess and only Trump can get you out of it,"" he said, citing the increase in illegal immigration in the state.
Trump said he ""built one hell of a wall.""
""What the hell is wrong with our country?"" he asked.
""She's [Harris] imported an army of illegal alien gang members and migrant criminals from the dungeons of the Third World,"" he said. ""What the hell is happening to our cities?
""When I win on Nov. 5, the migrant invasion ends, and the restoration of our country begins,"" he said, arguing the border is the No. 1 issue in the U.S.
Trump said we are known through the world as ""an occupied country.""
""It's no different than if we lost a war,"" he said.
""I make this pledge to you: Nov. 5, 2024, will be liberation day in America. Liberation day. Liberation day, we're going to be liberated.
""Did you ever think you'd hear that 10 years ago? 15 years ago? We're going to liberate our country from criminals,"" he said.
""How stupid are we? How stupid are these leaders as stupid people? I will rescue California and every town across America that's been invaded and conquered. And we will put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in jail or kick them the hell out of the country, which is No. 1,"" he said.
Trump said 86% of the country feels we are on the wrong track.
""Doesn't that tell you something? It tells you ... we got a problem. I actually worry about the next three months, I really do. I worry about the next 3 1/2, four months. We'll end up in a world war because of this, the people that we have,"" he said.
Trump reiterated his ""no tax on tips"" and ""no tax on overtime"" platforms.
""By contrast, Kamala is known as the tax queen,"" he said.
Trump also criticized her and her boss, President Joe Biden, for their response to dual hurricanes in North Carolina and Florida.
""Biden and Harris have done a horrible job on North Carolina and some of the other ones. In particular, the first of the first of the hurricanes that came in, it really wiped out North Carolina,"" he said, before praising Elon Musk for getting Starlink to the region.
""I said, 'Elon, they're in big trouble in North Carolina. They need Starlink, and you guys are doing so well with it.' It's a very hard thing to get. So I said, 'You guys, is there anything you can do, because it's' — in the meantime, my phone rings and it's the guy from North Carolina thanking me. And I'm still on the phone with Elon. I said, 'Elon, what the hell did you do? You told them that you've got it before I even hung up,'"" Trump told the crowd.
""... He's a great guy and he's done a great job. And it's too bad that Kamala didn't do — I don't even know. She, she's essentially not even gone there,"" he said.
Trump argued that on the geopolitical stage, it's the ""enemies from within"" that are the most potentially problematic, including ""the sleazebags like a guy that you're going to elect to the Senate: shifty [Rep.] Adam Schiff.""
""Adam Schiff. He's a sleazebag, right? This guy? No, no, he's a major lowlife. ... But you're going to have shifty Adam Schiff, one of the true — I know him well because he conceived of the Russia hoax, right? The Russia, Russia, Russia hoax.
""He is a bad person. He's a sick person — not a stupid guy, but he's a sick puppy. That guy, one of the least — I'm not allowed to say this because this could cost you your president because you're not supposed to talk about somebody's looks, and so I won't. But to me, he's one of the least attractive human beings I think I've ever seen,"" Trump said.
""Not a stupid person. He's got the smallest neck I've ever seen. No, he's got the smallest neck. His neck is, like, so small, and his head is large. So he's not being held up by much. I can guarantee you he will not, he will not be playing for your local football team,"" Trump said.
The 2024 Republican presidential nominee addressed supporters at Calhoun Ranch, which belongs to GOP donors the Haagens, who have contributed at least $400,000 to Trump's reelection campaign, reported The Los Angeles Daily News.
The desert landscape was punctuated by a sea of MAGA hats and Trump flags, as Trump supporters waited in line to catch a bus to the rally.
The city of Coachella is strongly blue, with 78% of voters voting for President Joe Biden in 2020, and is home to roughly 42,000 people, situated just southeast of Palm Springs.
The rally in the Democrat stronghold comes just 29 days before the election.

News Max,US Has Paid Out $2B in EV Tax Rebates in 2024: Treasury,"The U.S. government has issued $2 billion in advance point-of-sale consumer electric vehicle (EV) tax credit payments since Jan. 1 covering more than 300,000 vehicles, the Treasury said Tuesday.
Since new rules took effect this year allowing for consumers to take advantage of EV tax credits worth up to $7,500 at the point of sale, more than 250,000 tax credits have been issued for new EVs and around 50,000 for used models that carry up to $4,000 rebates.
Nearly all involve transferring the credit to a car dealer at the time of purchase resulting in a significant rebate.
The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act created the point of sale rebate as well the used EV tax credit, lifted 200,000-vehicle manufacturer caps on credits, imposed income and vehicle price restrictions and extended credits to leased vehicles.
It also imposed new restrictions designed to wean the U.S. EV and battery supply chain away from China including requiring all EVs be assembled in North America to qualify for credits.
Treasury on Tuesday released a new analysis from its Office of Economic Policy that estimates the owner of an electric vehicle will save $18,000 to $24,000 more than a person who purchased a comparable gasoline vehicle. The analysis tallies estimated annual savings assuming a 15-year vehicle lifespan.
""These savings are giving consumers new choices and helping automakers and dealers to attract new customers and grow their businesses,"" said Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen who added ""consumers will save an average of $21,000 on fuel and maintenance over the lifetime of their vehicles and be protected from the volatility of gasoline prices.""
Consumers must attest they meet income limits to qualify for the tax credit at time of purchase or must repay the government when filing their taxes. For new vehicles, the adjusted gross income limit is $300,000 for married couples and $150,000 for individuals.

News Max,Fleitz to Newsmax: Biden's Iran Sanctions 'Too Late',"The fresh sanctions slapped on Iran's petroleum industry last week by the Biden administration in retaliation for Tehran's massive missile attack on Israel came ""too late,"" former CIA analyst Fred Fleitz said Monday on Newsmax.
""Iran has not been subject to American sanctions, the major sanctions, the oil sanctions, since Biden came into office. Iran is $100 billion richer today than when [Donald] Trump left office because of this,"" Fleitz said on ""Newsline.""
""And where did that money go? They used it towards their missile program, their nuclear program, Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels, and they paid for the Hamas terrorist attack of Oct. 7, 2023. If it was not for Joe Biden and his incompetent foreign policy, Iran would be basically broke, and Hamas would not have had the money to plan that horrendous massacre.""
The links between the Hamas terrorist attack and Iran will ""become much more pronounced,"" said Fleitz.
""We're seeing now that Iranians are claiming that they didn't know the attack was going to take place,"" he said. ""It sounds like they knew Hamas was doing something. They funded Hamas to do something, maybe Iranian officials didn't know the date. I think they did. I think they gave a green light for the attack, and The Wall Street Journal has said that.""
Fleitz said the situation will worsen if Vice President Kamala Harris wins the presidency.
""The problem here has been a deterioration of American deterrence, not just in the Middle East, but with Russia, with China, and its why the world is so much more unstable and dangerous today,"" Fleitz said. ""It's going to get worse if Harris is in office.
""Trump will restore maximum pressure against Iran. I think a credible, strong president with a strong national security, we can put Iran back in its box.""

News Max,Supreme Court Rejects Challenge to Ease Voter Registration,"The Supreme Court on Monday turned away a challenge from Republican state lawmakers in Pennsylvania to a Biden administration executive order that is intended to boost voter registration.
The justices did not comment in rejecting an appeal from the Republicans, who claimed the order is an unconstitutional attempt to interfere in the November election. Lower courts had dismissed the lawsuit.
Nine Republican secretaries of state and 11 members of Congress had asked the court to step in. In May, the justices declined to take up and decide the case on an expedited basis.
The justices separately rejected two appeals stemming from baseless claims made by Republicans that voting machines and software of Dominion Voting Systems were responsible for Donald Trump's defeat in the 2020 presidential election.
In one case, the court turned away an appeal from Fulton County, Pennsylvania, that questioned a Pennsylvania high court ruling involving voting machines. The other rejected appeal involved claims from people around the country that Denver-based Dominion tried to silence them.

News Max,Musk Says He's 'All In' on Trump in Election,"Elon Musk is ramping up his public support of Donald Trump, telling Tucker Carlson in a conversation streamed Monday that he is ""all in"" on the Republican presidential candidate.
After appearing alongside Trump at a weekend rally, the world's richest man used a two-hour chat with Carlson to push right-leaning talking points, including what he said was the threat to democracy if Democrat Kamala Harris prevails in November's election.
""My view is that if Trump doesn't win this election, it's the last election we're going to have,"" the Tesla and SpaceX boss told former Fox News host Carlson.
Musk, who has increasingly courted controversy in recent years, said he believed ""illegals"" -- migrants -- were being deliberately transported to a handful of key states, where if they are eventually granted citizenship, they would become Democrat voters.
""Now these swing-state margins are sometimes ten- twenty-thousand votes. So what happens if you put hundreds of thousands of people into each swing state?
""So my prediction is, if there's another four years of a Dem administration, they will legalize so many illegals that... the next election there won't be any swing states, and this will be a single-party country.""
Musk is increasingly becoming a surrogate for Trump on the campaign trail, and is reportedly planning to make a number of stops in battleground states in the coming weeks.
Over the weekend, he unveiled a program promising to pay $47 to anyone who registers voters in Pennsylvania, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona, Michigan, Wisconsin and Michigan.",2024-10-07
News Max,"NY Times Poll: Trump Leads by 1, Flipping Biden Voters","In a polling pool that said it voted for President Joe Biden in 2020 by 7 points (52%-45%), Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump leads Vice President Kamala Harris by 1 point (46%-45%), according to the latest The New York Times/Siena College poll released Sunday.
""I think I'm going Republican this time because, really, the economy is the biggest issue for me,"" Atlanta voter Oliver Funk, 25, told the Times. ""I think Donald Trump will be better at handling just everyday prices than what we've seen in the past four years.
""I think that’s funny to say 'American democracy is under threat.' There's actually democracy under threat around the world. We're pretty coddled and pretty safe. Actually, extremely safe.""
Despite that data point above and that voter's position, the Times' analysis focused on the Democrats' election narrative of ""threat to democracy"" weaponized against Trump – albeit without the story mentioning multiple assassination attempts against Trump or the fact Harris eschewed the democratic process by not competing in the Democrat presidential primary won by Biden by a landslide.
The story dutifully mentions the Democrat narratives of ""the 2020 presidential election, the criminal conviction of former President Donald J. Trump and Mr. Trump’s continued insistence that the democratic process is rigged,"" however.
The Times/Siena College poll results among registered voters in a full field:
- Republican Trump 46%
- Democrat Harris 45%
- Green Party Jill Stein 2%
Independents and third-party candidates Robert F. Kennedy, Cornel West, Libertarian Chase Oliver, and another unnamed candidate each received less than 1% support. There were 1% who vowed to not vote because those were the choices, while 4% do not know who to vote for or refused to answer.
The Times analysis homed in on the Democrat narrative of the threat to democracy with the headlined ""Voters Are Deeply Skeptical About the Health of American Democracy.""
Its subheadline did suggest a dissatisfaction with the Biden-Harris administration, though: ""Nearly half say it does not do a good job representing the people, and three-quarters say it is under threat.""
But that narrative does not mention the fact a plurality of votes say American democracy ""does a good job representing people"" (49%), trumping the 45% it ""does not do a good job representing the people.""
But those polled do admit overwhelmingly under Biden-Harris that American democracy ""is currently under threat"" (76%), while just 20% replied it ""is not currently under threat.""
Vital to Americans is their personal finances, according to a Norfolk, Virginia, social worker.
""I even have to go to a food bank, and my husband and I make a decent salary, and we still can’t wholly make ends meet with three children,"" Tyra Jackson-Taylor, 51, told the Times. ""It's just a lot, me having to work and him work overtime, just to try to make the ends meet.""
Despite the skepticism of American economics and democracy as laid out by the Times, the poll does show overwhelming confidence the election will accurately present a true victor.
The confidence in the 2024 election is up 10 points from 2022 midterms, as nearly 80% of voters trust the upcoming election result will be accurate. That includes a majority of Republicans, Democrats, and independents. That figure was about 70% just two years ago, representing an increase in U.S. election confidence, despite the Times story's concern for American democracy.
Also, the Times report noted ""few voters say that concerns about democracy are central to their vote. Just 7% of voters said democracy was the most important issue regarding their choice for president.""
The Times poll featured 2,516 voters polled nationwide by Siena College (Oct. 20-23). the margin of error among likely voters is plus or minus 2.2 percentage points.

News Max,Election Officials Urge Patience to Determine Next President,"Election officials across key battleground states are optimistic that results will be faster than 2020, but still urged patience to determine the outcome of this year's presidential election, Politico reported Tuesday.
Four years ago, the nation was in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and witnessed a monumental shift in how Americans vote. For the first time, the majority of votes were cast before Election Day with the help of mail-in ballots.
Election officials across swing states point to the surge in mail-in ballots as a key reason for the longer than usual wait to a determine results. Mail-in ballots require more human interaction with each one having to be verified, removed from individual envelopes, and then loaded into a tabulator.
""It should be sooner, but also be patient,"" Barb Byrum, a clerk in Ingham County, Michigan, told the outlet. ""It takes time to make sure that we are still following our security and our procedures.""
This year, officials expect a lower number of mail-in ballots along with having more time to refine processes resulting in a faster turnaround.
""The overwhelming majority of ballots were counted by Thursday afternoon or evening in 2020,"" said Kathy Boockvar, who was Pennsylvania's secretary of state in 2020, ""and my guess is the overwhelming majority of ballots will be counted by Wednesday evening.""
Adding to the delays of a national election have to do with inconsistent voting laws, such as when election officials can begin counting votes and when ballots must be turned in. In Arizona, voters are allowed to drop off ballots on Election Day or the day before, something that many states do not allow.
""Not every state is created equal, right?"" said Carolina Lopez, the executive director at the Partnership for Large Election Jurisdictions and a former Florida official. ""If you're from Florida, you're going to get results a little quicker, simply because we have 22 days of pre-processing. If you're in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, by law, they're not allowed to start until Election Day. It's just a quick numbers game.""
Current polling shows former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are either tied or separated by 1 percentage point in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and either state could decide the eventual winner.
Still, most election experts contend that this year will be notably improved from the last presidential election, even if the final results are not until known until days later.
""Things will be different this year,"" Quinn Yeargain, associate professor of law at Michigan State University told The Hill. ""It may not be as quick as 2022. Famous last words I suppose, but I would be surprised if the process took as long as it did in 2020.""

News Max,Jewish Voters in Swing States Reconsider Support for Democrats,"For Rona Kaufman, the signs are everywhere that more Jews feel abandoned by the Democratic Party and may vote for Republican Donald Trump.
It's in her Facebook feed. It's in the discomfort she observed during a question-and-answer at a recent Democratic Party campaign event in Pittsburgh. It's in her own family.
“The family that is my generation and older generations, I don’t think anybody is voting for Harris, and we’ve never voted Republican, ever,"" Kaufman, 49, said, referring to Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris. “My sister has a Trump sign outside her house, and that is a huge shift.”
How big a shift? Surveys continue to find that most Jewish voters still support the Democratic ticket, and Kaufman acknowledges that she's an exception.
Still, any shift could have enormous implications in Pennsylvania, where tens of thousands of votes decided the past two presidential elections. Many Jewish voters say the 2024 presidential election is like no other in memory, coming amid the growing fallout from Hamas’ attack on Israelis last year.
Jews represent a sliver of the voting-age population in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, the so-called blue wall of states that Democrats have come to rely on in recent presidential elections. In a close election, they are a big enough constituency that the campaigns of Harris and Trump see the potential for any slippage to swing a close contest.
That has forced Harris to walk a line between traditional Democratic constituencies with strong feelings about the war in Gaza, both Jews and Arab Americans — balancing support for Israel with outrage over the deaths of Israeli and Palestinian civilians and destruction in the region. The Biden administration has been pressuring Israel to end its attacks, which continued last week with the killing of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar by Israeli troops.
Trump has sought to connect with Jewish voters, claiming that Harris ""doesn't like"" Jewish people while asserting he would be the ""best friend Jewish Americans have ever had in the White House.""
In the past, surveys have shown that Jews overwhelmingly vote Democratic. A Pew Research Center poll released last month found that about two-thirds of Jewish voters back Harris. In 2020, about 7 in 10 Jewish voters supported President Joe Biden, according to AP VoteCast.
The question is whether that has changed, as Jews now see Israel's survival in a new light as its war with Hamas widens to Hezbollah and possibly Iran.
That has put a new focus on the relationship between Israel and the U.S., which continues to provide military aid. And many Jews say rising acts of antisemitism in the United States and anti-Israel protests sweeping across cities and college campuses — including in Philadelphia — have made them feel unsafe.
In Pennsylvania, still fresh in many minds is a gunman absorbed by white supremacist ideology murdering 11 worshippers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018, the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history.
As Pennsylvania plays a central role in the election, many say they've never seen such outreach from campaigns as they have now.
From Trump on down, Republicans are attempting to win over Jewish voters by highlighting a Democratic Party torn between its traditional and unconditional support for Israel and a growing faction that has accused Israel of war crimes in Gaza, called for Israel to unconditionally stop attacking Hamas, and demanded that the U.S. end its military support for Israel.
For some Jews who typically vote Democratic, that has resonated.
“I think that there are folks who are reluctant Trump voters who feel scared as Jews in this country,” said Jeremy Kazzaz, a Pittsburgh resident and Harris supporter.
Kazzaz, however, said Harris has a long record of fighting antisemitism that is relatively unknown to many voters.
He pointed out that the Biden administration tapped her husband, Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, to lead a task force to develop a strategy to fight antisemitism well before Hamas attacked Israel. Emhoff has been a key surrogate, campaigning in front of Jewish audiences in the Philadelphia suburbs and speaking at the groundbreaking of a new complex replacing Pittsburgh’s Tree of Life synagogue.
Still, where Harris' supporters see strong support of Israel — for instance, the Biden administration sent a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery to Israel, along with the troops needed to operate it — others see conditional support.
That includes Biden urging Israel not to hit Iran’s nuclear program or oil fields. At the same time, Biden has stressed his administration’s support for Israel and, in her remarks on the anniversary of Hamas' attack, Harris said she'll “always ensure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself and that I will always work to ensure the safety and security of the Jewish people here and around the world.”
Steve Rosenberg, of Philadelphia, who voted for Trump in 2016 and then Biden in 2020, will vote for Trump in 2024. In large part, Rosenberg sees Biden's lifting of Trump-era sanctions on Iran as providing the cash for the Islamic Republic to finance a war against Israel. Trump imposed the sanctions after voiding a treaty the Obama administration had reached to slow Iran's progress toward nuclear weapons, which he called a bad deal.
“The question is, ‘Who is better off today than four years ago?’” Rosenberg said. “And the answer is Iran and the mullahs and their proxies, and it's because Biden and Kamala Harris have capitulated to Iran.”
Kaufman, a self-described progressive who lives in Pittsburgh's heavily Jewish Squirrel Hill neighborhood, never thought she would vote for Trump.
But now, she expects Trump will continue a hardline stance against Iran — which she calls an imminent threat to democracy, human rights and western civilization — and worries that Harris will appease Iran and pander to the party's left wing.
Jews with very strong connections to Israel — her parents were born there and her daughter just finished a two-year eight-month mandatory service with the Israeli army — are similarly conflicted over supporting Harris, Kaufman said.
“I’m saying it out loud everywhere, but most people aren't saying it out loud.”
Some Jewish supporters of Harris view Trump as a potential threat to democracy. They express concerns about persecution, citing comments by Trump that they find troubling, such as his stance on using the military against domestic threats, remarks about dual loyalty among Jews, and his criticism of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Some view Trump's actions on Jan. 6, 2021, to maintain his position as a concern. Others express caution regarding his connections to authoritarian leaders and point to his dinner at Mar-a-Lago with Nick Fuentes and rapper Ye, both known for making antisemitic statements.
""That’s the conversation that I’m having with Jews,"" said Rabbi Beth Janus of Philadelphia.
Janus said Jews she knows are excited that a woman could be president and that she's married to a Jewish man. Conversely, Trump's support for Israel is transactional, she said.
“When it serves his needs, his objectives, he supports Israel,” Janus said. “But if it didn’t, then he wouldn't support Israel.”

News Max,Va. GOP Chair Anderson to Newsmax: State 'in Play' For Trump,"Virginia remains in play for former President Donald Trump, even with some polls showing Vice President Kamala Harris ahead, state GOP Chair Richard Anderson told Newsmax on Saturday.
""Our Protect the Vote program is firing on all cylinders, and I sincerely believe to the depth of my being Virginia is, in fact, in play,"" Anderson told Newsmax's ""Saturday Agenda."" ""If you follow the polls too closely, the breadth of those things will drive you absolutely nuts. So my thing is, I don't look at one picture in a moment in time. I want to look at the entire photo album, and I feel very good about where we are in Virginia.""
Further, Anderson said that Republicans have been beating Democrats in early polling in all of Virginia's congressional districts, so ""I just feel very good about this.""
He pointed out that in 2021, Virginia had a ""clean sweep"" of its executive branch, and the legislative branch flipped in 2022.
""We've opened some three dozen offices around the state — huge staff that's working on the ground,"" said Anderson. ""We've hired or recruited, trained, and certified an original goal of 5,000 volunteer poll watchers. We are now at 11,000. We also have 500 energetic, focused, aggressive elections attorneys that are being present at all of our polling locations.""
Further, he noted that Democrats are saying that Virginia is not in play.
""Why do they have some three dozen offices open and a like number of employees on the ground?"" asked Anderson. ""They are worried about Virginia.""
Meanwhile, Virginia does have the ""urban crescent"" stretching from the Washington, D.C., suburbs and then through Fredericksburg to Richmond and toward Hampton Roads, which is traditionally Democrat.
However, in 2021, Gov. Glenn Youngkin used a strategy that included losing Democrat areas of the state by a lower amount and then working to turn out Republican voters and ended up winning his election by 2%.
""That is the way to do it,"" said Anderson. ""That's the way we are working on it, and so far, these early numbers we're seeing in early voting give me great confidence about the Commonwealth of Virginia.""
Meanwhile, the southwest part of Virginia was hit hard by Hurricane Helene, but there is a ""sincere effort underway"" to make sure residents can still get out to vote, said Anderson.
""We have teams on the ground down there who are engaged on that very activity right now,"" he said. ""We still have slightly a month, so there is plenty of time for those people in those hard-hit areas to get to the polls and cast their ballot for their candidate of choice.""
Anderson added that GOP Senate candidate Hung Cao is running a strong race against incumbent Sen. Tim Kaine.
""[He] is working it very hard,"" said Anderson. ""He has planned a very extensive trip around the state of Virginia starting next week. I plan on being with him, and I have seen him in action. He electrifies crowds. He knows how to connect strongly. He is the underdog, but the best fights are those that are hard-fought and hard-won.""

News Max,Cook Political Report: Key Wisconsin Senate Race Now 'Toss-Up',"The Cook Political Report on Tuesday changed its prediction of the key Wisconsin Senate race from ""lean Democrat"" to ""toss-up,"" providing Republican Eric Hovde a shot in the arm with less than a month to go before the election as he attempts to defeat two-term incumbent, Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wis.
Baldwin has been ahead in the polls during the entire campaign but she has slumped as voting day nears, with some surveys showing she has been reduced to a 2 percentage point lead after being ahead by 7 percentage points only two months ago.
""This tightening, as Hovde has further consolidated Republicans behind him and brought independents over to his side, is largely predictable,"" Cook's Jessica Taylor wrote, pointing to Wisconsin's status as a swing state.
However, back in 2018, Baldwin easily won reelection of her Senate seat.

News Max,"Threats, Assassination Attempts Reshape Trump's Campaign","Donald Trump was onstage at a rally on Long Island last month, talking about taxes, when he appeared momentarily spooked by something he'd spotted over his shoulder.
“I thought this was a wise guy coming up,” he explained, joking that he was getting his elbow ready to fight back.
“You know I got a little bit of a yip problem here, right?” he added to laughs, using a term familiar to golf aficionados to describe a phenomenon once blamed on performance anxiety where players suddenly lose the ability to make easy shots. “I was all ready to start duking it out.""
It was a fleeting moment passed off as a joke. But as he returns to Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday for a rally at the site where a gunman opened fire in July, grazing his ear with a bullet, the scare underscores the lasting fallout for the candidate and his campaign even as much of the national attention has shifted to other crises.
Beyond the two attempts on his life in as many months, the former president and GOP nominee faces ongoing death threats from Iran, which has also been blamed for hacking top campaign officials and allies, exacerbating anxieties already heightened by a stepped-up security apparatus and new restrictions on how he can campaign.
Trump's allies insist he was not fundamentally changed by the gunman who fired from an unsecured roof at the rally in July or the would-be assailant in September who shoved a rifle barrel through the fence at his West Palm Beach golf course.
The picture of Trump standing, with blood streaked across his face, as he raised his fist and shouted “Fight!” has become the indelible image of the campaign.
“When you almost lose your life, it stays with you. It stays with him,” said Florida Rep. Byron Donalds, a close Trump ally. “But that doesn’t change his resolve. His resolve is just as strong as it ever has been.”
Trump staffers are on edge. There have been death threats directed at his aides, and his team isn't as able to quickly organize the mass rallies that have always been the signature of his campaigns.
Armed security officers now stand guard at the campaign’s Florida headquarters, and staff have been told to remain vigilant and alert.
Events have been canceled and moved around because the U.S. Secret Service lacked the resources to safely secure them. Even with the use of glass barricades to protect Trump onstage, there are concerns about holding additional rallies outdoors due to fears about drones.
Trump has accused President Joe Biden's administration of intentionally denying security resources to help Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent, by preventing him from addressing large crowds.
“They couldn't give me any help. And I'm so angry about it because what they're doing is interfering in the election,” he said in a recent Fox News interview.
U.S. Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement that Trump “is receiving heightened levels of U.S. Secret Service protection” and that “our top priority is mitigating risks to ensure his continued safety at all times.” Biden expressed concern for Trump after both assassination attempts, saying in September, “Thank God the president is OK.”
Trump also now travels with a larger security footprint, with new traffic restrictions outside his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida, and a line of dump trucks and big guns on display outside Trump Tower in New York when he’s staying there.
As reporters filed into his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, for a press conference this summer, guests — including a little girl wearing a red, white and blue bathing suit — were forced to exit their cars and go through airport-style metal detectors as their vehicles were searched for bombs.
Trump’s campaign last week was briefed on continued threats from Iran in presumed retaliation for his administration's killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, an act that prompted Iran’s leaders to vow revenge. In August, a Pakistani man alleged to have links to Iran was charged in a plot to carry out political assassinations on U.S. soil. Law enforcement did not name the targets of the alleged plot, but legal filings suggest Trump was a potential target.
Iranian hackers have also been charged with stealing information from Trump’s campaign and trying to pass it along to news organizations. In May, prosecutors say, the men charged began trying to penetrate the Trump campaign, successfully breaking into the email accounts of campaign officials and other Trump allies. They then sought to “weaponize” the stolen campaign material by sending unsolicited emails to people associated with Biden’s campaign. None of the recipients who worked for Biden responded.
The cyberattacks have forced some staff to change their email addresses and others to be wary of communicating online.
Trump already faced unprecedented legal jeopardy for a presidential candidate, with four criminal indictments — one resulting in a felony conviction with sentencing delayed until after the election, one case dismissed, and two pending — along with civil lawsuits that carry hundreds of millions of dollars in potential penalties.
“I think that from our perspective, just from the campaign standpoint, operationally, if there’s one group of people that can handle something like this thrown in their lap, it’s the team that Donald Trump assembled to run this campaign, just based on everything we’ve had to deal with, whether it’s lawsuits to keep him off the ballot, to indictments, to assassination attempts,” Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita said.
Trump often discusses the role of divine intervention in his life, suggesting that it may have been a factor in his political journey, noting that significant political figures often attract criticism.
“Obviously, when you come within a half an inch of a very different outcome, that’s going to impact you,"" said New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, another ally who said she spoke to Trump the morning after the Butler shooting.
“Of course, those moments really make you consider a higher power, why you are so committed to helping save this country,” she said. “I think it has further empowered and energized President Trump.”
Trump was recently asked by NewsNation if he's concerned about his safety ahead of his return to Butler. “Well, I'm always worried,” he responded.
“I’m going back to Butler because I feel I have an obligation to go back to Butler. We never finished what we were supposed to do,"" he said. “And I said that, when I was shot, I said, we’re coming back. We’re going to come back. And I’m fulfilling a promise; I’m fulfilling really an obligation.”
His most loyal supporters at his rallies, including the one on Long Island where he joked about the “yips,” haven't been dissuaded from seeing him in person.
“I know some people are scared to come, but I’m not,” said Eileen Deighan, 63, a nurse from nearby Yonkers, New York, who said she was inspired by Trump’s decision to keep on campaigning given the threats.
“The fact that he didn’t give up, he’s willing to fight for our country, how could you not support that?’ she asked. “That will that he has — doesn’t give up. It’s very contagious.”
Trump told his supporters at a rally in Wisconsin on Saturday that he would continue fighting “no matter what obstacles and dangers are thrown on our path.” But he had another point to make.
“I tell you what, I had a good life before I did this,” he said. “Nobody was shooting at me. I had a hell of a life.”

News Max,Pennsylvania Focus Group Dismisses Trump Hitler Allegations,"A focus group of eight purportedly undecided voters in Pennsylvania told Mark Halperin’s 2WAY that they aren’t swayed by accusations that former President Donald Trump is “a fascist"" who praised Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler.
Vice President Kamala Harris said during a CNN town hall on Wednesday that she thinks Trump is “a fascist” after Trump’s former White House chief of staff John Kelly said in interviews that Trump praised Adolf Hitler and his generals. The Trump campaign has denied these allegations.
Halperin asked the focus group if they had heard Harris’s comment and when the attendees confirmed that they had all heard her remarks, each shook their heads “no” when asked if “it’s valuable” or “important” for Harris to bring up the accusations Kelly made.
One voter named Josh Cantor said that Harris “obviously thinks it’s going to help her. I don’t think it does it all,” adding, “I don’t know why, if it was Kelly who heard the president say that, I’m not saying he did or he didn’t, I don’t think he’d lie — I think you said that, Mark, on an episode — but I think that he had a responsibility to resign the day that was said if that’s true. I don’t think that’s the case.”
Another voter, Karsten Chu, said, “I think part of the reason why I’m being pushed towards Trump so strongly is that I find that the Democrats and the left just keep going straight to Hitler all of the time with everything.”
Chu added that people on the right often make references to Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin when referring to the left, saying, “it’s like we’re fighting World War II every single day for every single election so it’s so exhausting. I think it just detracts from … their position and … it’s so hyperbolic that it makes it impossible to have good discussions and I think it ruins the discourse.”

News Max,Harvard CAPS/Harris Poll: Gaza War Low Priority for Average American Voter,"Research from Harvard University and the Harris Poll suggests that while American support for Israel remains robust, the year-long war with Hamas in Gaza ranked low in voting priorities.
The survey polled 3,145 registered voters from Oct. 11-13, including 2,596 likely voters and 898 voters in battleground states. The margin of error is +/- 1.8% on a 95% confidence level.
On a question asking for ""the most important issues facing the country today,"" inflation topped the list with 39%, followed by immigration (35%), ""economy and jobs"" (29%), women's rights (17%), and healthcare (16%). The Israel-Hamas conflict came in 15th on the list at 6% while antisemitism reached 28th with 2%.
Karlyn Bowman, a distinguished senior fellow emeritus at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), explained to JNS that the setup of the poll may have influenced the results.
""It is my impression that they asked people to volunteer what they thought was the most important issue,"" Bowman told JNS. ""In other words, if people had been given a list to choose from, the responses might be different.""
Bowman noted that ""in nearly all other recent polls I've seen, the economy/inflation and immigration top the list of concerns people have. These two issues are so potent that they tend to crowd out other responses. So this isn't surprising or unusual. Five percent is considered the threshold of significance; the Israel-Hamas conflict hits that mark.""
Bob Shapiro, a political science professor at Columbia University, told JNS that ""the 6% for Gaza is not surprising and 2% for antisemitism as well. The percentages are only as high as they are since respondents evidently were allowed to give multiple responses so that the responses sum up to more than 100%. So they are likely to be the single most important issue for very few voters.""
Christopher Wlezien, a government professor at the University of Texas at Austin, told JNS that the use of ""most"" in the question ""forces people to choose among the many important problems they might see, and when the economy and national security are problems, they tend to drive out other ones.""
Another question named eight issues and asked voters to name the one ""most important to you personally."" Inflation came in at the top with 46%, immigration at 14%, abortion at 11% and the Israel-Hamas conflict at 3%.
In a ranking of favorability for 19 countries, institutions, activist groups and media companies, Israel reached fifth with 48% support. The U.S. military, police, Facebook, and the FBI ranked higher than Israel, while Fox News, CNN, Black Lives Matter, X, MSNBC, MAGA Republicans, campus protesters, China, and the Palestinian Authority ranked lower.
U.S. President Joe Biden received approval from 35% of respondents for his handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict.
Another question asked whether voters regarded Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump as better on the Israel-Hamas war. Harris received 37% support, Trump received 47%, and 16% said they did not know. The survey also showed that 62% of voters reported closely following the war, 81% supported Israel, and 73% saw Iran as a regional sponsor of terror in the Middle East.

News Max,"Trump to Newsmax: Harris Is 'Against Religion, Absolutely'","If Christians, evangelicals, and gun owners would just vote proportionately to other Democrat-controlled voting blocs, Republicans might ""never lose an election,"" GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump told Newsmax, saying Vice President Kamala Harris is ""against religion, absolutely.""
""I hope they vote,"" Trump told Chris Salcedo in an exclusive, 26-minute sit-down interview Saturday. ""You know, Christians, evangelicals have a very low – I'm talking, over a 50-year period – they have a very low percentage of voting, very unfortunate.
""You know who else does? Gun owners.
""If they voted, we could never lose. Gun owners don't vote, meaning they vote at like 15 or 16%. If they ever voted, we could never lose an election.
""Same thing with Christians: They go to church, but they don't vote. They have to vote. It's so important.""
Trump contrasted his leadership with that of Biden-Harris on the border, crime, inflation, the economy, and religion.
""I think I'm getting all of the Christian vote,"" Trump told Salcedo, questioning ""how could a Christian vote for"" Harris.
""I had so many people on television say, 'We have to vote for Trump.' Almost universal support, because if you look at her, she's against religion, absolutely.
""He was too. [President Joe] Biden was bad, but he wasn't like, you know, this one's bad.""
Religion and guns are contrasts with Harris, Trump concluded.
""I'm doing very well with Christians, very well,"" he said. ""Evangelicals, they love Trump. I think I'm an 88% or something like that.""

News Max,Corey Lewandowski to Newsmax: Trump Outworking 'Lazy' Harris-Walz,"Former President Donald Trump is taking ""nothing for granted"" over the final two weeks, campaign senior adviser Corey Lewandowski told Newsmax on Tuesday.
The Republican nominee is scheduled to host 29 campaign events over the next 10 days, Lewandowski told ""Wake Up America,"" calling it a ""full court press"" until Election Day.
After three campaign stops Monday and another three Tuesday in two different states, Lewandowski said he would stack Trump's schedule against anybody ""who has ever campaigned for president.""
""President Trump is going to be everywhere,"" Lewandowski said.
This is what everywhere looks like, Lewandowski said, beginning with stops in North Carolina and Florida on Tuesday:
- ""Georgia two stops [Wednesday];
- Arizona and Nevada on Thursday;
- Michigan two stops on Friday;
- Michigan and Pennsylvania, two stops on Saturday.""
After a ""monster event"" at Madison Square Garden in New York City on Sunday, ""Then you go to next week,"" said Lewandowski:
- ""Three stops in Georgia on Monday;
- Three stops in Pennsylvania on Tuesday;
- Then back to North Carolina, back to Wisconsin;
- Then back out west to Nevada and Arizona on Thursday of next week;
- Then Michigan and Wisconsin again next Friday.""
""29 stops in the next 10 days for Donald Trump that are public events that he will be hosting. That doesn't include what Vice President nominee [J.D.] Vance is doing,"" Lewandowski said. ""So it is a full-court press for the next 14 days.""
He added, ""We'll take nothing for granted. We're going to run through the tape over the next two weeks.""
By comparison, Lewandowski called the Democrat ticket of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz ""lazy.""
""I will put Donald Trump's schedule up against anybody who's campaigning for president, who has ever campaigned for president. And the American people see it. They see him out working and taking nothing for granted,"" Lewandowski said. ""This is a man, at 78 years old, who outworks not only his staff, but the press corps that travels with him and then everybody else.
""And so, look, the American people are very smart. They see that Vice President Harris and Tim Walz are lazy. They won't fix this country, and they want someone who's willing to work 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to put our country and make it great again, and that's what Donald Trump is doing.""

News Max,Voter Challenges Surge in Georgia but Few Removed From Rolls,"From Georgia's mountains to its Atlantic shore, challenges to the qualifications of voters have rolled in this summer and fall, part of a wide-ranging national effort coordinated by former President Donald Trump’s allies to enlist Republican activists to remove people they view as suspect from the voting rolls.
So far, fewer than 1% of individuals questioned have been removed from the rolls or placed into challenged status, primarily because counties are not acting on challenges. However, some who believe Georgia's voting rolls contain ineligible voters are seeking to change this by filing lawsuits and urging the State Election Board to direct counties to take further action.
The Associated Press finds more than 63,000 Georgians have been challenged since July 1, when a law that could make it easier to uphold challenges partially took effect. The AP's survey covered Georgia's 39 most populous counties, as well as six other counties with challenge activity. That’s a big surge from 2023 and the first half of 2024, when the AP found that about 18,000 voters were challenged.
And efforts are spreading geographically. They had been concentrated in majority-Democrat counties in metro Atlanta. But since July 1, 100 or more voters have been challenged in at least 20 counties statewide, including some heavily Republican areas.
As the AP found earlier, county election officials continue rejecting the vast majority of challenges. Fewer than 800 voters since July 1 — mostly in the suburban Atlanta Republican stronghold of Forsyth County — have been removed from the rolls or placed in challenged status. Voters in challenged status can cast ballots if they prove their residence, but counties are supposed to consider removing them next year if they don't vote.
The effort to remove voters has drawn scrutiny from the U.S. Justice Department, which in September issued a seven-page guidance memo that aims to limit challenges and block parts of the new Georgia law by citing 1993’s National Voter Registration Act.
Most of the targeted voters appear to have moved away from their listed addresses, and activists argue letting them stay registered invites fraud. Challengers have been aided by tools which rely on change-of-address lists and other documents to help identify people who could be wrongly registered.
“When ineligible voters remain on the voter rolls, it increases the likelihood of those persons voting in our county, which dilutes the legitimate votes of our citizens,” said Marci McCarthy, chair of the DeKalb County Republican Party, which sued its county board of elections this month alleging it was failing to hear challenges. “And every vote by an ineligible voter robs us as citizens of our vote.”
Often, when counties send letters to challenged voters, no one appears at a hearing to defend their eligibility. But in the Savannah suburb of Bryan County on Oct. 10, a room full of voters applauded as the county board dismissed challenges because the person who filed them didn't appear for a hearing.
“I’m frustrated with this entire process, that we all had to be here today,"" Michael Smith said at the hearing. ""I’m frustrated that our state passed a poorly thought-out law that required and allowed somebody to do this to all of us.”
Many Democrats and liberal voting rights activists argue Republicans are challenging voters either to remove Democrats or to sow doubt about the accuracy of elections in advance of 2024 presidential voting. The voter challenge movement originates from concerns about illegal voting but gained prominence within the Republican Party following Trump's claims of voter fraud, which led some to question the legitimacy of Biden's win in Georgia in 2020.
“We are amplifying lies and misunderstandings, fundamental misunderstandings, of how election law works,” state Rep. Saira Draper of Atlanta, who was the state Democratic Party’s director of voter protection in 2020, told the State Election Board on Oct. 8.
Opponents say disqualification efforts rest on faulty foundations. They say voters who change their mailing addresses haven't necessarily changed their residences and that some information challengers use is outdated. Particularly under fire are voter challenge tools including EagleAI and True the Vote’s IV3.
“EagleAI is a third-party program that scrapes the internet that was reviewed by county election offices as being worse than the programs that they have already,” Draper said.
But State Election Board Executive Director Mike Coan, assigned by the board to examine whether challenges are being unfairly denied in eight counties, said he believes challengers are providing “a free public service for our state” by helping clean up the rolls. Some counties say challenges compiled using EagleAI don't meet the legal standard to remove a voter, but Coan disagrees.
“When you’ve got people out there who have technology that is far superior, you should be listening, not turning your head and looking the other way,” Coan said.
He concluded the denial of many challenges by counties “goes against the very spirit and the letter of the law.”
“There are thousands and thousands of challenges that have been dismissed arbitrarily,” Coan told board members. He and Trump-aligned board members suggested the board should make statewide rules to guarantee more challenges are heard.
Rulemaking would confront underlying disagreements over whether federal and state laws block counties from hearing the vast majority of activists' challenges. Justice Department guidance issued last month suggests some parts of the state law that took effect July 1 are overridden by federal law.
After the 2020 election, the GOP-led state legislature specified each voter can file unlimited challenges against other people in their county. That came after Texas-based vote monitoring group True the Vote challenged 364,000 Georgia voters prior to two U.S. Senate runoffs in 2021. Lawmakers this year enacted another law that defined probable cause for removing challenged voters and said counties could remove voters until 45 days before the election.
But federal law says a state can make systematic changes to voter rolls only up to 90 days before an election. The Justice Department guidance says systematic changes include not only government-led efforts but also challenges compiled using programs like EagleAI.
Even some deeply Republican counties postponed action until January, but a few counties have considered action after the 90-day deadline.
Another disagreement involves challenges to people who have moved.
Through routine voter list maintenance that doesn't require a challenge, officials remove voters who are dead, convicted of felonies, mentally incompetent or no longer living in Georgia.
But federal law says Georgia can only cancel a registration for a voter who has moved if the voter doesn’t respond to a mailing, enters what is called inactive status, and then doesn’t vote in the two following federal general elections. That process takes more than two years.
Challengers, relying on change-of-address lists, have been targeting inactive voters for immediate removal. They argue the waiting period doesn't apply to challenges.
Officials in Democrat-majority counties have routinely disagreed, but some Republican-dominated counties see it differently. Forsyth County has removed or placed in challenged status 635 voters since July 1, according to board minutes, accounting for 80% of challenges upheld in surveyed counties.
Forsyth County remains an outlier, though. For now, voter challenges have had little impact in Georgia. But if courts and the Republican-majority State Election Board smooth the path, that could change.

News Max,Michael Whatley to Newsmax: Trump 'Knows What He's Talking About in the Economy',"Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley told Newsmax on Tuesday that former President Donald Trump has outlined ""a lot of very specific policies"" for improving the economy during his on-stage interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday.
Trump appeared in Illinois on Tuesday for an interview with Bloomberg Editor-in-Chief John Micklethwait at the Economic Club of Chicago, where Whatley said that Trump ""is putting a lot of very specific policies on the table,"" adding that ""he knows what he's talking about in the economy,"" and noting that Vice President Kamala Harris ""refused to do the same interview.""
Whatley said on ""Newsline"" that Trump is connecting with voters ""on every single issue set that matters"" to Americans.
He added that ""Donald Trump is on offense, Kamala Harris is playing defense, and it's true in every battleground state, and it's true on every single issue set that matters to the American voters.""
Whatley went on to praise Trump as ""a candidate who can go and talk directly to the American voters, talk to every American family about the issues that matter to them.""
He continued, ""Donald Trump has been able to clearly articulate over the course of the last year, year and a half that he's been running what he's going to do to rebuild our southern border, restore our economy and rebuild our national security apparatus so that we will be strong enough to protect our interests and our allies at home and abroad.""

News Max,Trump to Appear on Popular Joe Rogan Podcast,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump will participate in an interview on Friday with popular podcaster Joe Rogan, who has tens of millions of listeners.
Two campaign officials said Trump will travel to Rogan's studio in Austin, Texas, for the interview.
Trump criticized Rogan in August on Truth Social, Trump's social media platform, after the podcaster praised then-independent candidate Robert Kennedy Jr. Kennedy has since pulled out of the race and endorsed Trump. Trump later called Rogan a ""good guy.""
Trump's opponent in the Nov. 5 election, Democrat nominee Kamala Harris, has been considering doing an interview with Rogan to try to expand her appeal to male voters.
Spotify said in March that ""The Joe Rogan Experience"" had 14.5 million followers. This was almost triple the platform's second most popular program. Rogan also has more than 19 million followers on Instagram and 17 million followers on YouTube.
A poll by YouGov last year found that 81% of his listeners are male and 56% are under 35 years old, a similar demographic that tends to support Trump over Harris.

News Max,Jason Miller to Newsmax: Harris 'Starting to Drop Off' in Polls,"Jason Miller, senior adviser to former President Donald Trump, told Newsmax on Wednesday that Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign is conducting a ""media blitz"" to combat a drop in recent polls.
Miller, in an interview with ""Newsline,"" commented on Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz appearing for interviews on multiple talk shows and podcasts in the past week after facing criticism for not conducting more interviews when she launched her bid for the presidency.
""The reason why you see Kamala Harris' campaign going on this media blitz is clearly they're seeing something in their polling, which is probably what we're seeing in our polling, that Kamala Harris is starting to drop off.""
He added that ""key groups"" such as ""younger men,"" Latinos, and union workers ""are looking and seeing that,"" causing the Harris-Walz campaign to ""change it up"" and ""reintroduce Kamala Harris to the American public.""
""As we head toward the final days here, when Kamala Harris does one of these interviews like we saw with 'The View,'"" Miller said, ""asked a very simple question from Sunny Hostin, 'Is there anything over the past four years that you would do different?' and Kamala Harris thought about it for a moment and goes, 'No, nothing comes to mind,' — nothing about the border, nothing about inflation, nothing about the missing 325,000 kids, or Afghanistan — it is a nightmare for them.""

News Max,States Weigh Future of Workers' Subminimum Wage,"Mel Nichols, a 37-year-old bartender in Phoenix, takes home $30 to $50 an hour with tips included. But the uncertainty of how much she's going to make on a daily basis is a constant source of stress.
""For every good day, there's three bad days,"" said Nichols, who has been in the service industry since she was a teenager. ""You have no security when it comes to knowing how much you're going to make.""
That uncertainty exists largely because federal labor law allows businesses to pay tipped workers, like food servers, bartenders and bellhops, less than the minimum wage as long as customer tips make up the difference. Voters in Arizona and Massachusetts will decide in November if it's good policy to continue to let employers pass some of their labor costs to consumers.
The ballot measures reflect an accelerating debate over the so-called subminimum wage, which advocates say is essential to the sustainability of the service industry and detractors say pushes the cost of labor off employers' shoulders and leads to the exploitation of workers.
The amount tipped workers make varies by state. Fourteen states pay the federal minimum, or just above $2 an hour for tipped workers and $7 an hour for non-tipped workers.
Arizona employers can pay their tipped workers $3 less hourly than other workers. Under current rates, that means tipped workers' base pay is $11.35 an hour.
Voters will decide whether to approve a measure backed by state Republicans and the Arizona Restaurant Association to change the minimum for tipped workers to 25% less than the regular minimum wage as long as their pay with tips is $2 above that minimum.
The hourly minimum wage in Arizona is currently $14.35 and increases yearly according to inflation.
Voters in Massachusetts are being asked to eliminate the tiered minimum-wage system.
There, voters will decide on a measure to incrementally increase the state's tipped worker wage — currently $6.75 per hour — until it meets the regular minimum wage by January 2029. The measure was put forward by One Fair Wage, a not-for-profit that works to end the subminimum wage.
If voters approve the measure, Massachusetts would join seven states that currently have a single minimum wage. Michigan will soon join that group after an August state Supreme Court ruling initiated a phase-out of the subminimum wage.
""When you're not making the money that you should be making to pay your bills, it becomes hard on you,"" said James Ford, a longtime Detroit-based hospitality worker. ""(The ruling) makes me think we're moving forward.""
Other states have wage measures on the ballot. In California, voters will choose whether to raise the hourly minimum wage from $16 to $18 by 2026 in what would be the highest statewide minimum wage in the country. Measures in Alaska and Missouri would gradually raise minimum wages to $15 an hour while also requiring paid sick leave.
In the last two years, Washington, D.C., and Chicago also have started to eliminate the subminimum wage.
Employers must ensure that workers get the full minimum if they don't make that much with tips. But they don't always comply with federal labor law. One in 10 restaurants and bars investigated nationally by the U.S. Labor Department between 2010 and 2019 violated a provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act, resulting in the establishments paying $113.9 million in back wages.
The issue disproportionately affects women, who make up about 47% of the U.S. workforce but nearly 70% of those who work in tipped professions, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data.
In Arizona, Republican state Sen. J.D. Mesnard, the sponsor of Proposition 138, said the measure is a win for businesses and lower-wage workers.
""The employer is protected in the sense that they can preserve this lower base, knowing that there are going to be tips on top of it,"" Mesnard said. ""The tipped worker is guaranteed to make more than minimum wage, which is more than they're guaranteed today.""
Nichols doesn't support it.
""It would reduce my hourly, and anything that reduces my hourly is not something that I want to lean into,"" she said. ""I don't believe that business owners need any more cuts in labor costs.""
Proposition 138 was initially put forward as a response to a ballot measure pushed by One Fair Wage that would create a single minimum wage of $18, but the group abandoned the effort after threats of litigation from the restaurant association over how it collected signatures.
Instead, One Fair Wage will focus on trying to pass a wage hike in the Legislature. Democratic State Rep. Mariana Sandoval said she hopes her party in November can flip the Legislature, where Republicans hold a one-seat majority in both chambers.
After working for tips for more than 20 years, server Lindsay Ruck, who works at a restaurant at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, said she's faced her fair share of belligerent customers. But because their tips make up such a significant part of her pay — approximately $60 an hour — she's hesitant to stand up to them.
To Ruck, higher base pay — not less — is called for.
""I think that there should be just a single minimum wage and then people should get tipped on top of that,"" Ruck said.
The National Restaurant Association and its state affiliates warn of reduced hours, lower employment and menu price hikes if employers can't rely on tips to pay their workers. That's why Dan Piacquadio, a co-owner of Harold's Cave Creek Corral restaurant outside Phoenix, is hoping voters pass Proposition 138.
""This is just a way to protect our current system that's been there for 20 years and protect restaurant owners, keep restaurants affordable, and most importantly, keep very good pay for all tipped workers,"" Piacquadio said.
Between 2012 and 2019, the number of restaurants and people employed at those restaurants grew at a faster clip in the seven states that have a single minimum wage compared to states that pay the federal minimum tipped wage, according to labor economist Sylvia Allegretto.
""We are sitting here in a state that has a $16 minimum wage,"" Allegretto said from Oakland, California, where she works at the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research. ""No subminimum wage, and we've got a thriving restaurant industry.""

News Max,Biden: I Don't Know If Israel Is Holding Up Peace Deal to Sway November Election,"President Joe Biden had terse words for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, and said he didn't know whether the Israeli leader was holding up a peace deal in order to influence the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election.
“No administration has helped Israel more than I have,” Biden said. “None. None, none. And I think Bibi should remember that. And whether he’s trying to influence the election, I don’t know but I’m not counting on that.”
Biden, in a rare appearance in the White House press briefing room, was responding to comments made by one of his allies, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who said on CNN this week that he was concerned Netanyahu had little interest in a peace deal in part because of U.S. politics.
Israel has pressed forward on two fronts, pursuing a ground incursion into Lebanon against Hezbollah that left eight Israeli soldiers dead and conducting strikes in Gaza that killed dozens, including children. And the nation has vowed to retaliate for Iran’s ballistic missile attack this week, as the region braced for further escalation.
Biden said there had been no decision yet on what type of response there would be toward Iran.
“I’m assuming when they make a decision on how they’re going to respond, we will then have a discussion,"" he said.

News Max,Rep. Laurel Lee to Newsmax: Reform Secret Service Culture,"The Secret Service needs a cultural shift, Rep. Laurel Lee, R-Fla., a member of the Trump Assassination Task Force, told Newsmax on Thursday.
A report, issued Tuesday by an independent panel tasked by President Joe Biden, found flaws that contributed to an assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July.
During her interview on ""The Record With Greta Van Susteren,"" Lee addressed the findings, saying, ""This report confirms so many of the things that our task force has identified since the first assassination attempt against President Trump.
""It really highlights and goes into detail things like the communication failures and the systemic failure to coordinate effectively with local law enforcement.""
Lee said securing rally sites and locations where Secret Service protectees appear requires effective coordination, which the report found lacking.
""There are some very practical suggestions in there — things like having a field manual that they can share with state and local law enforcement,"" she said.
The panel's report went beyond operational failures and called for broader changes within the Secret Service, including culture, resources, funding, and mission focus reforms.
""The report identifies ... the view of this group that the Secret Service needs to get back to a focus on that protected mission and ensuring that that's where their priority is and that it's getting the job done,"" Lee said.

News Max,Biden Student Debt Relief Blocked by Different Judge,"A U.S. judge on Thursday temporarily blocked Democratic President Joe Biden's administration from implementing a plan to forgive student loan debt held by millions of Americans.
The ruling by St. Louis-based U.S. District Judge Matthew Schelp handed a victory to six Republican state attorneys general who challenged Biden's plan.
Schelp, an appointee of Republican former President Donald Trump, issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Biden administration from ""mass canceling"" student loans and forgiving principal or interest under the plan pending the outcome of the states' lawsuit.
Schelp ruled after another judge on Oct. 2 transferred the litigation from Georgia and removed that state from the case by finding it would not experience any legal harm under the debt relief plan.
The state attorneys general have accused the U.S. Department of Education of overreaching its authority by proposing a regulation that instead should be addressed through legislation in Congress.
The department proposed it in April after two previous plans were blocked by the courts. It would forgive $73 billion in student loan debt held by an estimated 27.6 million borrowers.
Biden campaigned for president in 2020 with a pledge to bring debt relief to millions of Americans who turned to federal student loans to fund their costly higher education.
The lawsuit was filed in Georgia, where U.S. District Judge J. Randal Hall in September issued a temporary block on the plan, though that expired on Oct. 3. Hall is the judge who moved the case to Missouri.
Schelp on Thursday said he agreed with Hall that the relief program should be halted until courts have had a chance to decide whether it is legal.
""Allowing Defendants to eliminate the student loan debt at issue here would prevent this Court, the U.S. Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court from reviewing this matter on the backend, allowing Defendants’ actions to evade review,"" Schelp wrote.
Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey, a Republican, in a statement called the ruling “yet another win for the American people.""
""The Court rightfully recognized Joe Biden and Kamala Harris cannot saddle working Americans with Ivy League debt,"" Bailey said.
The Education Department in a statement provided by a spokesperson said it was disappointed with the ruling and accused Republican state officials of seeking ""to prevent millions of their own constituents from getting breathing room on their student loans.""
""We will continue to vigorously defend these proposals in court. We will not stop fighting to fix the broken student loan system and provide support and relief to borrowers across the country,"" the department said.
Under the proposed regulation, debt relief would be granted to: people who owe more than they first borrowed due to the interest that has accrued; those who have been paying off loans for at least 20 or 25 years, depending on the circumstances; and borrowers who were eligible for forgiveness under prior programs but never applied.
The rule has not yet been finalized, a point the U.S. Justice Department made in arguing there was no final agency action for a judge to review in the first place.
The states argued that the administration was laying the groundwork to immediately cancel loans once the rule became final before any challenger could sue to stop it. They said that upon publication of the regulation, the Education Department would be able to instruct loan servicers to immediately process the debt forgiveness.
The attorneys general said such action would occur in the run-up to the Nov. 5 presidential election pitting Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, who is Biden's vice president, against Republican rival Trump, and that the administration would seek political credit for the policy.
The White House has called the current student loan system broken and has said debt relief is necessary to ensure that borrowers are not financially burdened by their decision to seek higher education.
Republicans counter that Biden's student loan forgiveness approach amounts to an overreach of authority and an unfair benefit to college-educated borrowers while others receive no such relief.

News Max,"Trump Gambles With Late-Stage Trips to Solidly Dem New Mexico, Va.","Donald Trump is traveling to New Mexico and Virginia in the campaign's final days, taking a risky detour from the seven battleground states to spend time in places where Republican presidential candidates have not won in decades.
The former president campaigned in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on Thursday and was scheduled to visit Salem, Virginia, on Saturday.
The Trump team is projecting optimism based in part on early voting numbers and thinks he can be competitive against Democrat Kamala Harris in both states — New Mexico in particular, if he sweeps swing states Nevada and Arizona. That hope comes even though neither New Mexico nor Virginia has been carried by a GOP nominee for the White House since George W. Bush in 2004.
Over the past few months in particular, the battleground states — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin — have seen a constant stream of candidate visits, and residents have been bombarded with political ads on billboards, televisions, and smartphones. In the past two weeks alone, presidential and vice presidential candidates have made 21 appearances in Pennsylvania, 17 in Michigan, and 13 in North Carolina.
In the 43 other states, a candidate visit is an exciting novelty.
Trump retains fervent pockets of support even in states that vote overwhelmingly against him, and he can easily fill his rallies with enthusiastic supporters.
He has made other recent detours from the states most at play, holding rallies at Madison Square Garden in New York and in Coachella, California — states that are even more solidly Democratic than New Mexico and Virginia. Those events satisfied Trump's long-shot claims that he can win both states, but were also aimed at earning maximum media attention as his campaign seeks to reach voters who do not follow political news closely.
Trump also showed up in staunchly Republican Montana, and both Trump and Harris campaigned on the same day last week in Texas, which Democrats last won in 1976.
Those trips served other purposes, such as highlighting issues important in a state or supporting House or Senate candidates.
Trump said in Albuquerque that he could win the state as long as the election is fair, repeating his historic claims about rigged past elections.
""If we could bring God down from heaven, he could be the vote counter and we could win this,"" Trump said. He added he's visiting New Mexico because it's ""good for my credentials"" with Hispanic voters.
Trump's strategy carries risk.
After losing to Trump in 2016, Democrat Hillary Clinton was criticized for going to Arizona late in the campaign instead of spending time in Wisconsin, Michigan, or Pennsylvania, states that ended up deciding that election. Arizona is now a battleground, but it wasn't considered particularly competitive eight years ago, when it voted for Trump by a 4-percentage point margin.
""I don't think there's any strategy,"" said Bob Shrum, a longtime Democrat political consultant who worked on numerous presidential campaigns and now leads Center for the Political Future at University of Southern California. ""I think he insisted on doing it. It makes no sense.""
The planned visit to Albuquerque brings Trump and his immigration stance to a border state with the nation's highest concentration of Latino voters, highlighting the campaign for Hispanic supporters.
About 44% of the voting-age population in New Mexico identifies as Hispanic. Many have centuries-old ties to Mexican and Spanish settlements, while the state has a smaller share of foreign-born residents than the national average.
At the same time, federal and local authorities in New Mexico are dealing with a surge in migrant deaths along the U.S. border with Mexico.
Trump's visit has implications for a congressional swing district stretching from Albuquerque to the border with Mexico. It's now held by a Democrat as Republicans look to hold onto their narrow House majority. Immigration has been a major issue in the race.
Also on the ballot, Democrat Sen. Martin Heinrich is seeking a third term against Republican Nella Domenici. She is the daughter of the late Republican Sen. Pete Domenici, who served six terms, from 1973 to 2009 and was the last New Mexico Republican elected to the Senate.
Independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. remains on the ballot in New Mexico, and roadside campaign signs for Kennedy popped up across the capital city of Santa Fe in late October, about two months after Kennedy's withdrawal from the race and endorsement of Trump.
New Mexico voters have twice rebuffed Trump at the polls, and Democrats hold every statewide elected position, all three congressional seats and majorities in the state House and Senate.
""He just brings us back to what the U.S. needs to be,"" Leandra Dominguez of Albuquerque, 45, said before Trump spoke. ""It's just fallen apart. We just need someone to save us.""
While Virginia was considered a battleground as recently as 2012, it has trended toward Democrats in the past decade, especially in the populous northern Virginia suburbs.
Trump lost the state to Clinton in 2016 and Democrat Joe Biden in 2020. This year, Democrats and their allies in the presidential race have spent nearly twice as much as Republicans on ads in Virginia, data show, though it pales in comparison to the spending in battleground states.
""We have a real chance,"" Trump said while phoning into a Richmond-area rally on Saturday.
Trump, while in Virginia, is likely to speak about Wednesday's Supreme Court ruling leaving in place a purge of voter registrations that the state says is aimed at stopping people who are not U.S. citizens from voting.
The high court, over the dissents of the three liberal justices, granted an emergency appeal from Virginia's Republican administration led by Gov. Glenn Youngkin.
Speaking to Fox News' Bret Baier on Wednesday night, Youngkin said from what he's seeing on the ground, ""Virginia is far more competitive than any of the pundits would have believed.""
He noted that two years after Biden won by 10 percentage points in 2020, he won as governor.
""Virginians are ready for strength back in the White House,"" he said.
Susan Swecker, chairwoman of the Democratic Party of Virginia, said Trump's scheduled visit to Salem on Saturday would only widen Harris' lead in the state.
""Kamala Harris will win Virginia convincingly, as he knows, and any visit from this deranged lunatic will only widen the margin,"" Swecker said.

News Max,New Law Makes Dueling Presidential Transitions Possible,"There will be 77 days between Election Day and inauguration, a period in which the president-elect may ready his or her administration to take over power from President Joe Biden.
Long built on tradition and bipartisanship, the presidential transition exploded into a point of political contention four years ago, after then-President Donald Trump made claims to dispute his loss and his administration delayed kicking off the transition process for weeks.
This year, a new law is meant to start the transition sooner, no matter who wins. But, if neither major party candidate concedes after Election Day, the updated rules allow both sides to get additional government funding and logistical support to begin working toward transitioning to power. That could lead to both Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump potentially assembling dueling, governments-in-waiting for weeks.
“Rules can only take you so far, and ultimately you need to have the players in the system working to shared objective,” said Max Stier, president and CEO of the nonprofit Partnership for Public Service, which has worked with candidates and incumbents on transitions. “Everyone should have the shared objective of making sure that the handoff of power is smooth and effective. And that requires a cooperation that law can’t alone enforce.”
Here’s a look at how changes meant to fix the problems of four years ago may not solve coming issues this time, and where the coming transition stands in the meantime:
Trump claimed widespread voter fraud, delaying the start of the 2020 transition from one administration to the next from Election Day on Nov. 3 to Nov. 23.
The Trump-appointed head of the General Services Administration, Emily Murphy, consulted the transition law dating to 1963 and determined that she had no legal standing to determine a winner — and start funding and cooperating with a transition to a Biden administration — because Trump was still challenging the results in court.
GSA essentially acts as the federal government's landlord, and it wasn't until Trump’s efforts had collapsed across key states that Murphy agreed to formally “ ascertain a president-elect ” and begin the transition process. Trump also eventually posted on social media that his administration would cooperate.
Enacted in December 2022, the Presidential Transition Improvement Act now mandates that the transition process begin five days after the election, even if more than one candidate hasn't conceded.
That avoids long delays and means “an ‘affirmative ascertainment’ by the GSA is no longer a prerequisite for gaining transition support services,” according to agency guidelines on the new rules.
But the new law also effectively mandates federal support and cooperation for both candidates to begin a transition. It states that such support should continue until “significant legal challenges” that could alter electoral outcomes have been “substantially resolved,” or when electors from each state meet in December to formally choose an Electoral College winner.
That means the government potentially bestowing enough backing that both sides can prepare an administration until mid-December — only about a month before Inauguration Day on Jan. 20.
Derek Muller, a University of Notre Dame law professor and presidential transition expert who testified in favor of the legislation, said it ensures that potentially two candidates get backing for transitions, with one eventually falling away. He said that's preferable to having a situation where no transition support is released to either side — which can spark delays leading to national security lapses.
“In the past, it was neither candidate gets the funding. Now it's both,” Muller said.
He pointed to the contested 2000 election, when GSA didn’t determine the winner until the Florida recount fight was settled on Dec. 13 — raising questions about national security gaps that may have contributed to the U.S. being underprepared for the Sept. 11 attacks the following year.
“It can last into mid-December. There’s no question that’s a risk,” Muller said of potential dueling transition efforts after this year's election. “But I think it’s a risk that they want to take. And even mid-December is still a month away from inauguration, so at least you have some certainty.”
Even today, though, Trump continues to claim he won in 2020 and only says he'll accept this November’s results if they are fair, making it easy to imagine him doing so only if he wins — and potentially putting the new law to the test.
The sprawling transition process starts around 4,000 government positions being filled with political appointees — people who are specifically tapped for their jobs by the president-elect's team. That often begins with key Cabinet departments.
Harris’ team already has reached an agreement with the Biden administration to use government office space in Washington and other resources, and to begin vetting potential key national security hires.
Trump's team has signed no transition agreements, missing deadlines to agree with GSA on logistical matters like office space and tech support and with the White House on access to agencies, including documents, employees and facilities.
Stier, of the Partnership for Public Service, said the Trump administration's disregard for the transition process dates to 2016, when the then-president-elect fired his transition coordinator, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, and then spent months of his early administration trying to catch up on basic staffing issues.
Stier said the agreements to prepare transition are merely “the starter's pistol — it isn't actually the race."" The full process, he said, “requires a deep understanding of our government and a willingness to appreciate the importance of process.""
Neither side will be starting totally from scratch. While Harris will build her own government, she might tap some holdovers from the Biden administration, where she was vice president. Trump will bring in a new team, but he built an entirely new administration in 2017 and can do it again.
Harris could also opt to keep Senate-confirmed Biden appointees as acting Cabinet secretaries, just in case it is hard to get her nominations through a post-election, GOP-controlled Congress. She's promised to appoint a Republican to her Cabinet, with an early favorite being former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney — once the third-ranking member of the House GOP and the daughter of a Republican vice president — who has campaigned with Harris.
Trump said he may tap former independent presidential hopeful and anti-vaccination activist Robert Kennedy Jr. on health issues and make South African-born Elon Musk a secretary of federal “cost-cutting.”
Either way, John Kirby, Biden's national security spokesman, said the current administration is set for a proper transition, ″no matter how things play out in the election.""

News Max,Little New in Trump Jan. 6 Unsealed Evidence,"Evidence unsealed Friday in the federal criminal case accusing former President Donald Trump of attempting to overturn the 2020 election contained few details not previously made public and was filled with redactions.
The hundreds of pages, many of which were blanked out and marked ""sealed,"" included material referenced in a sweeping court filing from special counsel Jack Smith made public earlier this month that argued that Trump, the Republican presidential candidate in this year's election, is not immune from the remaining allegations in the case.
Smith refiled his case after the Supreme Court ruled that a former president has broad immunity from prosecution for official acts conducted while in office.
Newsmax reached out to the Trump campaign for comment about the unsealed evidence.
The unsealed documents included excerpts of interviews, with witnesses names blacked out, conducted by then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi's House Jan. 6 select committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.
Much of the evidence, including reports of witness interviews, transcripts of grand jury testimony, and records obtained through search warrants, has been redacted in the public release.
Smith's court filing contained few details that had not already been made public but included descriptions of Trump's conversations with family members and aides.
A compilation of the evidence had been submitted as an attachment to Smith's filing, but its public release was delayed to give the former president time to raise objections.
Trump's lawyers argued that none of the material should be released ahead of the Nov. 5 election and successfully delayed its publication by a week. His defense team ultimately chose not to appeal U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan's decision to release redacted versions of the documents.
Chutkan is considering what evidence can be used against Trump in light of a Supreme Court ruling, CNBC reported.
Trump has pleaded not guilty to four criminal charges accusing him of a multipart conspiracy to obstruct the process to collect and certify the results of his 2020 defeat to Democrat Joe Biden.
The former president has argued the entire case should be thrown out based on the Supreme Court's immunity decision.

News Max,"Vance, Walz to Compete for Midwest Support in Only VP Debate","Vice presidential contenders J.D. Vance and Tim Walz face off in what could be an unusually important undercard debate Tuesday as they compete for decisive votes in America's heartland just weeks before the election.
The showdown between Walz, the Democratic Minnesota governor chosen by Kamala Harris, and Vance, the Republican senator from Ohio who is Donald Trump's running mate, is likely to be the last of the 2024 campaign.
Trump has refused a second debate with Vice President Harris, meaning this could be the final chance to see the two tickets go head to head.
Vance, 40, and Walz, 60, each claim to be the true voice of the crucial Midwestern swing states -- including Michigan and Wisconsin -- that could decide an election that remains on a knife-edge with five weeks to go.
Both have been out of the spotlight as of late, but Walz offered a brief message on X: ""Looking forward to tonight.""
History suggests vice presidential debates rarely move the dial much. But in an election campaign that has seen Harris step in for President Joe Biden unprecedentedly late in the game, Tuesday's contest may have added significance.
The race has seen Vance and Trump use increasingly divisive rhetoric and even falsely accuse immigrants of eating people's pets -- meaning the debate is almost guaranteed to make for fiery television.
""It will whet a lot of people's appetites for November 5,"" Thomas Whalen, an associate professor of social sciences at Boston University, told AFP.
But the debate itself risked being overshadowed by Mideast tensions, after Iran launched ballistic missiles against Israel, which said it largely repelled the attack.
Trump, visiting swing state Wisconsin on Tuesday, made zero mention of Vance or the VP debate in a rambling address. But he did insist that ""if I were in charge, today's attack on Israel never would have happened.""
Should Harris and Walz win, he warned, ""the world goes up in smoke.""
Harris for her part pledged her ""unwavering"" commitment to the security of Israel after Iran launched what she called ""a reckless and brazen attack"" on America's ally.
She said she ""fully"" supported Biden's order for the US military to shoot down some of the missiles.
The CBS clash also comes as several states dig out from enormous storm Helene, which has left at least 130 people dead and brought misery to thousands more.
The devastation, and how to address such disasters, is likely to come up during the debate.
- 'High drama' -
Walz and Vance were each picked by their bosses to reach out to voters in the Midwestern battlegrounds where, thanks to the country's idiosyncratic electoral college system, a few thousand votes could determine who wins the White House race.
Both are military veterans with strong blue-collar credentials. Vance authored the Rust Belt memoir ""Hillbilly Elegy"" while Walz boasts a folksy persona as a former teacher and football coach.
The similarities end there.
The combative Vance shares Trump's penchant for courting controversy, whether by smearing Democrats as ""childless cat ladies"" or by boosting claims that Haitians living in an Ohio town ate residents' pets.
Meanwhile, the cheery Walz will be seeking to introduce himself to a public that barely knows him, after Harris's swift rise to replace Biden as the Democratic nominee.
He became a hit with Democrats for branding Vance and Trump ""weird"" and for his progressive politics -- but that will be a target for Vance as he and Trump seek to paint Walz and Harris as ""Marxists."" He has also drawn fire from critics who say he has overstated his military service and role in the National Guard.
Vance ""is going up against a moron, a total moron,"" Trump said in an interview Monday on Fox Nation.
Televised debates have already proved their ability to shock this year, with Biden forced to drop his reelection bid after a disastrous performance against Trump in June brought long-simmering concerns about his age to the fore.
Whalen said few vice presidential debates have ""had any appreciable difference"" in the past, but Tuesday's clash could produce ""high drama"" for viewers who love political theater.",2024-10-01
News Max,Malcolm Hoenlein to Newsmax: Biden Erred in Revealing Plans to Iran,"Malcolm Hoenlein, executive vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations, told Newsmax on Wednesday that President Joe Biden erred in telegraphing to the Iranians what the U.S. will and won't do to help defend Israel.
""I think it's a mistake for the president or anyone else to signal to the Iranians what we won't do,"" Hoenlein said on ""Newsline."" ""We should keep them guessing. Part of the strength we have right now is that they believe Israel is capable and has proven itself capable, to do remarkable things that truly damage the Iranian interests, both out of their ring of fire — their allies, the Houthis, the Hezbollah, the Hamas — as well as Iran itself. And so [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu has made it clear that he will choose the time and the place and does not signal what they will not do to get Iran off the hook.""
Hoenlein added: ""Iran has to understand that they will pay a heavy price. The United States has been working with Israel, but should not send messages that are mixed signals. We have to be very clear there will be a heavy price. This was an act of war — 181 missiles that could have killed many people. Thank God they were interrupted and intercepted through various means, but the next time it may not be the case.""
Israel has vowed to retaliate after Iran's ballistic missile attack on Tuesday, while the U.S. warned Tehran of ""severe consequences.""

News Max,"Russia, Iran, China Could Stoke Post-election Violence: US Intel","Russia, China and Iran are intent on fanning divisive narratives to divide Americans ahead of the Nov. 5 U.S. elections and may consider fomenting violence after voters go to the polls, U.S. intelligence officials said on Tuesday.
The officials, briefing reporters on U.S. election security, said foreign actors could consider physical threats and violence, and are highly likely to conduct disinformation operations to create uncertainty and undermine the election process.
""Foreign actors, particularly Russia, Iran and China, remain intent on fanning divisive narratives to divide Americans and undermine Americans' confidence in the U.S. democratic system. These activities are consistent with what these actors perceive to be in their interests, even as their tactics continue to evolve,"" said one official from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI).
That official said influence actors, ""particularly from Russia, Iran and China,"" have learned from previous U.S. elections and are better prepared to exploit opportunities to stoke unrest.
Those actors could draw on the same type of tools they have been using in the pre-election period - especially information and cyber operations - and may also consider physical threats and violence, the ODNI official added.
But U.S. intelligence has not seen collaboration between Russia, China and Iran in election influence activities, the officials said. And, while foreign actors might seek to disrupt the process on Election Day, feeding discontent, the voting system is secure enough that they could not alter the outcome.
""Some foreign actors also have the capacity to stoke protests and take violent actions during this (post-election) period,"" the ODNI official said. ""In particular, Iran and Russia are probably willing to at least consider tactics that would contribute to such violence.""
A declassified memorandum released after the briefing by the National Intelligence Council (NIC) - the top U.S. intelligence analytical body - warned that foreign operatives almost certainly will amplify false post-vote claims of election irregularities.
They also may use cyber attacks and espionage to disrupt or alter news and public government websites to promote confusion about the results and spread disinformation about the ballot-counting process, especially in races that are too close to call, the NIC said.
The U.S. presidential race is expected to be tight. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday showed Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris with a 46% to 43% lead over Republican former President Donald Trump.
China has no intention of interfering in the election and hopes that whoever wins ""will be committed to growing sound and stable China-U.S. ties,"" a Chinese embassy spokesperson said in an email.
The Russian embassy and Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Russia and Iran previously have denied U.S. election-meddling allegations.
USING AI
The ODNI official said foreign actors were using social media and other online operations to influence U.S. presidential and congressional races, to denigrate some candidates or support others.
Some social media posts are likely to be generated by artificial intelligence, said that official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.
As an example, the ODNI official pointed to a post on social media platform X this month generated by what he called Russian influence actors that made a false allegation against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who is Harris' vice presidential running mate.
Intelligence agencies assessed that Russian influence actors created the content, the ODNI official said. A media review by the agencies showed ""several indicators of manipulation"" consistent with the actions of Russian actors, the official said.
That official said U.S. intelligence concluded last weekend that the video was fake and the product of disinformation operatives, adding that it was consistent with ongoing Russian efforts to undermine the Democratic presidential ticket by fabricating allegations against Harris and Walz.
U.S. intelligence agencies have been assessing for months that Russia would prefer that Trump retake the White House.
At Tuesday's briefing for reporters, intelligence officials said they expected more Russian amplification of protests if Harris wins the election.
""Russia would prefer the former president to win and they would seek to more aggressively undermine the presidency of the then-president-elect (Harris),"" the ODNI official said.
The NIC said ""Iranian actors"" may try to publish online content disparaging Trump.

This man is not a dictator,"" Mas said. ""He is a strong-willed businessperson who knows exactly what America needs to get back on track. And I hope that everybody listening to my voice goes out and votes, because that's what we need to bring Donald Trump back into the White House.
""He's not a dictator by any stretch of the imagination. He's not a Fidel Castro.""

News Max,Army Releases Official Report on Trump Arlington Incident,"The United States Army released a report Friday about the August incident between members of former President Donald Trump’s campaign for reelection team and an Army staff member at Arlington National Cemetery.
The heavily redacted document claims the Trump staffer put “both hands” on the Army official in what amounts to “simple assault.”
The incident occurred on Aug. 26 when Army staff indicated to Trump’s campaign team that they could not film inside the cemetery. Trump was there visiting the graves of several troops killed in Afghanistan in 2021.
“The law enforcement investigation into the incident remains open and we are therefore unable to provide further information at this time,” the Army said in a statement on Friday.
The Army staffer declined to press charges, fearing safety concerns if her identity was to be made public.

News Max,Rep. Clark: Voting Rights 1st Bill If Dems Take House,"House Democrats plan to prioritize voting rights if they win back the majority in the upcoming elections, Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass., told The Hill.
""We know that everything flows from the right to vote and having voter security, and what we have seen are attacks on that right to vote — undermining, through misinformation, Americans' belief in the integrity [of elections],"" the Democrat whip said in an interview with the outlet. ""We have fair and secure elections in this country. ... Donald Trump and J.D. Vance are still denying the 2020 election, which is outrageous.""
Under former Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., Democrats introduced comprehensive election reform as their first bill in the 116th and 117th Congresses. If they regain the majority, Clark confirmed that Democrats would pursue similar efforts.
Two key options include the For the People Act, which expands voting access and reforms campaign finance laws, and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which restores provisions of the 1965 Voting Rights Act struck down by the Supreme Court in 2013.
The For the People Act has passed the House twice but stalled in the Senate. It would expand voter access, limit voter roll purges, and require presidential candidates to release tax returns.
The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act would reinstate federal oversight for states with histories of voter discrimination, ensuring changes to election laws are pre-approved.
House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., the likely speaker if Democrats win the House, has echoed Clark's commitment to voting rights. During a rally in New York's 4th Congressional District, Jeffries called for passing the John Lewis Act.
""No one can take away your voice, your power, your ability to determine your future,"" he said.
As both parties fight for control of the House and the White House, Democrats focus their campaign on ""protecting democracy."" Trump's claims of election fraud remain central to political discourse, with some Republicans, like House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., continuing to suggest illegal voting has taken place in some form.
Beyond voting rights, Democrats are also preparing to prioritize women's reproductive rights. Clark indicated that restoring protections for women's healthcare, including access to abortion, would be a close second on the legislative agenda. Following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, Democrats have vowed to take action on reproductive freedom.
Democrats need to win four additional seats to regain control of the House, a goal Clark is optimistic about.
""We are making plans for the future. We will be ready,"" she said. ""But our priority is winning on Nov. 5.""

News Max,Eric Trump: Starmer Imperils UK-US Relations,"Eric Trump on Monday said U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer risks ""poisoning"" relations with the U.S. by interfering in the presidential election after some volunteers from the Labour Party traveled to help campaign for Vice President Kamala Harris.
""We have people who dabble in U.S. politics all the time from all over the world, it never quite works, and as a U.S. citizen, it pisses me off,"" Trump, son of former President Donald Trump, told the Daily Mail. ""You would think a leader would want to make best friends with both sides because it's only in the benefit of a country to have good relationships with whoever actually wins the election.
""It poisons a relationship if the election goes another way.""
Donald Trump filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission, calling for an investigation into what it termed apparently illegal contributions from the Labour Party to the Harris campaign.
Labour leader Starmer denied that the complaint would damage relations with Trump if the former president wins again on Nov. 5, saying Labour supporters were volunteering in their own time.
""The Labour Party has volunteers, [they] have gone over pretty much every election,"" Starmer told reporters. ""They're doing it in their spare time. They're doing it as volunteers. They're staying, I think, with other volunteers over there.""
Information from Reuters was used in this report.

News Max,Sen. Tuberville to Newsmax: Republicans Learning to Vote Early,"Republicans are casting early ballots in record numbers and that's because they're ""learning for the first time to go vote and go early"" to improve their chances of winning, Sen. Tommy Tuberville said on Newsmax Tuesday.
""We haven't done that in the past,"" the Alabama Republican told ""Wake Up America."" ""We've been [turning out] for a day of voting on a Tuesday and trying to cram it all in.""
But now, he added, ""you're seeing record turnouts for Republicans right now, especially in the South, and we've been keeping up with it.""
Data from the University of Florida's Election Lab shows that nearly 18 million Americans have voted early as of Tuesday, and while Democrats continue to outpace Republicans in early voting, the numbers with Republicans are also growing.
""It's something new for us,"" Tuberville said. ""But hey, if they're going to do it, let's do it, and let's do it the right way, and don't be left out in the cold like we have been over the last couple of times.""
Meanwhile, the Department of Justice has filed suit against Alabama over its voting laws after efforts to clear the voting rolls of non-citizens, and Tuberville said the move is ""all a plan"" to ""keep everybody in turmoil.""
""We are getting sued, obviously from Merrick Garland, the attorney general of the United States,"" said Tuberville. ""He's a Democrat.""
But the plan won't work, he added.
""Alabama obviously will be a Donald Trump state,"" said Tuberville. ""There's no problem there. But we have to make sure that we have congressional seats covered because our representatives run every two years. I'm not up this year. [GOP Sen.] Katie Britt is not up this year. But our representatives are and we want to make sure we turn out strong.""
At the same time, ""Democrats are trying to do everything they possibly can to keep Republicans from voting,"" he said.
Tuberville also commented on Vice President Kamala Harris' choosing to prepare for an upcoming NBC interview rather than being out campaigning like Trump.
""I think they're just trying to keep her off-camera,"" he said. ""She's been a disaster. Her poll numbers keep going down. Donald Trump is the Energizer bunny. I mean, he does not quit. I mean, he keeps going and going and going … he sleeps 2 or 3 hours a night, but he loves what he's doing. He loves the country. He's our only chance. We can't lose this.""
Trump, he added, will ""get us out of the wars. He will get us back to spending the right way.""
The United States must ""get an identity back,"" said Tuberville.
""We don't have an identity and the Democrats are all to blame for it because they pushed all this agenda that is totally nonsense,"" he said.
Meanwhile, Tuberville said that if he were advising Trump, he'd remind him to focus on education.
""We've got to get back to educating our kids instead of indoctrinating our kids all across the country,"" said Tuberville.
The economy is also vital, he added.
""We've got to get prices back down,"" he said. ""We've got to start drilling for oil. We've got to open our spigots up and, and give the American people a chance right now.""

News Max,Rep. Massie Endorses Trump for President,"Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., one of the most conservative, libertarian, and independent thinkers in Congress over the past 12 years, said Friday he is endorsing Donald Trump for president.
The six-term lawmaker, who represents Kentucky's 4th Congressional District, made his declaration in a statement he posted on X.
""Donald Trump will put Americans first by securing our liberties and home and preventing needless wars abroad,"" the statement read. ""He will Make American Healthy Again by empowering small farmers and taking on special interests that have corrupted our healthcare system. He has even committed to freeing Ross Ulbricht, who was wrongfully sentenced.""
Ulbricht, the founder of Silk Road, a darknet marketplace that used Bitcoin as its primary currency for anonymous transactions, mostly for illegal goods and services, was sentenced to life in prison in 2015 after being convicted of several charges, including distributing narcotics and engaging in a continuing criminal enterprise. His case is viewed by many as an example of government overreach.
""For these and many other reasons, he has my full endorsement,"" Massie said in his statement. ""I encourage conservatives, as well as independents and libertarians, to join me in voting for Donald J. Trump for President.""

News Max,Report: Iran Assassination Plots 'Extraordinarily Serious',"Iran's efforts to assassinate Donald Trump and former senior officials in retaliation for the drone strike that killed Qassem Soleimani are more extensive and aggressive than previously believed, Politico reported Friday.
""This is extraordinarily serious,"" Matt Olsen, the Department of Justice's assistant attorney general for national security, told Politico. ""Iran has made it very clear that they are determined to seek retaliation against former officials in connection with the Soleimani strike.""
Iran has not been hiding its intentions to assassinate Trump and those who oversaw his national security strategy since January 2020, when Trump ordered a drone strike that killed Soleimani, Iran's most powerful military general, at an Iraqi airport.
The Islamic regime has posted videos depicting the future deaths of Trump and others who helped orchestrate the attack, pushed for their arrest and extradition, and issued menacing statements promising revenge, Politco reported.
Although the government has gone to great lengths to protect many of those officials, some who experience similar threats receive no government protection, according to Politico.
Politico reported that it spoke with 24 people with direct knowledge of the Soleimani strike or the ensuing assassination threat, including current and former U.S. lawmakers, Secret Service agents, congressional aides, and senior U.S. officials. Some were granted anonymity because of ongoing threats against them or the sensitivity of their work.
Politico reported many cautioned that Iran lacks sophisticated assassination teams and likely could not pull one off against a well-defended individual inside the U.S. But the two assassination attempts against Trump this year have reopened questions about the government's ability to protect even its senior-most former officials.
In addition to Trump, who receives Secret Service protection as a former president, at least seven former generals, diplomats, and civilian policy advisers from his White House receive a 24/7 government security detail, Politico reported.
The list is includes those with direct ties to the Soleimani killing or were high up in the Trump administration, according to Politico: Mark Esper, secretary of defense; Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Paul Nakasone, head of the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command; Marine Corps Gen. Kenneth McKenzie, head of U.S. Central Command; Mike Pompeo, secretary of state; and Brian Hook, the State Department's special representative for Iran.
Milley did not respond to requests by Politico for comment. The others declined to comment.
The earliest indication of Iran's willingness to try to kill a former Trump official was with John Bolton, Trump's national security adviser who left office before the Soleimani strike. Bolton is a staunch advocate for taking a hard line against the Islamic regime.
In December 2021, the Biden administration approved Secret Service protection for Bolton.
Some argue the risk to Trump from Iran is increasing. In July, the FBI arrested an Iranian operative who entered the U.S. to arrange the assassination of ""a political person"" in retaliation for Soleimani's death.
The individual, a Pakistani national, remotely scouted a Trump rally.
On Friday, the Trump campaign reportedly requested, among other things, military aircraft for Trump to travel on during the final weeks of the campaign and expanded flight restrictions over his residences and rallies in light of the Iranian threat.
The Biden administration said it has sent warnings to Tehran to cease all plotting against Trump and former U.S. officials, according to Politico.

News Max,N.C. Rep. Chuck Edwards to Newsmax: Radio Silence From Biden,"Rep. Chuck Edwards, R-N.C., told Newsmax on Thursday that there has been radio silence from President Joe Biden as the communities in western North Carolina continue to pick up the pieces in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.
""I've not spoken with him directly,"" Edwards said during an appearance on Newsmax's ""Wake Up America."" ""Admittedly, the White House has called me a couple of times. They've been responsive to what I've asked so far, but I've not heard from him.""
When asked how many times he's spoken with Vice President Kamala Harris, who is running as the Democrat nominee for president, Edwards said, ""Zero.""
""Not heard from her at all,"" he said.
Edwards said that western North Carolina is beginning to ""see the relief or the assistance from FEMA and from various folks around the country,"" adding that the relief effort got off to ""a very slow start … but there are some signs of activity now.""
The Republican congressman, whose district includes Asheville, one of the hardest-hit areas, said that he thinks ""it's important that elected leaders see the devastation firsthand.""
""I don't know that you're going to see it by flying overhead,"" he said, referring to Biden's aerial tour of Asheville on Wednesday. ""I was given the opportunity to participate on that flight yesterday. I turned it down.
""I was wading in the water and through debris and talking to victims firsthand. That's the only way that you get a real perspective on this. And in terms of offering anybody any comfort, I don't see that unless they're bringing pallets of water with them.""
Conversely, Edwards said he has heard from former President Donald Trump's team and said the GOP presidential nominee is ""extremely concerned about what's happening here.""
""I feel confident that we would not have seen the delay in response from the federal government, were Donald Trump in charge,"" he said.
Trump was on the ground in Valdosta, Georgia, on Monday to deliver remarks and help hand out supplies to the devastated area, including water and fuel.
""I was also going to stop into North Carolina, which has really been hit hard,"" the former president wrote on Truth Social. ""I have a lot of supplies ready for them, but access and communication is now restricted, and we want to make sure that Local Emergency Management is able to focus on helping the people most affected, and not being concerned with me.""
He added that he would ""be there shortly.""
Edwards said that although the area will ""certainly be in search and recovery mode for months,"" he is ""so proud of the people here in the mountains, and how they've come together as neighbors, churches, [and] neighborhoods.""
""Organizations are deploying, coming together, helping neighbors, helping feed folks that can't get to a grocery store or don't have anything in their cabinets,"" he said. ""They're helping make sure folks have got water. They're doing welfare checks. The folks here are really coming together.""

News Max,Halperin to Newsmax: 'Hidden Voter Surge' May Be Happening,"Republicans have been turning out in record numbers during early voting, and it may be indicative of a ""hidden voter surge,"" political analyst Mark Halperin told Newsmax Wednesday.
On ""Rob Schmitt Tonight,"" Halperin said, ""Democrats are going to have to explain rather than spin what combination of voter enthusiasm and mechanical competence is causing these early vote numbers. It's not happening by accident.
""Those are the two factors. And there's whether you want to call it a 'hidden vote,' whether you want to minimize what's happening by saying the Republicans are simply moving votes from same day Election Day to early, something's going on again.""
He added, ""The [Donald] Trump turnout operation, which was derided, seems to be doing OK right now. And it's the same operation that we'll be doing Election Day.
""So there's ambiguity. There's, it's easy to read too much into things.""
But, he said, pollster Craig Keshishian, who said there's a hidden voter surge happening, ""could be right for sure.""
Halperin went on to say that deep blue New Hampshire could potentially be in play. He said several high-profile Democrats, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, have visited the state in recent days.
""And although it's not on Trump's schedule, they posted on the website the other day — they claim by accident — the fact that he was going to go to New Hampshire on their events page. So I think he'll go,"" he said.
""He's already going to New Mexico. He's already going to Virginia. I think he'll go to all four.
""And it's not just symbolism. Even if Trump wins one of those four, even if she wins the 'blue wall' states, he wins.""

News Max,Musk Holds First Solo Event in Support of Trump Near Philly,"Elon Musk held his first solo event in support of Donald Trump for president on Thursday, encouraging voters in the Philadelphia suburbs to register to cast their ballots and vote early, though some attendees shouted back, ""Why?""
The America PAC event at Ridley High School's auditorium in Folsom featured the world's richest man speaking onstage in front of a large U.S. flag for roughly 15 minutes before taking questions from the crowd, many of whom wore ""Make America Great Again"" hats.
The event was billed as a call to action to vote early in the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania, where Trump and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris are fiercely contesting the election. Some in the crowd questioned Musk's entreaties to vote early, reflecting the possibility that Republicans are still persuading their supporters to embrace early voting after Trump spent years demonizing the method.
The crowd rose to its feet and took cellphone videos as Musk, the billionaire founder of Tesla and Space X and owner of the social media platform X, walked onstage. They remained standing during his remarks and cheered loudly after he said the U.S. Constitution needs to be upheld.
""This is literally the fundamental values that made America what it is today. And anyone who is against those things is fundamentally anti-American and to hell with them,"" said Musk, who was born in South Africa. The crowd erupted.
He exhorted the crowd to make sure they and their friends and family were registered to vote and to ""pester"" those who weren't. Toward the end of the question period, which included more than a dozen from those in the audience, he was asked to explain whether people should vote early in Pennsylvania. Musk was momentarily distracted by a fan waving a hat, which he appeared to sign, and then by a child whom he brought onstage for a photo.
Redirected to the question, he said people should vote immediately.
Some in the crowd cupped their hands and shouted, ""Why?"" He did not answer. A spokesperson said after the event that he didn't have additional comment.
Trump for years has sowed doubt about mail and early voting by claiming it was rife with fraud, though voter fraud is rare in the United States. This year, Republicans are making a renewed push to encourage their supporters to vote early and lock in their ballots, though they acknowledge skepticism from those conditioned by Trump's false claims.
John and Linda Bird, a couple who attended the event, said they had concerns about the integrity of the voting system and worried about voting early.
John Bird said he planned to vote on Election Day. Linda pointed to a sign given out at the event that said Trump called for early voting and worried about the possibility of not getting to the polls on Nov. 5.
Still, she said she'd cast her ballot on Election Day, too.
""Anything can happen, you know, you wake up that morning, some catastrophe happens or whatever,"" she said. ""But, you know, we're planning on voting on Nov. 5.""
One of the questioners asked about fraud in elections — something Trump has falsely insisted cost him the 2020 race. An Associated Press review of every potential case of voter fraud in the six battleground states disputed by Trump found fewer than 475, a number that would have made no difference in the outcome.
Musk said sarcastically that it must be a coincidence that Dominion voting machines, which had been at the center of conspiracy theories in the 2020 election, were used in Pennsylvania and Arizona, two battleground states won by Democrat Joe Biden. In 2023, Fox News agreed to pay Dominion Voting Systems $787 million to avoid a trial in a defamation lawsuit the voting machine company brought against the network for lies told about their company switching ballots.
In an emailed statement Thursday, Dominion said its machines are not used in Philadelphia, as Musk said. The statement also said its systems are based on ""verified paper ballots.""
""These are not matters of opinion. They are verifiable facts."" Dominion said.
Musk has become a major booster of Trump this campaign season. On Thursday evening, he cast the election in dire terms.
""I haven't been politically active before. I'm politically active now because I think the future of America and the future of civilization is at stake,"" he said.
People were lined up to attend before 3 p.m. as school was letting out. A few people began to leave early when it became clear that not everyone who had lined up to ask a question would have a chance to ask one.
The event was livestreamed on X, formerly Twitter, and was at times glitchy and difficult to follow, even as it drew hundreds of thousands of viewers.
Musk is undertaking much of the get-out-the-vote effort for Trump through his America PAC, a super PAC that can raise and spend unlimited sums of money. He has committed more than $70 million to the super PAC to help Trump and other Republicans win in November.
Trump and the Republican National Committee he controls opted for an unorthodox strategy of sharing canvassing duties in key regions with groups like Musk's. They've also focused their efforts not on independent or moderate voters, but on those who already support Trump but usually do not vote.
Republican activists in swing states said in September that they had seen little activity from the PAC's get-out-the-vote efforts.

News Max,Rep. Donalds to Newsmax: JD Vance Is 'The American Dream Itself',"Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, is the personification of the American Dream, Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., told Newsmax on Tuesday.
On ""The Record With Greta Van Susteren,"" just hours before the vice-presidential debate was set to kick off, the Florida Republican said, ""If you look at J.D. Vance's entire life up to this point, he served our country in the Marines. He went into the business world, made something of himself. He has a beautiful family, beautiful wife. He is the very essence of what Americans aspire to be.
""The American dream itself, because he's come up from nothing in our country and is now on the precipice of being the next vice president of the United States.""
Donalds added, ""You couple that with the fact that the American people are going to see tonight the high level of intellect that J.D. has. It demonstrates really, in some respects, the future of politics to be able to lead our country.""
Donalds had some advice for Vance ahead of the debate. ""I think the approach for J.D. tonight is to lay out very clearly what [Vice President] Kamala Harris has done to break our economy, to break our border. And with [President] Joe Biden to apparently break our foreign policy,"" he said.
""Undecided voters are looking at all of the crises that are facing America, right now.""
But Donalds expressed confidence in Vance's performance. ""He's going to be great tonight,"" he said.

News Max,Biden's Comments Spike Oil Benchmark by 5.5 Percent,"President Joe Biden's comments on potential U.S. support for Israeli strikes on Iranian oil facilities have raised concerns about the future of global oil prices. His remarks on Thursday led to a sharp spike in the U.S. oil benchmark, The Hill reported.
On Thursday, in response to a question about whether the U.S. would support such actions, Biden replied during a White House briefing, “We’re discussing that,” though he quickly added, “There’s nothing going to happen today.”
Following Biden’s remarks, West Texas Intermediate (WTI), the U.S. oil benchmark, surged by 5.5%. The sudden spike highlighted the market’s sensitivity to geopolitical developments, particularly in the Middle East, a key region for global oil production.
On Friday, Biden appeared more direct in discouraging potential attacks on Iranian oil infrastructure. He stated, “The Israelis have not concluded what they’re going to do in terms of a strike. That’s under discussion. If I were in their shoes, I’d be thinking about other alternatives than striking oil fields.”
The president’s comments come amid an intensifying conflict in the region following Israel’s retaliation to the Oct. 7 attacks.
While Israeli bombardments of Gaza have had limited impacts on the oil market over the past year, Biden’s remarks signal a new layer of complexity in the already volatile situation. The region has seen further escalation, including an Israeli incursion into Lebanon that resulted in the death of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and a retaliatory missile strike by Iran earlier this week.
The potential for Israeli actions to impact Iran’s oil production could have far-reaching consequences. Iran, the world’s seventh-largest oil producer, pumps around 4 million barrels of oil per day. While the U.S. does not directly rely on Iranian oil, the global nature of the oil market means any disruption in Iranian supply could still impact American consumers.
“If that market lost supplies of Iranian oil, it affects the consumer because worldwide prices rise, and the U.S. has become a major supplier to the world,” said Andy Lipow, president of consulting firm Lipow Oil Associates, LLC.
Lipow emphasized that the U.S. economy is tied to global oil prices, and any disruption in the flow of Iranian oil would likely lead to higher prices at American gas pumps.
The oil market has been relatively stable in the past year despite regional conflicts, particularly when compared to the significant price spikes following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. That conflict sent gas prices soaring to record highs across the globe.
However, with tensions in the Middle East intensifying and the possibility of direct impacts on Iranian oil production, experts warn that American consumers could see renewed volatility in fuel costs if the situation escalates further.

News Max,Potential October Surprises Loom Over Presidential Election,"October surprises have a history of upending presidential elections, from the revelation of George W. Bush's DWI arrest in 2000 to Donald Trump's infamous Access Hollywood tape in 2016.
The Access Hollywood tape showed how potential new audio or video could upend a presidential election. Vice President Kamala Harris could face trouble if audio or video of her talking about how her past positions like supporting a ban of fracking surfaces, The Hill reported, while former President Donald Trump has faced attacks from the Harris campaign for promising wealthy donors a tax cut if elected.
The unpredictable nature of weather could change the shape of the race. Barack Obama got a boost for his handling of Superstorm Sandy in 2012, getting a hug from then-New Jersey Republican Gov. Chris Christie.
Hurricane Helene forced Harris to suspend in-person campaigning to return to Washington, D.C., to be briefed on the storm while Trump visited Georgia where he criticized the federal government's response to the storm. Harris and President Joe Biden are expected to visit areas affected by the storm.
The 2024 presidential election has seen Trump face two assassination attempts, including being grazed by a bullet while speaking at a rally in Pennsylvania. NBC News reported last month the FBI was investigating after election officials in six states received suspicious packages.
""I'm most concerned about vote-counting and election judges and violence. There's been a pretty clear pattern of threats about who gets to count votes,"" John Murphy, a professor at the University of Illinois who studies political rhetoric, told The Hill.
Another presidential debate could also change the shape of the race. The debate between Biden and Trump led to Biden dropping out of the race, while Harris was widely viewed to have bested Trump in their only debate. Trump has refused another debate, saying it would be too late, with early voting well underway in many states.
Vice presidential candidates Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat, will be debating on Tuesday.
The continued turmoil in the Middle East looms over the presidential campaign. Next week marks a year since Hamas attacked Israel and Israel recently launched a ground invasion of Lebanon, while US officials believe Iran is preparing to launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel.

News Max,Harris Won't Appear on Rogan Podcast: Campaign,"Vice President Kamala Harris will not appear on comedian Joe Rogan's podcast, with news that the interview was scrapped coming one day before former President Donald Trump's scheduled appearance on the program Friday.
Harris campaign spokesman Ian Sams told MSNBC's Chris Hayes Thursday night that the appearance for the ""Joe Rogan Experience"" podcast was canceled because of ""the scheduling of this period of the campaign,"" reports Mediaite Friday morning.
Sams said that Harris is ""happy to go anywhere and any place to talk to a broad segment of the country,"" and that the campaign had spoken with Rogan and his team about the podcast.
He stressed that the vice president has done other interviews and that she is ""happy to go into these places and share her message.""
Sams added: ""Donald Trump with Joe Rogan, that's going to be an interesting thing to watch.""
Rogan, posting the news that Harris would not be on his program, quipped on X ""Who's surprised?""
Rogan's fan base leans toward libertarians and younger males, and he often attracts high-profile guests from across the political spectrum to appear on his program.

News Max,Lara Trump to Newsmax: GOP Must Embrace Early Voting,"Republican National Committee co-Chair Lara Trump told Newsmax on Tuesday that early voting in North Carolina will help propel former President Donald Trump to victory in the upcoming general election.
Speaking about her home state of North Carolina, she noted that 1 million people have already cast a ballot in the state, which she said ""without a doubt"" helps Donald Trump in November.
""You have to remember, especially in a state like North Carolina, there were so many people who were adversely affected by"" Hurricane Helene, which caused widespread damage across the state, Lara Trump said on ""Newsline."" ""The whole western part of the state is still in a recovery mode of sorts, and yet we've actually seen historic vote totals. And a lot of those counties in the western part of North Carolina.""
She added that there’s a ""really palpable"" energy in North Carolina and ""all across this country,"" saying that ""people have been understanding why they have to get out and vote early.""
She said the RNC and the Trump campaign have ""been trying to talk to people in our party about the importance of early voting.""
""You see these vote totals really high and that's great, but I don't want anyone to get complacent. I don't want anybody to think we're going to take our foot off the gas.""
She added: ""We have 14 days left to make sure that we get Donald Trump back in that White House. That is exactly what we intend to do, and we are all across the country right now making sure we're delivering just that message.""

News Max,"NY Times/Siena College Poll: Trump, Harris Deadlocked","Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are in a tie of 48% each for the popular vote, The New York Times/Siena College final national poll for this election season revealed Friday.
The numbers do not bode well for Harris, considering Democrat candidates in recent years have taken the popular vote, even while losing the Electoral College nod, as was the case in 2016 when Hillary Clinton lost to Trump, reports The New York Times.
The poll was conducted of 2,516 registered voters nationally between Oct. 20-23 and carried a margin of error of plus or minus 2.2 percentage points. Harris' numbers have taken a slight drop since October when the Times/Siena College poll had her at a 49%-46% lead over Trump, but even then, the numbers left them at a statistical tie, considering the polling margin of error.
Even the polls in the battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin remain tight, pointing to a contest that remains up in the air with less than two weeks left until Election Day.
Some factors could swing the race toward one or the other of the candidates.
Immigration, one of the top issues among voters, is a strong suit for Trump, who has slammed Harris, the Biden administration's ""border czar"" on the matter.
Trump has promised that if elected, he'll launch the ""largest deportation"" in American history, and voters in the NY Times/Siena College poll said by an 11% margin that they trust him over Harris to handle the situation.
However, the number of Americans who say that Trump, at 78 years of age, is too old to be president stayed at 41% since July, which could prove an advantage for Harris among voters.
Harris has also drawn closer to Trump when it comes to the economy, the top issue for voters. Trump had a 13-point edge on Harris concerning the economy, but his lead shrunk to 6 percentage points.
Harris also held a 16-point lead over Trump in the poll about who would better protect access to abortion, and those numbers may grow. The survey showed that 15% of voters said they are not decided on who would handle the abortion issue better, and 42% of those people said they lean toward Harris, compared to 32% for Trump.
But two weeks ago, Trump held that edge with the undecided voters by 36% to 35%.
The poll also showed that Harris is ahead by 59% to 40% with voters who have already cast their ballots. However, there are signs that Republicans are also increasingly voting early this year, unlike in the past.
Other numbers have changed little in the Times/Siena polls over the past three months, including voters' opinion of Harris after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. She was seen favorably by 48% of the voters, as was Trump.
Harris also continued to lead among women, by 54% to 42%, with Trump ahead with men by 55% to 41%, numbers that have changed little in comparison with other polls.
In addition to the presidential race being deadlocked, the poll also found that 48% said they plan to vote for a Republican for Congress, with 48% saying they plan to vote for a Democrat.

News Max,Pollster Zogby to Newsmax: Momentum Not With Harris,"National polls are tightening and support for Vice President Kamala Harris could be waning, pollster John Zogby told Newsmax on Monday.
Zogby, appearing on ""American Agenda,"" noted that in battleground states, ""We're at a tie and momentum is not with Kamala Harris right now, simply because, at the very least, I think the novelty has worn off. She got herself a nice honeymoon. She was a different voice. She changed the conversation.
""But from the very beginning, after the honeymoon, as well, the pressure has been on to get specific. And, you know, there have been cliches you know, about an 'opportunity society' and that sort of thing. On the other hand, people are looking for specifics. Not the least of which is ... what is going to be different about you? Where is the change?
""And I think at the moment, anyway, there's still some time left, but at the moment she has ceded the mantle of change over to Donald Trump. That's not a good position for her to be in.""
Recent ABC, CBS, and NBC polls show Harris and former President Donald Trump deadlocked in the seven key swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, with Trump leading by 1 or 2 percentage points in all but Nevada.
But what that means come Nov. 5, is anyone's guess, Zogby said. ""Even a 2-point lead in Arizona, a 1-point lead ties. This is a tie. You know we are at equilibrium. We have no idea the direction things are going to going,"" he said.
""Campaign is going to be very important. There's no way to predict or even project on the basis of these numbers what's going to happen. We're at a tie right now.""

News Max,"Speaker, ABC Host Spar Over Trump Election Rhetoric","House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and ABC News ""This Week"" host George Stephanopoulos spent the majority of a Sunday interview arguing over what questions to answer.
Stephanopoulos spent the majority of his interview trying to get Johnson to respond to a statement former President Donald Trump made at his most recent Butler, Pennsylvania rally, where he stated:
""Over the past eight years, those who want to stop us from achieving this future have slandered me, impeached me, indicted me, and tried to throw me off the ballot. And who knows? Maybe even tried to kill me?""
The clip of Trump speaking, taken by ABC News, was immediately followed up with a clip from Trump's son, Eric Trump, speaking at the rally, stating: ""They tried to kill him.""
""So,"" Stephanopoulos asked Johnson, ""is it right for the president and his family to suggest that Democrats are behind the effort to assassinate him?""
Reacting to the clip, Johnson told Stephanopoulos, ""I think what they're alluding to is what we've all been saying: They have got to turn the rhetoric down.""
""For years now, the leading Democrats in this country, the – the highly – highest elected officials, and the current nominee for president have gone out and said that Donald Trump is a threat to democracy. That, you know, the republic will end if he's reelected.""
Stephanopoulos then pressed Johnson on a series of gotcha questions, mostly in regards to Jan. 6., such as: ""Can you say unequivocally that Joe Biden won the 2020 election and Donald Trump lost? What would you do next Jan. 6 if you are indeed speaker? If every state completes the certification process successfully, will you accept the results even if [Vice President] Kamala Harris is the winner?""
Amid Stephanopoulos's pressing, Johnson requested the news anchor to ask him a policy question. But Stephanopoulos refused.
When it came to asking Johnson about election fraud, in an effort to grab a sound bite from the speaker that the election was stolen, Johnson refrained for a second and then mentioned how, throughout his travels across the country this campaign season, voters have told him that election security is a primary concern for them.
""I'll tell you that election security is a major concern of the American people. The first or second question, almost without exception in every audience and crowd, is about election security.""
""I think,"" he added, ""the latest poll says 60% of Americans and both parties are worried about that. They're worried about election interference by foreign nationals like Iran who's trying to meddle in our elections. They're worried about, of course, illegals voting, non-citizens voting. That is against federal law.""
Newsmax has found no evidence that Iran or Russia or China has meddled in the lead-up to the upcoming election. However, the FBI did release a statement claiming that ""Russia, Iran, and China are trying by some measure to exacerbate divisions in U.S. society for their own benefit, and see election periods as moments of vulnerability. Efforts by these, or other foreign actors, to undermine our democratic institutions are a direct threat to the U.S. and will not be tolerated.""
Nonetheless, and despite the agency providing no evidence, the statement from the FBI can only be taken on good faith.

News Max,Trump Seizes on Walz's 'I'm Friends With School Shooters',"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump caught Minnesota Democrat Gov. Tim Walz saying twice he was ""friends with school shooters,"" noting the debate moderators nor the media are asking him to clarify a potentially ""very big mistake.""
""Why aren't the after shows talking about the fact that Walz said, 'I'm friends with school shooters!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social, pointing out the bias in the media and CBS News' moderators Margaret Brennan and Norah O'Donnell.
""Walz made a very big mistake on Gun Shooters,"" Trump added in another post. ""Does anyone think he knows what he said? Will he have a News Conference after the Debate to apologize to the parents and others who were so horribly hurt?""
""He said it twice — It is a DISQUALIFIER!"" Trump added.
Notably, Trump has been shot in an assassination attempt on July 13 and the Secret Service arrested another suspected assassin last month poised to strike at his South Florida golf course while he was golfing on a Sunday morning.

News Max,Trump Won't Participate in Interview for '60 Minutes' Election Special,"CBS News said Tuesday that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has declined to participate in an interview with “60 Minutes” for its election special, which will go forward next Monday with Democratic opponent Kamala Harris alone.
Television's top-rated news program regularly invites the two presidential contenders for separate interviews that air back-to-back on a show near the election. This year, it is scheduled for Monday instead of its usual Sunday time slot.
Asked for comment, the former president's campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said, “Fake news,"" adding that there were discussions but nothing was ever locked in.
“60 Minutes” said Trump's campaign had initially agreed to an interview before telling CBS that the former president would not appear. The network said its invitation to sit for an interview still stands, and correspondent Scott Pelley will explain Trump's absence to viewers.
Vice President Harris will appear in a pretaped interviewed with Bill Whitaker.
There are currently no other scheduled opportunities for voters to compare the two candidates together. Harris and Trump previously debated on Sept. 10. Although Harris has accepted an invitation from CNN for a second debate later this month, Trump has not accepted..
The interview special is scheduled to air Monday instead of the usual “60 Minutes” time slot because CBS is showing the American Music Awards on Sunday.
Trump's interview with “60 Minutes” correspondent Lesley Stahl prior to the 2020 election proved contentious, with the former president ending the session early and his campaign posting an unedited transcript of the session.
CBS News was hosting Tuesday's vice presidential debate between Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Tim Walz, Minnesota's Democratic governor.

News Max,Biden to Apologize for 150-Year Indian Boarding School Policy,"President Joe Biden said he will formally apologize on Friday for the country's role in forcing Indigenous children for over 150 years into boarding schools, where many were physically, emotionally, and sexually abused and more than 950 died.
""I'm doing something I should have done a long time ago: to make a formal apology to the Indian nations for the way we treated their children for so many years,"" Biden said Thursday as he left the White House for Arizona.
Interior Secretary Deb Haaland launched an investigation into the boarding school system shortly after she became the first Native American to lead the agency, and she will join Biden during his first diplomatic visit to a tribal nation as president as he delivers a speech Friday at the Gila River Indian Community outside Phoenix.
""I would never have guessed in a million years that something like this would happen,"" Haaland, a member of the Pueblo of Laguna in New Mexico, told The Associated Press. ""It's a big deal to me. I'm sure it will be a big deal to all of Indian Country.""
The investigation she launched found that at least 18,000 children — some as young as 4 — were taken from their parents and forced to attend schools that sought to assimilate them into white society while federal and state authorities sought to dispossess tribal nations of their land.
The investigation documented 973 deaths — while acknowledging the figure is likely higher — and 74 gravesites associated with the more than 500 schools.
No president has ever formally apologized for the forced removal of these children — an element of genocide as defined by the United Nations — or the U.S. government's actions to decimate Native American, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian peoples.
The Interior Department conducted listening sessions and gathered the testimony of survivors. One of the recommendations of the final report was an acknowledgement of, and apology for, the boarding school era. Haaland said she took that to Biden, who agreed that it was necessary.
""In making this apology, the President acknowledges that we as a people who love our country must remember and teach our full history, even when it is painful. And we must learn from that history so that it is never repeated,"" the White House said in a statement.
The forced assimilation policy launched by Congress in 1819 as an effort to ""civilize"" Native Americans ended in 1978 after the passage of a wide-ranging law, the Indian Child Welfare Act, which was primarily focused on giving tribes a say in who adopted their children.
The visit by Biden and Haaland to the Gila River Indian Community comes as Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign spends hundreds of millions of dollars on ads targeting Native American voters in battleground states including Arizona and North Carolina.
""It will be one of the high points of my entire life,"" Haaland said of Biden's apology Friday.
It's unclear what action, if any, will follow the apology. The Interior Department is still working with tribal nations to repatriate the remains of children on federal lands. Some tribes are still at odds with the U.S. Army, which has refused to follow federal law regulating the return of Native American remains when it comes to those still buried at the Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania.
""President Biden's apology is a profound moment for Native people across this country,"" Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. said in a statement to the AP.
""Our children were made to live in a world that erased their identities, their culture and upended their spoken language,"" Hoskin said in his statement. ""Oklahoma was home to 87 boarding schools in which thousands of our Cherokee children attended. Still today, nearly every Cherokee Nation citizen somehow feels the impact.""
Friday's apology could lead to further progress for tribal nations still pushing for continued action from the federal government, said Melissa Nobles, chancellor of MIT and author of ""The Politics of Official Apologies.""
""These things have value because it validates the experiences of the survivors and acknowledges they've been seen,"" Nobles said.
The U.S. government has offered apologies for other historic injustices, including to Japanese families it imprisoned during World War II. President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act in 1988 to compensate tens of thousands of people sent to internment camps during the war.
In 1993, President Bill Clinton signed a law apologizing to Native Hawaiians for the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy a century earlier.
The House and Senate passed resolutions in 2008 and 2009 apologizing for slavery and Jim Crow segregation. But the gestures did not create pathways to reparations for Black Americans.
In Canada, a country with a similar history of subjugating First Nations and forcing their children into boarding schools for assimilation, former Prime Minister Stephen Harper made a formal apology in 2008. There was also a truth and reconciliation process, and later a plan to inject billions of dollars into communities devastated by the government's policies.
Pope Francis issued a historic apology in 2022 for the Catholic Church's cooperation with Canada's policy of Indigenous residential schools, saying the forced assimilation of Native people into Christian society destroyed their cultures, severed families, and marginalized generations.
""I humbly beg forgiveness for the evil committed by so many Christians against the Indigenous peoples,"" Francis said.
In 2008, Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd formally apologized to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples for his government's past policies of assimilation, including the forced removal of children. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern made a similar concession in 2022.
Hoskin said he is grateful to both Biden and Haaland for leading the effort to reckon with the country's role in a dark chapter for Indigenous peoples. But he said the apology is just ""an important step, which must be followed by continued action.""

News Max,Judge: Election Certification in Georgia Is Mandatory,"A Georgia Superior Court judge ruled on Tuesday that election boards in the state must certify election results regardless of any suspicion of miscounts or fraud, The Atlanta Journal Constitution reported.
Judge Robert McBurney has rejected claims brought by Julie Adams, a Fulton County Election Board member, who previously voted against certifying this past spring's presidential primary results. McBurney wrote that any concerns about fraud or systemic error should be communicated to the proper authorities but are ""not a basis"" for an official to deny an election.
""If election superintendents were, as Plaintiff urges, free to play investigator, prosecutor, jury, and judge and so — because of a unilateral determination of error or fraud — refuse to certify election results, Georgia voters would be silenced,"" McBurney wrote. ""Our Constitution and our Election Code do not allow for that to happen.""
In March, Adams voted against certifying Georgia's presidential primary stating that she was ""unable to fulfill her oath in office."" In May, she filed suit against the board saying in a prepared statement, ""It's time to fix the problems in our elections by ensuring compliance with the law, transparency in election conduct and accuracy in results,"" Adams said. ""And in my duty as a board member, I want to make sure that happens.""
McBurney left open the window for election results to be properly investigated but not at the expense of meeting the previously established timeframe. ""There are no limits placed on this investigation (other than, of course, the immovable deadline for certification, discussed below),"" the judge wrote. ""Thus, within a mandatory ministerial task — thou shalt certify! — there are discretionary subtasks. The freedom allowed with the subtasks does not convert the overarching fixed obligation into a discretionary role.""
The outlet noted that at least 19 Georgia county election board officials have opted not to certify election results since 2020. On Tuesday, McBurney will hear arguments in another lawsuit filed against the Georgia State Election Board by Cobb County's election board. That suit aims to dismiss a requirement to complete a hand-count vote certification on election night.

News Max,CNN Contributor: Biden Can't Communicate Coherently,"Alex Thompson, a reporter at Axios and CNN contributor, said President Joe Biden's inability to speak coherently led to a comment that former President Donald Trump's supporters are ""garbage.""
Thompson made the comments Wednesday in an interview with Kasie Hunt, calling it a ""sad reality.""
""No one here at this table knows what Joe Biden meant unless someone here has talked to Joe Biden when he made those comments,"" Thompson said. ""And the sad reality is that they were indecipherable because this president is no longer able to coherently and consistently articulate a message.""
In a video call organized by advocacy group Voto Latino, Biden said, ""Donald Trump has no character. He doesn't give a damn about the Latino community. Just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a 'floating island of garbage.' The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.""
Biden has shown why Vice President Kamala Harris does not want him on the campaign trail, Thompson said.
""Just last week [he] referred to former Representative Gabby Giffords in the past tense — she's very much alive,"" Thompson said. ""This is a person that last week said that he wanted to throw Donald Trump in jail and then very quickly tried to backtrack and said he just politically meant to lock him up.
""And we are in this sad scenario where clearly Joe Biden and the aides around him that want to make him feel better, want him to be able to sort of be inserted into this race, see Kamala Harris' potential election as an affirmation of his record, but that Kamala Harris does not want him to be inserted and would prefer that he basically be absent this last week of this election.""

News Max,Tim Walz's Verbal Gaffes Frustrate Campaign,"Minnesota Democrat Gov. Tim Walz was chosen by Vice President Kamala Harris to shore up Midwestern votes, yet his past misstatements have put his campaign staff under constant damage control, Politico reported on Thursday.
Many political observers were surprised when Harris chose Walz over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, due to Minnesota already being well in hand for the Democrats and Pennsylvania being a critical swing state.
Walz's every-man style of speaking was intended to help Harris hold the ""blue wall,"" yet the outlet has reported that some in his campaign staff were unaware of his many inaccurate statements that continue to be used against him.
During Tuesday's debate against Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, Walz was pressed about his claim that he was in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. He previously said he'd visited Hong Kong in the spring of 1989 during protests in China's Tiananmen Square but insisted he ""was in Hong Kong and China"" during the pro-democracy protests.
""All I said on this was, is, I got there that summer,"" Walz told the CBS moderators, adding, ""I'm a knucklehead at times,"" before conceding he ""misspoke.""
Mike Mikus, a Democratic strategist in Pennsylvania told the outlet, ""Any time you are forced to go off message is never welcome,"" adding, ""But in the end, voters are looking for somebody who is more concerned about what these candidates are going to do to improve their lives than, 'Did he get every single fact correct?'""
On Wednesday, Walz was forced to clean up his remarks again during a campaign stop in Pennsylvania.
""Yeah, look, I have my dates wrong,"" Walz told reporters in Harrisburg. ""I was in Hong Kong in China in 1989. I speak like everybody else speaks. I need to be clearer.""
The campaign staff was forced to openly admit Walz's tendency for exaggeration yet used the opportunity to differentiate between their candidates slips of the tongue, and their opponents nefarious intentions.
""As the governor has said, he sometimes misspeaks. He speaks like a normal person and speaks passionately about issues he cares deeply about including democracy and stopping gun violence in our school,"" a spokesperson for the Harris-Walz campaign said, adding Trump and Vance ""repeatedly lie and mislead about their plan to ban abortion nationwide.""
Following Tuesday night's debate, Vance told reporters that he sympathized with Walz and his struggle with presenting a consistent message.
""Look, I've got to be honest, I feel a little bad for Gov. Walz,"" Vance said. ""And the reason I feel bad for him is because he has to defend the indefensible, and that is the record of Kamala Harris.""

News Max,Sen. Graham to GOP Who Back Harris: 'What the Hell Are You Doing?',"Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Sunday asked members of his party who are supporting Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign over former President Donald Trump's ""what the hell"" they are doing by ""supporting the most radical nominee in the history of American politics.""
Harris, Graham told NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" not only supports the Green New Deal and Medicare for all, but she was the ""last person in the room before [President Joe] Biden decided to withdraw from Afghanistan.""
""She was the border czar,"" he added. ""She cast the tie-breaking vote for an Inflation Reduction Act that gives you high prices.""
""What are you doing?"" Graham continued. ""You are trying to convince me that Donald Trump's rhetoric is the danger to this country? The danger to this country is the policies of Biden and Harris. Her fingerprints are all over this disaster.""
Graham further declared that he ""can't take four more years of this crap.""
""When you support her, you are supporting four more years of garbage politics,"" he said.
There have been several high-profile Republicans who have endorsed the vice president in recent weeks, including former GOP Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, along with former members of Trump's administration.
Graham's comments came after he was asked about Trump's growing rhetoric as the election comes near, including last week when he referred to Democrats as ""the enemy from within"" several times.
He made the enemy comment at his rally in Coachella, California, using the phrase to refer to Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif.
He also called Schiff ""the enemy from within"" again in a pretaped Fox News interview, also using the phrases to describe ""radical-left lunatics.""
Trump further repeated the phrase on the ""OutKick"" podcast, saying that we ""have a bigger problem from within and they hate it.""
But Graham dismissed Trump's comments, insisting that ""we're winning and going to win, not because of what Donald Trump’s saying, but because of what they’ve done for four years.""
Graham also argued that Americans want a change from the policies over the past four years, commenting that when Harris is asked if she'd do anything different, she responded in an interview, ""Nothing comes to mind.""

News Max,"In Part of Swing State Michigan, Neighbors Skip Presidential Signs in a Heated Campaign Season","The lawn of Nick Hannawa's suburban Detroit home is lined with political signs backing candidates for prosecutor, supervisor and local trustee. But Hannawa isn't promoting his presidential pick.
He says he doesn't want the headaches in an polarized election year.
In this part of swing state Michigan, many of Hannawa's neighbors in upper-middle class and affluent neighborhoods have a similar attitude about a public display on behalf of their preferred presidential candidate. It's easier, they say, to opt out of this once-typical show of support outside their house.
“Some people love Donald Trump. Some people hate Donald Trump,” said Hannawa, 37. “I voted for Donald Trump. I’m going to vote for Donald Trump again. If I put that sign in my yard again, is it really going to make a difference or is someone not going to like me?”
Hannawa's home county of Oakland was a political battleground for years but flipped to Democrats in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections. Republicans have not given up on the area, aiming to win back conservative voters one house at a time.
For years, urban areas have been heavily Democratic and rural areas vote overwhelmingly Republican, said David Dulio, director of the Center for Civic Engagement at Oakland University in Michigan. “And it’s always the suburbs where the campaigns really fight it out.”
For some residents, skipping yard signs is another symptom of weariness with the amped-up tension of American politics, particularly in the White House race between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Trump, the former president.
Putting out a sign can have an effect on neighborhood dynamics long past campaign season, said Anand Edward Sokhey, a political science professor at the University of Colorado at Boulder and co-author of “Politics on Display: Yard Signs and the Politicization of Social Spaces.”
""They are very much a person signaling ‘This is me. This is who I am.’ And other people are reacting,” he said. “You may not always know that neighbor’s name, but you remember — for years — that house had a Trump sign, that house had a Harris sign.”
A recent survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research and USAFacts found that about 6 in 10 Americans say they need to limit how much information they consume about the government and politics to avoid feeling overloaded or fatigued. In recent weeks, there have been isolated but startling instances of intimidation or violence tied to shows of support for a campaign.
Last month, a white suburban Detroit man, angry that he received Harris mailings, was charged with assault after he was accused of yelling obscenities and racial slurs and then threatening a Black postal carrier with a knife.
In Ohio, a Republican county sheriff posted on social media that people with Harris yard signs should have their addresses written down so immigrants can be sent to live with them. The post was removed after threat of legal action by the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio.
Many neighbors ""have stated they’re afraid to put signs in their front lawns,” Edward Shehab, another Bloomfield Township resident, said. “People are kind of like ‘I know who I’m going to vote for, and I don’t need to tell people what we’re going to do.’”
Shehab, 64, has Trump-Vance yard signs outside his home this fall even though four years ago his signs backing Trump and then-Vice President Mike Pence were stolen.
To Dulio, there's a noticeable lack of presidential yard signs this election year around the Detroit area.
“People just don’t want to — even Trump supporters — they just don’t want to hear it from their neighbors,"" Dulio added. ""They don’t want to take the risk of somebody confronting them or tearing down their lawn sign or whatever might happen.”
Hannawa said that chance of conflict is why he's instead limiting his signs to local candidates.
“I don’t do the presidential politics (signs). There is so much tension around it,” Hannawa said. “I’m an attorney, and I have clients on all sides of the political field.”
Danny Watson lives about a mile or so from Shehab and doesn’t have any election signs in his Bloomfield Hills yard. The retired medical professional said he identifies as an independent but feels posting political leanings isn't good for business.
“It makes interactions with patients difficult,"" Watson said. “I didn’t want to offend either group of clients I would deal with.”
One of the four political signs in Jack Robertson’s yard in Madison Heights is a Trump sign. He's an outlier in the neighborhood several miles north of Detroit.
“A lot of people say, ‘I’m not putting a sign out. Neighbors down the street will get mad. They’ll do this or that,’"" Robertson said. “So what? You have a right to do what you want to do. As long as you’re not hurting anybody in the process.”

News Max,FiveThirtyEight: Trump Odds of Winning on Upswing,"Former President Donald Trump's chances of winning the 2024 presidential election have steadily improved since last month, according to FiveThirtyEight's probability calculations.
The political forecasting website, which is owned by ABC News, has regularly released the odds for Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris winning the election. Trump started with a higher chance of winning at 53% to Harris' 47% at the end of July, just after Harris replaced President Joe Biden at the top of the Democrat ticket.
Harris saw a large boost after officially becoming the Democrat nominee for president, reaching a high of 64% probability to win in September, but the likelihood of her winning has fallen steadily since then while Trump's has continuously increased. Harris went from a 64% chance in September to a 55% chance just one week later, and that chance later fell to 52% earlier this week.
Trump's chances of winning fell to a low of 36% in September but steadily rose, hitting 45% before the end of the month and 47% earlier this week.
FiveThirtyEight also predicted that Trump will win Florida but that the battleground states of Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina could go either way.

News Max,Trafalgar Poll: Trump Holds Slight Edge in Arizona,"Former President Donald Trump maintained his lead over his Democrat rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, in the crucial swing state of Arizona, a poll released Monday by the Trafalgar Group showed.
The poll of 1,090 likely Arizona voters taken Oct. 11-13 showed Trump with a lead of 47.5%-46%. The poll has a margin of error of 2.9 percentage points. Just 3.7% of those polled were undecided.
Trump's lead of 1.5 percentage points is slightly smaller than the 1.6-point edge he held in September's poll.
Trump is ahead in six of seven swing states polled by Trafalgar — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Harris has a slight lead in Nevada. The former president appears to be doing better in battleground state polls than he is nationally, where Harris is either ahead within the margin of error or the candidates are tied.
In the hotly contested race to fill Arizona's vacant U.S. Senate seat — independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema declined to seek reelection — Dem. Rep. Ruben Gallego holds a 47.6%-43.9% lead over Republican Kari Lake, a staunch Trump supporter. Lake has carved into Gallego's lead — he was up 47.2%-43% in the September poll.

News Max,"Jason Miller to Newsmax: Trump, Not Harris, Focused on Helping Americans","Only one candidate in the presidential race ""is talking about how they're going to improve the lives of everyday Americans, whether it be on fixing the economy, fixing the border, fixing the chaos in our streets, fixing the chaos around the globe,"" Jason Miller, a senior adviser for former President Donald Trump's campaign, told Newsmax on Wednesday.
""President Trump is talking about how he can improve ... everyone's lives in this entire country, whether you're Republican or Democrat, whether you vote, whether you don't vote,"" Miller told ""Newsline.""
""It's notable that Kamala Harris and the Democrats and the media, that all that they want to talk about are these attacks on President Trump. Nobody wants to talk about what Kamala Harris wants to do as president. … It's been a really bad three-and-a-half years with destroying the border, being the deciding vote twice on this record setting inflation. People want someone to fix the economy and fix the border. It's really that simple.
""And the fact that Kamala has nothing to say about her own campaign, her own vision, or her own views really is telling. And voters are smart. I know a lot of the media doesn't want to give voters credit, but they realize what's going on and they're saying, you know what? Trump, he can fix it.""
On former President Barack Obama and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton coming out to support Harris in the final stretch of the presidential campaign, Miller said: ""A lot of this feels like 2016 when you had Barack Obama, you had Michelle Obama, you had Bill Clinton all going to some of these blue-wall states and some of the battleground states like they did for Crooked Hillary eight years ago.
""Although I think in this case, a lot of this is from the Harris camp. Don't forget that Kamala Harris, her entire strategy for helping African American men, was to say she is going to legalize drugs. Now, I've heard just from various media sources that this is really Ian Sams, who's kind of the architect of all this on the Kamala campaign, but whether it's Ian Sams, whether it's Kamala Harris, whether it's Barack Obama, the fact of the matter is these are disrespectful comments they're making. It's not going to help them win people's votes over. And that's why President Trump's simple message that he is going to make your life better, that he can turn it around, he can fix it. That's why it's winning.""

News Max,Bill Clinton: 'Economy Was Better' Under Trump,"Former President Bill Clinton, during a campaign stop for Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris, made reference to the economy being better during Donald Trump's presidency.
""I don't think it's right to say that people have to vote for Donald Trump because the economy was better then,"" Clinton said in a speech Wednesday in Muskegon Heights, Michigan.
Clinton said the economy was already ""roaring"" when Trump got elected in 2016, thanks to the policies from former President Barack Obama's second term.
Clinton overall touted Harris' economic plan and told her supporters they should vote for her.
""He's the best credit-claimer I've ever seen,"" Clinton said of Trump. ""'The sun rose this morning, I did that. But it rained yesterday. If I had been president it never would have rained.' You've got to give it to the guy, he's really good at this.""
Clinton also called the inflation under the Biden-Harris administration ""debilitating"" but said it was ""unavoidable.""
""COVID busted all the supply chains,"" he said.
It's the second time this month that Clinton, while stumping for Harris, has made a talking point for the other side. Earlier this month, Clinton said the illegal immigrant who stands accused of murdering nursing student Laken Riley in Georgia wasn't ""properly vetted.""
""Well, if they'd all been properly vetted that probably wouldn't have happened,"" Clinton said.

News Max,Trump Unveils 'Operation Aurora' to Rid US of Migrant Gangs,"Former President Donald Trump on Friday unveiled a plan to remove illegal immigrant gangs from the U.S. if he is elected in November during a rally in Aurora, Colorado, which has been menaced by the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.
""To everyone here in Colorado and all across our nation, I make this pledge and vow to you: Nov. 5, 2024, will be liberation day in America,"" Trump said at the Gaylord Rockies Resort and Convention Center in a rally that aired live on Newsmax and was simulcast on Newsmax2. ""I will rescue Aurora and every town that has been invaded and conquered. … And we will put these vicious and bloodthirsty criminals in jail or kick them out of our country. And we will be very, very effective in doing it. It's going to happen very, very fast. We're going to get them the hell out of our country.""
Trump called the effort ""Operation Aurora,"" a name he said was used by San Antonio police in their effort to rid the city of the Venezuelan gang. He dedicated it to the memories of Jocelyn Nungaray, 12, Laken Riley, 22, Rachel Morin, 37, ""and all of the others that are dead and/or mortally wounded at the hands of migrants who should never have been allowed into our country.""
""To expedite the removals of these savage gangs, I will invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798,"" Trump said, referring to a portion of the Alien Sedition Acts of 1798 passed by Congress that allows the president to authorize the arrest, relocation, or deportation of any male over the age of 14 who hailed from a foreign enemy country at war with the U.S. or where any ""invasion or predatory incursion is perpetrated, attempted, or threatened against the territory of the United States by any foreign nation or government.""
""Think of that 1798. This was put there in 1798. That's a long time ago,"" Trump said. ""To target and dismantle every migrant criminal network operating on American soil … we will send elite squads of ICE, Border Patrol, and federal law enforcement officers to hunt down and arrest and deport every last illegal alien gang member until there is not a single one left in this country. And if they come back into our country, they will be told it is an automatic 10-year sentence in jail with no possibility of parole. And I'm hereby calling for the death penalty for any migrant that kills an American citizen or a law enforcement officer.""
Trump has made Aurora, a 400,000-resident Denver suburb, a symbol of migrant crime that he said is a result of high levels of illegal immigration allowed under his rival, Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris, and President Joe Biden. Immigration is a top voter concern in the run-up to Election Day.
""My message today is very simple,"" Trump said. ""No person who has inflicted the violence and terror that Kamala Harris has inflicted on this community can ever be allowed to become the president of the United States. We're not going allow it.""
Trump also said he will encourage Congress to pass legislation prohibiting cities to declare themselves sanctuaries for illegal immigrants.
""We will send Congress a bill to ban all sanctuary cities in our country, including Denver,"" he said. ""And we will begin the largest deportation operation in the history of the United States. We will close the border. We will stop the invasion of illegals into our country. We will defend our territory. We will not be conquered. We will reclaim our sovereignty. And Colorado will vote for Trump as a protest and signal to the world that we are not going to take it anymore.""

News Max,Robert Wilkie to Newsmax: Biden's Iran Nuclear Stance 'Cosmic Insanity',"An Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear program would send its regime ""to the brink of extinction,"" and it is ""cosmic insanity"" that President Joe Biden had said that his administration will not support that plan, former Veterans Administration Secretary Robert Wilkie said on Newsmax Tuesday.
""Biden has already told the Iranians he's going to do everything he can to help them to preserve their most valuable military asset,"" Wilkie told ""Wake Up America."" ""He's telling the Israelis, We're not going to help you if you go after Iran's nuclear facilities … we know they have slowed the delivery of those weapons that could be used by the Israelis, the 5,000-pound bunker busters.""
And if the Israelis don't go after Iran, Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris can't be expected to carry out an assault on that country's military, even though it ""presents a threat not only to Israel but to us,"" he said.
Wilkie added that a strike on Iran's nuclear facilities would give a signal to ""the people in the streets"" who did not get one from Biden or former President Barack Obama that they will ""be able to get rid of the ayatollahs.""
""That seems to be the only thing that is keeping them in power,"" he said. ""If the Israelis take out the IRGC [Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps] and its terrorist apparatus within the country of Iran, I think that's a step forward for the people who want to finally get rid of the ayatollahs, who have been terrorizing them since 1979.""
Meanwhile, Wilkie said the next moves from the Israeli military will be attacks on Iran's military infrastructure, the IRGC's capabilities, and ""perhaps what passes for their naval infrastructure.""
""I would think a secondary group of targets would be their oil facilities,"" he added.
Another set of targets, the Iran-backed Houthis, ""points to the failure of American deterrence,"" said Wilkie.
""The Houthis have constantly attacked American ships and have closed down the world's second-busiest sea lanes,"" he said. ""We have massive firepower in that region, but Biden refuses to use it, and the Iranians have just written it off as nothing [and] show that they don't fear anything from Mr. Biden.""

News Max,Judge Allows Biden Student Loan Forgiveness Plan to Proceed,"The temporary restraining order preventing President Joe Biden from forgiving student loan debt for over 25 million Americans will expire after a federal judge delivered a loss to the Republican-led effort to stop the plan.
Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, North Dakota, and Ohio filed a lawsuit against the aid package that includes debt cancellation for millions of dollars worth of student loans, arguing that the attempt is illegal and would harm student loan providers.
However, U.S. District Judge Randal Hall in Georgia ruled on Wednesday that the state lacked the standing to sue against the plan and therefore could not serve as the venue for the lawsuit. The judge ruled that the case should be transferred to Missouri since the suit claims that the plan would harm the Missouri Higher Education Loan Authority.
""Based on Plaintiffs' reliance on MOHELA as its primary basis for standing, the Court finds the most equitable transfer would be to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri,"" Hall wrote in his decision.
A spokesperson for the Department of Education hit out at Republicans following the ruling in a statement to CNBC.
""The fact remains that this lawsuit reflects an ongoing effort by Republican elected officials who want to prevent millions of their own constituents from getting breathing room on their student loans,"" the spokesperson said.

News Max,Reggaeton Star Nicky Jam Pulls Trump Endorsement,"Reggaeton megastar Nicky Jam took back his endorsement of former President Donald Trump on Wednesday in the aftermath of a much-maligned joke made at Trump's Madison Square Garden rally, CNN reported.
In an Instagram post to his more than 43 million followers, Nicky Jam, who was born Nick Rivera Caminero, said he had supported Trump primarily based on his economic views saying, ""[Trump] being a businessman, I thought it was the best move.""
""Never in my life did I think that a month later a comedian would come to criticize my country, to speak poorly of my country, and therefore I renounce any support to Donald Trump and move aside from any political situation. Puerto Rico se respeta, Nicky Jam,"" he posted in Spanish.
The off-color comments were made by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe as part of his routine warming up the crowd prior to Trump's speech at Madison Square Garden. Hinchcliffe, who hosts the popular podcast ""Kill Tony,"" stirred controversy Sunday when he made fun of Puerto Rico saying, ""I don't know if you know this, but there's literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it's called Puerto Rico.""
Trump told ABC News on Tuesday that he did not hear the comments and did not know who Hinchcliffe was at the time of the event.
Last month, the Latin superstar appeared on stage with Trump at a campaign rally in Las Vegas wearing a red Make American Great Again hat. Nicky Jam is the most recent Puerto Rican star to denounce Hinchcliffe's comments and by extension Trump. Bad Bunny, Ricky Martin, and Jennifer Lopez have all since publicly endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in the days following the MSG rally.
Not everyone in the entertainment community was offended by Hinchcliffe's routine. Comedian John Stewart said, ""having a roast comedian come to a pollical rally a week before Election Day [was] not the best decision. I find that guy very funny. I'm sorry, I don't know what to tell you.""

News Max,Murtaugh to Newsmax: Trump Eyes Trifecta of Wins,"Former President Donald Trump is expanding his 2024 campaign into traditionally blue states, aiming to secure the presidency, reclaim the Senate, and expand the majority in the House of Representatives.
His communications director, Tim Murtaugh, emphasized this ambitious goal during an interview on Newsmax, stressing the importance of winning across all branches of government.
Speaking on ""Saturday Report,"" Murtaugh detailed Trump's plan to do large-scale campaign events in blue states, like one at Madison Square Garden scheduled for Oct. 27, designed to send a message to key battleground states and stir excitement for down-ballot races.
""It's not just about the presidential election,"" Murtaugh said. ""We want to win Congress, too. So, he's going for the trifecta: the White House, the Senate, and the House of Representatives.""
The Saturday Coachella stop in Vice President Kamala Harris' home state also presents an opportunity for Trump to connect with Latino voters, boost competitiveness in down-ballot races, fundraise, and weaken Democratic support.
""When the president does large-scale events like this, of course, it gets beamed into all the battleground states, and his message resonates,"" Murtaugh said. ""The excitement of such a gigantic crowd will be able to be conveyed in those battleground states.""
Trump's strategy also aims to build momentum in states with competitive House races, which could shift the balance of power in Congress.
""We're trying to build everything toward a huge Election Day for President Trump and all the down-ballot races as well,"" he said.
According to internal campaign polling, Murtaugh's remarks come as Trump continues to hold a lead in key battleground states, including Pennsylvania.
""Every number is trending toward Donald Trump,"" he said, pointing out the former president's performance in national and battleground state polls.
Reflecting on Vice President Kamala Harris' recent campaign appearances, Murtaugh criticized her for being a ""phony"" and ""inauthentic"" staging public responses to crises like hurricanes. He claimed Harris's efforts are backfiring, with her media appearances providing material for Trump's campaign ads.
""We hope she continues to go out and do more media every single day,"" Murtaugh said. ""She's a great sound bite factory for us.""
""That thing on 'The View' where she was asked directly, what would you have done differently? Anything in the last four years different from [President] Joe Biden? And she said, 'Nothing comes to mind. And in fact, I've been right there with him making all the decisions, every important step along the way.' We couldn't ask for anything better,"" he added.

News Max,"Walz: Iran Closer to Nuclear Weapon, Thanks to Trump","Sparks quickly flew out of the gate Tuesday night during CBS News' vice presidential debate between Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.
When asked about Iran's nuclear capabilities, Walz said, ""Iran is closer to a nuclear weapon than they were before because of [former President] Donald Trump's fickle leadership.
""And when Iran shot down an American aircraft in international airspace, Donald Trump tweeted, because that's the standard diplomacy of Donald Trump,"" he said.
Vance quickly shot back, arguing that diplomacy is not a dirty word.
""You yourself just said Iran is as close to a nuclear weapon today as they have ever been and, Gov. Walz, you blamed Donald Trump. Who has been the vice president for the last 3 1/2 years? And the answer is your running mate, not mine,"" he said.
Vance argued Trump has made the world more secure with diplomacy through strength.
""I'm 40 years old. When was the last time that an American president didn't have a major conflict break out? The only answer is during the four years that Donald Trump was president,"" he said.
With just weeks to go before the election, the two have been cutting a swath across the country in an attempt to secure key voters in hotly contested swing states.
Vance worked with Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., on debate prep, while Walz did the same with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg as his counterpart playing Vance.

News Max,Harris Courts 'McCain Wing' of GOP in Arizona,"Vice President Kamala Harris is looking to win over ""the McCain wing"" of the Republican Party in the battleground state of Arizona, NBC News reported.
Jen Cox, senior adviser for the Harris campaign in Arizona, told the news outlet, ""Talking with folks in the Maricopa County suburbs is really, really critical to our path to victory.""
More than two-thirds of Arizona voters live in Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located and where Biden won by more than 2 percentage points against former President Donald Trump in 2020.
""What we've heard from Republicans who have come out in support of the vice president is that respect for the rule of law is a critical component of their support for her,"" Cox added.
Phoenix-based Republican consultant Barrett Marson told NBC News on Friday that Harris is facing a challenge in winning over the same moderate suburban Republicans that helped President Joe Biden win the state by less than 0.5% of the vote in 2020.
""The McCain wing of this party is a conservative group. It just isn't nuts,"" he said.
""It makes it hard to vote for someone like Kamala Harris, because she's the antithesis of a lot of things John McCain advocated for throughout his life,"" Marson continued. ""But on the other hand, she doesn't want to overthrow the government.""
He added that Harris ""doesn't want to institute a dictatorship. She doesn't want to instruct the Justice Department to start arresting Republicans left and right. So the choice isn't a very good one for McCain Republicans, but it is also probably easier because of the actions of Donald Trump.""

News Max,"Trump Appeals to Religion, Harris Talks Jobs as Millions Vote Early","Republican Donald Trump on Monday appealed to religious voters in the southern swing state of Georgia as his campaign distanced itself from controversial remarks by supporters.
Millions of Americans have already cast their vote before the Nov. 5 election, which national polls including the latest one from Reuters/Ipsos, and surveys in swing states, show is a close race between Trump and his Democratic rival Kamala Harris.
In Georgia, where in-person early voting ahead of Election Day is expected to total up to 70% of ballots, Trump courted religious voters during a National Faith Advisory Board event.
""I think this is a country that needs religion,"" Trump said. ""They're trying to stymie you, this new administration, this new radical left group of people.""
But he faces pressure over his rally in New York on Sunday, where a comedian called Puerto Rico a ""floating island of garbage,"" prompting a backlash from Latino celebrities and criticism from both Republican and Democratic politicians.
The Trump campaign has said the joke did not reflect their views.
Georgia is one of seven competitive swing states expected to play a decisive role in an election that wraps up in eight days.
At stake in this election is stewardship of the world’s most powerful country. Harris and Trump diverge on support for Ukraine and NATO, tariffs that could trigger trade wars, abortion rights, taxes and basic democratic principles.
Some 46 million Americans have voted already, according to the Election Lab at the University of Florida, including some 2.8 million people in Georgia and 1.9 million people in Michigan, where Harris arrived on Monday.
That trails the roughly 60 million people that had voted early by about this point in 2020, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
ECONOMY
Harris visited Corning Inc's Hemlock Semiconductor facility to talk to workers and tour the assembly line and talk about the importance of investing in manufacturing jobs.
The company recently received a preliminary investment of up to $325 million via the Chips and Science Act, which a Harris campaign official noted Trump had criticized and Harris helped pass.
""When we can find a way to have meaningful partnerships with the private sector, with industries, but to do the kind of work that is happening here, everybody wins,"" she said.
Trump has argued his stewardship of the economy was stronger than that of President Joe Biden and Harris.
Though the U.S. job market has been strong under the Biden-Harris administration and stock markets have hit record highs, persistently elevated prices have hammered consumers on everything from groceries to rent.
Harris has issued policy proposals to bring down prices and help alleviate the country's housing crunch, while also contrasting her leadership approach with Trump, who she said would be focused on getting back at his enemies.
On Monday evening, Harris appeared at a rally in Ann Arbor, Michigan with her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, that featured a performance by singer-songwriter Maggie Rogers.
""There is nothing more important than this election,"" said Rogers, one of a number of celebrities who both campaigns have used to appeal to voters, as she warmed up an outdoor crowd in 50°F (10°C) temperatures.

News Max,"Pa. Shows Big Numbers for Democrats, Trouble for Trump","Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has called Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Arizona the must-watch battleground states on election night, but the early returns now show trouble for his campaign in the aptly name Keystone State.
Trump's campaign rally mantra has been ""too big to rig,"" seeking to run up the score to make a lead insurmountable. But Vice President Kamala Harris' early vote strength in Pennsylvania might be giving her a large cushion of votes going into Election Day on Nov. 5.
Trump beat Joe Biden on Election Day in 2020, only to find the win evaporate as mail-in ballots were counted. In his 2022 Senate race, Dr. Mehmet Oz handily won on Election Day against John Fetterman. But Fetterman had so many mail-in votes, he became the state's U.S. senator.
This year, close to 2 million mail-in ballots have been requested and nearly 1 million early Pennsylvania votes have already been cast. Bad news again for Republicans: These early votes come from an overwhelming majority of registered Democrat voters (64%), according to NBC News' early vote tracker Tuesday morning.
While these ballots are not actual votes for Kamala Harris, about 90% of Democratic registered ballots historically go to the party's candidate. Ditto for Republican ballots going to the GOP's candidate. So far, registered Republicans have cast just 27% of Pennsylvania's mail-in and early in-person votes to date. This number is up slightly from 2020 when 24% of ballots came from registered Republicans. Another 9% of ballots cast have come from those registered independent or with another party.
Some pundits argue that Pennsylvania, the largest of the seven battleground states, is absolutely critical for a Harris or Trump win in the Electoral College. Pennsylvania holds 19 electoral college votes with 270 needed to clinch the presidency.
The others key swing states are Arizona (11 electoral votes), Georgia (16), Michigan (16), Nevada (6), North Carolina (16), and Wisconsin (10%). Republicans' early vote ground game is doing better at getting registered Republican votes cast in other battleground states:
- Arizona (385,000 votes cast): GOP 44%, Democrat 35%
- Georgia (nearly 1.7 million): GOP 49%, Democrat 46%
- Michigan (more than 1 million): Democrat 54%, GOP 36%
- Nevada (247,000): Democrat 40%, GOP 35%
- North Carolina (more than 1 million): Democrat 36%, GOP 33%
- Wisconsin (326,000): Other 41%, Democrat 40%, GOP 19%
When asked last week at a Chicago economic forum which state is going to decide the election, Trump showed no hesitation in pointing to the Keystone State as the key to the election. ""Pennsylvania, I would say mostly,"" he said.
While there have been 921,720 early votes already cast by mail and in-person in Pennsylvania, there have been 1,843,687 mail-in ballots requested.
If current trends continue, the Democrats will enter Election Day with about 1 million votes already secured.
Pennsylvania's early in-person voting began Sept. 16 and the deadline to register to vote was Monday, Oct. 21. There remains a week left of early in-person voting, which ends Oct. 29 — a week before the Nov. 5 Election Day.
Pennsylvania is considered a swing state, but in the past seven presidential elections there has not been much in the way of swinging. It has been a Democrat stronghold, with Trump's surprise 2016 win the only anomaly.
At the moment Trump leads the RealClearPolitics polling average in the state by 0.8% points — similar to the 0.7% margin he won by in 2016.
All of the polls in that data set are within the margin of error, making the race a virtual statistical tie as early voting continues in Pennsylvania, making voter turnout, and perhaps the early ballots, the likely deciding factor.

News Max,"Sen. Rubio: Kelly, Former Trump Officials Lying With Fascist Claims","Former Trump administration officials like Mark Milley and John Kelly, who have accused Donald Trump of admiring Adolph Hitler and being a ""fascist"" are lying, Sen. Marco Rubio said Sunday.
And even those who do not want to call them liars have to admit that it's ""very dubious to see these accusations coming right before an election,"" the Florida Republican told ""Fox News Sunday.""
""These are the kinds of things that if someone says is in front of me … I walk out and resign,"" said Rubio.
He also called it ""hypocritical"" for Democrats who were ""horrible"" to Kelly in the past and who attacked him over his comments to suddenly back him.
""This guy who they hated and said horrible things about, now he's the standard of proof here,"" said Rubio.
Kelly, a chief of staff under former President Donald Trump, told The New York Times last week that Trump met the definition of ""fascist.""
Kelly's comments were endorsed by 13 former Trump administration officials in an open letter that claimed there would be dangers if he is elected to return to the White House. Other top Democrats, such as Trump's 2016 rival Hillary Clinton also used his comments to compare Trump to Hitler and question his Sunday rally at New York City's Madison Square Garden, claiming it echoed the 1939 Nazi rally at the site.
Rubio also on Sunday argued that the Trump administration officials are attacking him now because they want to open up job offers.
""These are people that worked in the administration or around the administration, and then they figured out pretty quickly, if we want jobs after we leave this administration, we have to become anti-Trumpers,"" said Rubio.
""Do you think Mark Milley ends up teaching at Princeton, teaching at Georgetown, on the advising JP Morgan, you don't get hired for those jobs unless you pronounce yourself anti-Trump and say things against him,"" he added. ""You need to become anti-Trump. It was a financial incentive here.""
Trump has denied Kelly's claims that he witnessed him praising Hitler ""more than once.""
Meanwhile, Rubio on Sunday attacked the Biden administration for its ""weakness,"" and said that the world's chaos, including the invasions of Ukraine and Israel, can be linked ""to the day we were run out of Afghanistan by the Taliban.""
That was a signal that Biden and his vice president, Democrat nominee Kamala Harris were weak and America was weakened by them, said Rubio.
""It's not a coincidence that since this moment we had the invasion in Ukraine. We have Oct. 7, we had things in the Middle East,"" said Rubio.
In addition, he said that the Chinese have harassed the Philippines and global shipping has been endangered, pointing to the ""graphic weakness under Biden and Harris.""

News Max,Alleged Would-Be Assassin Wants Trump-Appointed Judge off Case,"The man charged with attempting to assassinate former President Donald Trump in West Palm Beach, Florida, has asked a judge to recuse herself from the case.
Ryan Wesley Routh's attorneys on Thursday requested that U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon recuse herself because she was appointed by Trump, ABC News reported.
Routh's legal team, in a 10-page motion, said Cannon's recusal from the federal case ""is essential to preserve the appearance of impartiality.""
""[Cannon] owes her lifetime appointment to the alleged victim in this criminal case,"" the motion read.
""Taken together, these unprecedented facts and circumstances might create an appearance of partiality in the mind of the public.""
Routh, 58, is accused of attempting to assassinate Trump at the GOP presidential nominee's golf club on Sept. 15. The accused has pleaded not guilty to several federal charges including attempted assassination of a presidential candidate.
Cannon, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, was selected for Routh's case from a random draw of 10 federal judges, Politico reported.
""To be clear, there is no evidence that this case (or any other) was assigned in a non-random manner. But conspiracy theories have been based on less. Recusal would thus have the added benefit of preventing the public from harboring such a dangerous perception,"" Routh's lawyers said in the motion.
Cannon was the judge who in July dismissed special counsel Jack Smith's classified documents case against the former president.
Routh's attorneys cited Trump's social media posts and rallies, where he praised Cannon for her handling of the classified documents case, as reasons for the recusal request.
""By repeatedly and publicly praising this Court by name for its rulings in his case, Mr. Trump has arguably bolstered the perception that the Court is partial in his favor. Moreover, were Mr. Trump to become President again in the future, he would be in a position to nominate Your Honor to a vacancy on a higher appellate court, including the U.S. Supreme Court. In the mind of the public, this prospect of a judicial promotion could arguably affect this Court’s ability to be impartial in this case, where Mr. Trump is the alleged victim and has an interest in the outcome,"" the motion read, ABC News reported.
Earlier this month, federal prosecutors asked Cannon for an indefinite delay in scheduling Routh's trial. The judge previously ordered a Nov. 18 trial start date.
In a court filing obtained by ABC News, prosecutors requested the judge officially designate Routh's case as ""complex,"" citing the massive amount of evidence they gathered after he was arrested.
In August, Smith urged a federal appeals court to reinstate the classified documents case, saying Cannon's decision that dismissed the prosecution was at odds with long-standing Justice Department practice and must be reversed.

News Max,N.C. Dem Official Resigns After Charged in Trump Signs Theft,"A Democratic Party chairman in Moore County, North Carolina, resigned Thursday after he was arrested and charged with stealing roadside signs supporting former President Donald Trump, reported the Sandhills Sentinel.
Lowell Simon, who is also running for a North Carolina House seat in November, was arrested on Oct. 10 for allegedly removing the signs. His court appearance is scheduled for Oct. 30.
""While we appreciate the hard work and dedication he has shown to the Democratic Party and the community, the Moore County Democratic Party cannot and will not condone the tampering of political signs or any other illegal activity,"" the Moore County Democratic Party said in a post on Facebook.
""Mr. Simon has offered an apology for his actions, as well as his resignation, both of which have been accepted by the MCDP.""
The Moore County Sheriff's Office said Simon was removing signs along Seven Lakes Drive at approximately 5:25 p.m.
""The deputy, who was responding to an unrelated call at the time, later followed up at Simon's residence, where the signs were found in his vehicle,"" according to the office. ""Simon admitted to removing the signs, which were then recovered and returned to their original owner.""

News Max,John Deaton to Newsmax: Democrats Need to Tone Down Rhetoric,"President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will have trouble uniting America when they refer to half the people as ""garbage,"" John Deaton, the Republican nominee for senator in Massachusetts, told Newsmax on Wednesday.
Deaton, who is running against Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., condemned the comments Biden made where he said supporters of former President Donald Trump are ""garbage.""
After Trump was nearly assassinated the rhetoric should have been toned down, Deaton lamented on ""National Report.""
""You would think after witnessing that, that we could lower the temperature and we could lower the rhetoric, whether you support President Trump or not, that is just shocking,"" Deaton said. ""And there was a second assassination attempt. So maybe stop calling the man Hitler.
""You can't get up on stage and say, 'I'm going to unite this country and I'm going to bring all of us together,' if you're calling your political opponent Hitler.""
Deaton also noted his opponent Warren was asked why the race was so close if Trump is so bad, and she could only threw up her hands in the air and say she did not get it.
""I think it's your job to get it,"" Deaton said. ""I think these elites in D.C. need to take a long look in the mirror, because they're part of the reason it's a broken system.
""And Americans are tired of it, and we're paying the price. Hopefully after this election, maybe they will take a long look in the mirror, because they are part of the reason and part of the problem in this country.""

News Max,California Poll: GOP's Baugh Pulls Ahead in Bid to Flip Seat,"A California U.S. House seat now in Democrats' hands that Republicans most looked forward to picking up appears to be falling into place for its nominee Scott Baugh.
A just-completed survey by WPA Intelligence showed the GOP's Baugh, a stalwart conservative and former Orange County Republican Party chair, for the first time leading in the race to succeed outgoing Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif.
According to WPA's polling of likely voters, Baugh leads Democrat state Sen. David Min 43%-40% district wide.
""Since late September, Baugh has improved with independents [gaining 7%] and Democrats [gaining 6%],"" according to WPA's Chris Wilson.
Wilson also noted Baugh is in a near-tie with Min (43%-44%) among college graduates.
Two years ago, Baugh came within a whisker (51.6%-48.4%) of ousting Porter.
With her relinquishing the seat to run for the Senate this year, Baugh found himself in a fall race with Min.
Min is far-left member of the Progressive Caucus in the California State Senate who Republicans have slammed as ""soft on crime"" for his support of measures such as no cash bail.

News Max,Trump: DOJ Trying to 'Cheat' in Election in Virginia,"Former President Donald Trump accused the Biden administration's Department of Justice of trying to ""cheat"" in the upcoming presidential election by seeking to allow ""illegal voters"" to cast ballots in Virginia.
In early August, Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed an executive order requiring the commissioner of Department of Elections to certify that the department was conducting ""daily updates to the voter list"" to remove, among other groups, people who are unable to verify that they are citizens to the Department of Motor Vehicles.
President Joe Biden's DOJ has sued the Old Dominion State for violating the federal prohibition on systematic efforts to remove voters within 90 days of an election.
""One of the Greatest Examples of DOJ Weaponization is the fact that they are suing Virginia to put ALL of the Illegal Voters, which were fully exposed and removed by the important work of Governor Glenn Youngkin, back on the Voter Rolls,"" Trump posted early Monday on Truth Social.
""Obviously, this was done so that they can CHEAT on the Election. So sad! What has happened to our once Great Country?""
U.S. citizens who were identified and notified, and did not affirm their citizenship within 14 days would be removed from Virginia's list of registered voters, said the DOJ, which added this practice has led to citizens having their voter registrations canceled ahead of the Nov. 5 election.
Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, is opposing Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democrat nominee, in the race for the White House.

News Max,Trump Campaign Demands Colo. Halt Ballot Count Over 'Breach',"The Trump campaign is demanding that Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold immediately halt the count of mail ballots to conduct testing on the state's election software in the wake of the discovery of the disclosure of passwords to voting systems.
A Colorado law firm representing the Trump presidential campaign made the demand in a letter sent to Griswold on Wednesday.
Griswold, a Democrat who supported the Colorado Supreme Court's decision to remove former President Donald Trump from the Colorado primary ballot last December, is under fire after the discovery on the department's website of a spreadsheet with a hidden tab that included passwords to configure system settings for the state's voting systems.
Griswold knew about the disclosure on Oct. 24, five days before it became public, but didn't change the codes. The passwords had been posted for several months and were discovered Tuesday by Colorado Republican Party Vice Chair Hope Scheppelman, 9News reported.
The passwords are now being changed ""out of an abundance of caution.""
""Ultimately, a civil servant made a serious mistake and we're actively working to address it,"" Griswold told Colorado Public Radio News. ""Humans make mistakes.""
The person who posted the spreadsheet no longer works in Griswold's office, though Griswold did not say if the person was fired.
""It's bad. Let me emphasize that we have other precautions in place, but the fact that a serious breach occurred is troubling,"" former Republican Colorado Secretary of State Wayne Williams told 9News.
Colorado law firm Gessler Blue Law, on behalf of the Trump campaign, demanded Griswold halt the processing of mail ballots and scan them again if necessary, until accuracy tests are performed to ensure election integrity.
""[T]his inconvenience is necessary because it is the only way to guarantee that the elections equipment in those counties whose current BIOS passwords were disclosed by your office are secure and that the chain-of-custody for that equipment required by Colorado law and regulations is unbroken,"" attorney Scott Gessler wrote to Griswold on Wednesday.
Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., called on Griswold to resign, and a state senator is calling for an investigation into ""the ever widening election scandal and cover-up.""
""Jena Griswold was made aware of the leaked passwords on October 24th. She didn't change those leaked passwords until yesterday when the story became public,"" Boebert said in a post to X on Thursday. ""This is the same woman who supported keeping Trump off the ballot in Colorado. She not only needs to resign, she needs to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.""
Colorado state Sen. Kevin Van Winkle is calling for an emergency hearing into the matter, saying, Griswold's ""public response was insufficient and raised even more concerns than it addressed.""

News Max,"Trump Blasts Harris Over Health Records, Debates","Donald Trump slammed Vice President Kamala Harris for changing her mind on another debate and for demanding the former president release his medical records.
Trump took to Truth Social in Tuesday's early hours to excoriate his election opponent, who has called for a second debate between the two presidential candidates.
""Lyin' Kamala, after having turned down the FoxNews Debate on September 4th, which I accepted, is now saying she wants to Debate, despite the fact that the Votes are already being cast. The reason she wants it now is simple, she is losing in the Polls, and is desperate – Will do anything!"" Trump wrote in his post.
""The problem is that Kamala can't even do a simple Interview, and needs the Fake News Broadcasters, like CBS, to completely withdraw her answer on 60 Minutes, which was INCOHERENT, and illegally insert a completely different one in order to make her look modestly 'intelligent.' IT DIDN'T HELP, AND 60 MINUTES WILL BE PAYING A HEAVY PRICE FOR A LONG TIME TO COME…""
Trump then assailed Harris for demanding that he release his medical records after she released a letter from her doctor Saturday that pronounced her in good health and fit for high office.
""…As to her completely desperate request for my Medical Statements, she is dying to see my Cholesterol (which is 180!), I have already provided them, many times, including quite recently, and they were flawless. However, I have just seen Kamala's Report, and it is not good,"" Trump wrote.
""According to her Doctor's Report, she suffers from 'urticaria,' defined as 'a rash of round, red welts on the skin that itch intensely, sometimes with dangerous swelling.' She also has 'allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis,' a very messy and dangerous situation. These are deeply serious conditions that clearly impact her functioning. Maybe that is why she can't answer even the simplest of questions asked by 60 Minutes, and others. What is this all about? I don't have these problems…""
Trump concluded his rant by pointing out his previous medical disclosures.
""…I've put out more Medical Exams than any other President in History, and aced two Cognitive Exams (the Doctor stated that my 'cognitive exams were exceptional!'). I am far healthier than Clinton, Bush, Obama, Biden, but especially, Kamala,"" Trump wrote.
""Also, I am far too busy"" campaigning to take time, from the 22 days left, as I am using every hour, of every day, campaigning, because we have to take back our Country from the Radical Left people that are destroying it. MAGA2024!""
On Tuesday morning, Trump again commented on Harris' health.
""Kamala’s Medical Report is really bad. With all of the problems that she has, there is a real question as to whether or not she should be running for President! MY REPORT IS PERFECT - NO PROBLEMS!!!"" Trump posted.

News Max,Secret Service 'at Breaking Point' as Trump Returns to Butler,"The agency in charge of Donald Trump's safety is nearing its ""breaking point,"" NBC News reports.
According to a dozen current and former agents who spoke to the news outlet, insufficient staffing coupled with an increased workload has brought the Secret Service to a ""state of crisis"" that is creating a perfect storm of errors, lax protocols, and low morale that could result in devasting failure.
On July 13, Thomas Crooks, 20, fired eight shots at Trump during a campaign rally in Butler Penn. One of the shots struck Corey Comperatore in the head as he attempted to shield his wife and daughters from the gunfire.
Two months later, Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, was arrested in connection with an attempted assassination attempt on Trump while the former president was golfing at his West Palm Beach country club.
Two agents who spoke to NBC News said Trump’s return to Butler for another rally is happening at the precise time when the agency is ""redlining.""
""The U.S. Secret Service is killing their people, and worse, they are supposed to have a zero-fail protective mission on zero rest/sleep,"" said one former agent. ""I love my agency, but they are setting themselves up for another incident.""
Both the current and former agents asked not to be identified so they could speak openly about the many issues plaguing the Secret Service. One law enforcement official noted that the Secret Service is ""stretched virtually to the breaking point"" with another adding, ""I hate to say it, they are going to hit rock bottom fast.""
Secret Service’s chief spokesman, Anthony Guglielmi, acknowledged the unsustainable nature of the problem.
""The increasing demand placed on the agency during this dynamic threat environment has resulted in our people being pushed to the limit,"" he said in a statement. ""We recognize that this is not sustainable, and we cannot risk another mission failure.""
Agents recounted to the outlet numerous instances were agents had fallen asleep on the job in recent months, due to excessively long hours and in some cases, going months without a day off.
""Mistakes are being made,"" one agent said with another adding so many agents, ""are at the end of their ropes.""

""Let's put this in perspective: [Former President Donald] Trump is gaining; Trump is winning this election,"" Morris told Newsmax's ""Saturday Report."" ""The polls don't reflect it always. Some do. The swing state polls are a little more accurate than the national one. But Trump is clearly cleaning up these swing states. Even Pennsylvania shows some evidence tipping to the Republicans if Pennsylvanians vote.""

""But Georgia and Arizona are pretty clearly Trump territory now. North Carolina it looks like he's kept, and he's gained in Michigan. He's dead even. Pennsylvania is even. But he's gained in both of those states. Wisconsin is a little tougher, but still within reach,"" he said.
Former President Ronald Reagan won reelection in a historic landslide in 1984, but it only built up slowly, Morris reminded.
""Generally, the history of presidential races is when it's a landslide like Reagan in 1980, it only developed slowly,"" he said. ""It only developed toward the end, and it looks like a neck-and-neck race and then it falls off the table.
""And I think that's what is going to happen here in my view.""

News Max,Ramaswamy: Trump Would Win 'Decisively' If Election Held Tomorrow,"Former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy told Politico on Tuesday that former President Donald Trump would win ""decisively"" if the election were held this week. He told the outlet, ""I'm worried about something highly unanticipated happening in the next less than three weeks. I think that if the election were held tomorrow, I believe Donald Trump would win decisively.""
He added, ""But the election won't be held tomorrow, so my biggest worry is that a lot of unexpected things or unanticipated things or even one large unanticipated thing could happen between now and Nov. 5.""
Ramaswamy, who dropped out the race in January and endorsed Trump, said that Trump's campaign should highlight policy contrasts between the GOP candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris. He said, ""It's not that I think the country right now is in love with what Harris and Biden did over the last four years. It's that if the country is more confused about the differences, whether those are differences from Donald Trump or not, that helps Harris.
""And because that helps Harris, the thing that I think the Trump campaign needs to be doing is reminding voters exactly of what Kamala Harris' positions have been at least in the last four years versus what Donald Trump's positions are as the president.""
Ramaswamy has said that he speaks with Trump regularly and that they've discussed a potential cabinet position for him if Trump were to win the election.

News Max,Trump Campaign Crowdfunds $14 Million in New Approach to Emergency Relief,"Former President Donald Trump's campaign is using GoFundMe to rally its network of deep-pocketed backers and everyday donors around the survivors of his July assassination attempt and Hurricane Helene's destruction, bucking more traditional avenues of emergency relief.
The two high-profile fundraisers — organized by the Republican nominee’s national finance director — have drawn more than $14 million. They don't violate campaign finance laws, according to legal experts. Nor is the campaign allowed to pocket any proceeds for its own political ends; a GoFundMe spokesperson told The Associated Press that the majority of the Butler, Pennsylvania, funds have been disbursed.
But the use of a crowdfunding platform marks an unorthodox response to crises from a political campaign. Never before has a major party's presidential candidate turned to the for-profit company — which usually features desperate appeals for help covering tuition costs or medical bills — to mobilize his or her base toward outside charitable causes.
""It’s pretty unusual and actually quite odd,"" said Brett Kappel, a longtime campaign finance attorney with Harmon Curran who has advised Republicans and Democrats.
It's more typical to see candidates contribute campaign funds to IRS-approved nonprofits during natural disasters, Kappel said. He pointed to Federal Election Commission filings that show Sen. Tim Scott's 2022 campaign gave to the American Red Cross after Hurricane Ian hit South Carolina.
Trump campaign spokesman Brian Hughes said the motivation arose from ""the president wanting to help find a way for his supporters to give as much direct support as they can.""
The finance team got involved only because of its ""great expertise in working with large accounts,"" according to Hughes, and ""not one penny of this funding is going anywhere but to those impacted."" Hughes said more than $6.5 million of the $7.7 million raised for organizations helping with Hurricane Helene recovery had been disbursed as of Friday.
""The president has an amazing movement of supporters,"" Hughes told AP. ""With the experience in Butler generating millions of dollars of support, he saw the same opportunity to be a direct conduit for a philanthropic effort from his supporters.""
Longtime Trump associates, conservative celebrities and right-wing groups gave tens of thousands of dollars. Bill Ackman, the CEO of the Pershing Square investment firm who endorsed Trump shortly after the assassination attempt, donated $100,000 for hurricane relief. UFC President Dana White also pitched in $100,000. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., said on X that he donated $50,000 from his congressional salary for the Butler victims. Also contributing was The Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank behind Project 2025.
GoFundMe collects a transaction fee of 2.9% plus 30 cents for every donation to cover credit and debit charges. Its global Trust & Safety team has been communicating closely with organizer Meredith O’Rourke to ensure the safe distribution of donations from the Butler page, according to a company spokesperson. The GoFundMe spokesperson told AP that O’Rourke also provided a verified distribution plan, which the company routinely requires in cases where organizers are withdrawing money on behalf of other recipients.
Andrew Herman, a Washington lawyer specializing in campaign finance, said it would’ve been ""more palatable"" to direct supporters toward a recognized nonprofit because online crowdfunding is less regulated.
The bulk of the Pennsylvania disbursements were made this month, and more payouts will come while the page remains active, according to Hughes. The ""vast majority"" has gone to the families of the three people shot on July 13, he said. Some funds also compensated a local crane rental company after the owner said he lost business when the ensuing police investigation left him unable to retrieve equipment he'd donated for the rally.
Money raised for Hurricane Helene victims has gone to four nonprofits. Samaritan’s Purse spokeswoman Gabrielle Bouquet said the Christian humanitarian aid organization is grateful for Trump's ""steadfast support of the work we do in Jesus' name."" Bouquet declined to share the exact amount of the donation.
Water Mission, a Christian engineering nonprofit that builds safe water solutions in disaster areas, confirmed that the Charleston, South Carolina-based ministry had also received funds. Public relations director Gregg Dinino didn't specify the total.
Mtn2Sea Ministries, which delivers generators and supplies in the immediate aftermath of weather events, said on Facebook that it received $25,000 on Monday. The disaster relief group posted that the proceeds were used to buy South Georgia businesses' gift cards because ""the best way to help those in need is to get resources directly into their hands.""
It makes sense that Trump's team gravitated toward crowdfunding, said Benjamin Soskis of the Urban Institute's Center on Nonprofits and Philanthropy. The campaign ""has often been premised on a suspicion of institutions,"" he said, and GoFundMe ""drew some of its attraction by serving as an alternative to institutional charitable giving.""
But crowdfunding also brings less accountability, Soskis said. Crowdfunding pages don't have the same disclosure requirements as public charities that must divulge their finances in annual tax filings.
Soskis said Trump's previous philanthropic ventures has likely brought increased levels of scrutiny. A judge fined Trump $2 million in 2019 for using his since-dissolved charitable foundation to advance his interests.
""It is a combustible dynamic when you combine campaigning and charitable giving,"" Soskis said. ""The extra dynamics of crowdfunding and Trump’s own history with philanthropy itself adds more fuel to that fire.""

News Max,'Beacon/Shaw Poll: Trump Leads by 2 Nationally,"A new poll conducted by the Democrat-leaning Beacon Research and the Republican-leaning Shaw & Company Research has Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump 2 points ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris nationally.
Trump leads Harris 50%-48% both among registered voters and likely voters in the poll.
According to Polymarket, a betting website, Trump is the favorite in every swing state.
""Overall, the movement toward Trump is subtle but potentially consequential, especially if he is making gains among college-educated voters,"" Democrat pollster Chris Anderson said. ""However, the race has been well within the margin of error for three months and the outcome will likely hinge on which side is more effective at getting their voters to the polls as opposed to persuasion.""
The poll also highlighted demographic shifts. Trump's strongest gains have been among white voters and those with a college degree, while Harris has seen declines in support from key groups such as Black voters and voters over 65.
Trump is favored on issues such as the economy, immigration, and crime, while Harris leads on topics like abortion, climate change, and healthcare.
Beacon Research and Shaw & Company Research polled 1,110 registered voters and 870 likely voters Oct. 11-14. The results have margins of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points for both sets.

""And yet, she's asking voters to trust her with the presidency of the United States,"" Ernst told ""America Right Now.""
Ernst, who appeared live from a bus in Pennsylvania, where she is stumping for former President Donald Trump along with fellow surrogates, said the energy on the ground is palpable.
""We are talking about things that matter to American families, and it's resonating with the folks here in the Keystone State. They are excited to have a president that actually cares about their kitchen table issues, not the hope and joy and good vibes that Kamala Harris is trying to pass off to American families,"" she said.
Ernst encouraged supports to get out and vote early, assuring that election integrity remains intact.
""Things are much different this year than it was four years ago during COVID, where many of the election officials were able to get away with hijinks because of the COVID excuse. They don't have that excuse ... I do believe that we will be able to secure this election, make sure that the voters feel confident in the election integrity,"" she said.

News Max,Karoline Leavitt to Newsmax: Harris' Trump Rhetoric 'Despicable',"Vice President Kamala Harris' ""inflammatory rhetoric"" against former President Donald Trump is ""dangerous"" and ""divisive,"" Trump's national campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said on Newsmax Saturday.
""It's despicable to hear this inflammatory rhetoric coming from Kamala Harris,"" Leavitt told Newsmax's ""Saturday Report."" ""These are the types of words that led to two heinous assassination attempts on President Trump's life.""
During a CNN town hall Wednesday night, Harris said she agrees with Trump's former chief of staff John Kelly that her rival meets the definition of a fascist.
Such words are also ""divisive,"" said Leavitt.
""Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party are insulting the intelligence of tens of millions of Americans who support President Trump by suggesting that they would actually support a fascist or someone likened to [Adolf] Hitler,"" she said. ""It's absurd.""
Leavitt added that the rhetoric is ""dishonest.""
""Harris and the Democrats know that these attacks against President Trump are not true,"" she said. ""That's why three Democrats in 'blue wall' states are currently running advertisements right now, cozying up to President Trump with positive rhetoric about him, because they know that they need him to win.""
She added that Trump is ""more popular"" among Americans now than ever.
""This is the type of language that they've been using against him for eight years, but the polls show Americans aren't buying it,"" Leavitt said.
""They remember how much better their lives were under President Trump. We already had him for president for four years. Our democracy was stronger than it is today under Kamala Harris. It's a very poor and negative and disturbing closing message coming from the Kamala campaign.""
Democrats, though, are trying to make voters fear picking Trump because ""it's their last line of defense,"" she said.
""They don't have policy,"" she said. ""They don't have a record to stand on. Kamala Harris has been the most incompetent, weakest, most failed vice president in our nation's history.""

News Max,Russians Made Fake Video of Mail-In Ballots for Trump Being Destroyed: FBI,"Russian actors were behind a widely circulated video falsely depicting mail-in ballots for Donald Trump being destroyed in Pennsylvania, U.S. officials confirmed on Friday.
The video had taken off on social media Thursday but was debunked within three hours by local election officials and law enforcement after members of the public reported it.
U.S. officials said in a statement sent by the FBI that they believe the video was “manufactured and amplified” by Russian actors. The officials said it’s part of “Moscow’s broader effort to raise unfounded questions about the integrity of the U.S. election and stoke divisions among Americans.”
The information was released by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.

News Max,Nearly 700K Early Voters in Ga. Didn't Vote in 2020,"More than 670,000 early voters in Georgia did not participate in the 2020 general election, according to analysis by GeorgiaVotes.com.
As of Thursday afternoon, 3,482,358 million Georgians had voted early, and 671,201 did not vote in the 2020 election, a state narrowly won by President Joe Biden.
It's a group that comprises people who weren't old enough to vote in 2020, moved back to Georgia, or just decided to skip the 2020 election, election officials say.
""We think of the electorate as being really static when the much bigger pool of people is not folks who are switching (parties), it's folks who couldn't have voted, didn't vote or couldn't have voted in previous years,"" Bernard Fraga, a political scientist at Emory University, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
The number, however, is dwarfed by the 836,000 early voters at this point in 2020 who didn't participate in the 2016 election. Overall in 2020, 1.5 million voters who didn't vote in the 2016 election did so, representing 31% of all voters, according to the AJC.
Early voting overall is outpacing 2020 by more than 22,000, according to GeorgiaVotes.com.
Early voting turnout is not being dominated by the Democrat strongholds surrounding Atlanta, like DeKalb and Cobb counties, for example, according to the AJC. Percentagewise, sparsely populated rural counties that vote Republican have been huge drivers of early voting, the AJC reported.
The newspaper reported that more than two-thirds of voters in Towns County, for example, had already voted, 15 points above the state average. Trump won Towns with 80% of the vote in 2020. Other rural counties in Georgia's northeast are also seeing higher turnout rates early voting, according to the report.
""You've got to give Republicans credit. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. They're adapting to a very different political environment,"" DeKalb County Chief Executive Michael Thurmond told the AJC. ""And that means Democrats have to redouble their efforts.""

News Max,Pelosi: No Contact With Biden Since He Dropped Out,"Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she hasn't spoken to President Joe Biden since he ended his bid for reelection in July.
Pelosi was reportedly instrumental in getting Biden to drop out of the 2024 presidential race after his disastrous June debate performance against former President Donald Trump.
Biden's shaky and halting debate performance underscored long-running concerns about his ability to lead and his cognitive fitness and advanced age.
Pelosi told the the Dail Mail that while she considers Biden to be a friend, the election took precedence.
""Elections are decisions,"" Pelosi told the outlet. ""You decide to win. I decided a while ago that Donald Trump will never set foot in the White House again as president of the United States or in any other capacity.
""So, when you make a decision, you have to make every decision in favor of winning ... and the most important decision of all is the candidate.""
""I have the greatest respect for him,"" Pelosi said of Biden. ""I think he's one of the great consequential presidents of our country.""
Pelosi said that Biden's legacy was on the line and ""had to be protected,"" and she ""didn't see that happening in the course that it was on."" So, she said she made the call to ""get on a better course.""
""He will make the decision as to what that is, and he made that decision,"" she said. ""But I think he has some unease because we've been friends for decades.""
Pelosi indicated that she was focused on getting Vice President Kamala Harris into the Oval Office, saying that Harris is ""running on her strength, her knowledge of policy and strategy and presentation.
""I always thought America was more ready for a woman president than a woman speaker of the House,"" Pelosi told the Guardian. ""The Congress of the United States is not a glass ceiling there. It's a marble ceiling. And it was very hard to rise up there.
""But the public, I think, is better disposed. In Congress, they would say to me, 'Understand this, there's been a pecking order here for a long time of men who've been waiting for openings to happen and take their turn.' And I said, 'That's interesting. We've been waiting over 200 years.'""
In August, it was reported that Biden was still bitter over how he was replaced at the top of the Democrat presidential ticket, with his anger mainly directed at Pelosi.
Biden also reportedly was frustrated that former President Barack Obama did not approach him directly about ending his reelection bid, and also was miffed at Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.

News Max,Dem Lawmakers: Need Special Counsel to Probe Jared Kushner,"The Democrat chair of the Senate Finance Committee and a prominent Democrat congressman asked the attorney general on Thursday to appoint a special counsel to investigate whether Jared Kushner, former President Donald Trump's son-in-law, was functioning as an unregistered foreign agent for Saudi Arabia, according to a letter from the lawmakers.
The letter from Democrats Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland cited an Oct. 4 Reuters report that revealed that Kushner on multiple occasions had discussed U.S.-Saudi diplomacy concerning Israel with Saudi Arabia's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, since leaving government.
""This revelation is deeply disturbing, as Mr. Kushner appears to be influencing U.S. foreign policy by acting as a political consultant to the Saudi government while also accepting their money,"" Wyden and Raskin wrote in the eight-page letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland. The letter has not been previously reported.
""Mr. Kushner's proximity to President Trump and the potential for political interference warrants the appointment of a Special Counsel,"" the letter added.
Saudi Arabia has invested $2 billion into a private equity fund, Affinity Partners, that Kushner, who was a top adviser on the Middle East during Trump's administration, founded in 2021 after leaving government, according to congressional investigators.
In a statement, Kushner said, ""There is no conflict of interest."" He dismissed the letter as ""silly political stunts.""
Chad Mizelle, chief legal officer at Affinity Partners, called the request for a special counsel ""a disgraceful attempt by Wyden and Raskin to turn an already weaponized DOJ [Department of Justice] into a fully political operation with accusations that have no merit or evidence.""
The DOJ and the Saudi Arabian embassy did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Saudi Arabia's investments in Kushner's fund have been criticized by ethics experts, Democrats in Congress, and some Republicans, who have expressed concern that Saudi Arabia's stake can look like a payoff since Kushner worked on Saudi issues before leaving Trump's White House.
""There is substantial reason to believe,"" the letter wrote, ""that the Saudi government's decision to engage Affinity for investment advice is a fig leaf for funneling money directly to Mr. Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump."" Affinity and Kushner have previously denied that Saudi Arabia's investments are a payoff or a conflict of interest. Affinity has said Wyden and his Senate staff do not understand the realities of private equity.
The letter comes less than two weeks before the Nov. 5 presidential election between Trump, a Republican, and Democrat Kamala Harris. Special counsel investigations have more political independence than prosecutions run by DOJ attorneys, though special counsels can be fired by the attorney general.
During his time as Trump's special adviser, Kushner engineered the Abraham Accords, a series of agreements in which Islamic nations established diplomatic ties with Israel in exchange for concessions by the United States. Saudi Arabia never signed on but the Biden Administration has tried to encourage the kingdom to normalize relations with Israel, an effort that appeared to stall amid the Gaza conflict.
The Oct. 4 Reuters report, quoting a source familiar with the discussions, said Kushner's talks with Saudi Arabia's crown prince included the process of normalizing relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia. The source did not identify when the talks took place and whether they occurred before or after the start of the Israel-Hamas war.
The U.S. Foreign Agents Registration Act requires agents of foreign interests who engage in political activity to register with the DOJ.
Wyden is the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and has been investigating investments by Saudi Arabia and other countries in Kushner's funds since June. Raskin is the ranking member of the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability.

News Max,"Kari Lake to Newsmax: Polls Miss Key Voters, Hurting Accuracy","Kari Lake, Republican candidate for U.S. Senate in Arizona, voiced skepticism about public polling methods during an interview on Newsmax, comparing them to those leading up to the 2016 presidential election and suggesting polls are missing key voter demographics that may swing upcoming races.
Lake appeared on ""Greg Kelly Reports"" on Thursday, recalling how polling in 2016 strongly favored Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton.
""I remember it because I was doing what you do. I was a fair and honest journalist, and I was reading some of the crazy polling that said 98% chance Hillary is going to win, 2% chance for Trump, and we saw what happened,"" Lake said.
She believes the key issue with current polling is that it fails to capture the opinions of a significant portion of voters. According to Lake, polls are predominantly answered by individuals with strong political leanings, either on the far left or far right, while voters who fall somewhere in between remain largely unaccounted for.
""The problem with polling right now, Greg, is that the only people responding to it are polarized people who are dead set one way or dead set the other. You're missing that middle ground. The folks who are somewhere in the middle,"" she explained.
Lake added that her campaign's internal polling, which she described as more accurate, shows promising results for her campaign.
""That's why I feel comfortable with my private polling, my internal polling, which, frankly, has shown us up. And I'm proud of that,"" she added.

News Max,Crowds Support Trump as He Works McDonald's in Pa.,"People packed shoulder to shoulder along a street in Feasterville, Pennsylvania, a suburb on the outskirts of Philadelphia, gathered to watch and perhaps grab some fries from former President Donald Trump as he worked a shift at McDonald's on Sunday.
""I've now worked 15 minutes more than Kamala,"" Trump told a huddled gang of press from the drive-thru window, donning a yellow and gray apron. ""She never worked here.""
Outside in a parking lot across from the establishment, Trump 2024 banners and American flags waved as the crowd stood to catch a glimpse of what the Trump campaign is dubbing the October ""surp-fries.""
One spectator wearing a pink MAGA hat, Caitlin Hanlon, a hairdresser from Feasterville, told the New York Post, ""Love him or hate him, I just feel it's really cool to see this moment in history.""
Inside the Golden Arches, Trump stood busy, slinging fries and bantering with the press and customers.
""We got the salt on it?"" Trump asked one of the employees, sliding a bushel of fries into its red and yellow pouch, ""Never touches the human hand. Nice and full.""
""I'll take whatever he gives me,"" one customer said as they pulled away, clutching a bag of fries handed to them by the former president.
""This is fun,"" Trump mused.
Pennsylvania remains one of the most contested battleground states, alongside Georgia and North Carolina. Recently, in a bid for middle-class voters, Harris' campaign rhetoric shifted from emphasizing joy to emphasizing her middle-class roots as the election nears.
One such campaign talking point has been Harris' claim that she worked at McDonald's. The Harris campaign has maintained that she worked at the Golden Arches in Alameda, California, in 1983, during her freshman and sophomore years at Howard University. However, Trump has said her 1987 resumé makes no mention of her time helming the fry machine or attending to guests.
Coincidentally, though, Trump's McDonald's stop on Sunday fell on Harris' 60th birthday.
""Happy birthday Kamala! She's turning 60. I think I'll get her some flowers,"" Trump riffed to the press from the drive-thru. ""Maybe I'll get her some fries … I'll get her a McDonald's hamburger. Happy birthday Kamala.""

News Max,"Ballot Boxes in Washington state, Oregon Set on Fire","Authorities, including the FBI, were investigating Monday after early morning fires were set in ballot drop boxes in Portland, Oregon, and in nearby Vancouver, Washington, where hundreds of ballots were destroyed.
The Portland Police Bureau reported that officers and firefighters responded to a fire in one ballot drop box at about 3:30 a.m. and determined an incendiary device had been placed inside. Multnomah County Elections Director Tim Scott said a fire suppressant inside the drop box protected nearly all the ballots; only three were damaged, and his office planned to contact those voters to help them obtain replacement ballots.
A few hours later, across the Columbia River in Vancouver, television crews captured footage of smoke pouring out of a ballot box at a transit center. Vancouver is the biggest city in Washington's 3rd Congressional District, the site of what is expected to be one of the closest U.S. House races in the country, between first-term Democratic Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez and Republican challenger Joe Kent.
“I hope the perpetrator of this reprehensible act is quickly apprehended — and local and federal law enforcement have my full support in working to keep our democratic process safe and secure,"" Gluesenkamp Perez said in a statement.
She said she's requesting an overnight law enforcement presence posted at all ballot drop boxes in Clark County through Election Day.
“Southwest Washington cannot risk a single vote being lost to arson and political violence,” her statement said.
Representatives for Kent's campaign didn't immediately return phone and email messages seeking comment.
Clark County Auditor Greg Kimsey in Vancouver told The Associated Press that the ballot drop box at the Fisher’s Landing Transit Center also had a fire suppression system inside, but for some reason it wasn't effective. Responders pulled a burning pile of ballots from inside the box, and Kimsey said hundreds were lost.
“Heartbreaking,” Kimsey said. “It’s a direct attack on democracy.”
There were surveillance cameras that covered the drop box and surrounding area, he said.
The last ballot pickup at the transit center drop box was at 11 a.m. Saturday, Kimsey said. Anyone who dropped their ballot there after that was urged to contact the auditor’s office to obtain a new one.
The office will be increasing how frequently it collects ballots, Kimsey said, and changing collection times to the evening, to keep the ballot boxes from remaining full of ballots overnight when similar crimes are considered more likely to occur.
An incendiary device was also found on or near a ballot drop box in downtown Vancouver early on Oct. 8. It did not damage the box or destroy any ballots, police said.
In a statement, the FBI said it is coordinating with federal, state and local partners to actively investigate the two incidents. Anyone with information is asked to contact the nearest FBI office, provide information through tips.fbi.gov or call 1-800-CALL-FBI ( 800-225-5324 ).
Washington Secretary of State Steve Hobbs said the state would not tolerate threats or acts of violence meant to derail voting.
“I strongly denounce any acts of terror that aim to disrupt lawful and fair elections in Washington state,” he said.
Voters were encouraged to check their ballot status online at www.votewa.gov to track its return status. If a returned ballot is not marked as “received,” voters can print a replacement ballot or visit their local elections department for a replacement, the Secretary of State’s office said.
Washington and Oregon are both vote-by-mail states. Registered voters receive their ballots in the mail a few weeks before elections and then return them by mail or by placing them in ballot drop boxes.
In Phoenix last week, officials said roughly five ballots were destroyed and others damaged when a fire was set in a drop box at a U.S. Postal Service station there.

News Max,Axios: Harris Campaign Stiff-Arms Biden in Final Stretch,"Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign is giving President Joe Biden's overtures to help her on the campaign trail the cold shoulder.
""We'll get back to you,"" three sources told Axios about what Harris' campaign is telling Biden officials offering to help in the final weeks of the presidential campaign.
""Harris' team believes Biden is a political liability at a crucial time in the campaign — but is reluctant to directly say they don't want him to campaign for her,"" Axios' Alex Thompson reported Sunday.
Polling has consistently shown immigration, the economy, and inflation are the top voting issues, and Harris was tapped by Biden as the border czar to investigate ""root causes"" of mass illegal migration. Meanwhile, Republican talking heads say Biden's economy has not worked well for middle-class and poorer Americans amid massive inflation on energy, groceries, and basic consumer goods.
""One person familiar with the situation compared it to a slow-moving break-up: Harris' team and allies respect Biden's service, but are wary of further tying Harris to the unpopular president on the campaign trail,"" according to Thompson's reporting.
Biden's team has held days open for campaigning, only to remain sidelined and not given the go-ahead, two sources told Axios.
""He's a reminder of the last four years, not the new way forward,"" another source added.
White House officials disputed the veracity of the source's claims.
""There is always speculation in political circles, but this is not accurate,"" White House spokesperson Andrew Bates told Axios in a statement. ""We are in close touch with the campaign to determine when, where and how the president can be helpful.""
Notably, amid some shaky polling in Pennsylvania, Biden's team believes he can help there — a state he considered his home — and the Rust Belt, Axios reported.
Biden's 2020 victory over Trump featured strength exceeding Hillary Clinton's performance in those pivotal states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, ultimately handing Biden the White House over Trump.
The cold silence between the Harris campaign and Biden is evident in public, too, sources told Axios, noting a Biden appearance in Pittsburgh to campaign this weekend was left off the Harris ""Day Ahead"" memo Saturday outlining surrogates' campaign trail appearances.
Notably, a Harris campaign event earlier in October went on as Biden made an impromptu White House briefing appearance that some considered stepping on the campaign timing and messaging, Axios reported.

News Max,Guilfoyle to Newsmax: Dems Preach Tolerance But Spew Hate,"Kimberly Guilfoyle, a former Trump campaign adviser and prominent conservative voice, criticized Democrats on Thursday on Newsmax for ""preaching tolerance"" while spewing hate.
Guilfoyle on ""Rob Schmitt Tonight"" addressed Mark Cuban's comments on ABC's ""The View,"" where he claimed former President Donald Trump doesn't surround himself with ""strong, intelligent women."" Cuban is a surrogate for Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign.
Guilfoyle, a former San Francisco prosecutor, was asked if she had a response to Cuban's comment.
""You bet I do,"" Guilfoyle said. ""Look, Mark Cuban is spiraling because he sees Kamala imploding. The whole world sees it. The country sees it. He's trying to lift up the left's failing campaign by tearing conservative women down. And it's unacceptable.""
Guilfoyle argued that attempts to undermine conservative women would only galvanize voters on the right, including independents.
""This will only motivate independents and conservatives even more because we are fed up with the smear tactics,"" she said. ""The left lectures everyone about tolerance but spews nothing but hate.""
According to Guilfoyle, conservative women remain committed to their principles, withstanding what she described as smear campaigns. She cited conservative movements — specifically, Trump's America First agenda — as energized forces focused on mobilizing voters.
""Understand that when you vote, this is who the left is. When they get desperate, what do they do? They lie. They lash out. They lose control,"" she said, adding that fear tactics and baseless accusations have become staples of left-wing strategies.
""They're going to fearmonger,"" she said. ""They'll spew baseless nonsense because it's all they have left in their playbook.""
Guilfoyle emphasized that conservative voters, especially women, will not be deterred by negative portrayals or criticism.
""If we show up — our empowered movement — you know we win. If we turn out, we win,"" she said, underscoring her confidence in conservative voter turnout in future elections.
Guilfoyle reiterated her commitment to supporting ""smart, tough, strong, fearless conservative women,"" suggesting that conservative resilience and unity would play a critical role in the election.
""Watch us turn out on Election Day!"" she said.

News Max,Report: Big-Money Trump Group Raises $145M in 3rd Quarter,"A fundraising committee for former President Donald Trump's campaign hauled in some big bucks during the third quarter of this election cycle to the tune of $145 million.
New York Times reporter Theodore Schleifer posted Tuesday night on X that ""Trump 47, his high-dollar fundraising committee, took in $145 million in the 3rd quarter of the year.""
""Backers include VC Marc Andreessen, former [Washington] Commanders owner Dan Snyder, fight promoter Dana White, former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and hedge funder Bill Ackman,"" Schleifer wrote.
Quarterly campaign finance disclosures for the third quarter were due to the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) on Tuesday. Schleifer did not disclose the amounts of the contributions.
But according to FEC data, during the third quarter, which ran from July 16 to Oct. 15, Snyder contributed $844,600 to Trump 47 on July 16 and Andreessen, an acclaimed software engineer, contributed the same amount on Aug. 8.
Mnuchin, who was treasury secretary under Trump, contributed $419,600 to Trump 47 on July 29 and Ackman, the billionaire hedge fund manager who is founder and CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, contributed the same total on Sept. 10. Ackman was a longtime Democrat donor before endorsing Trump.
White, who introduced Trump at the Republican National Convention, contributed $500 on Aug. 25 and $73,300 on Sept. 23. White had given Trump 47 $838,000 in the second quarter, according to the data.
Newsmax reached out to the Trump campaign for comment.

News Max,Rep. Adam Schiff: Presidential Race Is 'Scary Close',"The presidential race is ""scary close"" as the polls in all the battleground states are razor thin with just one month to go before the election, Rep. Adam Schiff told NBC News' ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday.
The California Democrat said that his party is ""well poised to win this thing. But it's still scary close.""
He emphasized that ""I can't remember a time in history when we had such a clear and dramatic choice about the direction the country would take, whether we move forward to an economy that works for everyone, with a democracy that is healthy and intact, or whether we move back to this terrible, you know, Trump American carnage.""
Schiff added that ""I think, faced with that prospect and that choice, Kamala Harris will win this race, and I'm very optimistic about the outcome.""
In July, Schiff had pushed for Harris to replace President Joe Biden as the Democrat presidential candidate and said that he thought Harris could win ""overwhelmingly"" against former President Donald Trump.
On Sunday, he stood by that remark, but stated that ""I think she can win overwhelmingly ... by the standards of today.""
He specified that, ""given how divided the country is, ‘overwhelming' may be winning by 100,000 votes or 80,000 votes in these key battleground states,"" adding that, ""I think that's within her capacity to do.""
Schiff pointed out that when he made the comments in July about Harris, he was ""urging that the torch be passed to her, and it was. And I think the effect has been dramatic.""
He stressed that, ""young people who were disengaged are now engaged, interested, active, volunteering,"" but cautioned that the swing states remain exceedingly close between the two candidates.

News Max,Harris: Trump 'Dangerous' for Black Americans,"Former President Donald Trump is ""dangerous"" for Black America, Vice President Kamala Harris said in an interview with ""Roland Martin Unfiltered"" on Monday.
She pointed out a history of relations that Trump has had with the community. She said: ""Look at it in the context of how he actually thinks and talks about Black folks in America. … He is not looking out for folks when he was a landlord and would not rent to Black families: sued for it.
""When he took out a full-page ad in The New York Times against those five teenagers, Black and Latino, who were innocent, saying they should be executed, the Central Park Five.""
Harris also brought up Trump's attitude towards former President Barack Obama, saying that ""when you look at the first Black president of the United States, and [Trump] had birther lies, and now you look at Black immigrants, legal immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, and he gets on a debate stage and says they're eating their pets.""
The vice president also said that Trump is ""not looking out for middle-class folks. You look at what he's proposing in terms of cutting, [such as] healthcare costs.""
Harris insisted that the Biden administration has ""capped the cost of insulin, $35 a month for seniors. Black folks are 60% more likely to be diagnosed with diabetes. Under Project 2025, they would undo that $35 cap. You look at what [Trump] is planning to do that is about undoing, getting rid of the Department of Education and Head Start programs. Who do you think that's going to affect?""

News Max,Sen. Barrasso to Newsmax: Mich. Senate Race Close Due to Biden-Harris Policies,"Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., told Newsmax on Tuesday that the Michigan Senate race is tight because of the policies of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who is currently running as the Democrat nominee for president.
""People are responding to the question, 'Are you better off now than you were four years ago?' "" Barrasso said during an appearance on ""National Report."" ""I was here for Mike Rogers' debate last night. He clearly won. He shows he's ready to lead and get America back on track. And in Michigan, it's in addition to the high prices of things where prices are up over 20% since Biden and Harris took over in 2020.
""It's also the mandates coming out of the EPA and the Biden administration that are saying, Hey, we need you need to go out and buy electric vehicles. People don't want the electric vehicles. They don't want to buy them. So, many autoworkers here in Michigan are losing their jobs as a result of the mandates.
""You know, when Joe Biden told the EPA, 'I want you to prioritize climate over energy that is available, affordable and reliable,' what they did is basically jack up prices for people when they pay their heating bills, their gasoline bills, all of the things related to energy. And we need it all.""
Former Michigan Rep. Mike Rogers is running in the Great Lakes State as the Republican candidate for Senate.
""So, we have an administration so out of touch with the American people because they just follow the ideology of the far left,"" Barrasso continued. ""And now what they've done is nominated Kamala Harris, who is a dangerous San Francisco liberal, scarily dangerous, that we just cannot have that for our country.
""We need to get America back on track and the way to do it is with [former President] Donald Trump and a Republican House and Republican Senate, which is why I'm here with Mike Rogers today.""
When asked why Republican candidates are surging in the polls in Michigan, Barrasso said it all goes back to people's comparisons of their lives today versus four years ago under Trump.
""One is people have been paying so much more for everything, they're just falling further and further behind and they say the country is heading in the wrong direction,"" he said. ""And then in Michigan, with the electric vehicle mandates — that Mike Rogers has opposed but his Democrat opponent for the Senate has supported and actually voted for — that's forcing people out of work.
""It's forcing people to buy what they don't want to buy in terms of the vehicles that they want to drive.""

News Max,Harris Promises to 'Represent All Americans' After Biden's 'Garbage' Remark,"Kamala Harris called Wednesday for Americans to “stop pointing fingers at each other” as she tried to push past comments made by President Joe Biden about Donald Trump's supporters and “garbage.""
“We know we have an opportunity in this election to turn the page on a decade of Donald Trump, who has been trying to keep us divided and afraid of each other,"" the Democratic nominee said about her Republican opponent.
Harris made her pitch in Raleigh, North Carolina, at the first of three rallies she was scheduled to attend Wednesday. She's also heading to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Madison, Wisconsin, as part of a blitz of battleground states in the final week before Election Day.
She stressed unity and common ground, expanding on her capstone speech Tuesday in Washington, where she laid out what her team called the “closing argument” of her campaign.
“I am not looking to score political points,” the vice president said. “I am looking to make progress.”
Liz Kazal, 35, said she was “cautiously optimistic” about the election as she waited for Harris to take the stage. She’s tried to volunteer for the campaign every week, including making phone calls, knocking on doors with her toddler daughter and raising money for Harris’ candidacy.
“You hope for the best and plan for the worst,” Kazal said.
Harris was introduced at the rally by a former Republican voter who previously supported Trump, another example of her campaign's effort to welcome disaffected conservatives who are uneasy about reelecting the former president.
It was a message that Biden threatened to undermine on Tuesday — at the same time Harris was speaking near the White House — when he participated in a campaign call organized by the Hispanic advocacy group Voto Latino.
Biden used the opportunity to criticize Trump’s recent Madison Square Garden rally, where a comedian described Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage.”
“The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American,” Biden said. “It’s totally contrary to everything we’ve done, everything we’ve been.”
Biden and the White House rushed to explain that the president was talking about the rhetoric on stage, not Trump’s supporters themselves. He did not answer questions about his comments Wednesday during an Oval Office meeting with the president of Cyprus, but press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden “does not view Trump supporters or anybody who supports Trump as garbage.”
Harris told reporters before boarding Air Force Two for her flight to Raleigh that she disagrees ""with any criticism of people based on who they vote for.”
“I will represent all Americans, including those who don’t vote for me,” she said.
Her words were an attempt to blunt the controversy over Biden's comments and put some distance between herself and the president, something she has struggled with in the past.
Republicans have seized on Biden’s comments, claiming they were an echo of the time when Hillary Clinton, as the Democratic nominee in 2016, said half of Trump’s supporters belonged to a “basket of deplorables.”
“We know what they believe. Because look how they’ve treated you,” Trump said at his rally in Rocky Mount, North Carolina. “They’ve treated you like garbage. The truth is, they’ve treated our whole country like garbage.”
He also said “without question, my supporters are far higher-quality than Crooked Joe’s,"" using his nickname for the president.
Trump has refused demands to apologize for the comment about Puerto Rico at his rally, acknowledging that “somebody said some bad things” but adding that he “can’t imagine it’s a big deal.”
Political attack lines have a history of occasionally boomeranging back on people who use them. For example, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, now Trump's running mate, once described Democrats as beholden to “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made.”
Vance's 3-year-old comments resurfaced once he became the vice presidential nominee, energizing Harris supporters who repurposed the label as a point of pride on shirts and bumper stickers — much like Trump’s supporters once cheerfully branded themselves as “deplorables.”
On Wednesday morning, Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, downplayed Biden’s comments in television interviews.
“Let’s be very clear, the vice president and I have made it absolutely clear that we want everyone as a part of this,” he told ABC’s “Good Morning America."" “Donald Trump’s divisive rhetoric is what needs to end.”

News Max,Rep. Lawler to Newsmax: Dems Coming Full Bore for His Seat,"Two years ago, Republican Rep. Mike Lawler pulled off a massive upset in deep blue New York that helped tip the scales in favor of Republicans in the House of Representatives, and now Democrats are gunning to take it back.
Democrats are spending ""tens of millions of dollars"" this cycle to unseat him in the 17th Congressional District in the Hudson Valley, but Lawler told Newsmax on Monday that he feels ""very good"" about his position two weeks from the election.
Lawler in 2022 knocked off incumbent Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, then chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Now, it's progressive and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., disciple Mondaire Jones whom Democrats have tabbed to try and return the favor.
""Well, look, this race was the difference two years ago between a House Republican majority and a Democratic majority. We defeated the chair of the D-triple-C for the first time in over 42 years and helped end Nancy Pelosi's reign as speaker,"" Lawler said on ""Finnerty."" ""It was New York and California over two cycles that flipped 10 seats and made the difference. And so, obviously, Democrats are focused on New York and California. They're spending tens of millions of dollars to try and flip these seats back into Democratic control.
""And I feel very good with 15 days to go with where we are; we've been leading in every poll, both public and private. But … upwards of $40 million [will be spent] when all is said and done,"" he added. ""And this is a district Joe Biden won by 10 points that has 80,000 more Democrats than Republicans. So it's a fight to the finish. But I feel very good about where we are.""
Lawler is looking forward to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City this weekend, an event Lawler said will help energize his race, too.
""As New Yorkers, you always want to be in the world's most famous arena. And obviously, I think President Trump is no exception,"" Lawler said. ""I think there's going to be a lot of enthusiasm there for the former president, as we saw when he campaigned ... in the South Bronx just a few months ago and had over 30,000 New Yorkers show up.
""AOC held a rally right down the road and had about 100 people show up. So it shows you the difference in enthusiasm.""

News Max,Pollster Zogby to Newsmax: Emerson Numbers Too Close to Bet on Trump,"Nobody should place bets on former President Donald Trump's numbers based on a poll this past week showing him slightly ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris in five out of seven swing states, as the numbers are ""non-leads"" showing the race in a virtual tie, pollster John Zogby told Newsmax on Saturday.
""I would stay away from your bookie, and I wouldn't make any bets whatsoever just yet,"" Zogby, appearing with former Trump White House associate counsel May Mailman on Newsmax's ""Wake Up America Weekend,"" said about the Emerson College poll results.
""[They are] not only well within the margin of sampling error, but I need to study the Emerson model and see what the turnout model is and [if] it will resemble what other pollsters are saying,"" Zogby said.
There has been ""very little movement"" in the Harris campaign or the polling numbers between the candidates, Zogby noted.
""Trump has slightly pulled ahead in the battleground states. But look, not one of those leads in the battleground states is 1% or more,"" he said. ""It's all rounded to 1% or less. Secondly, the honeymoon is over for Kamala Harris… we're just not seeing any growth in her numbers or in her support among key groups.""
Trump's numbers are also locked in, said Zogby, adding that he thinks the race will go down to the wire.
""Let's be careful of calling something leads when they're really not leads,"" he said. ""They're really just little bumps in the carpet.""
Zogby and Mailman also discussed a Politico report that deemed the election a ""boys vs. girls"" race because of the differences in numbers between men supporting Trump and women backing Harris.
If the race comes down to those factors, Republicans are in trouble because women vote more often than men, said Mailman.
""If Republicans are going to put all of their stock on women or on men and getting men to vote, then there needs to be that turnout apparatus,"" she said. "" It can't just be registering them… there's a step two. There's actually taking them to the polls and if men can vote then that's a successful strategy. But do not forget, women turn out in huge percentages. So if I was a candidate, and I wanted to count on either men or women, I'd rather count on women.""
Meanwhile, Democrats like former President Barack Obama are ""bullying"" Black male voters and calling them ""misogynistic"" if they don't support Harris, said Mailman.
""This has nothing to do with sex,"" she said. ""This has to do with how do you treat men, what do you have to offer men? And you know, white, Black, or otherwise, the Democrats don't have a good answer to that.""
Zogby agreed that the election is a ""boys vs. girls race,"" and said that young men, particularly young Black men don't know ""exactly how to steer their lives in what they perceive as a female-dominated society.""
""I think it's wise for Kamala Harris to be going after women,"" he added. ""Women put Barack Obama over the top in 2012, when that was a very close election. I think the Trump and [Ohio Sen. J.D] Vance team are counting on the same thing from young men this time.""

News Max,Sen. Ricketts to Newsmax: 'We Know How To Hit Iran. Let's Do It',"The narrative that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is committing genocide took hold because President Joe Biden didn't support Israel after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, Sen. Peter Ricketts, R-Neb., told Newsmax on Monday.
Ricketts said on ""The Record With Greta Van Susteren,"" ""If [Biden] had come out right away and said 'Israel has been attacked, we're going to support them no matter what they need to do to destroy Hamas, because Hamas is a terrorist organization, and if anybody else gets in the way, like Iran, we're going to support Israel to destroy them, too.' Guess what, the terrorists would back off, and there wouldn't be all this pushback on Israel if we had just come out for them right away.""
Ricketts compared the situation to former President Ronald Reagan's actions after Iran attacked a U.S. Navy ship back in the 1980s. Ricketts said, ""Reagan started sinking their ships, and they backed off.""
Ricketts also suggested the U.S. end its support for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. He said, ""I've got a bill to end it because it's basically been described as a branch of Hamas. And we need to make sure that we're supporting our friend Israel and not backing off. And then let's get their sanctions back on Iran again.
""[Former President Donald] Trump knew how to do this. He took Iran's foreign reserves from $122.5 billion, down to less than $14 billion, and Iran did not have the money to support Hamas. Let's do those things. We know how to really hit Iran. Let's do it.""

News Max,D.C. Judge Allows Release of Appendix in Trump Jan. 6 Case,"The federal judge overseeing Donald Trump's election interference case in Washington, D.C., denied a request by the former president to prevent Department of Justice special counsel Jack Smith from releasing until after the Nov. 5 election a massive legal brief arguing why Trump can be criminally prosecuted.
U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, a former President Barack Obama appointee, wrote in a five-page ruling issued Thursday that ""incidental effects on politics are not the same as a court's intentional interference with them.""
""As a result, it is in fact Defendant's requested relief that risks undermining that public interest,"" Chutkan wrote. ""If the court withheld information that the public otherwise had a right to access solely because of the potential political consequences of releasing it, that withholding could itself constitute – or appear to be – election interference.""
Chutkan also ordered Smith's four-part appendix – with potentially significant redactions – to be released Friday. Smith is arguing why Trump should still be prosecuted following the Supreme Court's 6-3 decision in July that former presidents cannot be prosecuted for actions relating to the core powers of their office, and that there is at least a presumption that they have immunity for their official acts more broadly.
The case was thrown back to the lower courts to determine whether the conduct at the center of Smith's charges against Trump was official or unofficial.

News Max,Rep. Elise Stefanik to Newsmax: 'Significant Issues' for Harris,"Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., told Newsmax on Tuesday that there are ""significant issues"" for Vice President Kamala Harris when it comes to the Blue Wall states that she's counting on to propel her into the Oval Office.
""It's going to come down to Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina moving in our direction, Georgia as well, Arizona and Nevada,"" Stefanik said during an appearance on ""American Agenda.""
""These are key states, and we are doing a full court press. I was in Wisconsin last week. I will tell you the energy and enthusiasm is palpable. It's a huge disparity. Kamala Harris is just not getting the energy and enthusiasm that [President] Joe Biden had in 2020.
""She is underperforming Joe Biden in every single Blue Wall state compared to how he performed in 2020. She's also underperforming [President] Joe Biden in every single swing congressional district and swing Senate seat.
""That's why you're seeing alarm bells ring among Democrats and Democrats trying to wipe away their record,"" she continued. ""Democrats like [Sen.] Bob Casey in Pennsylvania, Democrats like [Sen.] Sherrod Brown in Ohio, [Sen.] Tammy Baldwin in Wisconsin, who want you to forget that they voted lock, stock, and barrel with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris because they see President Trump is making significant inroads, our Republican Senate candidates are making significant inroads.
""So, don't believe the Democrat ads when they're putting them out saying, ‘Oh, they support Trump,"" she added. ""No, they supported impeaching Donald Trump twice. They have done everything they can to block President Trump's effective policies. We need to get this done, and how we do that is by turning out all the votes. Bank your vote early in person, via legal absentee or on Election Day. We need to put this away.""
Stefanik also commented on the record early voting turnout in North Carolina, which was devastated by Hurricane Helene in western areas of the state, and its implications for the GOP.
""As you look at the numbers from North Carolina and some of these early states, as I said, we're cautiously optimistic, but we take nothing for granted, and every vote is going to matter because we know that Democrats and the left will bring out all of the stops,"" she said.
""But certainly in North Carolina, you referenced those very hard-hit districts, people are seeing the devastation of Joe Biden's failed administration and Kamala Harris' failure to ensure that the FEMA dollars and support was getting to those communities that need it the most.""
""That's why I think you're seeing historic turnout from these communities that have been decimated by Hurricane Helene,"" she added. ""They want to see the strong, effective leadership of President Trump, who works at the speed of business, not the speed of failed government bureaucracy of Kamala Harris.""

News Max,Former AG Holder: Harris Will Get 5M More Votes Than Trump,"Former Democrat Attorney General Eric Holder predicted Monday that Vice President Kamala Harris will get 5 million more votes than former President Donald Trump in November's election, though he predicted a close race because of the Electoral College.
""On the Democratic side I am concerned about complacency — I see that starting to erode — but I’m still concerned about that,"" Holder said at the Future Resilience Forum in London, Bloomberg reported. ""I would be shocked if she wins by less than 5 million votes.""
With just three weeks left before the election, Trump and Harris appear to be deadlocked in most national polls. An NBC poll released Monday showed Trump and Harris essentially tied at 48% and a DecisionDesk HQ/The Hill poll showed Harris leading Trump by 2.9 percentage points.
Holder in his speech warned of a second Trump term, saying ""the wrong person to win the election this time could plunge the world back into that doom loop.""
He also said the 2024 election gives the U.S. a chance to ""turn the page on this fecklessness once and for all.""

News Max,Harris Is Attending Church in Georgia and Encouraging Black Congregants to Vote,"Democrat Kamala Harris kicked off her 60th birthday on Sunday with a church visit in Georgia as part of an effort to court early voters, while her Republican rival, Donald Trump, is set to hold an event in battleground Pennsylvania and visit a local McDonald's.
Harris and Trump, who are essentially tied in the race for president in the most competitive states, have sharpened their attacks in recent days, while drumming up support for early votes by mail or in person with just 16 days left until the Nov. 5 election.
Vice President Harris and former President Trump, 78, are focusing on Georgia, Pennsylvania and a handful of other states likely to decide the election, where both parties have strong support and electoral results have been close in past cycles.
Harris, who was raised in the teachings of the Black church and sang in a church choir, attended a service and spoke at New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Stonecrest, Georgia, about 30 miles (50 km) east of Atlanta. Invoking her childhood experiences in a Black church, Harris drew a sharp contrast to the harsh and divisive rhetoric of the current political climate, although she did not mention Trump by name.
""At this point across our nation, what we do see are some trying to deepen division among us, spread hate, sow fear and cause chaos,"" she said. ""At this moment, our country is at a crossroads and where we go is up to us."" She will also speak at Divine Faith Ministries International in Jonesboro, just south of Atlanta, where she plans to encourage worshippers to exercise their voting rights. Music icon Stevie Wonder will attend and is slated to perform.
Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, on Sunday were promoting a ""Souls to the Polls"" initiative aimed at using gospel performances, national and state faith leaders, elected officials and others to mobilize voters.
After her events, Harris will record an interview with civil rights leader Al Sharpton that will air Sunday night on MSNBC. Walz attended a service in Saginaw, Michigan, while his wife, Gwen Walz, planned to visit a church in Las Vegas.
Harris will need strong results in the majority non-white cities of Detroit and Atlanta and their surrounding suburbs to repeat President Joe Biden's 2020 wins in Michigan and Georgia.
Trump, after escalating personal attacks on Harris on Saturday, told Breitbart News he would work at a McDonald’s restaurant in Pennsylvania on Sunday “just for fun” to mock Harris. Trump adviser Jason Miller said Trump would be working in the french fries area of the restaurant.
Harris says she worked at a McDonald’s when she was young but Trump says he does not believe her.
Trump then will hold a town hall in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.
The former president is seeking to take advantage of what he felt was an improved position for him in opinion polls that show a deadlocked race. Some voters already have sent mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania, the biggest prize on Election Day among battleground states.
On Monday, Harris said she will campaign with Republican former Representative Liz Cheney in the suburbs of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a Democrat who is supporting Harris, acknowledged on NBC'S ""Meet the Press"" that the race in his state is tight.
""We understand that this election likely will come down to tens of thousands of votes ... you've got to compete for every vote,"" Shapiro said.

News Max,Trump Campaign: Harris Spokesman Right on Liz Cheney,"The Trump campaign took a jab at Vice President Kamala Harris' spokesman, Ian Sams, in a press release on Monday after he criticized former Vice President Dick Cheney's role in getting his daughter, Liz Cheney, into a special State Department position that allowed the Bush administration to pursue its war in Iraq under false pretenses.
""Even a broken clock is right twice a day,"" the campaign quipped on Monday. ""And a Kamala Harris spokesman is right once in his life.""
The statement referenced a tweet of Sams from 2019, where he wrote, ""Liz Cheney helped lead us into Iraq from a special State Department Middle East post her dad's administration created for her.""
The Trump campaign noted that should Harris get elected, Liz Cheney would likely be the vice president's defense secretary.
In November 2002, economist Paul Krugman wrote in an op-ed for The New York Times that nepotism had been why Liz Cheney was appointed to a ""specially created State Department job.""

News Max,Trump: Free Legal Help Offered to Migrants in Texas,"Billboards have gone up in Texas offering free legal help to illegal migrants, according to social media posts by former President Donald Trump and others.
In posts on Truth Social and X, the former president wrote: ""Kamala is now running billboards near the Border advertising FREE Legal Services for Illegal Alien Criminals. When I win, the billboards are coming down, and the Migrant Gangs are going home!""
Trump's X post retweeted a post from the National Border Patrol Council, the official union of the U.S. Border Patrol. That posting depicts one of the billboards, which says, ""Your brother in immigration custody has rights, we're here to help."" It lists a web address for the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security.
The Border Patrol union said in its X post, ""This DHS billboard (supported by Border Czar Harris) will only encourage and incentivize illegal immigration and the abuse of the asylum system to continue. This leads to record numbers of illegal aliens pouring across the border into our communities with little to no vetting. PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL STOP THE INVASION! h/t @BillMelugin_""
The post links to the account of a Fox News correspondent who regularly reports from the border in Texas.
Newsmax reached out to DHS for comment.
In response to the report, Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, told Fox: ""The news that DHS is using taxpayer money to launch billboards advocating ‘rights' for individuals in ‘immigration custody' should be alarming because it's a preview of the legal arguments that radical progressive democrats will use to argue against deportation of the millions dumped in America by Biden-Harris-Mayorkas.""
Added Rep. Tony Gonzales, R-Texas: ""Time and again, we've seen DHS put an open borders agenda ahead of its mission to safeguard American families. Whether it's FEMA splurging hundreds of millions of dollars on migrant housing or OIDO running ads like this, our government is hemorrhaging money on the wrong priorities. It's time for Congress to pull the plug on programs like these.""

News Max,GSG Poll: Voters Prefer Obamacare Over Trump Tax Cuts,"More Americans said Congress should extend healthcare subsidies through the Affordable Care Act than extend the 2017 tax law championed by former President Donald Trump, according to a new poll from Global Strategy Group.
The Trump tax law and the subsidies provided through Obamacare are both set to expire next year, but most Americans said that Congress should prioritize extending the healthcare subsidies over the tax cuts:
- 58% support extending the ACA subsidies.
- 24% support extending the 2017 tax law.
- 18% aren’t sure.
Democrats and independents were both more likely to support the ACA subsidies than the 2017 tax cuts, but Republicans were strongly divided on the issue:
- 34% of Republicans support extending the ACA subsidies.
- 43% of Republicans support extending the 2017 tax cuts.
- 23% of Republicans aren’t sure.
In addition, the survey found that less than one in three Americans supported the 2017 tax law, while more than half have an unfavorable view of the cuts. This was the inverse of the polling results for the Affordable Care Act, which has a favorable approval rating from more than half of Americans:
- 59% of Americans have a favorable view of the ACA.
- 25% have an unfavorable view of the ACA.
- 16% are unsure.
- 30% of Americans support the 2017 tax law.
- 56% oppose the 2017 tax law.
- 14% aren’t sure.
Global Strategy Group polled 1,000 registered voters from Oc. 3-7, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

News Max,Rep. Andy Harris: Invoke Taft-Hartley Act on Strike,"Rep. Andy Harris, R-Md., called on President Joe Biden on Thursday to invoke the Taft-Hartley Act in response to the port workers' strike that has paralyzed ocean shipping on the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico.
The 1947 Taft-Hartley Act authorizes a president to seek a court order for an 80-day cooling-off period for companies and unions to try to resolve their differences.
""It is in the interest of the American people and the economy of Maryland for the President to invoke the Taft-Hartley Act, order the disputing parties in this port strike to the negotiating table, and intensively arbitrate,"" Harris said in a statement. ""The President should not allow this strike to ruin the economy or disrupt the supply chain.""
Ports from Maine to Texas shut down early Tuesday when the union representing about 45,000 dock workers went on strike for the first time since 1977.
If a shutdown lasts more than a few weeks, it could raise prices and create shortages of goods across the country as both the presidential election and holiday shopping season approach.
Biden could suspend the strike by invoking the Taft-Hartley Act, but he didn't seem inclined to do so when asked about it by reporters on Sunday.
When asked if he planned to intervene in the longshoremen's labor dispute, the president said ""no.""
""Because it's collective bargaining, I don't believe in Taft-Hartley,"" he said.
Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack told reporters on Thursday that container loads of highly-perishable bananas are stuck at some ports and the strike will make it difficult to retrieve them in time to prevent spoilage. Biden has pushed shipping companies to try harder to reach a deal, he said.
""That's the most effective way of getting the bananas to wherever they need to go,"" Vilsack said. ""And hopefully the shippers will come to the table. The union will come to the table. Collective bargaining will work, and we'll get this resolved quickly.""
The key to preventing product shortages and higher prices, Vilsack said, is limiting how long the strike lasts.
""Our assessment is if this lasts a couple of weeks, we're not talking about a significant disruption,"" he said. ""If you get into months, then obviously that's a different situation.""

News Max,Trump Vows to Revive White House 'Faith Office' If He Wins,"Former President Donald Trump said if he wins next week, he will give faith leaders direct access to him through a revived ""Faith Office"" in the White House, according to the Washington Examiner.
During an interview with the National Faith Advisory Board in Powder Springs, Georgia, on Monday, Trump told moderator Paula White-Cain he would reinstate the office he created during his first term.
In January 2020, Trump picked White-Cain, a Pentecostal pastor, to oversee the Faith Office during his final year in office.
""We're going to set that up,"" Trump said Monday. ""It's important, and it'll be directly into the Oval Office.""
He added, ""We have to save religion in this country. I mean, honestly, religion is under threat in this country, serious threat, and we can't let that happen.
""It's sort of the fabric of our country. It's the thing that holds our country together. We can't, we can't lose it. We're not going to lose it.""
A similar office, the Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships was first established by the Bush administration in 2001. The Obama administration revamped it and the Biden administration relaunched it in 2021.
In addition to reinstating the Faith Office, Trump recently appointed Dr. Ben Carson, his former Housing and Urban Development secretary, as his campaign's national faith chair.

News Max,Puerto Rican Voters Thrust Into Battleground Spotlight,"Puerto Rican voters in the United States have suddenly emerged as a key voting bloc in the aftermath of a comedian's remarks about the island at a Donald Trump rally in New York City on Sunday, The Hill reported.
Tony Hinchcliffe, who goes by the stage name ""Kill Tony,"" likened Puerto Rico to a ""floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now"" in the run-up of speakers ahead of Trump's speech at Madison Square Garden.
His joke ignited outrage among many Puerto Ricans, Hispanics and the political left, thrusting the potential impact of the Puerto Rican vote on Election Day next Tuesday into the spotlight. The campaign for Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris seized on the moment, releasing an ad aimed at Puerto Ricans using footage of Hinchcliffe's remarks.
""I think that this can and could make a big difference with Puerto Ricans who were already anti-Trump but were not sold yet or were soft on Kamala,"" Federico de Jesús, former deputy director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, told The Hill. ""They might be voting for her, but they weren't enthusiastic. I think that this will create rage, anger and motivate people to go out and maybe volunteer. Maybe take their relatives to vote.""
An estimated 5.8 million Puerto Ricans were living in the United States in 2021, according to census data. What's not clear is what percentage of them were voting age.
According to the 2020 census, Florida was home to 1.15 million Puerto Ricans, but Connecticut had the highest percentage of Puerto Ricans, at 8% of the population. However, neither is a swing state in 2024.
Pennsylvania, however, was home to more than 456,000 Puerto Ricans in 2020, 3.6% of that state's population. The battleground states of Wisconsin (1.1%), North Carolina (1.1%), Georgia (1%), Nevada (0.9%), Arizona (0.6%) and Michigan (0.4%) were all much smaller in population percentage let alone voting age Puerto Ricans.
But given the slim margins of victory that are being projected in the battlegrounds next week, those Puerto Rican populations could impact the result, according to the report.
""The fact that there's so many Puerto Ricans, more than 100,000 in Georgia, for example, more than that in North Carolina and obviously in Pennsylvania and in Wisconsin, that changes things,"" de Jesus told The Hill.

News Max,Obama Targets Young Vote at Rally for Harris in Pittsburgh,"Former President Barack Obama will make his case for Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday at a rally in Pittsburgh aimed at motivating young people to support the Democrat nominee and spurring them to vote in the Nov. 5 election.
Obama, whose White House term ended in 2017, has been a vocal supporter of Harris since she ascended to the top of the Democratic ticket after President Joe Biden stepped aside in July following a poor debate performance against Republican former President Donald Trump.
Obama is still popular with the party's base. His rally at the University of Pittsburgh, which he will headline while Harris campaigns in Nevada, is the first of several events he plans to do in battleground states across the country in the coming weeks.
Obama will say Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, her running mate, are uniquely positioned to lead the United States at this moment, according to his adviser Eric Schultz.
""He'll also talk about the enormous stakes and the risks involved in returning President Trump into office,"" Schultz said.
Obama and his wife, Michelle, gave rousing speeches in support of Harris at the Democratic National Convention in August; the former first lady is expected to campaign further for Harris as well.
Harris was an early supporter of Barack Obama's own presidential bid, and he has helped her behind the scenes as the party's 2024 standard-bearer, encouraging her to tap talent to bolster her campaign, which she did.
The former president is viewed by some as having helped usher Biden out of the race after Democrats' worries about the 81-year-old leader's age and abilities skyrocketed after his June debate against Trump.
Harris and Trump remain in a close race, and winning Pennsylvania could be key to winning the White House.

News Max,NY Times: JPMorgan Chief Dimon Would Consider a Role in Harris Admin,"JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon would consider a government role, perhaps that of the Treasury Secretary, if Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris wins the U.S. presidential election, The New York Times reported Tuesday.
Dimon is not making his stance known publicly for fear of retribution should Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, win, according to the report.
The CEO of the largest U.S. bank has long been floated for senior positions on U.S. economic policy.
But at JPMorgan's post-earnings call earlier this month, Dimon said the chance of him being asked to take up a government role was ""almost nil.""
""And I probably am not going to do it. But I always reserve the right"" to reconsider, he said.
Dimon took the reins at JPMorgan in 2006. He has emphasized that he and the rest of the board will ""do the right thing"" on succession when he eventually leaves, without specifying details.
He has been outspoken on economic and policy matters and has often celebrated American exceptionalism, including in his widely read annual letter in April.
""I've always been an American patriot and my country is more important to me than my company,"" he told analysts on a call this month.
The bank declined to comment on the report. Spokespeople for the Harris and Trump campaigns did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment.

News Max,Harris 'Strongly Disagrees' With Biden 'Garbage' Comment,"Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, have distanced themselves and their campaign from comments that President Joe Biden made and walked back that appeared to refer to former President Donald Trump's supporters as ""garbage.""
""Listen, I think, first of all, he clarified his comments, but let me be clear: I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for,"" Harris told reporters on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews on Wednesday, reports CNN.
""You heard my speech last night and continuously throughout my career,"" she added. ""I believe that the work that I do is about representing all the people whether they support me or not.""
Harris said Biden called her Tuesday night but said his comments ""didn't come up.""
She also insisted that she will ""represent all Americans"" if she's elected.
""I am sincere in what I mean,"" said Harris. ""When elected president of the United States, I will represent all Americans, including those who don't vote for me, and address their needs and their desires.""
Biden brought an outcry from Republicans, including Trump, when he was commenting on Trump's Madison Square Garden rally, where comedian Tony Hinchcliffe referred to Puerto Rico as a ""floating island of garbage.""
""Well, let me tell you something … I don't know the Puerto Rican that I know… or Puerto Rico where I'm — in my home state of Delaware — they're good, decent, honorable people,"" the president said in a Latino get-out-the-vote call. ""The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters,"" he added.
Biden attempted to clarify his comments in an X post, saying he was referring to the ""hateful rhetoric"" at the Trump rally, and a White House spokesperson insisted that Biden meant ""supporter's,"" or the words Hinchcliffe had used.
Walz on Wednesday told CBS News that Biden's comments were a response to the ""frustration with Donald Trump's rhetoric of division"" while rejecting the argument that what was said undercut Harris' message.
""I think there's — the frustration we've seen since January 6, the frustration with Donald Trump's rhetoric of division,"" said Walz. ""President Biden was very clear that he's speaking about the rhetoric we heard at that. So, it doesn't undermine it.""
Walz added that voters should focus on Harris' message, as she is the party's nominee, not Biden.
""The vice president and I have made it absolutely clear that we want everyone as a part of this,"" Walz said. ""Donald Trump's divisive rhetoric is what needs to end. He called this a garbage country, and continues on from 'the enemy within,' "" he said. ""What you heard Vice President Harris say, and what I say is, there's a place for all of us here, and I think that's the one — she's running for president, she's making the message, and she delivered that speech on the Ellipse that showed what we can be as a country.""
Meanwhile, CNN reported that senior Harris campaign officials were hearing from supporters who suggested that Biden should remain out of public view until after Election Day is over.
""The Biden gaffe yesterday is just so infuriating,"" one former administration official said. ""Nobody wants him out there.""
But another advisor said that the Harris campaign ""won't lose a single voter"" because of Biden's comments.

News Max,NBC News Poll: 52 Percent Say They'll Vote Early,"A majority of U.S. voters say they plan to vote before Election Day, though early voting remains a partisan issue, according to a new survey.
A share of 52% of voters say they're planning to cast their ballots early this year, an NBC News poll found. Another 44% say they plan to vote in person on Election Day.
Conducted Oct. 4-8, the poll's results show that 5% of registered voters say they've already voted — 3% by mail and 2% in person. Another 47% say they plan to vote early, 20% by mail and 27% in person.
The results released Tuesday also show that Vice President Kamala Harris has a 17-point lead (57% to 40%) among Americans who have already voted or plan to vote before Election Day. She has ""a massive lead"" over people planning to vote by mail and a narrow edge over early in-person voters.
Former President Donald Trump leads among voters planning to head to the polls Nov. 5 by a 21-point margin (58% to 37%).
The NBC News survey found that 3% say they aren't sure how they will vote and another 1% said they won't vote.
The poll's overall finding was similar from a survey concerning the 2022 midterm elections, when 49% of voters said they planned to vote early and 47% planned to vote on Election Day.
During the COVID-19 pandemic in early October 2020, 59% said they planned to vote early and 37% planned to wait to vote on Election Day. By late October, the share of people saying they'd vote early had risen to 68%.
The overall finding in the latest NBC News poll is significantly higher than the 41% who said they planned to vote early in early November 2016, when fewer states than now offered early voting.
Alabama was the first state to begin voting this year, when absentee ballots were sent to eligible voters on Sept. 11, USA Today reported. The state does not have an option for in-person early voting.
North Carolina had been expected to be the first state to initiate voting, but it was delayed by the legal process of removing Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s name from the ballot after he withdrew from the race.

News Max,"Trump, Harris Supporters Widely Divided on Big Issues","Just how divided are supporters of former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris?
Very, according to a survey conducted on issues including guns, immigration, religion, gender identity, policing. and more.
Gun Ownership:
While Harris tries to convince voters she isn't planning to ""take away their guns,"" her voting base's view suggests it would be just fine if she did, according to a recent survey conducted by Pew Research.
Just 18% of Harris supporters surveyed say they think it's important to protect the rights of American citizens to own firearms and another 80% say they want the government to control gun ownership.
The opposite is true among Trump supporters, 87% of whom think it's important to protect the right. And just 12% favor gun control.
While 89% of Trump supporters support gun ownership to protect themselves, just 18% of Democrats do. Eighty-one percent of Democrats said that gun ownership reduces safety by giving too many people access to firearms, while just 10% of Republicans said they agreed with that premise.
Asked if they think gun ownership is generally good or bad for society, only 1% of Harris supporters said it was very good and 2% said it was somewhat good. Twelve percent said it was neither good nor bad and 58% said guns are ""very bad"" for society.
Among Trump supporters, 21% said guns are very good for society, the same number that said they are somewhat good. Forty percent said they're neither good nor bad, and only 6% said they are very bad.
Immigration:
The chasm between Trump and Harris supporters is equally wide on immigration. Fifteen percent of Democrats surveyed said illegal immigrants should not be allowed to stay in the country legally compared to 70% of Republicans.

For illegal immigrants who meet the requirements to apply for citizenship, 56% of Harris supporters said they should be allowed to apply compared to just 14% of Trump supporters.
Sixty-five percent of Trump supporters said America risks losing its national identity if its borders are too open, while 88% of Harris supporters said that isn't the case.
Gender Identity and Sexual Orientation:
On gender identity and sexual orientation issues, Trump and Harris supporters are in near-total disagreement.
Asked whether someone is a man or woman is determined by the sex they were assigned at birth, 92% of Trump supporters said yes compared to 39% of Harris supporters. When asked if a man or woman can be a sex different than the one they were assigned at birth, 60% of Harris supporters said yes compared to just 7% of Trump supporters.
When asked about same-sex marriage, 46% of Harris supporters said it was good for society compared to just 3% of Trump supporters. The sides were nearly the same when asked if it was neither good nor bad, but when asked it was ""very bad"" for society, 4% of Harris supporters said it was compared to 36% of Trump supporters.
National Pride:
When asked, just 12% of Harris supporters agreed that the United States ""stands above other countries in the world"" compared to 35% of Trump supporters. Both sides were in near agreement that the United States is ""one of the greatest countries in the world, along with some others."" By contrast, 27% of Harris supporters said there are other countries better than the U.S. compared to 11% of Trump supporters.
Abortion and Family Values:
When asked about abortion, 43% of Harris supporters said it should be legal in all cases and 44% said it should be legal in most cases. Seven percent of Trump supporters said it should be legal in all cases and 28% said it should be in most.

Seventy-two percent of Harris supporters said the government should do more to help needy Americans even if it means going deeper in debt, compared to 28% of Trump supporters.",2024-10-13
News Max,Voting Groups That Got a Boost from Harris' Candidacy Are Still Working to Persuade Voters of Color,"Left-leaning voter engagement groups that saw a surge in support and energy after Vice President Kamala Harris replaced President Joe Biden as the Democrats' White House nominee are aligning with a key pillar of her campaign in the final stretch before Election Day — trying to turn out uncommitted voters of color.
But many of those groups are finding they still have much work to do to introduce Harris and her policies. The challenges reflect Harris' late campaign start, as well as attempts to overcome the earlier lack of enthusiasm for a rematch between Biden and former President Donald Trump. They also reflect inroads that Republicans have been trying to make in particular with Black and Latino voters.
Activists with Siembra NC, a grassroots organization that focuses on Latino communities in North Carolina, found many potential voters are willing to vote in downballot races for state and local offices while leaving the top of the ticket blank. Their feeling is that the closer-to-home races affect their daily lives, while neither Trump nor Harris addresses all their desires in a presidential candidate.
“What we’ve had to do is a lot of conversations around trust-building, and that takes time,” said Kelly Morales, the group’s co-director. “It’s really about helping folks see that not casting a vote is also a political decision.”
The organization hosted a get-out-the vote event followed by a block party in late September in Greensboro. Labor policies, Harris’ position on the border and Trump’s rhetoric about the Latino community were top issues, Morales said.
The group, which endorsed Harris, ended up knocking on nearly 1,000 doors during the event and had attendees from multiple counties.
Persuading voters of color, particularly Black and Latino men, has become a priority for the Harris and Trump campaigns with early voting underway across the country, with increased outreach to both groups in a recognition that the race is likely to come down to seven swing states.
Like Siembra NC, many voter engagement groups saw a renewed sense of enthusiasm after Harris became the Democratic nominee. At 59, she is more than two decades younger than Biden, who's 81. If she wins, Harris would be the first Black woman, the first Asian American and the first South Asian American elected president.
But as the Nov. 5 election nears, motivating undecided voters in the battleground states is a challenge.
""We have to be mindful that exuberance and excitement does not lead to us not doing the work. You still have to get people out,” said Michael A. Blake, founder and CEO of KAIROS Democracy Project, a nonpartisan group that is focusing on engaging young voters and people of color.
Activists say the biggest obstacles are restrictive voting laws passed in several Republican-controlled states after the 2020 election, attempts by right-leaning groups to purge voter rolls and conflict in the Middle East.
That's been evident for groups such as Asian Americans Advancing Justice in Atlanta, despite the initial excitement over South Asian representation on both sides of the presidential ticket: Usha Vance, wife of Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Trump's running mate, would be America's first South Asian second lady if Trump wins.
“While there’s an excitement, there’s also this desire to hold whichever party is at the top of the ticket accountable to what our communities need,” said Murtaza Khwaja, the group’s executive director.
In Texas, which has a closely watched Senate race, officials said they had removed more than 1 million voters from the rolls since 2021. This raised concern among voter outreach groups such as Asian Texans for Justice over whether eligible voters might have been purged but would run out of time to correct it before the election.
Language barriers add to the already complex process, said executive director Lily Trieu. Texas has seen a roughly 63% growth in its Asian population since 2012 and has nearly 1.1 million eligible Asian American and Pacific Islander voters as of this year, according to APIA Vote, a nonpartisan advocacy group that focuses on Asian and Pacific Islander voters.
“These are new hurdles that we’re seeing in response to this rise and enthusiasm,” Trieu said.
Biden’s decision to drop out of the race this summer meant a late start for the Harris campaign but led to a wave of voter registrations, significant increases in volunteers and a jump in donations to left-leaning voting groups.
Voto Latino said it registered more than 50,000 people in the 10 days after Biden withdrew on July 21. By comparison, the nonprofit advocacy group registered 2,250 people in July 2016 and 25,150 in July 2020.
More than half of this year’s new registrations were for voters age 18 to 29. Most of the increase has come in Arizona and North Carolina, important swing states, and Florida, Trump’s adopted home state. The group registered over 11,000 Latino voters in Arizona alone, more than half after Biden’s announcement.
“With Kamala Harris on top of the ticket, with enthusiasm that is organically coming out of young people, the charge among donors and folks who care about a robust democracy should be where can we close the voter registration gap,” said Maria Teresa Kumar, the group’s president and CEO.
Black fraternities and sororities, known collectively as “The Divine Nine,” have been a source of strength for Harris. She was a member of the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority while attending Howard University, one of the nation's most prominent historically Black universities.
On a recent afternoon, dozens of students at Spelman College in Atlanta lined up at a voter registration drive organized by the campus chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha and its brother chapter, Alpha Phi Alpha, at nearby Morehouse College.
The chapter president, Taylor Kerr, a psychology major at Spelman, said the organizations held the event because it was important for students to be civically engaged and have the opportunity to ask questions about registering and voting. The organizations were not allowed to endorse candidates.
Caleb Cage, a 21-year-old religion major at Morehouse, said he was there because of the excitement of having the chance to vote for a historic candidate.
“With Harris at the top of the ticket, there’s just a lot more energy,"" he said. ""People are more ecstatic and a lot more involved,” he said.
After Biden’s decision to leave the race, Delta Sigma Theta, a historically Black sorority, released a paid advertisement — the first of its kind — that centered on Black people and issues such as bodily autonomy and the right to learn about Black history, which has recently been under attack by some conservative school boards and state legislatures.
The ad was broadcast across various networks and streaming platforms, focusing on battleground states such as Georgia and Pennsylvania. The sorority already had a public service announcement running before the switch on the Democratic ticket, but changed it to focus on what it sees as being at stake for Black Americans.
Kerry-Ann Hamilton, the executive producer of the ad, said the campaign reached more than 200,000 potential voters. It was also intended in part to reach men and those who vote infrequently, said Elsie Cooke-Holmes, Delta Sigma Theta's international president.
“It’s about making sure that we get to our community, get to lower-propensity voters, those who might feel like there’s no reason for me to go to vote,"" she said. ""All of that is important, on all counts. It's about all of us.""

News Max,Sen. Mitt Romney Declines to Endorse Harris,"Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, reiterated his issues toward a second administration of former President Donald Trump, but stopped short of endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris.
Speaking at the Hinckley Institute of Politics at the University of Utah on Tuesday, Romney was given an opportunity to endorse Harris like many in the old guard of the Republican Party already have.
Instead, Romney chose to punt the question saying, ""I’ve made it very clear that I don’t want Donald Trump to be the next president of the United States.""
Romney told the audience that he feels the Republican Party will need ""to be rebuilt or reorientated"" regardless of the outcome of the election and hoped to play a role in those efforts. Harris has received Republican endorsements from former Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, former Vice President Dick Cheney, and dozens of staffers from former President George W. Bush.
""I believe I will have more influence in the party by virtue of saying it as I’ve said it,"" he said. ""I’m not planning on changing the way I’ve described it.""
Trump and Romney have endured a complicated political relationship over the years beginning with mutual endorsements and ending with rancorous social media posts.
Upon learning that Romney would not seek reelection in 2024, Trump wrote, ""Mitt Romney, a total loser that only a mother could love, just wrote a book which is, much like him, boring, horrible, and totally predictable.
""I am very proud to be the one who forced this Left Leaning RINO out of politics. He wanted to run sooo badly, but knew he couldn’t win in the great State of Utah without my Endorsement and Support, so he QUIT.""
Romney will end his term in the U.S. Senate holding the distinction of being the only Republican in the upper chamber to vote to impeach Trump during his first impeachment trial.

News Max,Pro-Palestinian 'Uncommitted' Group Airs Warning of Trump,"A national group of voters that tried to pressure President Joe Biden during the Democrat presidential primaries to change his administration's stance toward Israel warned Tuesday if Donald Trump is elected in November, his policies will be ""disastrous for Palestinian human rights.""
In a video posted on X, Lexis Zeidan, co-founder of the Uncommitted National Movement (UNM) and a resident of Dearborn, Michigan, the city with the nation's largest Muslim population, detailed plans advocated in Project 2025 to displace Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Project 2025 is a policy paper written by the conservative Heritage Foundation that Trump has disavowed.
""As a Palestinian American, the current administration's handling of this genocide has been beyond enraging and demoralizing,"" Zeidan said in the video. ""But the reality is that it can get worse. Nobody wants a Trump presidency more than [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu because that is his ticket to wiping Palestine off the map.
""Under Trump, U.S. foreign policy took a sharp turn that prioritized Israel's hardline right-wing agenda. During his administration, Trump moved the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, and proposed a Middle East plan that effectively dismantled any pathway to Palestinian self-determination. But what's coming next under Project 2025 is even more dangerous.""
In Michigan's Democrat primary that Biden won in February, more than 100,000 voted ""uncommitted"" to protest Biden's support for Israel's military operation in the Gaza Strip following Iranian-backed Hamas' massacre of Israeli civilians on Oct. 7, 2023. There also were tens of thousands of ""uncommitted"" protest votes in Minnesota, Hawaii, and Washington state.
The group also made significant demands of Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign with little success, including an arms embargo against Israel, and moving U.S. foreign policy away from the Jewish state. UNM could play a pivotal role in November in Michigan, a key battleground state, should its supporters buck Harris because her campaign did not alter its position on Israel.
Zeidan, stopping short of endorsing Harris for president, said Project 2025 proposes to cut all humanitarian aid to Gaza and the West Bank. She cited David Friedman, the U.S. ambassador to Israel under Trump, pushing for Israel to annex the West Bank and advocating for expelling Palestinians from Gaza. She also said Project 2025 advocates limiting activism by revoking legal protections for human rights organizations and criminalizing protests against Israeli policies.
""It's clear Netanyahu will be doing everything in his power to get Trump elected,"" Zeidan said. ""And we have to do everything in our power to stop him.""

News Max,"Chinese Hackers Who Targeted Trump, Vance Also Took Aim at Dems","Chinese hackers believed to have targeted the cell phones of GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump and running mate J.D. Vance are known in the cybersecurity industry as Salt Typhoon, and they also took aim at Democrats, including people affiliated with Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, reported The New York Times.
It's not clear what data was obtained from any of the attempts, though investigators believe that the hackers obtained access to U.S. telecommunications infrastructure and major U.S. broadband and internet providers AT&T, Verizon, and Lumen.
The attacks have been described as ""brazen.""
""They're taunting us,"" one person involved in the response told The Wall Street Journal. ""What is the diplomatic messaging behind them doing it, them showing us that they're doing it, and continuing to do it after they are caught?"" The brazenness of the operation, the person said, marked a ""new frontier"" in how the Chinese government is leveraging cyber activity against the U.S.
Beijing has previously denied claims by the U.S. government and others that it has used hackers to break into foreign computer systems.
Earlier this year, U.S. law enforcement disrupted a major Chinese hacking group nicknamed ""Flax Typhoon,"" months after confronting Beijing about sweeping cyber espionage under a campaign named ""Volt Typhoon.""

News Max,Financial Times Poll: Trump Leads Harris on Economy,"Former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, leads his Democrat rival Kamala Harris on the U.S. economy, a Financial Times poll found Thursday.
The poll found 44% of registered voters said they trusted Trump more to handle the economy versus 43% for Harris, FT reported.
""The results suggest Harris' economic pitch has run out of momentum in the final stretch of an increasingly tight race for the White House,"" according to the FT analysis. ""The FT's poll tracker now shows the candidates in a virtual dead heat in the swing states that will decide the election.""
The monthly tracking poll since February only briefly gave Harris a small lead on Trump after he was crowned the Democrat nominee. Trump had a large lead over Biden for all of those early months and Harris had led within the margin of error for her first two months in the nominee seat.
""If she is going to win the election, she is going to have to win it on other issues [than the economy],"" an expert told FT.
Trump leads on voters saying they were better off financially under him versus President Joe Biden and Harris, and they said they would be better off under Trump than Harris, according to the poll results.
The Financial Times and University of Michigan Ross School of Business polled 1,000 registered voters February-October and the margin of error was plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.

News Max,Ga. Court Rejects GOP Bid to Quickly Reinstate Election Rules,"The Georgia Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected an attempt by national and state Republicans to immediately reinstate recently passed election rules that a judge had ruled were invalid.
Fulton County Superior Court Judge Thomas Cox last week ruled that the State Election Board didn’t have the authority to adopt the new rules, and declared them “illegal, unconstitutional and void.” The Republican National Committee and the Georgia Republican Party had appealed that ruling to Georgia’s highest court. They asked that it be handled in an expedited manner and for the rules to be reinstated while the appeal was pending.
The Supreme Court declined the request for expedited handling and declined to put Cox's order on hold. The court's order says that once the appeal is docketed it will “proceed in the ordinary course,” which means it will likely take months before there's a ruling.
The rules included three that have gotten a lot of attention. One would require three poll workers to count ballots — not votes — by hand once polls close. The other two had to do with the process to certify county election results.
The three-person Republican majority on the State Election Board, which was praised by former President Donald Trump during a rally in Atlanta in August, voted to adopt multiple rules in August and September over the objections of the board’s lone Democrat and the nonpartisan chair. There have been at least half a dozen lawsuits filed in response, each challenging one or more of those rules.
Given the tight timeframe with the November general election just weeks away, judges have acted quickly to set and hold hearings in those cases.
Democrats had celebrated Cox’s ruling. They had raised concerns that the rules could be used by allies of Trump to slow or deny certification or election results, or to cast doubt on results if the former president loses the presidential election to Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.
While some prominent Republicans in Georgia, including Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, have criticized the flurry of last-minute rules the State Election Board introduced, the state and national Republican parties have been supportive. They have said the rules promote transparency and accountability in the state’s elections.
Cox’s ruling came in a lawsuit filed by Eternal Vigilance Action, an organization founded and led by former state Rep. Scot Turner, a Republican. The suit argued that the State Election Board overstepped its authority in adopting the seven rules. In addition to invalidating the rules, he ordered the State Election Board to immediately inform all state and local election officials that the rules are void and not to be followed.
Reached by phone Tuesday, Turner said he was glad for the election workers, who will not have to be trained on new election rules with just two weeks to go before Election Day. Many county election officials had expressed concern over the tight timeline for implementing the rules, saying they risked causing confusion for poll workers and undermining public confidence in the election results.
“I hate fighting my friends,"" Turner said. ""It’s unfortunate that the Republican Party has apparently lost their affection for defending constitutional principles like separation of powers. But I’m undeterred and we will continue to fight.”
The Associated Press has reached out to the state and national Republican parties seeking comment on the Georgia Supreme Court order.
An earlier ruling from Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney in a separate case had already temporarily blocked the hand-count rule. McBurney blocked the rule while he considers the merits of that case, saying it was too close to the general election and that implementing it at this point would cause chaos.
Two other new rules that Cox invalidated were passed by the State Election Board in August and have to do with certification. One provides a definition of certification that includes requiring county officials to conduct a “reasonable inquiry” before certifying results, but it does not specify what that means. The other includes language allowing county election officials “to examine all election related documentation created during the conduct of elections.”
The other rules that Cox said are illegal and unconstitutional are ones that:
- Require someone delivering an absentee ballot in person to provide a signature and photo ID.
- Demand video surveillance and recording of ballot drop boxes after polls close during early voting.
- Expand the mandatory designated areas where partisan poll watchers can stand at tabulation centers.
- Require daily public updates of the number of votes cast during early voting.

News Max,House Report: Security Failures Led to Assassination Attempt at Trump Rally,"The assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump at a Pennsylvania rally in July was “preventable and should not have happened,” according to a bipartisan House panel that is investigating the shooting and what it calls the “stunning security failures” at the event.
The report from a House task force, released Monday, is just the latest look at the cascading and wide-ranging law enforcement failings that preceded the July 13 shooting at the Butler, Pennsylvania, rally where Trump was struck in the ear by gunfire. One rallygoer was killed in the shooting and two others were wounded.
Members of both the House and Senate have repeatedly questioned why the Secret Service, an agency tasked with protecting the country’s top leaders, didn’t do a better job communicating with local authorities during the campaign rally, particularly when it came to securing the building that was widely agreed to be a security threat but that ultimately was left so unprotected that gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks was able to climb up and shoot.
Lawmakers in their report focus on ""the fragmented lines of communication and unclear chains of command"" between Secret Service and Pennsylvania state and local police but place the majority of the blame on the Secret Service for the security breakdown.
“Federal, state, and local law enforcement officers could have engaged Thomas Matthew Crooks at several pivotal moments,” the report stated. Lawmakers added that throughout the afternoon, “as Crooks’s behavior became increasingly suspicious, fragmented lines of communication allowed Crooks to evade law enforcement” and climb onto the unsecured roof where he would eventually open fire.
“Put simply, the evidence obtained by the Task Force to date shows the tragic and shocking events of July 13 were preventable and should not have happened,” the report continued.
The preliminary findings are drawn from thousands of pages of documents, nearly two dozen transcribed interviews with state and local officials as well as a series of both classified and non-classified briefings from senior officials at the Secret Service and the FBI.
The report breaks little new ground, as the failed Secret Service response has been already documented by an independent commission, an interim Senate report as well as congressional testimony and news media investigations. The House report, like others before it, does not identify specific individuals who may be to blame.
But The Associated Press has previously reported that at least five Secret Service agents have been placed on modified duty. The director of the Secret Service at the time, Kimberly Cheatle, resigned shortly after the shooting, saying she took full responsibility for the lapse.
The task force — comprised of seven Republicans and six Democrats — showcased some of the report's findings during a public hearing last month. Lawmakers say they plan to issue a final report, including recommendations to avoid future assassination attempts against political candidates, by mid-December.
The task force has also begun investigating the second assassination attempt on Trump last month where a man with a rifle camped outside one of his golf courses in southern Florida.

News Max,Senate Dem Candidates Vastly Outraise GOP in Battlegrounds,"Democrat Senate candidates across the top 10 battleground states vastly outraised Senate Republicans last quarter, raising $203 million to the Republicans' $83 million, according to Politico.
The outlet reported that the GOP in the upper chamber had been warning for weeks that the collective haul of its candidates was likely to be surpassed by Democrat fundraising efforts, but the final numbers revealed that Senate Democrats raised nearly 2.5 times the amount Republicans did.
Between July 1 and Sept. 30, three battleground Democrats each raised more than $30 million and all but three Democrats in the top 10 battleground states outraised their GOP opponents by at least a 2:1 margin, according to the outlet.
Here's a look at the fundraising disparities in the top Senate races:
Arizona: Democrat Rep. Ruben Gallego pulled in $21.8 million, almost 2.5 times as much as Republican Kari Lake's nearly $9 million.
Florida: Former Democrat Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell raised $15.1 million in the last quarter, which is three times as much as the $4.9 million Republican Sen. Rick Scott brought in.
Maryland: Democrat Angela Alsobrooks raised $13.4 million, or four times as much as former Gov. Larry Hogan, who raked in $3.3 million for the state's open Senate seat.
Michigan: Democrat Rep. Elissa Slotkin outraised Republican Rep. Mike Rogers by 4:1, bringing in $18.2 million compared to her opponent's $4.5 million last quarter.
Montana: Vulnerable Democrat Sen. Jon Tester not only outraised his opponent, Republican Tim Sheehy, by more than three times, but also outraised his fellow Democrats by pulling in $32.2 million last quarter, versus Sheehy's $9.7 million.
Nebraska: Despite her unexpectedly tight reelection battle, Republican Sen. Deb Fischer only raised $1.2 million, while independent challenger Dan Osborn pulled in $3.3 million.
Nevada: Democrat Sen. Jacky Rosen came the closest to her GOP opponent's fundraising haul last quarter, raising $12.1 million to Sam Brown's $8.5 million.
Ohio: Incumbent Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown raised $30.7 million — nearly five times as much as GOP rival Bernie Moreno's $6.5 million.
Pennsylvania: Republican Dave McCormick, a former CEO of one of the world's largest hedge funds, raked in $7.6 million last quarter, which was less than half of Sen. Bob Casey's nearly $16 million haul.
Texas: While GOP Sen. Ted Cruz raised $17.2 million — more than any other vulnerable Republican — it wasn't enough to surpass Democrat Rep. Colin Allred, who totaled $30.3 million.
Wisconsin: Out of Eric Hovde's $11.6 million fundraising haul last quarter, $7 million came from funds he loaned himself. Democrat Sen. Tammy Baldwin brought in $13.6 million, however.

News Max,GOP Rips 'MAGA Democrats' for Invoking Trump in Campaigns,"Republicans are calling out endangered ""MAGA Democrats"" trying to get themselves reelected who continue to sidle up next to former President Donald Trump in their campaigns in the hopes of attracting undecided voters, the Washington Examiner reported.
Vulnerable Democrats from both chambers on Capitol Hill are spending millions in TV advertising, touting Trump policies they say they agree with to praising him for legislative pieces of their own that he signed during his first term.
National Republican Congressional Committee press secretary Will Reinert called them ""MAGA Democrats"" who are running ads ""better suited for a [Saturday Night Live] skit than a serious congressional campaign,"" he told the Examiner.
The list of Trump-embracing Democrats is extensive:
- Rep. Jared Golden, Maine
- Sen. Tammy Baldwin, Wisconsin
- Sen Jon Tester, Montana
- Sen. Bob Casey, Pennsylvania
- Sen. Sherrod Brown, Ohio
- Rep. Elissa Slotkin, Michigan
Casey recently launched an ad embracing Trump's tariffs and saying he ""bucked Biden to protect fracking.""
A Baldwin ad praised Trump for signing her ""Made in America"" bill. Slotkin began in August, running an ad touting Trump signing her law on drug prices.
Tester appealed to ""lifelong Republicans"" in an ad while Brown earlier this year touted a bill of his Trump signed to stop drugs at the border.
In Ohio on Monday, a union supporting Brown released an ad linking the Democrat to the other sitting senator from Ohio — vice presidential nominee JD Vance.
""Sen. Brown puts party politics aside and fights for our workers and our safety so Ohio doesn’t ever get railroaded again,"" says the ad, showing a side-by-side photo of Brown and Vance.
The Senate Republican fundraising arm blistered Democrats for voting to twice impeach/convict Trump and stonewalling his ""agenda at every turn"" only to latch onto his battleground popularity with the election one week away.
""Now that they can see the writing on the wall, they’re trying to rewrite history,"" National Republican Senatorial Committee spokesman Philip Letsou told the Examiner in a statement. ""These Democrats have no respect for their own voters, and that’s why they feel so comfortable flagrantly lying.""

News Max,DHS Report: Migrant Program Risks National Security,"A migrant program created by President Joe Biden and endorsed by Vice President Kamala Harris that promotes a policy of catch and release is increasing national security risks, according to a report from an inspector general overseeing the Department of Homeland Security.
Customs and Border Protection is releasing noncitizens without identification into the United States, a report from the DHS Office of Inspector General said. The report revealed the Transportation Security Administration lets migrants get on airplanes, allowing them to fly freely throughout the United States.
CBP dealt with 2.4 million migrants on the southern border in fiscal year 2023 and released most of them into the country, according to the report. Federal law requires the migrants to be detained, though they have been released into the country under the Biden administration.
While their data is entered into a DHS database to check for past criminal convictions, it only has access to data from countries the U.S. has partnered with, the Washington Examiner reported.
The DHS has no access to criminal data from countries like Mexico, Haiti, Venezuela, Cuba, Nicaragua, and China, the Examiner reported.
There is nothing stopping migrants from giving customs agents a fake name, according to the report. DHS officials failed to respond when asked how many migrants had been released into the country without identification, saying they don't even collect that information.
""Immigration officers we interviewed acknowledged the risks of allowing noncitizens without ID into the country,"" the report noted.

News Max,Biden: 'Loser' Trump Running to 'Stay Out of Jail',"President Joe Biden, in a fiery speech in Philadelphia on Tuesday night, tore into former President Donald Trump, accusing him of running for the White House to avoid going to prison and calling him a “loser in everything he does.”
""It makes me angry,"" Biden told a crowded audience at the Philadelphia City Committee dinner Tuesday night, reports Mediaite. ""I say America's winning; we're the most powerful nation in the world, the most respected nation in the world … Trump says we're losers, but the only loser I know is Donald Trump.""
He also compared and defended his record against Trump's, telling the audience that ""more people are working today in America than any time since Trump left office; that's just a fact. 401Ks are strong, violent crime is down, murder is down, and fewer people are crossing the border. Trump calls that a hellscape? He talks about America being a failed nation; where the hell's he from?""
Biden went on to insult Trump's business record, calling him a ""failed businessman"" and asking how it was ""possible"" that his Atlantic City casinos had gone out of business.
""I thought the house always won. Pretty hard to do,"" said Biden.
Biden, who dropped out of his presidential race against Trump this summer amid questions about his own competency and age, went on to call him the ""only loser I know,"" and spoke out about the former president's legal problems.
""I want to watch that sentence,"" Biden said about Trump's upcoming sentencing hearing in New York City on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. ""I think he's running to stay out of jail.""
Biden further ridiculed Trump's behavior at a Pennsylvania town hall, where the event was cut short because of medical interruptions, leaving Trump instead to have his team play his music rally playlist songs for the crowd.
""He stood on the stage for 30 minutes and danced,"" said Biden. ""I'm serious. What's wrong with this guy?""
Biden further made the sign of the cross while lampooning Trump's promise to be a ""great protector of women, and claimed he was too afraid to face his challenger, Vice President Kamala Harris, in another debate.
“She beat Trump so badly in the debate he's scared to death to beat her again,"" said Biden, making yet another verbal gaffe, saying ""beat"" when in context he meant ""meet.""
""That's a fact. Tough guy, right? Tough guy. Because he knows he'd lose again. That's a fact. He is a loser.”
Newsmax has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment.

News Max,"Rep. Van Duyne to Newsmax: 'Stark Contrast' Between Trump, Harris With Storms","The reaction to the double hurricane blow that has hit the south in recent weeks shows the ""stark contrast of leadership"" between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, Rep. Beth Van Duyne said on Newsmax on Saturday.
""You see what President Trump is doing,"" the Texas Republican told Newsmax's ""Saturday Report."" ""He recognizes that people need help, that they are desperate right now and that's what he's providing.""
But President Joe Biden and Harris are ""doing nothing more than the blame game,"" Van Duyne said, including Biden telling Trump to ""get a life"" while responding to the former president's criticism of the storm response.
""This is all about a campaign to them, a campaign to try to win in November,"" she said. ""It's not about helping people. And if you want to talk about misinformation, you want to talk about disinformation, you want to talk about being un-American. How about the Biden-Harris administration, the pain that they have caused to the American people over the last four years, selling out your national security, your border security, and letting between 15 million to 20 million people in our country illegally?""
Harris has said that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis refused her phone calls, but he said that he never knew she had called. He also accused her of trying to ""inject herself"" into the storm recovery because of her presidential campaign, and commented that he's dealt with storms in Florida under both Trump and Biden, and ""neither of them ever politicized it.""
""I thought that was such a classic moment,"" Van Duyne said. ""'I'm busy with the storm. Don't suddenly try to politicize this because the election is right around the corner.'""
""Kamala, I've got a clue for you,"" she added. ""It's not about you. It's about the people who have been devastated by this storm. It's by your administration's lack of action and lack of forethought.""
But Harris, said Van Duyne, ""Wants to insert herself just to be able to get a photo op that she's on the phone with a governor who's actually doing something. It's pathetic. It's sad, but this is Kamala Harris.""
Van Duyne also Saturday spoke out about the differences in border policies between the Trump administration and the Biden-Harris White House.
""You look at Tom Homan, you look at Mark Morgan and what they were able to achieve,"" she said. ""They took that seriously. You had criminal aliens who were committing crimes in our country, and what they did was, they worked with local law enforcement to deport them. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement was a great partner to the city of Irving when I was mayor there, and they did a wonderful job.""
Americans, she added, are not ""stupid.""
""It just is so frustrating to see how Biden and Harris and the media are trying to portray this,"" said Van Duyne. ""Americans can see the increase in crime, they can see the increase in fentanyl in their communities. They're not stupid, but the Biden-Harris administration continues to treat them like they are.""

News Max,"Walz, Vance Clash on Middle East at Outset of Debate","Democrat Tim Walz questioned Republican Donald Trump's fitness for office at the outset of Tuesday's vice presidential debate, arguing that the former president is too unstable to be trusted at a time of crisis in the Middle East.
His Republican opponent for the country's No. 2 office, JD Vance, responded by asserting that Trump had made the world more secure during his term in office.
Amid Israel's ongoing assault against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon and Iran's retaliatory missile strikes on Tuesday, the escalating Middle East conflict that began last October when the militant group Hamas attacked Israel was the debate's first topic, giving the two men a chance to outline their foreign policy credentials.
Asked whether he would support a preemptive strike against Iran by Israel, Vance suggested he would defer to Israel's judgment, while Walz did not directly answer the question.
Instead, Walz pivoted to criticizing Trump for nixing the Iran nuclear deal. The 2015 deal, which then-President Trump abandoned in 2018, had capped Iran's uranium enrichment at 3.67% purity and its stockpile of this material at 202.8 kg (447 pounds) - limits Tehran has since far exceeded.
""Iran is closer to a nuclear weapon because of Donald Trump's fickle leadership,"" he said.
Walz, 60, the liberal governor of Minnesota and a former high school teacher, and Vance, 40, a bestselling author and conservative firebrand U.S. senator from Ohio, have portrayed themselves as two sons of America's Midwestern heartland with deeply opposing views on the issues gripping the country.
The rivals were expected to clash early and often at the CBS Broadcast Center in New York, with each trying to land a lasting blow at the last remaining debate before the Nov. 5 presidential election between Trump and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.
Walz has called his Republican opponents ""weird,"" and Vance came under fire for past comments disparaging some Democrats as ""childless cat ladies.""
Harris and Trump were expected to watch the debate, which began at 9 p.m. (0100 GMT on Wednesday), and Trump said he would offer a play-by-play commentary of the event on social media.
Harris was widely viewed as the winner of her sole debate with Trump on Sept. 10 in Philadelphia, which was watched by an estimated 67 million people.
That square-off did little to change the trajectory of an extremely close election battle. While Harris has edged ahead in national polls, most surveys show voters remain fairly evenly divided in the seven states that will decide the November election.
Political analysts say vice presidential debates can be fiery but generally do not alter the outcome of an election. That said, even a slight shift in public opinion could prove decisive with the race on a razor's edge five weeks before Election Day.
The main takeaway from the last V.P. debate, the 2020 encounter between then-Senator Harris and then-Vice President Mike Pence, was a fly that landed on Pence's head unbeknownst to Pence himself.
With no more debates planned, the stand-off allows Walz and Vance to make closing arguments on behalf of their campaigns - just as early voting ramps up across the country.
MUD-SLINGING
Walz, who has sought to cultivate a homespun image as a former high school football coach, is expected to get Vance to defend his 2021 comments criticizing Harris and other Democrats as ""a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives.""
Walz is also likely to go after Vance for spreading a fictional story of Haitian immigrants eating household pets in Springfield, Ohio, a false claim that Trump has repeated and that local officials say has drawn bomb threats.
The Democrat will seek to introduce himself to U.S. voters who may not be familiar with him, while aiming to keep the conversation focused on Harris' agenda, said a Walz adviser who asked to remain anonymous to discuss strategy.
Trump advisers said Vance would try to force Walz to defend the Biden-Harris administration's policies on immigration and the economy, as well his own handling of the riots in Minneapolis in 2020 after the death of George Floyd, a Black man, at the hands of a white policeman.
Vance will also bring up questions about Walz's military service, said Tom Behrends, a retired command sergeant major who joined a Trump campaign call about the debate.
Republicans have accused Walz of exaggerating his final rank in the Army National Guard, where he served for 24 years. Walz has in the past described himself as a retired command sergeant major, one of the highest non-commissioned officer positions in the Army.
While he achieved that rank, he did not meet the requirements to retire with that title.
The Harris campaign says also Walz ""misspoke"" in 2018 during his gubernatorial campaign in Minnesota when he referred to ""weapons of war, that I carried in war."" Walz was never deployed to a war zone.
Vance is a former Marine who served as a military journalist. He was deployed to Iraq but never saw combat.
Earlier on Tuesday, Minnesota Public Radio reported that Walz was not in China during the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown as he has previously claimed but traveled there months later, another misstatement likely to draw Vance's fire.
Despite Vance's having written ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" a popular 2016 memoir, U.S. voters have a negative view of him, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows, with 51% of registered voters saying they view him unfavorably, compared with 39% who view him favorably. Meanwhile Walz was viewed favorably by 44% of registered voters, with 43% reporting an unfavorable view in the Sept. 20-23 poll.

News Max,Trump: Not Tired but Exhilarated; Killing Harris in Polls,"Facing criticism from Vice President Kamala Harris for not releasing his health records, former President Donald Trump told reporters Friday he has had no ill effects from the toll of an arduous campaign trail because ""we're killing"" his Democrat rival in the polls.
""Wow, that's a lot of press,"" Trump said as he departed his plane at Detroit Metropolitan Airport. The GOP nominee was to attend a roundtable in Auburn Hills, Michigan, before a rally Friday night in Detroit. His press gaggle aired on Newsmax.
""I'm not even tired,"" said Trump, 78. ""I'm really exhilarated. You know why? We're killing her in the polls because the American people don't want her.""
A reporter asked Trump whether he would release his health records, and he pointed to records that have been made public over the past four years.
""We've done five exams over the last four years,"" he said. ""You've got them all. Obviously, I'm in the middle of a very big and very contentious fight. We're leading. I've given my health exams. I've also done cognitive tests twice, and I've aced them, meaning a perfect score.
""I want to see [Harris] do a cognitive test because she couldn't ace, because she wasn't born smart.""

News Max,Trump Warns of Black Voters' Decline Amid Illegal Immigrant Crisis,"Former President Donald Trump on Truth Social Wednesday said Black communities face political marginalization due to the influx of illegal immigrants permitted by the Biden-Harris administration.
Trump warned that Black Americans could lose political power if Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party remain in office.
""Kamala's support is collapsing with Black voters. Inflation is hell. Worse, their cities are being used as illegal alien dumping grounds. If Kamala gets 4 more years, the Black Community loses its political power forever because their neighborhoods will all be majority migrant,"" Trump posted on Truth Social Wednesday.
Trump's statement follows a broader narrative that has emerged in conservative circles, highlighting the challenges Black Americans face in competing with migrants for jobs, housing, and public services.
On Monday, Harris, in contrast, announced a plan to bolster economic opportunities for Black men. Her efforts aimed to energize a key Democratic voting bloc amid reports of dwindling enthusiasm, especially among Black voters, Newsmax reported.
The National Review recognized these concerns, detailing frustrations in inner-city communities over the growing presence of illegal immigrants. The publication reported that American citizens, particularly those in predominantly Black neighborhoods, feel increasingly sidelined as their needs are overshadowed by the resources allocated to illegal immigrants.
National Review noted that Black workers, particularly men, have long struggled against the influx of undocumented laborers in low-skilled job markets. According to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, hearings over the past two decades indicated that illegal immigration had a measurable and sometimes dramatic impact on Black employment and wages.
As far back as 1960, the competition led to a significant decline in relative employment rates for Black males in low-skill sectors — up to 7% — while wages dropped by 9%. This economic strain was also linked to an increase in incarceration rates for Black men, exacerbating social and economic challenges.
The surge in illegal immigration has further strained public resources. Steven Camarota of the Center for Immigration Studies testified before Congress that nearly 60% of households led by illegal immigrants access public benefits, costing taxpayers an estimated $42 billion annually. Public schools, in particular, face significant financial burdens, with $69 billion spent yearly on the roughly 4 million children of illegal immigrants.
Historically, Democrats have enjoyed overwhelming support from this demographic, with nearly 89% of Black voters supporting the party in the past two election cycles. However, polling suggests that Trump is gaining ground, with reports indicating he could secure over 20% of the Black vote in the upcoming election.
Some analysts warn that as illegal immigrants continue to flood into the country, they may not only compete with Black workers but also eventually replace them as the most reliable Democratic voting bloc.

News Max,Jason Miller to Newsmax: Trump Amplified Dems' True 'Garbage' Feelings,"Donald Trump wearing a safety vest at his Wisconsin rally put the focus on how Vice President Kamala Harris and many Democrats ""truly feel"" about the former president's supporters, Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller told Newsmax on Thursday.
Trump showed up at a rally in Green Bay on Wednesday still wearing an orange-and-yellow safety vest while sitting in a garbage truck and highlighted President Joe Biden's remark about the former president's supporters being ""garbage.""
""What this did was this put the focus in visual terms back on Kamala Harris, back on Joe Biden for the way that they've been treating not just President Trump but millions, tens of millions, of Americans all around the country who they continually have been hitting on with these horrific attacks over the past couple of weeks, calling President Trump supporters everything from Nazis to fascists to dictators to now, unfortunately, garbage,"" Miller told ""Wake Up America"" host Sharla McBride.
Miller added that Biden referring to Trump supporters as being ""garbage"" during a video call on Tuesday was not an ""intentional"" act in the final days before the general election.
""I think it's how they truly feel,"" Miller said. ""And so to them, this wasn't that big of a deal. Of course, they're going to call President Trump's supporters garbage. And so when President Trump put on that vest, got in the truck and then kept even the vest on when he was up on stage, it was that reminder. This is what Kamala Harris and Joe Biden think about you.""
McBride asked Miller whether Biden's comment would ""sink"" Harris' hopes of winning the White House.
""I think it was probably sunk even before Joe Biden made his unfortunate comments,"" Miller said. ""But you notice that Kamala Harris did not come out and rebuke what Joe Biden had to say. And that's because this is how the National Democratic Party thinks.""
After pointing out that Politico reported the Republican candidate won the day Wednesday in a battle of the presidential campaigns, McBride asked Miller how Trump will try to continue his momentum.
""Well, we have more in store,"" Miller said. ""Even today, President Trump will be in Albuquerque, New Mexico, which is usually a blue state. But we're seeing it very close in our polling. I think it's a state that we can pull off.
""The president will also be in Las Vegas and then in Phoenix later this evening. And so it's a jam-packed day out west. And then tomorrow President Trump will be in Michigan and in Wisconsin looking to win the Sun Belt, looking to win the Rust Belt. But I tell you, if you thought last night was good, we have some other things that are coming between now and Election Day. The foot is on the pedal.""

News Max,Councilwoman to Newsmax: Excited Over New York Trump Rally,"Republican New York City Councilwoman Vickie Paladino told Newsmax on Monday that it's ""very exciting"" that GOP voters in that Democrat stronghold will get to see former President Donald Trump when he comes to Madison Square Garden in less than two weeks.
""I say go, Trump go!"" Paladino said during an appearance on Newsmax's ""Wake Up America."" ""That's what I say. I think it's excellent. I think it gives everybody an opportunity here in what they consider a blue state, which we are a blue state, but it gives us other people the opportunity to go see Trump, and he will sell out the Garden. This is very exciting!""
When asked if she thinks Trump should be spending his time before the election focusing on the battleground states instead of reliably blue ones, Paladino said the outcome will be be decided by a slim vote margin.
""I think he's divvying up his time as he sees fit, because I think we're looking at it as this is an open-book election,"" she said. ""I mean, this is going to be balanced on a certain couple of hundred votes, some people say a couple of thousand votes. It's tight.
""He has to bring up the rest of the ticket as well. We got Congress, we got Senate, we've got other very important races running in these blue states that should be won.""
The issue of illegal immigration is ""where the rubber hits the road,"" the councilwoman said, referring to the hundreds of thousands of migrants who have traveled to New York City during the Biden-Harris administration.
""This is where the people actually see, because we, as New Yorkers, are living through it every single day,"" Paladino said. ""Just another 700 came in last week.
""We cannot forget that this crisis, this illegal invasion that we are suffering and paying for, the taxpayers of New York are paying for, is brought to you by [Vice President and Democrat presidential nominee Kamala] Harris. I'm dropping [President Joe] Biden.
""This is brought to us by Harris. She is responsible. She carries the monkey on her back. We don't want it. It's time for it to end.""
She said the 150 hotel rooms being used to house illegal aliens in New York City could have been used by the victims of Hurricane Helene, which devastated several states in the Southeast, especially western North Carolina, in late September.
""Wouldn't it be nice to have been able to offer Asheville, North Carolina, the opportunity to come up here and give them the hotel rooms?"" Paladino said. ""Wouldn't that be a great idea while they rebuild Asheville?""

News Max,New Jersey GOP Rep. Tom Kean Should Keep House Seat,"He comes from a legendary New Jersey family, but his Congressional seat was seen at risk.
But the latest data suggests that Republican Rep. Tom Kean Jr. will keep his New Jersey 7th Congressional District seat.
In 2022, Kean captured the seat by just over 9,000 votes out of more than 300,000 cast.
In unseating Democrat Rep. Tom Malinowski, Kean became one of 16 Republicans to represent a U.S. House district carried by Joe Biden in 2020.
His father, Tom Kean, had served for two terms as the Garden State's popular governor in the 1980s.
Tom Kean Jr. has positioned himself as a moderate-to-conservative presence and the approach is working in the 7th District.
A Monmouth University Polling Institute survey of likely voters showed Kean beating Democrat challenger Sue Altman, 46% to 44%.
With Malinowski and others nixing a bid for Congress, Altman — a community activist and former teacher — emerged as a candidate.
Kean has hit her hard for a tweet of hers four years ago suggesting she supported the ""defund the police"" movement.
Altman said she now regrets the tweet, insisting she does not support defunding the police.
""And Tom has been endorsed by some of the building trades unions,"" Roger Bodman, who served as commissioner of labor under the elder Kean, told Newsmax. ""I may be biased, but the Kean name still carries a lot of respect around here.""

News Max,Phila. Sues to Stop Musk PAC's $1M Voter Lottery,"The Philadelphia District Attorney's Office on Monday filed a lawsuit seeking to stop a political action committee controlled by billionaire Elon Musk from awarding $1 million to registered U.S. voters in battleground states ahead of the Nov. 5 election.
The complaint brought by the top prosecutor in the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas, called the giveaway by Musk's America PAC, which backs Republican former President Donald Trump, an ""illegal lottery"" that enticed Pennsylvania residents to share personal data.
Lawrence Krasner, the top prosecutor in Pennsylvania's largest city, which is a Democrat stronghold, alleged the giveaways violated state consumer protection laws.
""If not enjoined, their lottery scheme will irreparably harm Philadelphians – and others in Pennsylvanians – and tarnish the public's right to a free and fair election,"" the complaint read.
In response to a request for comment, an America PAC spokesperson sent a link to the group's latest post on X, which was published after news of the lawsuit.
The post identified a Michigan resident who received the $1 million prize, and said additional awards would be handed out every day until the election.
Pennsylvania is one of seven battleground states where the presidential election between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, is set to be decided. Whichever candidate wins the state will receive its 19 electoral votes out of a total of 270 needed to win.
The Justice Department has sent a letter to America PAC warning that the billionaire Tesla chief executive's giveaways for registered voters who sign his free-speech and gun-rights petition may violate federal law, CNN reported last week.
Legal experts consulted by Reuters last week were divided on whether the giveaway violates federal laws that make it a crime to pay or offer to pay a person to register to vote.
The Trump campaign is broadly reliant on outside groups for canvassing voters, meaning the super PAC founded by Musk — the world's richest man — plays an outsized role in what is expected to be a razor-thin election.

News Max,Pollster Nate Silver: 'My Gut Says Donald Trump',"Pollster Nate Silver said he's finding the close numbers in this year's presidential race ""unsatisfying,"" but his ""gut"" prediction is that former President Donald Trump will take the 2024 win over Vice President Kamala Harris.
Urgent: Become an Owner of Newsmax, Find Out About IPO Plan, See More Here
""My gut says Donald Trump. And my guess is that it is true for many anxious Democrats,"" Silver, creator of the FiveThirtyEight polling engine, wrote in an opinion piece for The New York Times on Wednesday.
However, Silver warned that voters shouldn't ""put any value whatsoever on anyone's gut — including mine,"" but should resign themselves that the ""50-50 forecast"" for Harris and Trump ""really does mean 50-50.""
He went on to write that Harris or Trump can still defeat their polling numbers to bring home a win.
With Trump, Silver said that those who think he'll beat the polls use the notion of ""shy Trump voters,"" with the premise that many people are being polled who support Trump, but fear admitting that they do out of the potential of facing social stigma.
""There's not much evidence for the shy-voter theory — nor has there been any persistent tendency in elections worldwide for right-wing parties to outperform their polls,"" Silver said.
He added that there is a ""certain snobbery"" in the theory, as most Trump supporters are proud to say they back him, and there is less stigma now about voting for him.
It's more likely that Trump has the problem of ""nonresponsive bias,"" in which pollsters are not reaching enough of his supporters.
However, Democrats no longer have the edge in party identification, and Harris may also need to be concerned about a ""Hillary effect,"" because when Hillary Clinton ran for office, undecided voters tilted against her rather than admit they would vote for a woman.
But Harris could also be underestimated in the polls, said Silver.
""On average, polls miss by three or four points,"" he said, noting that if the numbers swing her way, Harris will win by the popular vote and the Electoral College with the largest margin since President Barack Obama's win in 2008.
But still, pollsters who are too afraid of ""missing low"" on Trump again, like in the 2020 election, could either consciously or unconsciously make assumptions favoring him, said Silver.
Either way, Silver said that while the numbers are close now, ""Don't be surprised if a relatively decisive win for one of the candidates is in the cards — or if there are bigger shifts from 2020 than most people's guts might tell them.""
That's because even a small polling error like the ones in 2016 or 2020 could result in a ""comfortable"" Electoral College win for either candidate.
""According to my model, there's about a 60 percent chance that one candidate will sweep at least six of seven battleground states,"" Silver wrote.

News Max,Poll: Jewish Support for Democrats Lowest in 40 Years,"Jewish support for the Democrat Party has dipped to its lowest percentage in 40 years according to a poll released Friday from the Manhattan Institute.
Vice President Kamala Harris currently enjoys the support of 67% of Jewish voters compared to 31% who favor former President Donald Trump. While Harris will undoubtably capture the majority of Jewish votes this election cycle, the figure represents a steep drop since former President Bill Clinton captured 80% of the Jewish vote in 1992 and the lowest since the Ronald Reagan era.
Following the Oct. 7 massacre by Hamas on Jewish civilians in Israel, many American Jews witnessed what they felt was a mixed response from the White House coupled with rampant antisemitism on college campuses. Although Jewish voters tend to favor Democrats on most issues, the Biden Administration’s fluctuating support for Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has forced some American Jews to rethink they’re allegiance with Democrats. Support of Israel among Jewish voters is at 86% while 62% say they are concerned about antisemitism within the Democratic Party.
Jesse Arm, chief of staff at the Manhattan Institute, said the findings show Jewish voters view “security, Israel, and antisemitism” as weak points for Harris compared to Trump. “This is evidenced by the fact that Jews are almost universally supportive of Israel - a mere 5% of Jewish voters say they are not supporters of the Jewish state,” Arm said.
Harris’ primary support from withing the Jewish community comes from the Reform, unaffiliated, or nondenominational Jews. The survey noted that a third of Jewish voters say abortion is the most important campaign issue in 2024, compared to most Americans who view the economy as their primary concern.
The Manhattan Institute polled surveyed 658 registered Jewish voters across the U.S. between October 5-9 and carries a margin of error of +/- 3.8%.

News Max,Ga. Official Appeals Election Certification Ruling,"Julie Adams, a member of the Fulton County Board of Registration and Elections in Georgia, appealed a state judge's ruling stating that local election officials don't have an option when it comes to certifying the election results in November, reported The Hill.
Judge Robert C.I. McBurney made the ruling Oct. 15 in response to Adams' lawsuit against Nadine Williams, director of the Fulton County Board of Elections.
Adams refused to certify the county's results from the primary elections on May 21 after Williams didn't allow her to access election data to confirm the accuracy of the returns.
She asked the court to define the certification duties of her job.
McBurney ruled that Georgia law requires officials like her to certify without delay.
""If election superintendents were, as Plaintiff urges, free to play investigator, prosecutor, jury, and judge and so — because of a unilateral determination of error or fraud — refuse to certify election results, Georgia voters would be silenced,"" McBurney wrote. ""Our Constitution and our Election Code do not allow for that to happen.""
Mike Berry, the executive director for the center for litigation at the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute, and Adams' lawyer, recently told CNN that his client ""should have access to the data to be able to do her job, and for people to take that and try to extrapolate conspiracy theories about what might happen in November I think is misplaced and overblown.""

News Max,Israel Preps Iran Strike as US Election Looms,"Israel is ready to launch its counterstrike against Iran in response to Tehran's recent missile barrage against the Jewish state, and it could happen before the Nov. 5 presidential election, CNN reported.
While Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is aware of the upcoming election and the potential political ramifications, the election is not a factor in the timing of the strike, CNN said.
Netanyahu has promised Israel's response will focus solely on military targets, avoiding Iran's oil refineries or nuclear facilities. The Biden-Harris administration has been outspoken in its opposition to striking such sites, fearing it could escalate tensions into a wider regional conflict.
Additionally, a strike on oil facilities could send U.S. gas prices skyrocketing just before Election Day, which could potentially hurt Vice President Kamala Harris.
Iran fired about 180 missiles into Israel on Oct. 1, targeting Tel Aviv and other populated areas. Most of the missiles were intercepted, but one Palestinian man was killed. Iran has said the attack was retaliation for Israel's recent assassinations of several top terror leaders, including Hezbollah founder Hassan Nasrallah.
U.S. this week sent Israel its advanced U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense battery, as well as additional troops to the region, despite warnings from Iran.
Meantime, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin earlier this week sent a letter to the Israeli government warning that Israel's failure to deliver more humanitarian aid to Gaza could prompt U.S. to cut off military assistance. However, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris did not sign the letter, nor have they publicly threatened to cut off aid.

News Max,"Trump Promises to 'Frack, Frack, Frack' If He Wins","Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday held a rally in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the birthplace of President Joe Biden, where he focused on his plans to revive U.S. energy production, bring jobs back to the commonwealth, and lower taxes if he is reelected.
Trump said the policies of the Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have contributed to America's energy woes and that those woes would continue if Harris is elected in November.
On fracking, Trump said, ""On day one, I will tell Pennsylvania energy workers to frack, frack, frack and drill, drill, drill. Drill, baby, drill.
""We're going to frack, frack, frack. We will have energy independence and energy dominance as we did just four short years ago. We were energy independent four years ago. Can you believe now we get our energy from Venezuela? What's that all about?
Trump said Harris will ""never, ever let you frack. You're not going to frack if she won. You're not going to frack. She's been against it her whole life.""
Harris said during her 2020 campaign for president that she opposed fracking. But lately, including during the debate, Harris said she would not ban the practice if she is elected.
Trump added, ""Even now, Kamala's Green New Deal mandates are regulations that were — are — impossible, impossible to enforce. As an example, forcing power plants to shut down. All across the country, more than 50 plants have recently been closed. So she took office and they are not going to be replaced.
""If Kamala is reelected, your costs will go up and your lights will go out,"" he said. ""That's what's going to happen.""
Trump said if he wins, he will work to keep energy costs down.
""Today, I make Pennsylvania this promise,"" he said. ""I will stop the energy price hikes. I will stop the plant closures immediately, and we will restart the plants that Kamala has very cruelly closed. I mean, you know, they don't know they have thousands of jobs involved, people that have worked there for 25 years or longer.
""And we're not going to let it happen. I will terminate the Green New scam immediately,"" he said, referring to the Green New Deal. Harris supported the original Green New Deal.
Trump said, ""I will end the destruction of our electrical grid. They are destroying our grid. It's already in bad shape, I'll tell you right now. But they are destroying. Isn't it amazing? We don't have any electricity, but they want to go all electric cars. Think of that.""

News Max,2 Va. Officials Sue State on Ballot Machines,"Two Republican election officials said in a recent lawsuit that they will not certify the results of the Nov. 5 election in a rural Virginia city unless the ballots are hand-counted, perpetuating a false notion that machines tallying the votes can be manipulated.
The suit against the Virginia Department of Elections and Elections Board was filed earlier this month in Waynesboro, Virginia, by the city's election board chair Curtis Lilly and vice chair Scott Mares. In the complaint, Lilly and Mares argued that election officials do not have access to the votes tallied by machines, which they allege prevents them from verifying ""the results of the voting machine's secret canvass.""
The counting system, Lilly and Mares argued, violates a provision of the state Constitution that stipulates such machines must be in public view.
""As Electoral Board members are prohibited from hand-counting ballots, we cannot ensure that the vote tally produced by the voting machines matches the votes memorialized on the case paper ballots,"" Mares said in an affidavit sent to The Associated Press.
The electoral board members filed the lawsuit in Waynesboro District Court. The Office of the Attorney General, which is defending the Department of Elections and State Board of Elections, declined to comment on pending litigation.
The lawsuit comes as election conspiracy theorists across the U.S. are moving to support hand-counted ballots, nearly four years after former President Donald Trump falsely claimed the past election was stolen from him. But research shows that hand-counting is more prone to error, costlier and likely to delay results.
In Virginia, voters cast paper ballots that are subsequently counted by machine. In August, Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin filed an executive order that mandated the machines are tested before every election and never connected to the internet. In that same order, Youngkin required officials to make daily updates to voter lists to remove ineligible voters, a move that the U.S. Justice Department alleged in a recent suit violated federal law.
""The Virginia model for Election Security works,"" Youngkin said in a statement in August. ""This isn't a Democrat or Republican issue, it's an American and Virginian issue.""

News Max,Trump Plans Rally in 'Reeling' New York City,"Former President Donald Trump will hold a rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City on Oct. 27 at 5 p.m., his campaign announced Monday.
""New York is reeling from the harmful effects of the dangerously liberal policies championed by Kamala Harris and Democrats like Eric Adams,"" the Trump campaign said in a press release.
""Since Kamala took office, the average New York household has been forced to spend an additional $28,537, including $4,282 more on food, $4,918 more on shelter, $3,992 more on energy, and $8,912 more on transportation. These disastrous economic policies are draining the bank accounts of hardworking New Yorkers.
""Additionally, thanks to Kamala's reckless open-border policies, over 210,000 migrants have flooded into New York City since the Spring of 2022, draining vital government resources and overwhelming the city.""
Trump's message to New Yorker is ""simple and built on his winning record: If you want to return to the strongest economy in over 60 years, rising wages, quality jobs, strong borders, and safer neighborhoods, then vote for the Trump-Vance ticket,"" the release said.

News Max,Dems' Registration Advantage in Swing States Declines,"Democrats are increasingly sounding the alarm as the party's voting registration has faced problems in various swing states with Election Day just a few weeks away, The Hill reported on Sunday.
One such example is Pennsylvania, where ""if you look at the changes from 2020 to 2024, Democrats are down about 300,000 voters and Republicans are up about 70,000,"" said Berwood Yost, director of the Center for Opinion Research at Franklin & Marshall College. ""Nonaffiliated independent voters are up about 83,000, 85,000 voters.""
He said, ""It's definitely a warning sign, but we knew this was going to be a close race. This is another example of that.""
Yost specified that declining Democratic voter registration is especially problematic for Vice President Kamala Harris in swing counties in Pennsylvania, such as Erie, North Hampton, and Bucks, and in rural counties, such as Fayette County, where she wants to keep former President Donald Trump's margin of victory as small as possible.
David Paleologos, the director of the Political Research Center at Suffolk University in Boston, added that Democrats had about a 666,000-person voter registration advantage over Republicans in Pennsylvania in 2020, which has shrunk to a 354,000-person advantage in 2024.
He also pointed out that in another key battleground state, North Carolina, the Democrats' voter registration advantage has decreased from plus-393,000 voters in 2020 to only about plus-130,000 voters in 2024.
Paleologos said that ""the general shift has been away from being registered as a Democrat over the last four years,"" explaining that ""it's been more of a decrease of registered Democrats"" than a surge in Republican voter registrations.
Although Democrat strategists in Pennsylvania and North Carolina concede that their party's voter registration advantage has declined in those two key states since Joe Biden won Pennsylvania and narrowly lost North Carolina in 2020, they explained that the shifting registration numbers are catching up to voting behavior, as registered Democrats who voted for Trump or others in the GOP have only recently come around to changing their party registration.
""What's happening is that some registered Democrats are changing parties to reflect how they've been voting for years. A 2020 Trump voter who changes his registration from Democrat to Republican in 2024 doesn't indicate much about how voting in Pennsylvania will change in 2024,"" said J.J. Balaban, a Democratic strategist based in Pennsylvania.
Paleologos added that the margins between the parties in voter registration have shifted in two other battleground states: Arizona and Nevada.
In Arizona, Republicans have doubled the voter registration advantage they had over Democrats in 2020, when Biden won the state.
""When you look at Arizona, which Biden won, ... Arizona had a net registration advantage for Republicans of 130,000, but that's doubled. Now the Republican registration advantage in Arizona is 259,000 [people],"" Paleologos said.
In Nevada, Paleologos said Democrats have always had their voter registration advantage narrow significantly, as the party had a net registration advantage of nearly 79,000 in 2020, which has since gone down to a net advantage of plus-29,000 registered voters.
Jon Ralston, CEO of The Nevada Independent, said the Democrat voter advantage in Nevada was about 5 points in 2020 and it now stands at just 1 point.

News Max,Trump Demands CBS Release Harris' 'Word Salad' Transcript,"The Trump presidential campaign on Tuesday called on CBS News to release the unedited transcript of Kamala Harris' interview with ""60 Minutes,"" which edited out the Democrat's ""epic word salad"" answer about Israel, the New York Post reported.
""60 Minutes"" on Sunday night teased a clip with Harris about the United States' lack of influence over ally Israel and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
This was Harris' answer:
""The work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region,"" Harris told ""60 Minutes"" host Bill Whitaker.
However, when the interview aired Monday night, Harris' response had been edited to this:
""We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.""
The Trump campaign wants answers.
""On Sunday, '60 Minutes' teased Kamala's highly anticipated sit-down interview with this epic word salad that received significant criticism on social media,"" Trump 2024 national press secretary Karoline Leavitt told the Post. ""During the full interview on Monday evening, the word salad was deceptively edited to lessen Kamala's idiotic response.""
Leavitt wants to know what else ""60 Minutes"" chose ""not to air.""
""The American people deserve the full, unedited transcript from Kamala's sit-down interview,"" Leavitt added. ""We call upon '60 Minutes' and CBS to release it. What do they, and Kamala, have to hide?""

News Max,Rasmussen Poll: 49 Percent Say Election Officials Cheated,"Nearly half of U.S. voters believe election officials have been involved in cheating, according to a Rasmussen Reports survey released Thursday.
The survey of 1,854 likely voters was conducted from Oct. 27-29 and has a margin of error of +/- 2 percentage points.
When asked whether there are ""election workers and officials who have enabled fraud in elections,"" 49% said yes, 27% said no, and 24% said they were not sure.
By political party, 62% of Republicans, 38% of Democrats and 47% of unaffiliated voters said there are election workers and officials who have enabled fraud in elections.
More men (54%) than women (44%) said election workers and officials have enabled fraud.
The poll also showed that 43% said election officials found guilty of cheating should be prohibited from holding public office in the future, serve prison sentences, and pay fines.
Just 22% said withholding future public office from violators is a sufficient penalty, 19% said prison alone is an appropriate punishment and 9% favored fines. Another 2% said they would impose the death penalty on officials convicted of committing voter fraud.
Asked how likely is it ""officials who have enabled election cheating will be held criminally accountable,"" 48% said it is likely, including 26% who said it is ""very likely."" But 45% said they don’t think it’s likely, including 14% who said it’s ""not at all likely.""
More Democrats (62%) than Republicans (38%) and unaffiliated voters (41%) believe it's likely officials who have enabled election cheating will be held criminally accountable.
The survey found that Democrats are less likely than Republicans or unaffiliated voters to say officials found guilty of cheating in elections should be subjected to prohibition from holding public office, fines, and prison sentences.

News Max,Michigan Poll: Trump Leads Key Swing State by 1,"Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are neck and neck in Michigan with just 18 days to go, according to a new poll.
The poll from Michigan News Source and Mitchell Research and Communications found Trump and Harris tied at 47% in an eight-way race with minor candidates polled. In a two-way race, Trump leads Harris by 1%.
Mitchell Research polled 589 likely voters Oct. 14, and the poll results have a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
The poll found Trump leading with women, 48.7% to 47.3% while Harris leads with men, 48% to 47.8%, a marked change from other polling which generally found Harris leading with women and Trump leading with men.
Trump leads Harris 50% to 43% with voters ages 18 to 29, and 48% to 45% with people ages 30 to 44.
Trump leads 53% to 43% with white voters, while Harris leads 80% to 18% with Black voters. Harris leads with college graduates, 54% to 38%, while Trump leads 64% to 36% with those without a college degree.
The poll also showed Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., has a slim lead over former Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., in the race for the U.S. Senate, 47% to 43%.

News Max,Trump to Kick Off Final Week of Campaign with Madison Square Garden Rally,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump will headline a rally at New York's Madison Square Garden on Sunday, creating a high-profile spectacle aimed at generating media buzz in a state that he is likely to lose on Nov. 5.
U.S. billionaire Elon Musk, who is supporting Trump's reelection bid with his X social media platform and enormous wealth, will be among the featured speakers, the Trump campaign announced.
Trump, a New York celebrity for decades, will use the event at the iconic venue known for Knicks games and Billy Joel concerts to deliver his closing argument against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.
""We want to close it out with a beautiful bang,"" he said last week.
Polls show the rival candidates are neck and neck with just over a week until Election Day. More than 38 million votes have already been cast.
Trump has been seeking to tie Harris to the Biden administration's handling of immigration and the economy. Last week, Trump debuted a new attack line: ""She broke it, and I promise you I will fix it.""
Harris will kick off her own appeal to last-minute voters with a speech on Tuesday on the National Mall in Washington, where she will try to sharply draw a contrast between herself and Trump.
A Republican presidential candidate has not won the state of New York since Ronald Reagan was re-elected in 1984. Democratic President Joe Biden won the state by 23 percentage points in 2020, and a Siena College poll this week found Harris leading Trump by 19 points, 58% to 39%.
But Trump, who held a rally in Long Island, New York in September, has said he is making a play for the state.
'SHOW OF STRENGTH'
By staging the attention-grabbing event in the world's biggest media market, Trump could help boost Republican candidates in New York congressional races. The state has seven competitive seats that could help determine whether the party holds on to the U.S. House of Representatives next year.
It could also give Trump a boost in nearby northeastern Pennsylvania, a battleground state that has increasingly become home for New York commuters.
Trump's campaign said the event at the 19,500-seat arena, which can cost upwards of $1 million to rent, was sold out.
""This is an attempt by Trump to dominate the headlines in the final days of the election,"" said Republican strategist Ryan Williams. ""He has a flair for the dramatic. I think he wants to have a show of strength with a stadium full of people.""
A crowd of some 30,000 people attended Harris' rally with superstar singer Beyonce on Friday night in Houston.
Trump's 2016 presidential opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, has accused him of ""re-enacting"" a pro-Nazi rally that was held at the Garden in 1939 on the eve of World War Two. Trump’s critics have long accused him of empowering white supremacists through his dehumanizing and racist rhetoric.
Her comments drew a rebuke from Trump and Republican leaders.
""She said it's just like the 1930s. No, it's not,"" Trump said at a rally in Michigan on Friday. ""This is called Make America Great Again, that's all this is.""
Republicans Mike Johnson, the speaker of the House, and Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, issued a joint statement saying Clinton's rhetoric “risks inviting yet another would-be assassin” to target Trump and “endangers” American lives.
Other speakers at the Sunday event include Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the former independent presidential candidate who dropped out of the race and backed Trump, conservative commentator Tucker Carlson, and Howard Lutnick, who is chairman and CEO of the financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald and co-chair of the Trump White House transition team.
Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX and owner of X, has traveled across Pennsylvania on Trump's behalf and has given $119 million to his pro-Trump spending group that is helping turn out voters in the most closely contested states.
The group, America PAC, is also giving away $1 million per day to randomly selected registered voters in battleground states who sign its online petition. The Justice Department has sent a letter to America PAC warning that the giveaways may violate federal law, CNN reported.

News Max,Butler Rally Victims: Secret Service Was Negligent,"Two men critically wounded during former President Donald Trump's July campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, told NBC News the U.S. Secret Service was negligent in its security duties.
Trump was grazed in the ear by a would-be assassin's bullet and a spectator was killed at the rally on July 13.
Jim Copenhaver, 74 and David Dutch, 57, who were shot by the sniper, told NBC News that the Secret Service and law enforcement officials were negligent in protecting Trump and innocent civilians.
""I believe there was 100% negligence on the Secret Service, probably everybody involved in setting that security, down to inter-department communications,"" said Dutch, who was shot in the liver. ""The negligence was vast. It was terrible.""
""I'm sure there was negligence. It wouldn't have happened, had it been secure,"" said Copenhaver, who was shot in the arm and abdomen.
Asked if the Secret Service failed him and the former president, Dutch replied: ""Big time.""
""The whole security setup was poor,"" he added.
Copenhaver and Dutch plan to sue over the security failures, according to their attorneys.
A bipartisan Senate report last month said multiple Secret Service failures before the rally were ""foreseeable, preventable, and directly related to the events resulting in the assassination attempt that day.""
A House task force is investigating the attempted assassination at Butler. During the task force's first hearing on Sept. 27, officials said a lack of preparation and communication from the Secret Service before the rally contributed to the security failures.
Dutch told NBC News he was ""angry"" at the security failures and the fact that someone ""tried to shoot the president, shot into a defenseless crowd.""
""I was just angry that the whole situation even happened,"" he told NBC News. ""It should have never happened.""
Dutch and Copenhaver each are dealing with lingering effects from the shooting.
Copenhaver said must walk with a cane and he still gets occasional pain in his abdomen. He also has lost 30 pounds.
Dutch said he has lost 25 pounds and can't drive or lift more than 10 pounds.
""It's a struggle every day,"" Dutch told NBC News.
Corey Comperatore, 50, was killed in the shooting while shielding his family.

News Max,Hurricanes Force Changes to Florida's Election Procedures,"With Florida still recovering from Hurricane Helene, some state and local officials are bracing for more disruptions from Milton that could affect how people vote in the general election.
Gov. Ron DeSantis already has granted counties hardest hit by Helene greater flexibility in distributing mail-in ballots and changing polling sites for in-person voting. Further changes might be necessary after Hurricane Milton.
Florida has a long history of hurricanes — and of making election accommodations because of them.
This year, some voter advocacy groups are pushing for a judge to reopen Florida's voter registration period, arguing that people may have missed their chance to register because they were preoccupied by hurricanes.
Hurricane Helene made landfall in northern Florida on Sept. 26 — the same day that local election officials could begin sending mail-in ballots to voters who requested them.
The hurricane forced thousands of people to flee their homes, some of which are no longer habitable. That means it's no longer possible for some voters to receive mail-in ballots at their homes. And that list is likely to grow following Hurricane Milton.
“It’s possible mail ballots could get lost, either getting to the voter or being returned by the voter. They could be damaged, especially if there are high winds and waters,"" said David Becker, executive director of The Center for Election Innovation and Research.
In such cases, voters can request a replacement mailed ballot or still vote in person.
Helene also damaged voting infrastructure, such as polling locations, in at least 13 counties, mainly along where Florida's panhandle meets its peninsula. Dozens of polling sites were damaged in Pinellas County, near Tampa Bay, which could take another hit from Milton, said Travis Hart, president of the Florida Supervisors of Elections organization.
DeSantis issued an executive order granting flexibility for election officials in those 13 hard-hit counties to alter their procedures because of Helene.
The order allows early voting and Election Day polling places to be changed or consolidated. It also makes it easier for residents to request that mail-in ballots be sent to a different address than where they are registered to vote. And it allows ballots to be sent in forwardable envelopes so that they can reach voters in their new locations.
The gubernatorial order also makes accommodations to try to avoid a potential shortage of poll workers by waiving a training requirement for experienced workers and allowing poll workers to be brought in from other counties.
“Our poll workers, they are very dedicated people, and I know that when it comes to elections, they will show up — unless there’s just something that’s out of their hands that they can’t control,” Hart said.
In general, it's good to make only those election changes that are most necessary, so as to limit confusion for voters, Becker said.
“When voters really want to vote — and by all indications, voters really want to vote in this election — they find a way,” he said.
Monday was the deadline for Florida residents to register to vote in next month's election.
A federal judge denied a request to reopen voter registration after hearing arguments Wednesday. The plaintiffs are considering whether to appeal. The lawsuit brought by the Florida chapters of the League of Women Voters and NAACP contends that thousands of people may have missed the registration deadline because they were recovering from Helene or preparing to evacuate from Milton.
Voting preparations are like Christmas shopping, said Cecile Scoon, co-president of the League of Women Voters of Florida.
“You tend to wait for the last two to three weeks to buy the present,” Scoon said. “Voting is very similar. The interest skyrockets” as a deadline approaches.
The Florida Supervisors of Elections association did not request an extension of the voter registration period. Hart said “people had ample time” to register.
There's not much evidence to suggest that voter registration deadlines suppress participation in elections, Becker said. But reopening a voter registration period — even if justified — could fuel disinformation and false claims about an election from a losing candidate, he said.
This is not the first time Florida has had to make adjustments to election plans in counties hit by hurricanes.
After Hurricane Charley struck southwest Florida in August 2004, then-Gov. Jeb Bush allowed election officials in 10 counties to delay early voting, set up new polling places and extend the deadline to hire poll workers ahead of the state’s primary election.
In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew skirted Florida’s entire Atlantic Coast and forced many government offices to close just days before the deadline to register to vote in the presidential election. Democrats sued then-Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican, to extend the registration deadline. Scott refused, but a federal judge ordered the deadline extended by one day.
In October 2018, Scott allowed Gulf and Bay counties to make adjustments after Hurricane Michael caused widespread damage. Supervisors were allowed to forward mail-in ballots to temporary addresses and to relocate or combine polling places.

News Max,Splintered Dems Prep Differently Than '16 for Trump Win,"The pink pussycat hats. A Women's March that drew a half-million demonstrators to the nation's capital. Millions of other demonstrators nationwide.
It was all part of the Democrats' reaction to Donald Trump's victory over Hillary Clinton in 2016.
But this time could be different should the Republican former president prevail Nov. 5 over Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday. Trump is no longer an unknown entity and with polls so close, he has as good a chance of winning as losing, so the shock to the system of millions of Democrats will not be as intense.
More than a dozen influential progressives told the Journal they are dreading the prospect of Trump returning to power and are dismayed that half the country might see a different reality than they see.
Jim Hannon, a psychotherapist and liberal organizer in Massachusetts, counseled calm in an open letter last week, noting the strength of Harris' campaign while urging a broader perspective.
""Trump could win. So, panic then? No,"" he wrote. ""A Trump presidency would be awful but not the end of history.""
On a recent evening, the Journal reported, more than 200 joined a Zoom meeting titled Mass Training For Women's Safety Teams hosted by a Women's March veteran who noted its timing amid ""escalating political violence.""
Others are channeling their nerves into action by planning to attend Women's Marches scheduled in Washington, D.C., and beyond on Saturday. In Boston, they are joining parties where volunteers fill boxes with abortion kits to mail to women in red states with strict abortion limits.
""We feel like we're doing something,"" Erin Gately, a 47-year-old physician assistant told the Journal. After Trump won in 2016, she took to the streets to protest but said this time she would focus on tangible actions such as protecting abortion rights.
Danielle Deiseroth, 28, executive director of Data for Progress, a liberal research group, told the Journal she has been talking with leaders of other progressive nonprofits about how to push back if Trump is elected. She said she anticipates progressives will look to Democrat governors as political torchbearers and Democrat attorneys general to contest Trump initiatives.
Laurie Woodward García, a South Florida activist, founded People Power United during Trump's presidency to champion progressive causes, and, in her words, ""stand up to fascism,"" the Journal reported.
Her bimonthly online seminars, some scheduled for after the election, explore the consequences if Trump were to enact Project 2025, a conservative policy agenda created by the Heritage Foundation from which he has distanced himself. Each session has drawn about 500 viewers.
""We've got to be optimistic and fight like hell,"" she said.
That might be complicated by the uncertain trajectory of the Democratic Party, which would be at a generational crossroads with Barack Obama, the Clintons and President Biden all off the stage and no clear heir apparent should Harris lose.
""We'll be in rebuilding mode,"" South Carolina state Rep. Gilda Cobb-Hunter of Orangeburg, S.C., told the Journal.

News Max,Texas Man Hits Election Worker Who Said Remove Trump Hat: Police,"A Texas man who wore a hat supporting former President Donald Trump punched an election worker who told him that wearing items endorsing a candidate are prohibited at voting sites, a sheriff said Friday.
The election worker, identified as a 69-year-old man, was treated at the scene Thursday and returned to his election post at a San Antonio library on Friday, officials said. The suspect was arrested on felony charges of assaulting an elderly person and could face additional charges, Bexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar said.
The alleged assault happened at the end of the first week of early voting in Texas, where long lines have stretched outside some polling places.
Both the sheriff and county elections administrator urged voters to stay calm and patient during sometimes long waits to vote during what they described as a contentious election.
“Thankfully there was nothing life-threatening about what occurred, but it was still an ugly incident,” Salazar said.
The suspect, identified as Jesse Lutzenberger, remained in jail Friday evening, according to Bexar County records. Jail records did not list an attorney and a phone number for Lutzenberger's home could not immediately be found Friday.
Under Texas law, wearing clothing for or against a candidate inside a polling place is prohibited, as it's considered electioneering. Lutzenberger allegedly entered the polling location in a red “MAGA or TRUMP” baseball cap, according to an arrest affidavit.
After being told he had to remove his cap in the voting area, Lutzenberger did and proceeded to cast a ballot, according to Salazar. He then put the cap back on before leaving, followed by the clerk again telling him remove the hat while inside the building.
As the clerk escorted him out of the library, Lutzenberger allegedly threw an elbow or arm back toward the clerk and then turned to punch him in the face multiple times, according to Salazar.
The clerk was treated at the scene by emergency medical personnel, Bexar County Elections Administrator Jacque Callanen said.
Salazar said there have been “several” incidents of voters wearing prohibited clothing or caps into polling places, but they then removed them when the state law was explained to them.
“Nothing here is worth getting hurt for, going to jail for,"" he said.

News Max,Biden-Harris Fail to Deport 74 Percent of Criminal Aliens,"A new report from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, compiled by the Daily Mail, indicates that the Biden-Harris administration failed to deport 74% of criminal illegal migrants from the United States.
""Under President Joe Biden, and his hand-picked 'border czar,' Vice President Kamala Harris, we don't just have a crisis at our borders — we have one in the interior, as well,"" Homeland Security Chair Rep. Mark Green, R-Tenn., told the Mail.
Green added that under former GOP nominee Donald Trump, border crossings were down, and immigration enforcement was up. During the Trump administration, the aggregate number of deportations at the border was 32%. Under Biden and Harris, that figure is 3.5%.
""Biden and Harris have completely flipped that record on its head,"" Green continued. ""On their watch, encounters have hit historic, sustained highs, while removals have dropped through the floor.""
The ICE report states that there were more border encounters in 2023 alone than during the entire Trump administration.
Green surmised that ""Biden and Harris have utterly abandoned their oath to enforce the laws of this country — assuming they ever took that oath seriously to begin with. Meanwhile, innocent Americans continue to be victimized daily by this administration's dereliction of duty. Enough is enough.""

News Max,Rep. Gaetz to Newsmax: Dems Created 'Permission Structure' for Migrant Crime,"Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., accused Democrats of creating a ""permission structure"" that allows migrant-related violence, including the presence of Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang, to go unchecked.
Gaetz voiced his concerns on Newsmax, Wednesday, on ""Rob Schmitt Tonight,"" warning that dangerous criminal activity, such as that linked to Venezuela's Tren de Aragua gang, has taken root in U.S. cities like Aurora, Colorado, and New York.
The gang, one of Venezuela's most notorious criminal organizations, is reportedly operating out of city-funded migrant shelters and has escalated from petty theft to armed robberies in Times Square, according to the New York Post.
Gaetz criticized the insufficient vetting process for migrants entering the U.S., asserting that the permissiveness of current policies has led to a dangerous situation.
""Denial is indeed the first stage of grief, right? And the mainstream media and the Democrats in power tell us that it's not real, that people who are dangerous and might harm us on election day were passed through an insufficient vetting process … and you should really worry that it's only a few apartment complexes in Colorado who are being overtaken by this Venezuelan violent gang,"" he said sarcastically.
He expressed concern that a mindset has developed where a certain amount of violence is tolerated as a trade-off for broader immigration and social policies.
""I think that the perspective of American leaders should be that no apartment complexes should be overtaken. One is too many,"" Gaetz emphasized. ""But at the same time, there's a permission structure being set up where a certain amount of violence and danger is acceptable so long as it achieves these social gains of allowing illegal people into our country.""
Gaetz pointed to the broader consequences of sanctuary city and state policies, which he argued have invited dangerous elements into communities.
""When you invite the Third World into your community, you get Third-World consequences,"" he said, adding that residents of affluent neighborhoods may soon see the repercussions of these policies in the suburbs.
Local law enforcement officials confirmed that nearly two dozen young members of the Tren de Aragua gang, some as young as 11 years old, have been involved in escalating criminal activities, from purse snatchings to armed heists. The gang's rise in New York, officials warn, highlights the unintended consequences of the city's shelter policies for migrants.
The congressman insisted that this situation is not an accident but rather a direct result of open borders and policies that offer incentives to undocumented immigrants.
""It's not by accident,"" Gaetz remarked. ""It's a direct consequence of us allowing our borders to be open, and then the pull factors in our country where we're giving things away to illegals like housing and healthcare. ""

News Max,Marc Lotter to Newsmax: Voters Know What to Expect From Trump,"How Vice President Kamala Harris will be as president is unknown, but voters know what to expect from former President Donald Trump, said Marc Lotter, chief communications officer for America First Policy, on Newsmax on Saturday.
""I think this is the one fundamental difference in this election that we've never really experienced before: We actually have a challenger candidate with a record as president,"" Lotter said on ""Wake Up America Weekend.""
""Most of the time, either one candidate or both candidates are a hypothetical president. So I have to envision what it is going to be like with that person in the White House.
""In this case, you actually have one person with a record of being president. You don't have to wonder,"" he said.
""He doesn't have to prove that he can lower gas prices, grocery prices; seal the border; deal with the wars. He already did it.
""And it's Kamala Harris who's got to try to prove people that A, all the things that they've done over the last four years aren't her fault — when we know they are. And B, she's got a plan to fix it,"" Lotter said.
""That's why she's not winning, because she can't answer the simple question of 'how are you going to do it? And why haven't you done it yet?'""

News Max,2 Pacific NW Toss-Ups Could Decide Fate of Congress,"In their battle for Congress, national Republicans and Democrats are keenly eyeing the Pacific Northwest, where two of the most competitive U.S. House races in the country are playing out.
Oregon’s GOP-held 5th Congressional District and Washington state’s Democratic-held 3rd Congressional District are considered toss-ups, meaning either party has a good chance of winning.
Both districts are purple — meaning a blend of Republican red and Democratic blue — and feature freshman incumbents who narrowly flipped their seats in the 2022 midterms. And with turnout typically higher in presidential elections than in midterms, political experts say they’ll be watching to see which candidates are able to mobilize more voters — especially moderates and independents.
“These races could determine who controls the House of Representatives in the next Congress,” said Chandler James, associate professor of political science at the University of Oregon. “The Pacific Northwest is kind of where the center of a lot of action is.”
An intense rematch is playing out in southwest Washington, where first-term Democratic Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez is defending her seat against Donald Trump-backed Republican Joe Kent. Both candidates are trying to frame the other as the extreme choice.
The Republican-leaning district featuring sprawling farmlands as well as the suburbs of Portland, Oregon, narrowly went for Trump in 2020, making it a crucial target for the GOP this year.
Gluesenkamp Perez has sought to showcase herself as an independent-minded moderate. Her actions during her tenure have ranged from co-sponsoring a bill to protect medication abortion to voting in favor of a resolution rebuking Vice President Kamala Harris’ role in the handling of the U.S.-Mexico border. She was also ranked by the Lugar Center and the Georgetown University McCourt School of Public Policy as having one of the most bipartisan voting records in the U.S. House.
She has outraised Kent, bringing in $6.7 million compared to his $1.4 million, according to the most recent quarterly federal campaign finance records.
Kent, a former Green Beret who has promoted Trump’s debunked theory that the 2020 election was stolen, has blamed his opponent for things he sees as bad policy by the Biden administration, including its border policy. He has cited inflation and illegal immigration as top concerns while seeming to dull down some of his more extreme positions.
In the past on social media he has called abortion an “evil stain on our humanity,” but in a debate on Monday, he said he doesn’t support a federal ban.
“He is saying exactly what the pollsters tell him to, but we know what he believes,” Gluesenkamp Perez said in response.
Both have honed in on the economic issues plaguing parts of the region, especially the rural areas, according to Mark Stephan, associate professor of political science at Washington State University Vancouver.
“They’re both trying to claim that they care more than the other one about small communities, rural areas, the economic vitality of Southwest Washington,” he said.
Gluesenkamp Perez came out of nowhere to narrowly win the seat two years ago against Kent in a district that hadn’t been in Democratic hands for over a decade. She replaced Jaime Herrera Beutler, a more moderate Republican who lost the 2022 primary in part because she voted to impeach Donald Trump after the Jan. 6 insurrection.
There is no registration by party in the state, but for presidential primaries, Washingtonians must declare a party. In the primary this March, Republican voters outnumbered Democrats by nearly 30,000 in the district. However, a spokesperson from the Secretary of State’s office cautioned that this doesn’t indicate who will win.
The boundaries of Oregon’s 5th District were significantly redrawn following the 2020 census. It encompasses disparate regions spanning part of Portland and its wealthy and working-class suburbs, as well as rural agricultural and mountain communities and the fast-growing central Oregon city of Bend on the other side of the Cascade Range.
In the 2022 midterms, the first elections to be held in the 5th after redistricting, GOP U.S. Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer flipped a seat that had been held by Democrats for roughly 25 years. But this November, she’s facing a different opponent — Janelle Bynum, a state representative who previously beat her in legislative elections in the district and has the backing and funding of national Democrats.
Bynum was elected to the Oregon House in 2016, representing the suburbs southeast of Portland. She says she would seek to codify the abortion protections of now-overturned Roe v. Wade into federal law if elected.
Before her election to Congress, Chavez-DeRemer was a former mayor of the Portland suburb of Happy Valley and small business owner. She has endorsed Trump and highlighted her endorsements from law enforcement groups. She says she doesn't support a national abortion ban, despite previously expressing support for the U.S. Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade and its federal abortion protections.
If Bynum wins in November, she'll be Oregon’s first Black member of Congress. Chavez-DeRemer became the first Latina member of Congress to represent Oregon, along with Democratic U.S. Rep. Andrea Salinas in the state’s 6th Congressional District, when both were elected in the 2022 midterms.
Democrats hold a slight advantage in voter registration in the 5th, but roughly a third of voters are unaffiliated, and the two candidates have sought to appeal to the district’s purple hue. Bynum describes herself on her campaign website as a “common-sense, pragmatic leader,” while Chavez-DeRemer has highlighted her work on bipartisan bills. They've both tried to paint their opponent as extreme or radical.
In terms of campaign fundraising, Chavez-DeRemer has outpaced Bynum, raking in about $4 million compared to her opponent’s $2.4 million, the most recent quarterly federal campaign finance records show.
The separate fundraising arms for both parties in the U.S. House have each reserved over $6 million in ads in the Portland media market, which includes parts of Oregon's 5th and Washington's 3rd districts.

News Max,Trump Vows Tax Deductions For Interest on Car Loans,"Former President Donald Trump announced a plan to make interest on car loans fully tax deductible during a speech to the Detroit Economic Club on Thursday.
Trump said the move would ""stimulate massive domestic auto production and make car ownership dramatically more affordable for millions and millions of working American families."" The idea is similar to others Trump has proposed, such as eliminating the tax on tips, overtime work, and Social Security benefits, in a bid to keep more money in Americans' wallets.
The former president also said Thursday he would seek to renegotiate the 2020 U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement and reiterated his call to impose tariffs on foreign cars. Trump said, ""I want German car companies to become American car companies. I want them to build plants in America. Otherwise, I'd rather not have their cars here.""
Trump's speech comes as polls show him neck-and-neck with Vice President Kamala Harris in Michigan, a key battleground state.
The former president also drew criticism Thursday for calling Detroit a ""once-great city"" that's more ""developing"" than ""most places in China."" He also warned that if Harris wins in November, ""our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she's your president. You're going to have a mess on your hands.""
Several local politicians, including Democrat Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, hit back, with Duggan posting on X, ""Detroit just hosted the largest NFL Draft in history, the Tigers are back in the playoffs, the Lions are headed to the Super Bowl, crime is down and our population is growing. Lots of cities should be like Detroit. And we did it all without Trump's help.""
Democrat Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, no friend of Trump's, posted on X: ""Keep Detroit out of your mouth. And you better believe Detroiters won't forget this in November.""

News Max,"Battleground N.C. Sees Strong Early Voting, Despite Obstacles","Turnout for early in-person voting started strong Thursday in the presidential battleground of North Carolina, including in mountainous areas where Hurricane Helene destroyed property and upended lives but apparently did not dampen a fierce desire to participate in elections.
More than 400 early voting sites opened as scheduled for the 17-day period, including all but four of the 80 sites previously anticipated for the 25 western counties hardest hit by the storm, said State Board of Elections Executive Director Karen Brinson Bell. She credited election workers — including volunteers impacted by the severe weather — emergency management officials and utility crews.
“I know that thousands of North Carolinians lost so much in this storm. Their lives will never be the same after this tragedy,” Brinson Bell told reporters in Asheville, the region's population center and a city devastated by the historic rainfall. “But one thing Helene did not take from western North Carolinians is the right to vote in this important election.”
Helene’s arrival in the Southeast decimated remote towns throughout Appalachia and killed at least 246 people, with a little over half of the storm-related deaths in North Carolina. It was the deadliest hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland since Katrina in 2005.
Several dozen who died were from Buncombe County, where Asheville is located. Thousands in western North Carolina still lack power or clean running water.
But that didn't stop many from voting. About 60 people — most bundled up in jackets, hats and gloves for the chilly weather — lined up to cast a ballot at the South Buncombe Library in Asheville before the polls even opened at 9 a.m.
Among them was 77-year-old Joyce Rich, who said Helene made early voting more urgent for her. Rich said while her house was largely spared by the storm, she and her husband still need to do some work on it. Meanwhile, family members who don’t have power or water access are coming over to take showers.
“We decided, let’s just get it finished,” Rich said. “You never know what’s going to happen.”
In Polk County, an area along the South Carolina border that was also hit by Helene, the parking lot of the county elections board was so packed with early voters that an election worker was forced to direct traffic. To access the site, some people parked blocks away and walked down sidewalks still covered with small branches and other storm debris.
Voter Joanne Hemmingway, who spent 10 days without power in her home near Tryon, had always planned to vote early, and was thankful that election officials were able to still pull it off after Helene struck.
“Not having it? That never crossed my mind,” Hemmingway said.
In adjoining Henderson County, officials closed lanes on a major highway to help move election traffic, and golf carts ferried voters from an auto parts store parking lot to the county's lone voting site.
There, voter Michael Dirks said he found himself looking forward to voting after Helene, figuring it would be an important milestone in “getting back to normal, whatever that might turn out to be.”
In Wake County, home to the capital, Raleigh, several polling locations listed wait times of at least one hour late Thursday afternoon.
Thursday's sunny weather likely helped to make turnout “terrific” statewide, according to Brinson Bell, who suggested that the state could break a record for first-day early voting in all 100 counties.
Early in-person voting continues through Nov. 2. More than 3.6 million ballots — 65% of all ballots — were cast during early voting in the 2020 general election. In the 2016 election, 62% of all ballots were cast during early in-person voting.
Officials in the 25 counties affected by the storm were still evaluating Election Day polling locations, with the “vast majority” expected to be available to voters, Brinson Bell said. So far, officials have requested tents for about a dozen sites, she added.
Traditional absentee voting in North Carolina began a few weeks ago, with over 67,000 completed ballots turned in so far, election officials said. People displaced by Helene are being allowed to drop off their absentee ballot at any early voting site in the state.
The importance of early voting wasn’t lost upon the presidential campaigns of Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.
On Thursday, Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz campaigned in the state, including an event in Durham with former President Bill Clinton. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Whatley and others appeared on the “Team Trump Bus Tour” when it resumed Thursday in Rutherford County, which was among the hardest-hit areas.
The North Carolina ballot also includes races for governor, attorney general and several other statewide positions. All U.S. House and General Assembly seats also are up for reelection.

Pennsylvania law does not allow early voting, and Bucks County officials insist election offices are not polling places and on-demand printing of mail ballots is not early voting.
In some locations, people reported being sent away because of the long lines well before the 5 p.m. ET deadline to request ballots, The Bucks County Courier Times reported. County officials said on X that anyone in line to apply for a ballot by 5 p.m. Tuesday was able to submit their application.
Speaking Tuesday night at a Trump rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania, 2½ hours after the state deadline to accept mail ballot applications, Whatley told voters to stay in line.
""Donald Trump needs your votes, Donald Trump needs Pennsylvania, and America needs Pennsylvania,"" Whatley said at about 7:30 p.m. ET, The Pennsylvania Capital-Star reported.
""Folks, here's what's happening: Democrat election officials are seeing our numbers. They're seeing our turnout. They are seeing us breaking early vote records across Pennsylvania. They are terrified. And they want to stop our momentum. We are not going to let them suppress our votes. We are going to fight.""
He then added ""the Trump-Vance campaign has just filed a huge lawsuit against Bucks County,"" though, at the time, the courts were closed for the evening.
The Pennsylvania Capital-Star said unclear direction from state election officials created confusion among members of both major political parties about the difference between on-demand mail ballots and early voting.
The process of getting a mail ballot on demand required voters submit mail ballot applications. Each voter then receives a ballot on the same day and can fill out the ballot and turn it in on the spot. Or, they can take the ballot home and return it another day before Election Day, The Pennsylvania Capital-Star.
KFOX14 reported Tuesday that in Delaware County, a Trump supporter was seen handcuffed by police at a Pennsylvania voting center.
Valerie Biancaniello took to X posted video showing a group of uniformed officers taking her into custody.
""I was just taken away in handcuffs at the Delaware County, PA Government Center for encouraging people to stay in line and vote,"" Biancaniello posted Monday afternoon.
Pennsylvania is considered to be one of seven key battleground states that likely will determine the outcome of the presidential election.
