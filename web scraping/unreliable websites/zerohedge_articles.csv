Zerohedge,"""Six Ways From Sunday"" And The Continuity Of Government","During the rushed debate over the Patriot Act, was when I first heard political officials talking about the importance of “continuity of government.”
I immediately recognized what all these DC voices were describing was a construct of a post-911 government that would exist and maintain itself without the elected representatives of WeThe People.
The intelligence gathering and homeland security system put into place after the Patriot Act was passed, is a bureaucratic administrative state without the presence of elected officials controlling the apparatus. That leads to the following question:
How can a constitutional republic function without elected officials in control of it?
That question is at the heart of our current situation.
That question is at the epicenter of this “new American democracy” that no one seems to understand.
The simple answer is it cannot.
We have been fighting this three-headed IC monster (DHS, DNI, DOJ-NSD) ever since.
This reality the underlying predicate behind why Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the Special Counsel charges against Trump. This reality is also the underlying framework behind why the Supreme Court recently reaffirmed the plenary power of the President with control over the executive.
In the post-9/11 system that was created by the Patriot Act, our Constitutional Republic was inextricably fractured, placing systems and silos in charge of government under the auspices of “continuity of government.”
From that moment forth, elected representatives no longer held authority or oversight *over* the national security apparatus. Instead, the Patriot Act flipped the actual system of democratically elected representative government.
The RESULT: Our elected officials became subservient to the institutional interests of unelected agency officials. As Senator Schumer calls them “the six ways from Sunday” coalition.
This reality empirically surfaces with people like former AG Bill Barr saying the President does not have unilateral authority over the DOJ. Also, the Lawfare approach and narrative that a President is not the arbiter of governing power. Both statements are constitutionally false, as affirmed by SCOTUS – Thank God.
Understand this. This is the root of the cancer that was always present, silent and lurking in the background institutions prior to 9/11. After the Patriot Act passed, that cancer fully metastasized and entered the bloodstream of American governance.
What was previously a slimy bag of institutional snakes, kept in place by a tenuously worn nylon bag – sewn from the remaining fabric of our constitution, was released by the Patriot Act.
Everything thereafter, including the constant bites we suffer from the unleashed weaponization, is a consequence of that moment.
That’s the root of our modern political reality.
This is the “new American democracy,” where the unelected officials and administrators within institutions hold power.
Under this Patriot Act framework, representative government [executive branch, legislative branch and even the judicial branch] are subservient to those who use the shield of national security. This outcome is the direct consequence of creating a system for the “continuity of government.”
LEARN IT!
Then, suddenly, everything about the domestic enemy we confront gets really clear.
Thankfully, the Supreme Court has now given indications that they understand what has taken place.
The Supreme Court has recently affirmed that only the President of the United States has the authority to control the Executive Branch. As a direct and consequential outcome, only the President of the United States can remove the core issue that has corrupted our constitutional intent.
Every element vested in the “continuity of government” as a manipulation of the constitution are now aligned to eliminate the threat President Donald Trump represents.
We have one chance.
Vote like your freedom depends on it, because it does.
Read the SCOTUS opinion, not from a point of view of President Trump, but from the point of view of what does this allow him to do in his second term, and what invisible straightjackets did it remove that were a threat during his first term?
While impeachment is a political process within the Legislative Branch, and the Supreme Court is extremely hesitant to overstep their role therein, the High Court did put this sentiment clearly into the opinion about immunity: …“The President is not above the law. But Congress may not criminalize the President’s conduct in carrying out the responsibilities of the Executive Branch under the Constitution.”…
Congress may not criminalize the conduct of the President simply for carrying out his core executive branch duties.
Removal of Executive Branch officials is a core duty, an official act, carrying absolute immunity.
That affirmed reality is exactly why the Deep State and Lawfare crowd are very alarmed.",2024-10-28
Zerohedge,"The ""Righteously Pissed Off"" Are Ready To Go To Work To Fix Whatever They Can","Speaking of Abortion...
“Good rule of thumb: those who frequently use the word “disinformation” are the ones most likely to be pushing it”
- Elon Musk
What were they thinking after they shoved “Joe Biden” into the abyss, like an old refrigerator over the edge of the landfill, and afterward settled — instantly it appears, with no process at all — on Kamala Harris to lead the party to victory in the fall election?
I will tell you: they were not thinking at all.
The collective mind of the Democrat elite was a vast vacuum devoid of thought, mass, or light, like a corner of deepest space, lacking even a particle of cosmic debris to evoke the existence of existence.
Such mindlessness was the consummate expression of a party that for eight years worked every angle of political mental illness toward the loss of its mind, driven by whatever dark energy seeks escape from truth, life, and God — whatever is opposite of creation and being. What you are witnessing is a colossal act of being un-born. The party put out a call to the universe and the universe ordered. . . an abortion of the Democratic Party! You are reminded again: be careful of what you wish for.
And so do things stand one week before the election. You have not seen such a vivid demonstration of slowly-and-then-all-at-once since the implosion of Lehman Brothers as the collapse of the Democratic Party this fateful October. Poor Kamala is just collateral damage at this point. She goes out before some manufactured audience and seven-minutes onstage delivering a door-dash order of precooked blather is all she can stand before being overwhelmed by the emptiness and futility of her task. . . and then she flees back to the waiting limousine (and the chardonnay bottle).
Meanwhile, her allies — that is, the Democratic Party’s allies — play their own roles in this political abortion. The LA Times and the WashPo declined their usual proforma endorsements, two kisses of death. Those actions last week provoked nervous breakdowns in both newsrooms, cries of anguish, resignations, professional suicides. The news media find themselves in a peculiar position, having gone along for years with the gathering mental illness of the Democratic Party, like incompetent parents in a large dysfunctional family, offering unconditional support for their kids’ intolerable and unacceptable behavior.
They are flying to pieces now on the CNN chat panels. James Carville, the party’s shriveled Gollum, has gone to IV infusions of Jim Beam, seems like. Jake Tapper gets Sunday schooled by JD Vance and turns into a mewling cat-lady right before your eyes. Anderson Cooper goes all waxy and mute. Joy Reid surrenders to echolalia as her MSNBC fans are subjected to the guest list of P. Diddy’s “freak-offs,” ranting about Hitler. Lawrence O’Donnell is looking more and more like Vincent Price in Return of the Fly. Reality-optional hardly suffices to describe cable news these days.
You’ve got to ask: can they just let it be? Can they just let go of their insane Jacobin rebellion now and let it fade into history? Then, kick back, recuperate, get their minds right, put their house and family in order, and move on as a legit political faction in a functioning republic? Or, do they burn the asylum down?
The signals are troubling. They are chattering about Mr. Trump “using the military” against them in the months to come — as if the Abrams tanks were going to roll up to DNC headquarters and blast away. By now, you know that such thoughts expressed by Democratic pols and news pals are always projections of their own wishes. The New York Times published just such a classic paranoid projection exercise last week “. . . telling Americans that if he [Trump] wins, he plans to bend, if not break, our democracy.”
Surely it is too late, with early voting well underway, to stop any ballot harvesting and other election shenanigans as engineered by master fraudster Marc Elias. In fact, frauds are already being discovered (e.g., Lancaster County, PA.) Not a good look. It is exactly what a conspiracy (to commit election fraud) means in law, and the actual people who cooked the ballots and transported them are going to rat-out those who instructed them to do it. Wait for that, and wait for it to pop up elsewhere around the country. This time, watchers are watching, much more carefully.
Of course, you know there will be long delays, perhaps a week or more, before definitive election results will get posted. The country’s in a bad way, really frightened of what these desperate Democrats with their mitts still on the levers of power might do. Judge Merchan is scheduled to deliver his bit of mischief November 26 in the New York “Stormy Daniels hush money” case. You can bet that the Supreme Court will squash him like a sow-bug five minutes later and vacate his stupid case.
Reasonable observers (Rickards, Armstrong) are whispering about martial law and blood in the streets following the election. Yet Mr. Trump’s MAGA legions, appear supernaturally confident now, fortified with a sense of mission. They’re righteously pissed-off about all the hoaxes, the lawfare, the swarming illegal migrants, their squandered tax dollars, and much more. But they are ready to go to work, eager to put their shoulders to the wheel to fix whatever they can and, as they do, the death of the Democratic Party is one abortion they will not shed any tears over.

Zerohedge,King Biden & Queen Harris Overrule Supreme Court On Student Debt Forgiveness,"Biden repeatedly acts like he is above the law. So who’s the threat to Democracy?
Biden Tries to Overrule Courts a Third Time
The Wall Street Journal reports Biden Snubs the Courts Again on Student Loan Forgiveness
‘That didn’t stop me,” President Biden declared after the Supreme Court blocked his $430 billion student loan write-off in 2023. It sure didn’t. After striking out in court with three debt forgiveness schemes, the Administration on Friday unveiled another. Take that, judges.
The Education Department says its proposed rule would authorize forgiveness for some eight million borrowers experiencing “hardship.” Under the rule, the department can discharge debt if it calculates a borrower has an 80% likelihood of defaulting on payments within the subsequent two years based on 17 factors such as income, debt balances and assets.
The rule would effectively let the department forgive debt of any borrower any time it wants. The administration says high child-care costs could qualify as a hardship. How about high auto loan or credit-card payments? Did someone say moral hazard?
In April the department released a plan that cancels accrued interest for 25 million borrowers and forgives debt of those who entered repayment over 20 years ago or who “enrolled in low-financial-value programs”—meaning, forprofit colleges. The plan also promised to waive debt for borrowers with a “hardship.”
A federal court last month blocked that plan, but the department says its new rule “would operate separately and distinctly.” Courts are playing whack-a-mole with the Administration’s debt write-offs that end-run Congress, which never authorized such broad-based debt forgiveness.
Such lawlessness is one reason so many Americans discount the left’s assertions that Donald Trump endangers democracy. Mr. Biden acts like he’s king, and Democrats and media voices cheering him on have no standing to object if Mr. Trump follows the Biden precedent.
Queen Harris
Please recall that when Harris was asked what she would have done differently than Biden, she could not come up with a single thing.
She supports Biden’s energy policy to ban gasoline engines, Biden’s immigration policy, the Inflation Reduction Act, Medicare for All, and student loan forgiveness.
She lied about supporting fracking, backed off that, and now the lie is back on again.
The NYT Has Another Great Poll for Trump
If you missed it, please see The NYT Has Another Great Poll for Trump, Tipping Point is Immigration
In yet another display of momentum for Trump, the New York Times has Trump tied nationally.
On October 21, I commented October 21: In California, Harris Is Down 21 Percentage Points With Latinos vs 2020
And while the The Immigrant Crime Spree is Real, Not Imaginary, Thank Harris and Biden that’s not really what the backlash against immigration is really about.
If people were not struggling with shelter, food, insurance, etc., they would not be so upset with immigration.
The backlash against immigration is really a backlash against inflation and the economy. That is what’s behind the shift towards Trump.
And it’s why this election is not the tossup everyone says it is.
Finally, Trump is Trump, but Harris is nothing but Biden with a very annoying laugh.",2024-10-28

The propaganda and manipulation by Democrats, Deep State non-profits (funded by radical leftist billionaires), and corporate media outlets have lost control of the narratives just days before the presidential election—they're no longer effective at propping up Kamala Harris—as a majority of American people reject censorship, wokeism and whatever this is...

Americans are now more interested in upholding the values of the West, the US Constitution, and the Declaration of Independence, with some youth seeking traditionalism. The far-left slant of the Overton window during the Biden-Harris administration appears to be shifting the other way/ or perhaps widening.
The Overton Window is a range of acceptable policy ideas within mainstream political debate. For years, corporate MSM, radical leftist non-profits, and far-left activists in government and corporations have artificially pushed the window to the left, force-feeding Americans into radical leftist ideas to transform the nation towards a pathway towards socialism/or 21st-century communism.
History may show that Elon Musk's X and former President Trump shifted the Overton Window from a leftist extreme to more of a center-right. Americans are increasingly giving up on woke pronouns, instead focusing on ""Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.""

Zerohedge,2 Lawmakers Attempt The Impossible: Saving Social Security,"Authored by Mark Tapscott via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),
More members of Congress, 329, co-sponsored the Social Security Fairness Act (SSFA) than nearly any other legislative proposal in 2024, but that may not be evidence of lawmakers’ eagerness to fix what ails the retirement pension program—the bill doesn’t address the fundamental insolvency issue.
The SSFA would end two provisions of current law that reduce benefits for millions of public employees at all levels of government with separate pension systems. Eliminating the provisions means more Social Security benefits for such workers.
In other words, the SSFA would increase the total amount of Social Security benefits paid out without providing new revenues to fund them. Even so, the bipartisan proposal is likely to pass Congress and President Joe Biden—who promised in his 2020 campaign to eliminate the provision—is expected to sign it into law when lawmakers reconvene after the election.
For decades, Social Security has been the untouchable “third rail” of American politics that virtually no Democrat or Republican dares to propose changing for fear of angering legions of elderly and disabled voters who depend on the program.
Approximately 70 million Americans are beneficiaries, making Social Security the largest federal entitlement program.
The Social Security Trustees’ latest report projects that the system will become insolvent in 2035 unless Congress approves major reforms soon.
Meanwhile, the ratio of workers paying into the system to beneficiaries is heading downward. The ratio in 1950 was 16 workers to one beneficiary; today that ratio is 2.8 workers per beneficiary. Plus, retirees are living longer today, drawing more benefits over time.
Politicians increase benefits, but are loathe to increase Social Security taxes or slash benefits.
The seemingly impossible challenge for Congress and the White House is how to reform Social Security if increased taxes and reduced benefits are untouchable. The last president to propose a major reform was George W. Bush, who shortly after being re-elected in 2004, suggested privatizing the system.
Under that proposal, Americans would have been allowed to divert some of their Social Security taxes into government-approved private investment funds. Bush hastily dropped the plan after opposition in both parties and in the mainstream media exploded.
More recently, two lawmakers have ventured beyond the raise-taxes-reduce-benefits dilemma to explore other ways of saving Social Security before it becomes insolvent.
Raising the Tax Cap
Rep. John Larson (D-Conn.) has introduced his Social Security 2100 Act repeatedly in recent years, and it has gained strong support (188 co-sponsors) among his Democratic colleagues. Larson is the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee’s Subcommittee on Social Security.
During a floor speech earlier this year, Larson said that “more than five million of our fellow Americans have worked and paid into the system and get below poverty level checks from their government.”
Larson noted, however, that it has been decades since Congress approved changes designed to shore up the Social Security system’s finances. He also rejected suggestions from House Republicans that a study commission be created to recommend reforms.
“It’s long overdue that we not study this—how about we do what we’re elected to do by the public and actually vote,” he said.
“I commend President Biden for saying, look, the way we’re going to pay for this is by lifting the cap ... on people making more than $400,000 a year.”
Larson’s bill would not hike the Social Security tax rate, but would apply Social Security taxes to all taxpayers making more than $400,000 annually. The present salary cap on Social Security taxes is set at $168,600.
“Millionaires have already stopped paying into the Social Security program. Bill Gates stopped paying back in January. That is wrong, it’s not right, but to lift that cap will allow us to not only extend the solvency of Social Security, but increase benefits across the board,” he said.
According to an analysis by the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, an individual making $500,000 annually only pays Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) levies on the first $168,600 of income, which equals $10,453 a year. Under the Larson proposal, the same individual would pay $31,000 in FICA levies, nearly three times as much.
Larson did not respond to requests for comment.
The Big Idea
Venturing even further into reform is Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana doctor and ranking Republican on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.
Cassidy calls his proposal the “Big Idea” and it is based on the creation by Congress of a new $1.5 trillion investment fund that is totally separate from the Social Security Trust Fund—which receives FICA revenues that pay for benefits.
Asked by The Epoch Times how the new fund would be financed, Cassidy said “that is open to negotiation. You could sell government assets to fund it over time, you could borrow it and put it in there.
“Folks say ‘But wait a minute, isn’t that going to increase your debt?’ It turns out you’re not spending it, you’re putting it into escrow. And according to the Congressional Budget Office, that’s going to be considered a wash.”
The Big Idea escrow fund would be managed by an independent company that would bid for the job, assume a fiduciary responsibility for the results and invest the fund in a conservative portfolio of private sector entities to function like Sovereign Wealth funds.
“[Wall Street executive John] Paulson and [former President Donald] Trump have talked about creating a Sovereign Wealth fund. Advisers to Joe Biden have talked about creating a Sovereign Wealth fund. Now what we’re talking about with our Big Idea is somewhat of a Sovereign Wealth fund,” Cassidy said. Paulson is often mentioned as a potential Secretary of the Treasury if Trump is re-elected.
The same approach is already in use in the pension field, Cassidy said, with the federal government’s Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) for civil servants, the U.S. National Railroad Retirement Trust, Wisconsin’s public employee retirement system, and the Canadian government pension system.
Cassidy said the fund is projected to generate sufficient profits to cover 75 percent of Social Security’s revenue shortfall and that he is open to alternative approaches to covering the remaining 25 percent.
“Combined with some relatively minor tweaks to the program, at the end of 75 years, all the accumulated debt would be paid off, and the Social Security program would be able to cover its obligations in perpetuity,” he said in an earlier statement.
Asked how misuse would be avoided, Cassidy said “we’ve got a couple of mechanisms, we had the Heritage Foundation help us draft the way by which to prevent political meddling.” He said former Comptroller General David Walker has also suggested several solutions.
Cassidy said he supports a ban on investing in firms based in China, an issue that ensnared TSP managers in 2019 when Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) highlighted the risks of federal worker contributions investing in Chinese firms.

Zerohedge,Jury: Workers Fired For Refusing COVID-19 Vaccine To Get More Than $1 Million Each,"Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),
Rail transit officials in California’s Bay Area have been ordered to pay more than $7 million to transit workers who were fired because they refused to get a COVID-19 vaccine years ago.
On Oct. 23, a federal jury in the U.S District Court for the Northern District of California sided with six former San Francisco Bay Area Regional Transit (BART) workers who had refused to get the vaccine for religious purposes.
BART was ordered to pay the group more than $7.8 million, with each individual receiving between $1.2 million and $1.5 million, the Pacific Justice Institute, which represented the transit workers in the trial, said in a statement on Oct. 24. The institute, a law firm representing the six former employees since 2022, said the eight-person jury deliberated for two days this week before returning the verdict that awarded the employees the compensation.
About a week ago, the federal jury also determined that BART had failed to prove that it suffered an undue hardship by denying accommodations to the ex-employees in the case.
On Oct. 23, the jury further found that the six employees met the burden of showing that there was a conflict between their religious beliefs and the BART vaccine mandate, which was implemented in 2021.
According to the law firm, the jury also agreed with the figures that the plaintiffs had provided for lost wages that they had suffered after losing their jobs. The jury then added $1 million each to those figures, the firm said, describing the verdict as a “legal earthquake.”
“The rail employees chose to lose their livelihood rather than deny their faith. That in itself shows the sincerity and depth of their convictions,“ Kevin Snider, the Pacific Justice Institute’s chief counsel, who served as lead trial attorney, said. ”After nearly three years of struggle, these essential workers feel they were heard and understood by the jury and are overjoyed and relieved by the verdict.”
The law firm stated: “During the trial, jurors heard compelling testimony from dedicated employees. One of the plaintiffs had worked for more than 30 years for BART, with a stretch of 10 years perfect attendance, before being unceremoniously dismissed. Another had been out on workers comp for months, with no scheduled return date, when she was fired.”
Lawyers for BART argued that multiple employees who had conflicts with receiving the vaccine had secular—rather than religious—reasons. But the jury disagreed with those arguments, the Pacific Justice Institute said.
The vaccine mandate was approved by BART’s board of directors in October 2021 and stipulated that all employees must get the COVID-19 vaccine. It allowed some employees to be exempt from the vaccine, including for religious reasons.
A year later, BART employees filed a class-action lawsuit accusing the operator of denying religious accommodations that violated state law.
U.S. District Judge William Alsup, who presided over the lawsuit against BART, ruled that the operator’s policies did not violate the employees’ right to religious freedom, according to an order he issued in March.
A separate order issued by Alsup in January found that BART received 188 requests for a religious exemption and accommodation, and of that figure, 40 chose not to complete the process. They were either terminated from employment or ultimately got the vaccine.
“Plaintiffs’ putative class fails because its members have little in common beyond their request for religious accommodation,” the judge further said in his order. “They do not share a common religious objection. They do not share a vocation or a set of contractual rights. They do not present a similar set of potential accommodations and associated burdens. They do not present similar health and exposure concerns.
“Potential accommodations do not impact the same pool of coworkers. Those coworkers do not have the same bargained-for rights.”
The Epoch Times contacted BART for comment on Oct. 25 but received no reply by publication time. The rail operator’s spokesman, James Allison, told local news outlet SFGate that it had “no comment” on the verdict.",2024-10-27
Zerohedge,The Thin Blue Line: University Professors Are Approaching Near Unanimity As A Democratic Lock,"The 2024 presidential election is shaping up to be the single most divisive election in our history.
The public is split right down the middle with almost every group splintering between former president Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.
There is, however, one group that seems almost unanimous: professors.
A new survey of more than 1,000 professors shows that seventy-eight percent will vote for Harris and only eight percent will vote for Trump. Other than a poll of the Democratic National Committee, there are few groups that are more reliably Democratic or liberal.
For anyone in higher education, the result is hardly surprising. The poll tracks what we already know about the gradual purging of departments around the country of conservative, libertarian, and dissenting professors.
Indeed, the lack of political and intellectual diversity may be turning some donors and even applicants from higher education. With failing revenue and applications, universities are starting to re-embrace commitments to neutrality on political issues.
Some, however, are doubling down on advocacy and orthodoxy.
In an op-ed this week, Wesleyan University President Michael Roth called on universities to reject “institutional neutrality” and officially support Kamala Harris. Calling neutrality “a retreat,” Roth compared Trump’s election to the rise of the Nazis and insisted that schools should “give up the popular pastime of criticizing the woke and call out instead the overt racism.”
He added, without a hint of self-awareness or irony, that “we should not be silenced because of fears of appearing partisan.”
In my book “The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in an Age of Rage,” I discuss the intolerance in higher education and surveys showing that many departments no longer have a single Republican as faculties replicate their own views and values.
So not only are professors voting en mass for Harris, Roth would have the schools themselves work openly for her election.
That ideological echo chamber is hardly an enticement for many who are facing rising high tuition costs with relatively little hope of being taught by faculty with opposing views.
There are obviously many reasons why faculty may reject Trump specifically, but this poll also tracks more generally the self-identification and contributions of faculty.
A Georgetown study recently found that only nine percent of law school professors identify as conservative at the top 50 law schools — almost identical to the percentage of Trump voters found in the new poll.
Notably, Roth acknowledged that the current lack of intellectual diversity in higher education had become so extreme that there might be a need for “an affirmative action program for conservatives.”
However, he and others continue to saw feverishly on the branch upon which we all sit in higher education in calling for even greater political advocacy.
There is little evidence that faculty members have any interest in changing this culture or creating greater diversity at schools. In places like North Carolina State University a study found that Democrats outnumbered Republicans 20 to 1.
Recently, I had a debate at Harvard Law School with Professor Randall Kennedy on whether Harvard protects free speech and intellectual diversity.
This year, Harvard found itself in a familiar spot on the annual ranking of Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE): dead last among 251 universities and colleges.
Harvard has long dismissed calls for greater free speech protections or intellectual diversity. It shows.
The Harvard Crimson has documented how the school’s departments have virtually eliminated Republicans. In one study of multiple departments last year, they found that more than 75 percent of the faculty self-identified as “liberal” or “very liberal.”
Only 5 percent identified as “conservative,” and only 0.4% as “very conservative.”
Consider that, according to Gallup, the U.S. population is roughly equally divided among conservatives (36%), moderates (35%), and liberals (26%).
So Harvard has three times the number of liberals as the nation at large and less than three percent identify as “conservative’ rather than 35% nationally.
Among law school faculty who have donated more than $200 to a political party, a breathtaking 91 percent of the Harvard faculty gave to democrats.
The student body shows the same bias of selection. Harvard Crimson previously found that only 7 percent of incoming students identified as conservative. For the vast majority of liberal faculty and students, Harvard amplifies rather than stifles their viewpoints.
This does not happen randomly. Indeed, if a business reduced the number of women or minorities to less than 5 percent, a court would likely find de facto discrimination.
Yet, Kennedy rejected the notion that the elite school should strive to “look more like America.”
It is not just that schools like Harvard “do not look like America,” it does not even look like liberal Massachusetts, which is almost 30 percent Republican.
Our students are being educated by faculty taken from the same liberal elite of just 26 percent of our nation.
Some sites like Above the Law have supported the exclusion of conservative faculty. Senior Editor Joe Patrice defended “predominantly liberal faculties” by arguing that hiring a conservative law professor is akin to allowing a believer in geocentrism to teach at a university.
The result is that law students at schools like Harvard have relatively few faculty to reflect the views of half of the judiciary and the majority of the Supreme Court.
Likewise, having a faculty that ranges from the left to the far left further marginalizes the small number of conservative students.
The impact of this academic echo chamber is evident in surveys showing that 28 percent of Harvard students engaged in self-censorship — a figure doubling since just 2021.
Given my respect for Professor Kennedy, I was surprised that he dismissed the sharp rise in students saying that they did not feel comfortable speaking in classes. Referring to them as “conservative snowflakes,” he insisted that they simply had to have the courage of their convictions.
This ignores that they depend upon professors for recommendations and their challenging the orthodoxy at the school can threaten their standing.
Moreover, Kennedy defended cancel campaigns or “disinvitations” of speakers as a form of free speech. As students see faculty supporting the cancelling of conservative or libertarian or dissenting speakers, it is hardly an invitation to speak freely yourself in class.
There was a hopeful aspect, however, to the debate. Before the debate the large audience voted heavily in favor of Harvard’s position. However, after the debate, they overwhelming voted against Harvard’s position on free speech.
It is an example of how exposure to opposing views can change the bias or assumptions in higher education.
There is little likelihood that Harvard or higher education will change. It is like the old joke about how many psychiatrists it takes to change a light bulb. The answer is just one but the bulb really has to want to change.
Academics like Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC Berkeley law school, have denounced conservative justices as mere “partisan hacks.” Other faculty have joined in claims that Trump and his supporters are “fascists” out to destroy democracy. It is only likely to get worse after the election.
The political polling of professors reflects the near complete cleansing of colleges of conservative faculty. The question is whether donors or applicants will continue to support an echo chamber that has become ideologically deafening.

In fact, wind turbines, whether on or off the shore, are a clear danger to many endangered species and concerns are mounting about their widespread and harmful effects on the natural world. Years ago, the great cause in environmentalism was to save the whales, but these concerns seem to have abated of late, while the slaughter of millions of onshore bats, along with the destruction of many types of large raptors, is simply ignored.
Andrew Montford of Net Zero Watch has updated his graph on the stranding of U.K. cetaceans and compared it to the rise of offshore wind capacity.
Both totals have soared in recent years. Is there a causal link? Perhaps not one that would inconvenience Net Zero fanatics, but Montford says the suggestion of a causal relationship “remains very strong”.
The Daily Sceptic has reported in the past about the mounting casualties of whales stranded off the north eastern coast of the United States in the wake of massive offshore windfarm construction. There have been around 300 fatalities in the last five years, and many suggest the extensive sonar soundings, pile driving and heavy concentrated vessel traffic is causing havoc with aquatic feeding, breeding and migration up and down the coast.
The latest U.K. stranding figures have been reported to Ascobans, a UN environmental conservation body for cetaceans in the NE Atlantic. Commenting on the “shocking” figures, the environmental writer and campaigner Jason Endfield called them “a wake-up call to those planning to further industrialise our seas in the name of renewable energy, and especially offshore wind farms”. In his view, it made no sense to increase ocean noise to levels that are “literally unbearable for marine mammals”.
The great cover-up of this environmental disaster continues with massive industrial parks being erected around the coasts of many countries. In the U.K., the incoming Labour government is committed to a massive expansion with the Mad Miliband spraying around billions of pounds in additional subsidies to boost an industry that would not exist in a free market.
To the fore in blowing smoke over the issue is Greenpeace USA’s senior oceans campaigner Arlo Hemphill who claims there is “no evidence whatsoever” connecting wind turbines to whale deaths. “It’s just a cynical disinformation campaign,” says another Greenpeace spokesman. The mainstream media often goes along with this narrative as shown by recent tweets from Agence France-Presse reporter Manon Jacob. He dismissed the focus on wind farms as a red herring “when offshore wind remains thus far marginal in the U.S. and scientific evidence of large marine mammal deaths is lacking”. This is the same Jacob who wrote a recent ‘fact check’ of the Daily Sceptic that was so bad and misleading it should feature in future journalism schools as an example of how not to criticise well-sourced material.
The investigative science journalist Jo Nova has a different take on the matter:
“Researchers have known since at least 2013 that pile drivers were permanently deafening porpoises, leaving them presumably to die miserable deaths wandering blindly through dark or murky seas. Where were all the professors of marine science, paid by the public to know these things, and where was the BBC?”
Spread the word, she continued.
Fifty years ago, environmentalists would have raised hell about a thousand dead whales and dolphins. Now they are part of the cover-up. “They don’t want to draw attention to the blubber on the beach in case people start asking hard questions,” she observed.
There are however some signs that the ‘nothing to see here, guv’ line is starting to crack. A recent essay in Watts Up With That? suggested that an impact statement from the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) had finally acknowledged the harm caused by offshore wind farms. Examining leases off the New Jersey and New York coast covering over 488,000 acres, the BOEM hints that these developments are not entirely benign “despite being repeatedly framed as environmentally friendly solutions to the climate crisis”. Marine mammals, sea turtles, birds and fish could suffer due to noise, habitat displacement and changes in migration patterns, it is said. Even bats, says WUWT?, which are not typically associated with offshore environments, could be affected.
The essay noted that this latest BOEM work may signal a more cautious approach, “perhaps influenced by increasing legal challenges, public backlash, and even emerging scientific research indicating that wind turbines are not as harmless as once believed”.",2024-10-30
Zerohedge,"NYC Mayor Says Trump Not A Fascist, Urges Politicians To 'Dial Down The Temperature'","Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),
New York City Mayor Eric Adams rebuffed recent claims that former President Donald Trump is a fascist and said that Trump’s Madison Square Garden event should go ahead.
“I have heard those terms hurled at me by some political leaders in the city, using terms like [Nazi leader Adolph] Hitler and fascist,” the Democratic mayor said at a news conference in New York City on Saturday.
“I know what Hitler has done, and I know what a fascist regime looks like. I think, as I have called for over and over again, that the level of conversation, I think we can all dial down the temperature,” Adams said at the conference in which he also detailed a significant police presence planned for Trump’s event at Madison Square Garden in Manhattan Sunday.
He made the comment after Vice President Kamala Harris and her surrogates criticized Trump in recent days after his former chief of staff John Kelly accused him of praising Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Germany dictator’s generals while he was in office. Trump has refuted Kelly’s comments.
Referring to the claims, Harris told voters Wednesday at a CNN town hall that “I invite you to listen and go online to listen to John Kelly” make the allegations against the 45th president. “This is a serious, serious issue. And we know who he is. He admires dictators,” Harris said.
Kelly told the New York Times and the Atlantic that the former president wanted generals like Hitler had.
“He commented more than once that, ‘You know, Hitler did some good things, too,’” Kelly told the New York Times.
Kelly’s comment was not publicly corroborated by other former Trump White House officials and was refuted by Trump in the past week.
During a media event, Trump told reporters that he never said positive things about Hitler during his time in the Oval Office, saying that he “would never say that” and criticized The Atlantic and its reporting.
Former Vice President Mike Pence’s former chief of staff Mike Ayers has also rebutted the claims.
“I’ve avoided commenting on intra-staff leaks or rumors or even lies as it relates to my time at the White House but General Kelly’s comments regarding President Trump are too egregious to ignore,” Ayers posted on X. “I was with each of them more than most, and his commentary is *patently false.*”
After Harris’s statement, Trump’s campaign spokesman Steven Cheung accused the Democratic candidate of spreading “outright lies and falsehoods.”
Adams, who is currently facing federal bribery charges, said Saturday that he disagrees with the notion that Trump’s rally should be scrapped over Kelly’s comments.
“This is America. This is New York, and I think it’s important that we allow individuals to exercise their right to get their message clear to New Yorkers,” the mayor said. “And our job as a city and as a Police Department is to make sure they can do that ... in a peaceful way.”
Adams’s comments about lowering “the temperature” also appeared to echo a comment made by President Joe Biden earlier this year in the immediate aftermath of the first assassination attempt against Trump in Pennsylvania. At the time, Biden called on Americans to “cool it down” after the shooting, in which a bullet clipped Trump’s ear.
Trump became the subject of a second assassination attempt in mid-September after the Secret Service engaged with an individual who was pointing a rifle through a perimeter fence while the former president was golfing in Florida.
In mid-October, Trump spoke at the Al Smith charity dinner in New York and made reference to the federal charges Adams is facing, as well as those he is facing. “They’ve gone after me, Mr. Mayor, and you’re peanuts compared to what they’ve done to me,” he said on Oct. 18. “And you’re going to be OK.”

Former President Trump sat down with Joe Rogan for a three-hour interview on Friday. Several days later, the viral interview appears to have been censored on the video-sharing platform.
On early Tuesday morning, Rogan addressed censorship concerns by uploading the full video on X. He said, ""Since there's an issue with searching for this episode on YouTube here is the full podcast with Trump.""

A quick YouTube search for Rogan's interview with Trump does not yield results for the original video, suggesting that the platform may be suppressing it. The only way to watch the video is to go directly to Rogan's channel.
On X, David Heinemeier Hansson, CTO of software company Basecamp, wrote, ""Tried to find the Rogan/Trump interview on YouTube but no matter what I search, it's not coming up. Would be beyond bonkers if they're actively trying to suppress it. Must be a glitch, right?""

""Lack of credibility isn't unique to The Post. Our brethren newspapers have the same issue. And it's a problem not only for media, but also for the nation.

Zerohedge,"Seeking Middle East Peace, Michigan Muslim Leaders Endorse Trump At Saturday Rally","In the latest vivid demonstration that once-durable Democratic constituencies are being completely shattered in 2024, former President Donald Trump on Saturday welcomed Michigan Muslim leaders onto a stage and heartily accepted their endorsements. ""I’m thrilled to accept the endorsement of these highly respected leaders,"" Trump told the crowd in Novi, a Detroit suburb.
The principal motivator of the endorsements appears to be outrage over the Biden-Harris administration's support of Israel's long, astoundingly destructive war on Gaza -- and a belief that even ardent Israel-backer Trump would be far more likely to bring the carnage to an end. Imam Belal Alzuhairi took to the stage in the Detroit suburb of Novi to voice that very sentiment:
""We, as Muslims, stand with President Trump because he promises peace, not war! We are supporting Donald Trump because he promised to end war in the Middle East and Ukraine. The bloodshed has to stop all over the world, and I think this man can make that happen. I personally believe that God saved his life twice for a reason.""
Alzuhairi also commended Trump's commitment to protect children from school curricula that undermine family values, and to creating a strong border and stopping illegal immigration:

Dearborn Heights mayor Bill Bazzi likewise embraced Trump as potential peacemaker, telling the crowd, ""We're going to stop the wars, we're going to make the United States safe again, and we're going to make the world safe."" Amer Ghalib, Muslim mayor of Detroit suburb Hamtramck, endorsed Trump on Oct. 20. Liberals celebrated when Hamtramck elected a majority-Muslim city council in 2015, and then Ghalib as its first Muslim Mayor in 2021, but they recoiled and even felt betrayed when the council barred LGBTQ Pride flags from city flagpoles last year.
As is the case with seemingly every other issue, Kamala Harris has chosen not to stake out a position on the Israel-Gaza war that's even modestly different from that of the Biden administration -- such as merely putting conditions on the billions of US dollars shoveled into the country. Here she is lamely dodging the issue in her train wreck of a town hall performance in Philadelphia on Wednesday night:
Kamala Harris says clearly and fairly succinctly that we must accept her sponsorship of the Gaza genocide as a trade off for more affordable groceries pic.twitter.com/HlNzKj2LP7
— Max Blumenthal (@MaxBlumenthal) October 24, 2024
That approach could well cost Harris Michigan's 15 electoral votes and the 2024 election, as Michigan has one of the largest Muslim populations in America. The issue could also be decisive in states with lesser Muslim populations but tightly-contested races. An Arab News/YouGov poll released last week found that Trump is narrowly winning the Arab-American vote, 45% to 43%. In 2020, 86% of Muslims voted for Biden, with just 6% backing Trump.
As if her refusal to take a different approach to Israel weren't doing enough damage with Muslims, Harris has put herself in an even deeper hole by embracing the endorsements of arch-Middle-East-interventionist Dick Cheney and his daughter, former Rep. Liz Cheney -- and even toting Liz along for multiple appearances in Michigan. By some estimates, upwards of one million people have died as a result of the Dick Cheney-orchestrated invasion of Iraq on false premises.
Kamala Harris doesn't care about genocide. If she did, she would state permanent ceasefire and suspension of arms trade to 🇮🇱 as part of her campaign.

She's gonna lose the Muslim & Arab American vote. pic.twitter.com/LJ86v2MJxm
Sharing a view that's no doubt widely held among Michigan Muslims, Hamtramck Mayor Ghalib told reporters last week:
""It was surprising for us as Arab Americans to have Kamala Harris bringing someone whose family name always reminds us of war crimes in the Middle East....To bring this person to our backyard, to remind us all of the tragedies that happened in the Middle East, is something that tells us that there would be more wars coming if Kamala Harris is elected.""
While it's certainly not universal, the substantial Muslim embrace of Trump is particularly remarkable given Trump's demonstrated devotion to the State of Israel and relentless pandering to its backers inside the United States.
Trump's political campaigns have been fueled by enormous donations from the late Sheldon and still-living Miriam Adelson, a billionaire couple whose foremost policy concern has been ensuring steady financial, military and political support for the State of Israel, and aligning Washington with the agenda of Israel's right wing. The Adelsons have been closely allied with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, even publishing a free Israeli newspaper that boosts Netanyahu and his Likud party.
The couple donated a jaw-dropping $90 million to Trump's 2020 campaign, rewarding him for his Israel-catering policies, including relocating the US embassy from Tel Aviv to contested Jerusalem, exiting the Iran nuclear deal and recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which Israel captured in 1967's Six-Day War. Trump also awarded Miriam Adelson the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In the 2024 race, Miriam Adelson has donated another $100 million to a PAC that works to elect Trump.
The remarkable fracturing of Muslim support of the Democratic Party comes alongside similar erosion of other once-reliable cornerstones of the Democratic electorate, including blacks, Hispanics, union members and young voters. Can this race really be as tight as ""experts"" tell us?",2024-10-27
Zerohedge,Harris Spokesman Confirms Kamala Said No To Joe Rogan Podcast,"A spokesman for the Harris campaign confirmed that Kamala said no after being invited on the Joe Rogan podcast, claiming the invitation was turned down due to a “scheduling” issue,” despite her being in Texas today where Rogan’s podcast is based.

“Well yeah, I think that the Vice President’s happy to go anywhere and any place to talk to a broad segment of the country,” said Sams, before admitting that she wasn’t prepared to go to Texas to speak with Rogan.
“We talked with Rogan and his team about the podcast, unfortunately it isn’t going to work out right now because of the scheduling of this period of the campaign,” he added.

That’s a little odd given that Rogan’s podcast is based in Austin, Texas and Kamala will be in Houston Texas later today to appear at a rally alongside Beyoncé.
Houston is just a two and a half hour drive from Austin.
While the clash may be explained by Donald Trump recording a show with Rogan on Friday, it’s unclear why Harris couldn’t have just stayed in Texas and recorded the podcast the next day given the show’s massive audience.
It’s also possible that two podcasts could have been recorded on the same day, but apparently Harris isn’t that bothered about appearing on Rogan’s show.
As we previously speculated, it was always going to be unlikely that Kamala would want to sit down with Rogan for an elongated length of time given that she isn’t really known for her skills when it comes to nuanced, long format conversations.
Rogan’s podcast has a combined Instagram, Spotify and YouTube audience of over 50 million followers, making it the most watched/heard podcast on the planet.
Elon Musk’s first appearance on the show attracted over 68 million viewers on YouTube alone.
Harris has faced sustained criticism for doing barely any adversarial interviews, with the only real test for her so far coming in the form of a 25 minute conversation with Fox News’ Bret Baier, which didn’t go down too well.

Zerohedge,"""Who Will Be More Servile To Israel: Trump Or Kamala?"" ZH Debate With Michael Tracey, Harrison Smith","Many Americans are tired of the fruits of their labor being stolen to finance mass slaughter. Neither Trump nor Kamala have indicated their intent to diverge from the status quo when it comes to Israel. So the question at the center of today’s ZeroHedge debate: Who will be worse?
Independent journalist Michael Tracey, arguing Trump will be the “most fanatically pro-Israel” President ever, faced off with Harrison Smith of InfoWars who argued the former POTUS is playing politics and cannot be materially worse than the Biden-Harris coterie. Moderated by Liam McCollum of the “Human ReAction Podcast” and Mises Institute.
Full discussion below:
“Trump is the peace President.”
Keeping faith in Trump’s anti-war instincts, Smith pointed to the former President’s tendency to rebuff entrenched foreign policy officials, which — while imperfect — is preferable to the Deep State on autopilot.
Smith: “Trump is the peace president. That much is obvious. Kamala Harris is purely a puppet of the establishment, which is in totality Israeli-controlled at that level when it comes to the State Department and foreign policy.”
“You're either voting for the puppet of the Israeli lobby or somebody — who participates in their scheme sometimes — but has also shown and proven that he has the ability to defy their greatest and largest goals.”
— ZeroHedge Debates (@zerohedgeDebate) October 29, 2024
Democrats Aren’t Pro-Israel Enough!
Tracey dismissed this as wishful thinking that is misaligned with Trump’s record in office and current rhetoric, which at times is markedly more radical than Kamala’s:
Tracey: “Trump is running on the most fanatically pro-Israel platform of any major candidate ever.”
“[Biden and Harris] have supplied more armaments to Israel than any administration ever. Trump denounces them as not doing enough and actually catering to Hamas. What else are we to draw from that? Trump goes around explicitly stating that he gave his pro-Israel donors all the policy initiatives that they had ever sought.”
— ZeroHedge Debates (@zerohedgeDebate) October 29, 2024
But moving the U.S. embassy and “recognizing” the Golan Heights — the major first-term moves Trump touts — are a far cry from genocide, argued Smith, categorizing them as “symbolic” yet largley insignificant.
Smith: “It's what Trump does. They're the low hanging fruit. They're just things that he could do that would make these people happy that wouldn't change anything on the ground. That wouldn't exacerbate any conflict. That wouldn't cause any war.”
No War With Iran
In a recent interview with comedian Tim Dillion, Vice Presidential Nominee JD Vance said that Israel and the United States sometimes have “distinct interests” and that it is “very much” in U.S. interests to avoid war with Iran. Vance bolstered the former POTUS’s comments from the previous week to podcast host Patrick Bet David, when Trump eschewed PBD’s insistence on regime change in Iran.
Smith highlighted these — very recent — exchanges as more evidence of the restraint exhibited by MAGA as compared to the establishments wings of both parties:
— ZeroHedge Debates (@zerohedgeDebate) October 29, 2024
Dovish sentiment aside, Trump is still heavily backed by hawkish GOP members like Tom Cotton and Marco Rubio as well as die-hard zionist religious fanatics.
Tracey: “Trump, however, has aligned himself more with those genuinely messianic religious elements… One of the Rabbis that stood beside Trump said that he wants to build a Third Temple, and he views Trump as the vessel for accomplishing that.”

Zerohedge,76% Of Americans Are Worried About Post-Election Violence: Poll,"Authored by Tom Ozimek via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),
A new poll shows that the vast majority of Americans are at least somewhat worried about a possible outbreak of violence following the fast-approaching Nov. 5 presidential election.
The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll, released on Oct. 28, found that 41 percent of registered voters were “extremely” or “very” concerned about post-election political violence, with another 35 percent saying they are “somewhat” concerned about an outbreak of unrest after Election Day.
A higher percentage of Americans (82 percent) said they were at least “somewhat” concerned about increased political violence directed at election officials or political figures. The specter of violence has hung over much of the presidential campaign due to two assassination attempts against former President Donald Trump, while President Joe Biden said recently he’s confident the election will be “free and fair” but is unsure whether it will be “peaceful.”
The findings of the AP-NORC survey align with the results of a recent Scripps News/Ipsos poll, which showed that 62 percent of Americans believe that an outbreak of post-election violence is at least “somewhat” likely. At the same time, over half (51 percent) of those polled by Scripps News/Ipsos said they would support using the U.S. military to prevent election-related violence, including 61 percent of Republicans.
The use of the U.S. military to respond to political violence has become a heated topic of discussion in recent weeks after Trump said he wasn’t concerned about election-related violence because, if chaos were to truly break out, the National Guard—or even regular military units—could step in to restore order.
“I think it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military, because they can’t let that happen,” Trump said in an Oct. 13 interview with Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo, in response to a question about the potential for an outbreak of election-related violence. The former president added that he wasn’t worried about potential Election Day chaos being fomented by his supporters or foreign actors, but instead by people he labeled “radical left lunatics” and the “enemy from within.”
Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign seized on Trump’s remarks, saying that Americans should find them alarming.
“Trump is suggesting that his fellow Americans are worse ‘enemies’ than foreign adversaries, and he is saying he would use the military against them,” Ian Sams, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, said in a statement.
Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), dismissed those concerns as unfounded campaign rhetoric. In an Oct. 27 interview on CNN, Vance said that when Trump spoke about using the U.S. military against the “enemy from within” he was not referring to political opponents but to extreme cases like the far-left activists who “burn down our cities,” referring to the chaos that engulfed parts of the country in the summer of 2020 following the death of George Floyd.
The poll showing a growing public concern about election-related violence was released with just eight days of campaigning left before Election Day. Over 45 million early votes have already been cast.
Meanwhile, the vast majority—92 percent—of local election officials have taken steps to increase security for poll workers, election infrastructure, and voters ahead of the 2024 election, according to a survey conducted earlier this year. The survey also showed that election-related safety concerns have reached or exceeded levels recorded in the prior election cycle.",2024-10-30

Zerohedge,Election Battles For State Legislature Supermajorities Heat Up,"Authored by Austin Alonzo via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),
While Congress stagnates, America’s state houses are drafting and passing policies affecting millions. Now, more than ever, those legislative bodies operate without input from an opposition party or dissenting governor.
As of Oct. 21, there are 23 Republican trifectas, 17 Democratic trifectas, and 10 divided governments where neither party holds trifecta control, according to Ballotpedia. A trifecta means one party holds the state governorship and a majority in the state house and senate.
Heading into November’s general election, legislative supermajorities exist in 57 of the 99 legislative chambers in the union, according to data compiled by state and local government consultancy Stateside.
Republicans hold 41 of those veto-proof advantages, while Democrats own 20. All told, there is a partisan supermajority in at least one house of the Legislature in 35 of the 50 states.
However, in 14 of those states, the supermajority is held by an advantage of three seats or less. Michael Behm, Stateside’s co-CEO and principal, told The Epoch Times that organizations aligned with the Democratic and Republican parties are spending heavily on down-ballot races that could make or break a supermajority in the coming legislative term.
Even though voter interest is low in statehouse races compared with high-profile campaigns for national offices, Behm and others who spoke with The Epoch Times said the stakes are high. Most of the legislative actions that affect the public, such as policy on abortions, education, energy, health care, taxes, and transportation, come from decisions made in statehouses.
“With the federal government being so polarized and hamstrung these days, the action is at the state level,” Behm said.
Supermajorities
The definition of a supermajority varies from state to state. Generally, attaining a supermajority means a state legislative body has enough members from one party to pass laws without any votes from the minority party and enough votes to override the governor’s vetoes.
Heading into the 2024 general election, Republicans hold a supermajority in both houses of the state Legislature in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming.
Additionally, Republicans hold a supermajority in one chamber of the Legislature in Iowa, Mississippi, and South Carolina.
Democrats own a supermajority in both houses of the state Legislature in California, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, and Rhode Island. Democrats have a supermajority in one chamber of the state Legislatures of Colorado, Connecticut, and Nevada.
Behm said that’s the largest number of supermajorities he has ever observed in state legislatures. Ideologically, the domination of the legislatures by a single party reflects intense political polarization in these states, he said.
Chris Cooper, director of the Haire Institute for Public Policy at Western Carolina University, said a supermajority effectively limits the governor’s power to carry out policy priorities in a state with a divided government.
Four governors—Kansas’s Laura Kelly, Kentucky’s Andy Beshear, North Carolina’s Roy Cooper, and Vermont’s Phil Scott—preside over divided state governments in which the opposition party holds a legislative supermajority.
The four governors’ legislatures stripped them of much of their policymaking potency. In June, Scott, a Republican, told members of the news media, “I think the power has gotten to their head,” referring to the Democrat-controlled Vermont General Assembly’s overriding of six of his vetoes in a single override session.
In North Carolina, a supermajority almost wholly nullifies the will of a governor who already commands limited influence under the state’s constitution, Chris Cooper said.
With their supermajority, Republicans passed new abortion restrictions, drafted new election laws, and further throttled back Gov. Roy Cooper’s power during the most recent legislative session.
“They have taken away appointment power from the North Carolina governor,” Chris Cooper said. “They have made a number of changes that make the already powerful state Legislature into something even more powerful.”
National Efforts
Behm said the rise of legislative supermajorities can be attributed to growing involvement from national partisan groups known as 527 organizations. These are tax-exempt entities that can receive and spend unlimited amounts of money to influence federal, state, and local politics and elections.
Three decades ago, statehouse races were usually local contests directed and financed by city and state chambers of commerce, unions, and other parochial political organizations, Behm said. Now, national groups such as the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC) and Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC) invest vast national resources into the state’s legislative caucuses.
Behm said both party committees use professionals to recruit candidates and organize the partisan campaigns designed to build majorities in statehouses.
“These 527 groups have turned state legislative races into national races,” Behm said.
Chris Cooper said Republicans began to take over the statehouses in 2010 when the Republican Party introduced an initiative known as Project REDMAP. The plan called for investing huge sums into state legislative races that were previously overlooked in Washington and flipping chambers to the GOP.
“They did as advertised,” he said. “They turned maps red.”

Zerohedge,The Changed Meaning Of Nationalism,"Few words in the English language have such migratory meanings as nationalism.
It has changed again in our time.
Today it suggests self-determination of peoples against a growing global hegemon in a range of areas from finance to agriculture to health to the uses of the military and surveillance.
Those who call themselves nationalists affirm the rights of a people in a defined geography to manage their own lives apart from impositions of the neoliberal order, which is deeply weakened as compared with a decade ago.
The book that set this recent change in motion is “The Virtue of Nationalism” by Yoram Hazony, published in 2018.
He argues that nationalism—a wide diversity of governing principles among sovereign nations—is essential for the preservation of freedom, tradition, and cultural meaning. It is not aggressive but merely protective, a barrier to impositions by international agencies, manipulative finance, and a howling secular media. The book became a sensation among conservatives mainly because it broke a taboo of the use of the term.
When I first read it, I was fully prepared to oppose the idea. Having been intellectually shaped in a period of the old consensus, I had presumed that all forms of nationalism have a toxic root as compared with the aspiration of universal human rights and global cultural norms. The experience of pandemic controls, imposed simultaneously the world over, shifted my own views because it was a paradigmatic case of the illiberalism of globalism. No longer did internationalism imply freedom; quite the opposite. This experience forced me to consider what I might have missed.
There were only three nations that resisted compulsory measures such as lockdowns, business closures, population masking, and then shot mandates. They were Sweden, Tanzania, and Nicaragua.
In each case, the reason came down to some form of: that is not how we do that here. Sweden embraced traditional public health principles. Nicaragua said that lockdowns would harm their people. Tanzania rejected lockdowns because something seemed sketchy about the whole scheme.
World media howled in fury at these three nations, hoping for failure from them all, as if to punish any country that dared to go a different way.
All three ended up with similar or better health outcomes without having destroyed their citizens’ lives or trampling on rights and liberties in law. In practical terms, the COVID response wrecked the association many people (including me) held between globalism and freedom.
Globalism today is more likely to be seen as a danger not only to sovereignty but also to the rights of peoples.
The controversy over nationalism began in the late 19th century as multinational empires began to fall apart and new nations were formed out of language groups, ethnicities, and religious groupings in France, Germany, Spain, and Italy. To shore up the status of the remnants of the Holy Roman Empire under ecclesiastical control was the whole point of the calling of the first Vatican Council in 1869. The Pope sought affirmation of his own political infallibility in order to retain the Papal states, but that effort failed (the council only affirmed doctrinal infallibility under rare conditions). A century later, a second Vatican Council made the point and affirmed the rights of religious liberty.
In between those two periods, the meaning of nationalism shifted one way then another. The great theorist of nationalism in the late 19th century was Ernst Renan and his famous speech “What Is a Nation?” (1882). The essay still holds up as a long history of the idea of the nation, and sets forth reasonable parameters concerning central principles of organizing them. He delineates five factors: religion, language, territory, heritage, and ethnicity (race), each of which can be benign or threatening depending on circumstances.
The essay was just what was needed at these times, and ended up having great influence following the Great War, which finally ended shattering the Habsburg and Prussia monarchies and codifying democracy as the preferred political system. Russia’s revolution introduced further trauma as that monarchy too collapsed. Looking back, it is a wonder that the UK monarchy served the period at all but it was only through making every compromise possible with parliamentary control plus the affirmation of religious liberty.
The self-determination of nations became the central slogan of postwar policy, a slogan pushed by the Woodrow Wilson administration as the map of Europe was redrawn in ways that proved unsustainable. Nonetheless, in those years, nationalism was regarded as benign and even necessary for peace, even as elites rallied around new globalist institutions such as the League of Nations as guarantors of the principle of non-aggression. Self-determination generally affirmed the right of a people to govern themselves through plebiscite.
Article 22 of the League of Nations said:
“To those colonies and territories which as a consequence of the late war have ceased to be under the sovereignty of the States which formerly governed them and which are inhabited by peoples not yet able to stand by themselves under the strenuous conditions of the modern world, there should be applied the principle that the well-being and development of such peoples form a sacred trust of civilisation ...”
The controversies over nationalism were hardly finished, however, as democratic institutions in Germany collapsed following economic crisis and political upheaval. What took its place was the aggressive nationalism of the Nazi Party together with the rise of Imperial Japan, leading to a repeat and intensification of the first world war. Out of this experience came the discrediting of the nationalist idea, particularly as it pertained to race and language. The German attempt to cobble together a racial state out of lost territory had plunged the world into the most murderous conflict in the history of humanity.
Following the war, globalism took center stage again with the creation of the International Monetary Fund, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the World Bank, and the United Nations, while multinational alliances dominated much of the world. Nationalism was discredited yet again, and that’s where we stood for the better part of four decades. The crackup of the Soviet Union and its satellites changed the constellation yet again, as break-off states recaptured their historic names and many peoples in the world found new meaning in national identity.
Since 1990, the struggle between globalism and nationalism has been a defining feature of world politics but it took time to hit Western industrialized democracies. With the UK decision to withdraw from the European Union, a new nationalism took hold that was resisted strongly by globalist ambitions.
Was the new nationalism liberal? That’s a complicated question. In places yes, and, in places, no. The drive toward immigration restriction was an inevitable consequence of refugee upheavals all over Europe and the United States. The push to repudiate the World Trade Organization’s ambition for a tariff-free world came after decades of industrial loss. All of this was already taking place when the pandemic controls hit with stunning ferocity, as the World Health Organization imposed experimental methods of virus control—as if governments could somehow conquer the microbial kingdom through force.
The bitter combination of lockdowns, the refugee crisis, and sketchy plans for zero emissions that threaten industrialization itself kicked the nationalist spirit into overdrive, as populist movements have swept the world. The two sides have lined up in predictable ways: those advocating sovereignty and those wanting to preserve what remains of the neoliberal order. That is the essential dynamic of our times.
Where does that leave freedom lovers in their opinions about nationalism? It puts us where we were back in the 1880s with Renan’s outlook: whether and to what extent freedom is best guaranteed by the national principle depends on time and place. Regardless, based on what we are seeing in politics today, there is no stopping the eventual replacement of the neoliberal order with a world of sovereign nations, some liberal and some not.

Zerohedge,What 2016 And 2020 Polling Reveals About This Year's Election,"Authored by Austin Alonzo via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),
With less than two weeks until the general election, former President Donald Trump is performing significantly better in national and battleground state polling than he did in both 2016 and 2020.
According to an average of national polls compiled and published by RealClearPolitics on Oct. 22, Trump is trailing Harris by less than a percentage point.
On the same day in 2020, Trump trailed President Joe Biden by 7.9 percentage points.
In 2016, he trailed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by 6.1 points.

✅Popular vote
At this point in 2016, Hillary had a 6 point lead in the popular vote, Biden had a 9 point lead but Kamala Harris is just up by 1.pic.twitter.com/4Jl8O4TMbp
Trump, who’s making his third run for the White House, ultimately lost the popular vote in both 2016 and 2020.
The polling averages published on Oct. 22 show Trump led the Democratic Party’s candidate in all seven battleground states—Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin—that may well decide the outcome of the Electoral College.
The former president is performing better in each state than he did in 2016 and 2020.
Top pollsters in the United States say this could be interpreted as a sign that polls are doing a better job of capturing the on-the-ground sentiment of voters than they had in the past two presidential elections.
They also said the polling is a significant indicator that Trump is running a close race with Vice President Kamala Harris and may well have the advantage heading into Election Day.
“It is a dramatically even race,” Don Levy, the director of the Siena College Research Institute, told The Epoch Times. “[It’s] far more tightly contested according to polling than the last couple of elections.”
“Right now, he looks very much more viable than he did in 2016 and 2020,” David Paleologos, the director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center, told The Epoch Times.

— Eric Daugherty (@EricLDaugh) October 25, 2024
Mark Mitchell, Rasmussen Reports’ head pollster, said his polls indicate that “Trump is locked in to win the national popular vote.”
Methodology Improvements
In his past two runs, Trump exceeded the expectations set by statewide polling in the seven battleground states.
According to a comparison of the final vote count published by each state’s election authorities and each state’s average polling about two weeks before Election Day, Trump overperformed polling by about 5.8 percentage points in 2016.
Clinton was projected to win all seven states except Georgia in 2016. Trump won all but Nevada.
In 2020, the projections were more accurate.
Trump beat his polling by about 3.2 percentage points. However, Biden was projected to win all seven swing states, and he took them all but North Carolina.
Levy and Paleologos told The Epoch Times that major pollsters improved their methodologies in the years following 2016 and 2020.
“There simply wasn’t a tremendous amount of high-quality state-level polling in 2016,” Levy said.
Siena, which publishes its polls in partnership with the New York Times, examined what went wrong in 2016 and tried to correct it in the following election years.
Specifically, Levy said statewide polls undercounted Trump supporters because they did not recognize the demographics that back Trump.
First, there is a significant political divide between those who have a four-year college degree and those who do not.
Second, there is a similar gap between urban voters and rural voters.
The more educated voters living in cities and suburbs tend to vote Democrat more often than other Americans, Levy said.
This is especially true in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.
In retrospect, Levy said, his organization’s 2016 polling—and those conducted by other prestigious pollsters—didn’t properly sample the right populations or weigh their responses appropriately.
In 2020, Levy said, pollsters using telephone surveys likely oversampled Democrat voters and undersampled Republican voters.
He said white-collar employees working from home were more likely to answer the phone and complete a survey than blue-collar workers who stayed on-site through the pandemic.
Moreover, Trump supporters were more likely to answer only some of the questions in a survey than those voting for the Democratic candidate.
If they had not completed the survey, their answers may not have been included in the final report.
Had they included those partial responses, Levy said polls would have been notably more accurate.
In 2024, Siena changed how it weighed answers, enacted strict quotas to reach the right demographics needed to produce an accurate sample, including partial responses, and called people back as much as possible in order to collect the opinions of the harder-to-reach respondents.
Based on what he’s seeing from other “high-quality polls,” there is significantly less variance in overall polling this year than there was in previous elections. This indicates pollsters across the board are learning from their mistakes.
“We either are going to be more accurate, or we have again systemically failed to capture some hidden trend within the electorate,” Levy said.
Confidence in Polling
Trump’s odds-defying victory shook public confidence in political polling.
Despite past failures, Paleologos said he believes Americans should continue to trust polls published by reputable organizations with a long track record of success.
However, in 2024, more polls than ever before are being published by organizations that may not use the same quality of sampling methods as more reputable pollsters.
“Polls that are published in 2024 include all of the apples, not just the good apples,” Paleologos said. “[Averages include] the bad apples and the rotten apples.”",2024-10-25
Zerohedge,The Political Theology That Maintains State Power,"For religions throughout the world, established rules, studies, and practices are instrumental for their legitimacy. Established religious institutions throughout the world train theologians to study the nature of God and their belief system. For the Sunni Muslims, theologians in the Hanafi school consist of legal studies in line with Islam, while others like the Murji’ah sect focus on moral teachings of work and faith. Catholics too prescribe specialized areas of study to theologians, whether that be social teachings on leading a moral life or supernatural studies of God.
Whatever the case, each of these studies offers legitimacy to the faith and to the clergy, so the state, in all its omnipotence, follows suit. The late German jurist Carl Schmitt held that the “omnipotent state” practices its legitimacy similarly.
Writing in his book, Political Theology, that “all significant concepts of the modern theory of the state are secularized theological concepts.”
As the age of monarchs came to a close in the early 20th century and the age of massive ideological states came into play, new concepts and ideas had to be developed, as they did not have a “mandate of heaven” to legitimize their power.
The United States government, for instance, has had an army of academics, experts, and celebrities to legitimize its actions.
Their political theology consists of some of the following: economics, law, and the hard sciences.
Analyzing these concepts, we can see how the state and its clergy weaponize them in order to maintain their power.
Economics
In 1994, Charlie Rose interviewed the British businessman James Goldsmith. Sir Goldsmith was campaigning in the European Union against the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), a component of the WTO agreement. In 1995, 125 countries had signed onto the agreement, which included agricultural subsidies. Goldsmith warned in the interview that this would lead to massive emigration from third-world countries and that people in western society had come to serve an economic index that harms them.
He claimed that, if the GATT were adopted, we would be:
Creating mass immigration, which none of us could control. We would be destroying the towns, which are already largely destroyed. Look at Mexico; look at our own towns, and we’re doing this for economic dogma because we’ve got to get it done by the end of December. We can’t wait another year or two to see the results. Otherwise some political gimmick like Fast Track will go out of the way. What is this nonsense? Everything is based in our modern society on improving an economic index. How do we get greater economic growth? How do we grow the GNP? The result is, we are destroying the stability of our societies because we are worshiping the wrong god, economic index.
It is economic orthodoxy today that GDP must grow and that financial stimulus is one way of doing this. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States government issued stimulus checks from the low of $600 to a high of $1,400 per person. Assistant professor Christina Patterson of the University of Chicago suggested that when Congress pumped the money into the economy during COVID, the highest growth came from the individual household. Her suggestion: “Lawmakers should give the money to people who will spend most of it, rather than sock it away in savings.”
To suggest that the COVID stimulus grew the economy is preposterous. Some of the real effects of the “stimulus” are as follows: nearly 7,000 firms are considered “zombie firms” that are laden with debt, an increase of 30 percent over the last ten years; the average price inflation rate in 2022 was 8 percent, with a high of 9.1 percent in June 2022; grocery prices increased by 20 percent. The inflationary expansion of the money supply and adjustment of interest rates by the Federal Reserve during this time caused the increase in prices. The Federal Reserve propping up the stock market led to the rise of zombie firms because of malinvestment, but mainstream economists refuse to believe their orthodoxy is wrong.
Law
The United States has prided itself on being a land of law, where the rule of law reigns supreme and all its subjects, even the president, cannot usurp it. This is an illusion in our current political theology. America’s “supreme law of the land,” the Constitution, has been nothing more than a suggestion for much of its history. Whether that be censorship against the freedom of speech and press, as seen with the Espionage Act of 1917, or with the illegal mass surveillance by the NSA as exposed by Edward Snowden in 2013. Each case violated amendments in the Constitution, the 1st and 4th respectfully. Despite the controversy, the Espionage Act is still in effect and Edward Snowden is in exile in Russia.
Despite this, the establishment is still unwavering in their claims of being defenders of American law and democracy. What they’re really defending is their so-called mandate of heaven. Just as the Chinese Emperors had this supernatural mandate, the president, the Congress, and the bureaucrats each have the supernatural concept of “law” on their side. Hugo Krabbe, a Dutch political scientist, developed an explanation for the legitimacy of constitutional law in his book The Modern Idea of the State, saying:
We no longer live under the dominion of persons, either natural or fictitious legal persons, but under the dominion of norms [laws], of spiritual forces. In this is revealed the modern idea of the state…. These forces rule in the strictest sense of the word. Obedience can be freely rendered to these forces, for the very reason that they do proceed from the spiritual nature of mankind. (italics in original)
The entire constitutional legal order is, therefore, based on man’s sense of right and wrong. Just as Moses took down the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai to the Israelites, so do we receive the law from the politicians on Capitol Hill and in the halls of bureaucratic departments. This is how the American establishment is able to maintain its power, by linking their positions of authority to American “morality” that they claim is linked to the law. Any attack against them or to the law is a threat to the American way of life and the regime will use all the means at its disposal to silence you. The former British PM, Tony Blair, had described himself and all who govern as a Moses-like figure in his book, On Leadership. He had stated:
I liken governing to leading people on a journey. You don’t just start by stepping out. You begin with a description of the destination—the house on the hill you might call it.... Think of Moses and the Exodus from Egypt. You might have thought that since he was leading his people out slavery and oppression, they would have been perpetually grateful. But they weren’t. They complained bitterly much of the time. They dissented. They rebelled. They frequently averred that they would have been better off if he had just left them where they were.
Many of the bureaucrats that rule, whether from places such as London, Brussels, or Washington DC, have a Messiah complex. All they do is for the benefit of the democratic system and, therefore, the whole Western world. From here, the regime can continue to manage its economy and wars without interference, as James Burnham said in his book The Managerial Revolution:
They proclaim the rules, make the law, issue the decrees. The shift from parliament to the bureaus occurs on a world scale. The actual directing and administrative work of the bureaus is carried on by new men, a new type of men. It is, specifically, the MANAGERIAL type. The active heads of the bureaus are the managers-in-government, the same, or nearly the same, in training, functions, skills, habits of thought as the managers-in-industry.
Because of the form the law has taken, we’re no longer ruled; we’re administered. The term “law and order” becomes merely a tool to contain what Carl Schmitt has called the “exception.” When the current regime finds the state of things abnormal, they can declare war on it. Whether they be abstract concepts such as “disinformation,” against populists like Donald Trump, or against ideologies like “fascism” and white supremacy.
Conclusion
In the past, kings could legitimize their power through alliances with a church or spiritual leader to show that their rule was established by a higher authority, an alliance of the throne and altar.
Today, politicians and bureaucrats use the “sciences” and their experts to establish their authority.
Economists at the Federal Reserve and IMF fund the government’s schemes, judges support laws via theories that violate the Constitution, and you, while dissenting, will follow the “new Moses” to the house on the hill.",2024-10-28

EU President Ursula von der Leyen just joined the ranks of former Senator John Kerry and other globalist ghouls in declaring war on free speech by perversely proclaiming that the EU citizenry needs to be “vaccinated against disinformation.”
Like every censor in history, she characterizes her censorship program as a means of expunging erroneous information and ideas from public discourse. By using the word “disinformation,” she implies that she and her clique are already the sole possessors of the truth about everything, and that everyone who has and shares heterodox ideas is necessarily in error.
Her entire premise is FALSE for the following reasons:
1). Knowledge about the world is constantly evolving through constant inquiry, discussion, and dissemination. Knowledge is NOT a static thing. This is why countries with stifling censorship regimes have experienced intellectual, scientific, and artistic stagnation. Their rulers try to freeze the human mind in its state at their moment in history.
2). NO state, university, or ecclesiastical committee has ever been in possession of the full truth of any matter. Official orthodoxies have always been challenged by heterodox thinkers. Indeed, virtually every major advance in human insight has been performed by heterodox thinkers.
3). As John Milton observed in his 1644 pamphlet, Areopagitica, contending with error is an intrinsic part of learning and discovery. We literally learn by making mistakes and correcting them. If free speech is suppressed for the objective of preventing the propagation of erroneous thought—or “vaccinating against it”—it will become extremely difficult if not impossible for people to learn and discover.
4). Without a single exception in history, the people who hold power always advocate the orthodoxy that sustains and extends their power and that of their friends and supporters.
Ursula von der Leyen is the quintessence of this principle.

Zerohedge,Judge Throws Out Vote Payment Allegations Against Elon Musk,"A federal judge has turned away allegations that billionaire Elon Musk violated the law when he started giving $1 million away to registered voters.
California resident Aaron Greenspan in a lawsuit filed over the summer accused Musk of violating state laws and the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. In a recent emergency motion, Greenspan, who founded the company PlainSite, said Musk’s newly announced million-dollar giveaways to voters in swing states violated federal law that prohibits paying or offering to pay people to either register to vote or vote.
Greenspan said that Musk, who has endorsed former President Donald Trump, should not be “permitted to continually violate federal law and swing the election.” He asked the court to order Musk to stop violating the law.
U.S. District Judge Maxine M. Chesney on Oct. 22 denied the motion.
She pointed to a decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit that concluded there must be a relationship between an injury claimed in a motion for injunctive relief and the conduct asserted in the underlying lawsuit.
“Here, the injury claimed is unrelated to the conduct alleged in the complaint and the relief sought therein,” Chesney said.
Musk’s lawyers noted that the giveaways were only open to people who signed a petition in favor of free speech and the right to bear arms and that the petition itself says it is only open to registered voters in swing states such as Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
“Plaintiff’s motion fails for numerous reasons, including that Plaintiff has no standing, the requested relief bears no relationship to Plaintiff’s complaint, and Plaintiff fails to meet his burden to establish a private right of action under Section 10307(c),” the lawyers said.
“Even if the Court were inclined to consider the merits, Plaintiff does not establish any of the elements required to obtain emergency relief. He fails to show he is likely to prevail on his claims; he does not establish a likelihood of imminent, particularized harm; and, rather than show that the balance of equities and public interest favor his position, he seeks a prohibited prior restraint on Musk’s political speech, including through a vague demand to enjoin ‘interfering with the voting preferences of any individual.’”
Musk’s political action committee on Thursday gave away $1 million to a Wisconsin man, and $1 million more to a Michigan man.",2024-10-26

Zerohedge,Jury: Workers Fired For Refusing COVID-19 Vaccine To Get More Than $1 Million Each,"Authored by Jack Phillips via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),
Rail transit officials in California’s Bay Area have been ordered to pay more than $7 million to transit workers who were fired because they refused to get a COVID-19 vaccine years ago.
On Oct. 23, a federal jury in the U.S District Court for the Northern District of California sided with six former San Francisco Bay Area Regional Transit (BART) workers who had refused to get the vaccine for religious purposes.
BART was ordered to pay the group more than $7.8 million, with each individual receiving between $1.2 million and $1.5 million, the Pacific Justice Institute, which represented the transit workers in the trial, said in a statement on Oct. 24. The institute, a law firm representing the six former employees since 2022, said the eight-person jury deliberated for two days this week before returning the verdict that awarded the employees the compensation.
About a week ago, the federal jury also determined that BART had failed to prove that it suffered an undue hardship by denying accommodations to the ex-employees in the case.
On Oct. 23, the jury further found that the six employees met the burden of showing that there was a conflict between their religious beliefs and the BART vaccine mandate, which was implemented in 2021.
According to the law firm, the jury also agreed with the figures that the plaintiffs had provided for lost wages that they had suffered after losing their jobs. The jury then added $1 million each to those figures, the firm said, describing the verdict as a “legal earthquake.”
“The rail employees chose to lose their livelihood rather than deny their faith. That in itself shows the sincerity and depth of their convictions,“ Kevin Snider, the Pacific Justice Institute’s chief counsel, who served as lead trial attorney, said. ”After nearly three years of struggle, these essential workers feel they were heard and understood by the jury and are overjoyed and relieved by the verdict.”
The law firm stated: “During the trial, jurors heard compelling testimony from dedicated employees. One of the plaintiffs had worked for more than 30 years for BART, with a stretch of 10 years perfect attendance, before being unceremoniously dismissed. Another had been out on workers comp for months, with no scheduled return date, when she was fired.”
Lawyers for BART argued that multiple employees who had conflicts with receiving the vaccine had secular—rather than religious—reasons. But the jury disagreed with those arguments, the Pacific Justice Institute said.
The vaccine mandate was approved by BART’s board of directors in October 2021 and stipulated that all employees must get the COVID-19 vaccine. It allowed some employees to be exempt from the vaccine, including for religious reasons.
A year later, BART employees filed a class-action lawsuit accusing the operator of denying religious accommodations that violated state law.
U.S. District Judge William Alsup, who presided over the lawsuit against BART, ruled that the operator’s policies did not violate the employees’ right to religious freedom, according to an order he issued in March.
A separate order issued by Alsup in January found that BART received 188 requests for a religious exemption and accommodation, and of that figure, 40 chose not to complete the process. They were either terminated from employment or ultimately got the vaccine.
“Plaintiffs’ putative class fails because its members have little in common beyond their request for religious accommodation,” the judge further said in his order. “They do not share a common religious objection. They do not share a vocation or a set of contractual rights. They do not present a similar set of potential accommodations and associated burdens. They do not present similar health and exposure concerns.
“Potential accommodations do not impact the same pool of coworkers. Those coworkers do not have the same bargained-for rights.”
The Epoch Times contacted BART for comment on Oct. 25 but received no reply by publication time. The rail operator’s spokesman, James Allison, told local news outlet SFGate that it had “no comment” on the verdict.",2024-10-27
Zerohedge,Owners Of Ship Involved In Baltimore Bridge Collapse Settle DOJ Lawsuit For $100 Million,"The owner and operator of the cargo ship that caused a Baltimore bridge collapse has agreed to pay nearly $102 million to settle a civil lawsuit with the Department of Justice, the DOJ announced Thursday.
The Dali collided with one of the columns of the Francis Scott Key bridge in March, after the ship suffered mechanical issues, which caused the bridge to collapse and kill six workers.
The incident forced Baltimore to close its port and federal channel for months, which slowed commercial shipping traffic that flowed through Maryland's largest city.
As The Epoch Times' Caden Pearson reports, the DOJ announced the settlement with Grace Ocean and Synergy Marine, the owners and operators of the Motor Vessel Dali, on Oct. 24.
The deal resolves a portion of the legal dispute that began in September when the DOJ sued the companies for damages linked to the federal government’s response to the incident.
The $101.9 million settlement will cover the federal government’s costs for cleaning up the wreckage and reopening the port. However, it does not address the cost of rebuilding the bridge itself, which the state of Maryland is pursuing in a separate claim.
“Thanks to the hard work of the Justice Department attorneys since day one of this disaster, we were able to secure this early settlement of our claim, just over one month into litigation,” Benjamin Mizer, principal deputy associate attorney general, said in a statement.
“This resolution ensures that the costs of the federal government’s cleanup efforts in the Fort McHenry Channel are borne by Grace Ocean and Synergy and not the American taxpayer.”
In a separate move, Grace Ocean has already paid nearly $100,000 to the Coast Guard to address the oil spill threat caused by the wreck.
“This is a tremendous outcome that fully compensates the United States for the costs it incurred in responding to this disaster and holds the owner and operator of the Dali accountable,” said Brian Boynton, principal deputy assistant attorney general at the DOJ.
The disaster occurred on March 26 when the Motor Vessel Dali lost power while departing the Port of Baltimore for Sri Lanka.
After regaining and then losing power again, the ship struck the Francis Scott Key Bridge, causing it to collapse into the water below.
The collapse halted shipping traffic in and out of the port for weeks and severed a critical highway connection.
Federal, state, and local agencies worked together to clear over 50,000 tons of debris from the water. Shipping resumed by June after temporary channels were created to ease the jam.
The $100 million settlement does seem a little shy of the estimates of the costs involved in rebuilding the bridge.
As Shailen Bhatt, administrator of the Federal Highway Administration, confirmed to lawmakers in May, a preliminary estimate to replace the bridge at $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. It will take four years to construct, with completion estimated to come sometime in 2028, he said.
So while they may claim the ""American taxpayer"" is off the hook, we suspect that is another lie (because the optics would be bad).",2024-10-25
Zerohedge,Who Is Actually Running The Country?,"Members of both American political parties and other concerned observers have been asking for a while now, ""Who's actually running the country?""
John Richardson, via The Gatestone Institute, says some answers include:
Former President Barack Obama, who, in November 2020, said on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert:
""People would ask me, knowing what you know now, do you wish you had a third term? And I used to say, ""You know what? If I could make an arrangement where I had a stand-in, a front man or front woman, and they had an earpiece in, and I was just in my basement in my sweats looking through the stuff, and then I could sort of deliver the lines, but somebody else was doing all the talking and ceremony, I'd be fine with that.""
George Soros, of whom the journalist Wayne Allen Root wrote:
""Obama take his marching orders from George Soros.""
The Chinese Communist Party, about whom Root wrote:
""[T]he real power behind the throne. The boss of bosses. The capo di tutti. China and the Chinese Communist Party. Everyone is taking orders from China and the CCP. China bribes all the politicians in America and around the world with billions in offshore bank accounts. China owns Biden and his family. China owns virtually the entire leadership of the Democratic Party -- and quite a few establishment RINO Republicans, too.... It's easy to see China is the top dog. You'd have to be blind, deaf or really dumb to not see that. Everything happening ... just happens to weaken and divide America while benefiting China.""
And of course Jill Biden, who was recently asked by the president to chair a Cabinet meeting.
More often, it seems, it is a cadre of unelected bureaucrats – a faceless politburo – who uphold the law or not, according to political expediency or whim.
American author and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has called this group ""a machine.""
Are ""open borders"" legal or not? Are immigration laws being violated or not? Are illegal aliens, then, legal or not? Are prosecutions of presidential candidates within a month of a presidential election ""election interference"" or not? Were the deliberate lies of former US intelligence officials to the US public about the authenticity of Hunter Biden's laptop actionable ""election interference"" or not?
What we should probably be asking, as we head to November, is: ""Do we really want to go on living like that?""",2024-10-29
Zerohedge,Supreme Court Passes On 2nd Amendment Challenge To Federal Gun Law,"Authored by Matthew Vadum via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),
The Supreme Court has sidestepped a challenge to a federal law prohibiting felons from possessing firearms.
Instead of scheduling oral argument in the case filed by Lorenzo Garod Pierre, on Oct. 21, the court granted the petition and immediately overturned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit ruling that Pierre was appealing.
The Supreme Court did not provide reasons for its decision. No justices dissented.
The Supreme Court directed the 11th Circuit to reconsider its ruling in Pierre’s case in light of United States v. Rahimi, a decision the high court issued in June that the federal government said “clarified the methodology for determining whether a firearms regulation complies with the Second Amendment.”
In Rahimi, the justices upheld Section 922(g)(8) of Title 18 of the U.S. Code, a federal law that bars people under domestic violence-related restraining orders from possessing firearms.
Specifically, they found that the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution isn’t violated when an individual is disarmed after a court has found him to pose a credible threat to the physical safety of another.
Pierre said in his petition that he was charged in July 2022 with violating Section 922(g)(1) of Title 18 of the U.S. Code for knowingly possessing a firearm after being convicted of a felony. Court papers did not provide details of the prior felony conviction.
Pierre asked the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida to throw out the felony-level indictment, arguing that it was “unconstitutional in light of” New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen, which the Supreme Court handed down in June 2022. In Bruen, the nation’s highest court held that firearms restrictions must have a historical analogue and that the Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms in public for self-defense.
A magistrate judge filed a report that recommended denying the motion to dismiss. Magistrate judges are appointed to assist federal district judges.
Pierre objected, and the district court refused to dismiss the charge, finding that prior 11th Circuit rulings “squarely foreclosed” the constitutional challenge and were not undermined by the Bruen precedent.
Pierre lodged an appeal with the 11th Circuit arguing that his conviction “as applied” ran afoul of the Second Amendment. In an as-applied challenge, a litigant argues that a statute or regulation is unconstitutional in the context of a specific case.
On March 12, the 11th Circuit affirmed the district court in a two-page decision, holding that the circuit court’s prior rulings were binding in the case.
Pierre argued in his petition that, since Bruen was decided, federal courts of appeals have been split on whether a “defendant may mount a challenge that his individual circumstances do not supply a basis, consistent with the Second Amendment, for stripping the right” to possess firearms.
The 11th Circuit says felons are “categorically ‘disqualified’ from exercising their Second Amendment right,” but the Seventh and Ninth circuits allow defendants to file as-applied challenges to charges under Section 922(g)(1).
The Supreme Court should grant review to resolve the circuit split, the petition states.
U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued in a Sept. 16 brief that the Supreme Court should grant the petition and send the case back to the 11th Circuit with instructions to review its ruling in light of Rahimi.
The Rahimi decision contains within it the proper legal standard for evaluating the Pierre case because it “clarified the methodology for determining whether a firearms regulation complies with the Second Amendment.”
And because the Supreme Court vacated judgments in five separate challenges to Section 922(g)(1) in July and sent those cases back to circuit courts for review in light of Rahimi, “consistent with that practice, the Court should grant the petition ... in this case, vacate the court of appeals’ judgment, and remand for further consideration in light of Rahimi,” Prelogar said.
The Epoch Times reached out for comment to Pierre’s attorney, Brian Taylor Goldman of Holwell, Shuster, and Goldberg in New York City, and the U.S. Department of Justice but had received no replies as of publication time.",2024-10-28
Zerohedge,"LGBT Activists Meet With Pope, Urge Him To End Vatican Opposition To Trans Ideology","LGBT activists have a strange obsession with religious acceptance, specifically from the Catholic Church. Rational minds would argue that if a group is diametrically opposed to your lifestyle then you would avoid associating with that group. Why clamor for their attention?
In the early days of the gay rights movement the attitude of proponents was essentially that they would go their own way - All they wanted was for religious taboos to no longer be codified into law and used to regulate their lives. It sounds fair enough, but the problem with the political left is their underlying agenda of incrementalism and their unhealthy tendencies toward moral relativism.
In other words, give them an inch and leftists will steal a mile. They see compromise as an invitation to dominate. Giving concessions to a leftist is the same as inviting a vampire into your house; do it once and they'll keep coming back to feed whenever they please.
The gay rights issue is a perfect example of this ugly habit. In the 1990s the community was widely accepted in the west, the only right they didn't enjoy was to have their marriages recognized nationally. They claimed that once that right was achieved they would ask nothing more of the Christian community or the church. And of course, that was a lie.
Today, gay and trans rights groups demand that all church denominations accept trans ideology and trans membership. This includes gay and trans church leaders that teach ""tolerance"", mixing activist mantras into religious lessons and supporting ""trans visibility"". Going their separate ways is not enough and lack of association is unacceptable. Leftists require that their beliefs be adopted by everyone everywhere.
The Vatican under Pope Francis has been surprisingly reticent to welcome the trans movement into the fold, despite Francis being a devout globalist on more than a few hot button issues. Earlier this year the Pope called gender ideology the 'worst danger today', noting:
‘I would like to emphasize one thing: It is very important that we have this meeting, this meeting between men and women, because today the worst danger is gender ideology, which erases differences.’
In response, LGBT activist groups are increasing their focus on pressuring the Vatican to change their public position. Trans representatives met with the Pope this month in an 80 minute private discussion. The group included a Catholic sister who works with LGBTQ people, a member of the transgender community, and a U.S. medical doctor who helps run a clinic providing gender-affirming hormonal care for adults.
“I really wanted to share with Pope Francis about the joy that I have being a transgender Catholic person,” Michael Sennett, who took part in the meeting, told Reuters.
Sennett, a transgender man (a biological woman) from Boston, said she told the pontiff about “the joy that I get from hormone replacement therapy and the surgeries that I’ve had that make me feel comfortable in my body.” The group say they specifically urged the Pope to reconsider his opposition to gender affirming care (sex change hormones and surgeries).
It's not know exactly what was said during the event, but activists that met with the Pope claim he expressed an interest in appointing bishops in the US that are 'more open' to transgender Catholics. Considering the idea is a violation of multiple Biblical ideals and doctrines, it's hard to say how this would be possible.
As mentioned, this scenario sounds once again like the incrementalism of the progressive left. It starts with compromises on LGBT membership, then trans ideology makes its way into the church, then it takes over the church and you end up with this disturbing result:
Activists claim they just want to worship like other Christians do, but that's not the trend we see in the western world. The argument being promoted is that Christianity must ""adapt to the times"" and that Biblical beliefs must ""evolve."" It's the typical futurist method of removing opposing systems that act as obstacles to their control. The notion is that everything new is better and everything old should be abandoned. It's the Marxist view of religion, which does not compromise.
Even for those that are not religiously inclined the end game should be obvious - The inevitable erasure of Christianity. The push for Trans affirmation by the Vatican is likely an attempt to destroy conservative ideological opposition from within while installing a new kind of religion in Christianity's place.",2024-10-27
Zerohedge,Steve Bannon Released From Prison After Serving 4 Months For Contempt Of Congress,"Authored by Sam Dorman via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),
Steve Bannon, who served as a top White House adviser early on in the Trump administration, was released from prison on Oct. 29 after serving four months for contempt of Congress.
“The four months in federal prison not only didn’t break me, it empowered me,” he said during his “WarRoom” podcast. “I am more energized and more focused than I’ve ever been in my entire life.”
Bannon, 70, was serving time in the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut. His release comes after a federal judge on Oct. 22 denied his request for early release. Bannon entered prison in July after the Supreme Court refused to take up his request to avoid his four-month sentence.

— Maureen Bannon (@maureen_bannon) October 29, 2024
When he began serving his sentence in July, Bannon called himself a “political prisoner.”
“I am proud of going to prison,” he said at the time, adding that he was standing up to Attorney General Merrick Garland and what he called a “corrupt” Justice Department.
A jury convicted him in 2022 for two counts of contempt of Congress after he refused to comply with requests from the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol breach.
Bannon, 70, claimed that former President Donald Trump had extended executive privilege over his testimony. Bannon’s attorney, David Schoen, told the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that the district court had wrongly excluded evidence surrounding another attorney advising Bannon that he didn’t have to comply with the subpoenas because Trump had invoked that privilege.
“At a bare minimum, it’s required that the defendant know or understand that his or her conduct was unlawful or wrong,” Schoen told the court in November 2023.
“Mr. Bannon acted in the only way he believed and understood from his lawyer that the law permitted him ... to behave in response to the subpoena.”
The appeals court said that under its precedent, Bannon’s advice-of-attorney defense “is no defense at all.”
STEVE BANNON IS BACK, and his return monologue is insanely powerful.

“As both this court and the Supreme Court have repeatedly explained, a contrary rule would contravene the text of the contempt statute and hamstring Congress’s investigatory authority,” Judge Brad Garcia said, writing for the court.
“Because we have no basis to depart from that binding precedent, and because none of Bannon’s other challenges to his convictions have merit, we affirm.”
Bannon faces other criminal charges in New York, where a judge has set Dec. 9 as the start date for the trial in his border fundraising case. Prosecutors allege that Bannon helped funnel more than $100,000 to a co-founder of the nonprofit WeBuildTheWall Inc. who was allegedly getting a secret salary after Bannon and others had promised donors that every dollar would be used to help construct a wall along the U.S.–Mexico border.
Bannon has pleaded not guilty to money laundering and conspiracy charges, calling them “nonsense.” In 2021, Trump pardoned Bannon in a federal case similar to the one he’s currently facing from New York prosecutors.
That case was brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office, which also prosecuted Trump for alleged election interference involving a payment to adult performer Stephanie Clifford, known as Stormy Daniels. Trump similarly pleaded not guilty.
Bannon entered prison the same month that another former Trump White House adviser, Peter Navarro, exited under similar circumstances. Navarro claimed executive privilege in defying a congressional subpoena, but D.C. District Judge Amit Mehta said he hadn’t shown enough evidence the privilege was asserted.
Trump is facing potential prison time for his role in the events of Jan. 6, 2021, but has successfully avoided trial in Washington. His appeal on presidential immunity resulted in a landmark Supreme Court case and a lengthy delay of the pre-trial process for special counsel Jack Smith’s prosecution of him.

Zerohedge,Virginia Asks US Supreme Court To Allow Its Removal Of Non-Citizens From Voter Rolls,"Virginia officials filed an emergency application with the U.S. Supreme Court on Oct. 28 asking the justices to allow the state to remove suspected noncitizens from the voter rolls.
The application was filed in the case known as Beals v. Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights.
The application was directed to Chief Justice John Roberts, who oversees emergency litigation from Virginia.
The lead applicant, Susan Beals, is Virginia’s Commissioner of Elections.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit found unanimously on Oct. 27 that taking the names off the voter rolls within 90 days of an approaching federal election appears to violate the National Voter Registration Act.
Federal elections are scheduled for Nov. 5.
The Supreme Court previously held in Purcell v. Gonzalez (2006) that courts should not change rules close to an election because doing so creates a risk of causing confusion.
Virginia counters that the legal provision is not relevant because the names being removed are not those of U.S. voters.
But “that argument violates basic principles of statutory construction by focusing on a differently worded statutory provision that is not at issue here and proposing a strained reading of the Quiet Period Provision to avoid rendering that other provision absurd or unconstitutional,” the Fourth Circuit said.
Such an interpretation would be problematic because it would give the words “voters” and “registrant” an identical meaning, the circuit court said.
Moreover, Virginia had not demonstrated its appeal was likely to succeed or that it would suffer irreparable harm should the appeal be denied, the circuit court said as it affirmed an Oct. 25 ruling by U.S. District Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles.
Giles wrote that Virginia was still free to cancel the voter registration of noncitizens individually or to investigate “noncitizens who register to vote or who vote in Virginia’s election.”
The ruling applies only to Virginia’s “systematic” effort to remove noncitizens that began after Aug. 7, she added.
In the new application, Virginia said it objected to the district court decision because “less than two weeks before the 2024 Presidential Election, and more than a month into early voting, the district court ... ordered Applicants, Virginia and its election officials, to place over 1,600 self-identified noncitizens back onto Virginia’s voter rolls, in violation of Virginia law and common sense.”
Virginia said the Supreme Court should stay the district court ruling because it “is based on a misinterpretation of the [National Voter Registration Act], which does not prohibit Virginia from removing noncitizens from its voter rolls.”
The ruling would also “impose significant cost, confusion, and hardship upon Virginia, creating a massive influx of work for its registrars in the critical week before the election, and likely confusing noncitizens into believing that they are eligible to vote.”
Roberts directed co-respondents Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights, League of Women Voters of Virginia, African Communities Together, and the federal government to respond to the application by 3 p.m. on Oct. 29.",2024-10-28
Zerohedge,"Seeking Middle East Peace, Michigan Muslim Leaders Endorse Trump At Saturday Rally","In the latest vivid demonstration that once-durable Democratic constituencies are being completely shattered in 2024, former President Donald Trump on Saturday welcomed Michigan Muslim leaders onto a stage and heartily accepted their endorsements. ""I’m thrilled to accept the endorsement of these highly respected leaders,"" Trump told the crowd in Novi, a Detroit suburb.
The principal motivator of the endorsements appears to be outrage over the Biden-Harris administration's support of Israel's long, astoundingly destructive war on Gaza -- and a belief that even ardent Israel-backer Trump would be far more likely to bring the carnage to an end. Imam Belal Alzuhairi took to the stage in the Detroit suburb of Novi to voice that very sentiment:
""We, as Muslims, stand with President Trump because he promises peace, not war! We are supporting Donald Trump because he promised to end war in the Middle East and Ukraine. The bloodshed has to stop all over the world, and I think this man can make that happen. I personally believe that God saved his life twice for a reason.""
Alzuhairi also commended Trump's commitment to protect children from school curricula that undermine family values, and to creating a strong border and stopping illegal immigration:

— Nemat Sadat (@nematsadat) October 26, 2024
Dearborn Heights mayor Bill Bazzi likewise embraced Trump as potential peacemaker, telling the crowd, ""We're going to stop the wars, we're going to make the United States safe again, and we're going to make the world safe."" Amer Ghalib, Muslim mayor of Detroit suburb Hamtramck, endorsed Trump on Oct. 20. Liberals celebrated when Hamtramck elected a majority-Muslim city council in 2015, and then Ghalib as its first Muslim Mayor in 2021, but they recoiled and even felt betrayed when the council barred LGBTQ Pride flags from city flagpoles last year.
As is the case with seemingly every other issue, Kamala Harris has chosen not to stake out a position on the Israel-Gaza war that's even modestly different from that of the Biden administration -- such as merely putting conditions on the billions of US dollars shoveled into the country. Here she is lamely dodging the issue in her train wreck of a town hall performance in Philadelphia on Wednesday night:
Kamala Harris says clearly and fairly succinctly that we must accept her sponsorship of the Gaza genocide as a trade off for more affordable groceries pic.twitter.com/HlNzKj2LP7
— Max Blumenthal (@MaxBlumenthal) October 24, 2024
That approach could well cost Harris Michigan's 15 electoral votes and the 2024 election, as Michigan has one of the largest Muslim populations in America. The issue could also be decisive in states with lesser Muslim populations but tightly-contested races. An Arab News/YouGov poll released last week found that Trump is narrowly winning the Arab-American vote, 45% to 43%. In 2020, 86% of Muslims voted for Biden, with just 6% backing Trump.
As if her refusal to take a different approach to Israel weren't doing enough damage with Muslims, Harris has put herself in an even deeper hole by embracing the endorsements of arch-Middle-East-interventionist Dick Cheney and his daughter, former Rep. Liz Cheney -- and even toting Liz along for multiple appearances in Michigan. By some estimates, upwards of one million people have died as a result of the Dick Cheney-orchestrated invasion of Iraq on false premises.
Kamala Harris doesn't care about genocide. If she did, she would state permanent ceasefire and suspension of arms trade to 🇮🇱 as part of her campaign.
— Jaded Kamala Khan (@TamTV_) August 8, 2024
She's gonna lose the Muslim & Arab American vote. pic.twitter.com/LJ86v2MJxm
Sharing a view that's no doubt widely held among Michigan Muslims, Hamtramck Mayor Ghalib told reporters last week:
""It was surprising for us as Arab Americans to have Kamala Harris bringing someone whose family name always reminds us of war crimes in the Middle East....To bring this person to our backyard, to remind us all of the tragedies that happened in the Middle East, is something that tells us that there would be more wars coming if Kamala Harris is elected.""
While it's certainly not universal, the substantial Muslim embrace of Trump is particularly remarkable given Trump's demonstrated devotion to the State of Israel and relentless pandering to its backers inside the United States.
Trump's political campaigns have been fueled by enormous donations from the late Sheldon and still-living Miriam Adelson, a billionaire couple whose foremost policy concern has been ensuring steady financial, military and political support for the State of Israel, and aligning Washington with the agenda of Israel's right wing. The Adelsons have been closely allied with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, even publishing a free Israeli newspaper that boosts Netanyahu and his Likud party.
The couple donated a jaw-dropping $90 million to Trump's 2020 campaign, rewarding him for his Israel-catering policies, including relocating the US embassy from Tel Aviv to contested Jerusalem, exiting the Iran nuclear deal and recognizing Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which Israel captured in 1967's Six-Day War. Trump also awarded Miriam Adelson the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In the 2024 race, Miriam Adelson has donated another $100 million to a PAC that works to elect Trump.
The remarkable fracturing of Muslim support of the Democratic Party comes alongside similar erosion of other once-reliable cornerstones of the Democratic electorate, including blacks, Hispanics, union members and young voters. Can this race really be as tight as ""experts"" tell us?",2024-10-27

Zerohedge,"Trump's Attorneys Seek Election Case Dismissal, Say Special Council Appointment Unconstitutional","Former President Donald Trump’s attorneys argued in a new filing on Oct. 24 that Special Counsel Jack Smith’s superseding indictment should be dismissed since his appointment was unconstitutional.
“Everything that Smith did since Attorney General [Merrick] Garland’s appointment, as President Trump continued his leading campaign against President Biden and then Vice President Harris, was unlawful and unconstitutional,” Trump’s attorneys said in a filing to D.C. Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is overseeing his election interference case.
“That includes Smith’s separate violation of the Appropriations Clause by relying on an appropriation that does not apply in order to take more than $20 million from taxpayers,” the filing added.
The filing was a motion requesting that Chutkan allow Trump to submit another motion to dismiss based on the legality of Smith’s appointment. Trump is seeking not only dismissal of the superseding indictment but also an injunction preventing Smith from “spending additional public funds” while violating the Constitution.
It’s the latest attempt by Trump to obtain rulings that would severely weaken or end Smith’s prosecution, which restarted after months of delay as the Supreme Court weighed Trump’s appeal on presidential immunity.
Trump is seeking to dismiss the case based on the Supreme Court’s ruling that presidents have some immunity, as well as based on its decision from June in Fischer v. United States, which narrowed Smith’s application of an obstruction statute used against Jan. 6 defendants.
Trump’s latest filing echoes arguments from Florida Judge Aileen Cannon, who dismissed Smith’s classified documents case against Trump in the state. Both Trump and Cannon also cited Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, whose concurring opinion in the immunity decision raised doubts about the legitimacy of Smith’s appointment.
That case is headed towards the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit where Smith is seeking an appeal of Cannon’s decision. If the 11th Circuit and Chutkan return differing opinions on this issue, it could prompt the type of circuit split that reaches the Supreme Court.
Chutkan has already indicated that she would reject the type of arguments that Cannon used in dismissing the classified documents case. During a status conference on Sept. 5, she said that she didn’t find Cannon’s opinion “particularly persuasive.”
Cannon’s ruling conflicted with a 2019 judgment by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which upheld former special counsel Robert Mueller’s appointment. That 2019 decision wasn’t binding for Chutkan, Trump’s attorneys argued, because it was decided before the Supreme Court issued multiple decisions attempting to rein in agency power through a principle called the “major questions doctrine.”
That doctrine, which the Supreme Court applied in its decision striking down President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness, holds that laws should not be interpreted as allowing agencies to decide major questions unless explicitly stated by the text.
Because Congress didn’t provide a clear statement authorizing the appointment of special counsels like Smith, Trump’s attorneys said, his appointment was illegal.
Smith told the 11th Circuit that Cannon’s decision “needlessly casts doubt on longstanding practices in the Department of Justice and across the Executive Branch.”
He disputed Cannon’s ruling on statutory grounds but also took issue with her interpretation of the Supreme Court’s decision in U.S. v. Nixon. That case centered on former President Richard Nixon’s attempt to resist a subpoena from special prosecutor Leon Jaworski.
In that case, the court’s majority defended the special prosecutor’s appointment.
“Under the authority of Art. II, § 2, Congress has vested in the Attorney General the power to conduct the criminal litigation of the United States Government ... It has also vested in him the power to appoint subordinate officers to assist him in the discharge of his duties,” the 1974 majority opinion, authored by Chief Justice Warren Burger, read.
Cannon said in July that the court’s wording was dictum, or nonbinding, on future court decisions. Trump’s attorneys agreed.",2024-10-25

Zerohedge,Fever Dream,"“The American 'Left' is fully exposed now as a demented, vicious, abusive animal of traumatizing narcissism.”
- Celia Farber
Do you hear that lonesome whistle blow? Wooooo-wooooo! It’s the last train to Palookaville pulling into the station. At this late hour, two passengers get on: Kamala Harris, mom jeans and blazer, rheumy red eyes, half-gone on chardonnay. . . and an elderly gentleman with a goatee in a colorful but shabby red-white-and-blue suit, famous long ago as “Uncle Sam.”
There’s an election on, in case you haven’t noticed, imminent even. Kamala, everyone seems to agree, has blown it. Can’t answer simple questions pitched by friendly ringers in the “news” business. Hiding somebody else’s agenda is a tough assignment, you see. All she can really do is cackle or simper and, let’s face it, that gets humiliating fast. Joy has turned to despair. Her punched ticket says “one way.”
Whose idea was it, anyway, over at party HQ, to put her up to this contest? She wishes she knew, as she gazes out the window at the sad lights of the little towns streaking by — East Chugwater, Erehwon, Tanktown, Loserville, onward into the night to the end of the line. How’d they manage to yank her out of the comfort of the Naval Observatory, where she was comfy and cozy watching Netflix rom-coms with Doug, chardonnay refills on-demand, all the Doritos a gal could munch. She was a lover, not a fighter, she repeats to herself, but the self-consolation doesn’t quite avail.
Uncle Sam sits stoically five seats behind her. He is resigned, knowing very well why he is on that train, too. His own country is sending him into exile after swindling him out of his history and his posterity. He doesn’t even recognize the place anymore. What happened to Sandberg’s city of big shoulders? Who turned the fruited plain into a hellscape of muffler shops? How did the heroes of Iwo Jima transition into a legion of TikTok influencers with pierced faces and scrambled brains? When the train gets in, he has no place to go. Perhaps he’ll sleep in a ditch.
You entertain these drear hallucinatory conceits despite the giddiness about Donald Trump’s seeming triumph over adversity — botched assassinations, court cases hatched by malice-crazed ninnies, blob-generated calumnies, conspiracies, ops, and hoaxes galore. And for Halloween, they painted a Hitler mustache on him, just for fun. It remains to be seen what marvels of ballot legerdemain have been concocted by Marc Elias, Esq, lawfare artist supreme, destroyer of the nation’s faith in itself.
But say Mr. Trump overcomes even the planned epic voter fraud to capture the prize. What then? You’re entitled to feel nervous. The army, under Department of Defense directive 5240.01 has just been licensed to gun you down. This is a new thing. Now isn’t is it a queer moment in history for a move like that? What are they expecting, anyway? And, by the way, who exactly is the varlet in the chain-of-command who issued that directive? (Or did it just bubble-up out of the ruling blob like some sulfurous gas from a Yellowstone fumarole?)
People of good faith have reason to believe that the country is about to be blown apart. By another odd coincidence, an outfit called the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association International (AFCEA) has scheduled an “exercise simulating a cyber-attack on critical infrastructure” for November 5 in Atlanta, Georgia. That’s election day. In a big swing state. Whose idea was that? Is there already not enough that might go wrong that some treasonous moron had to kick the risk of fiasco up another notch? Or might it be cover for another Three Card Monte caper with the Georgia votes? This is the sort of thing that will dog poor old Uncle Sam’s mind as he tries to fall asleep in that drainage ditch on the ragged edge of Palookaville.
Or perhaps what we’re witnessing is a fabulous bit of what George W. Bush once called “strategery” by the Party of Chaos.
Five minutes after Mr. Trump gets elected, a certain unseen hand flips a little toggle somewhere in the banking system that tanks the economy so hard and fast that 2025 will make the Great Depression of the 1930s look like a Hamptons clam bake... for the next four years we become a land with no money and no way to generate money. . . and MAGA / MAHA is left to suck eggs in the cold and dark until 2028 when the Democratic Party returns in full Maoist mode, riding in on a unicorn cavalry to rescue us. . . . Nah. . . .They just blew it.
So, more likely, we’re seeing the suicide of the Democratic Party.
Even CNN is starting to back away from them, as from a convocation of lepers. They can smell the odor of necrosis. Plus, their own instinct for survival has kicked in. They have a business to run. They want to be around to cover the treason trial of Alejandro Mayorkas — a sure thing to jack those sagging ratings back up.
Maybe even Kamala Harris will be called out of retirement to testify and we’ll find out just what was going on in the White House in the summer of 2024, when “Joe Biden” — remember him? — was rattling around the joint like a BB in a packing crate, howling for his ice cream, and no one was around anymore to hear him.",2024-10-25

The Harris supporter went on to suggest that countless people, including immigrants, will need to “flee for their own safety” and that Democrats can help by not identifying them to MAGA fascists.
“Do not brag about the people you have helped, do not tell others about the people you have helped, keep your mouth shut,” he emphasized.
The leftist went on to urge that literally any subject that gets raised which is remotely related to politics should be answered with the words, “I don’t talk about politics.”
“It’s gonna hurt but that’s what’s gonna help you and others survive,” he absurdly claims, adding, “These are the ground rules for surviving a fascist government, which is 100 per cent what Donald Trump has said on camera he wants to put in place if he gets re-elected.
Donald Trump has never said such a thing on camera or anywhere else.
The leftist’s final piece of advice is for Harris supporters to buy guys and take part in firearms safety training to defend themselves and also for them to all delete their social media profiles permanently.
He concluded by saying following his advice could be the difference between “walking free and being in a camp.”
Of course, there is absolutely no evidence that a Trump administration would launch a fascist takeover of government if he is elected, outside of Trump Derangement Syndrome sufferers and legacy media talking heads ludicrously fanning the flames of hysteria.
As we previously highlighted, pollster Mark Halperin warned that America would undergo its worst mental health crisis ever if Donald Trump wins the presidency.
Halperin said that the fallout would be unprecedented and sustained, suggesting that the backlash to Trump’s 2016 victory will be dwarfed by the utter deluge of cope and seethe that will unfold after November 5th.

Zerohedge,Leftists Are Terrified About What Will Happen To Them If Trump Wins The Election,"After being indoctrinated for almost a decade to believe that their political opponents are secret Nazis ready to install a fascist regime, it's not surprising that Democrats are freaking out over recent polls indicating a potential Trump win in the November elections. Convinced that America 2024 is going to be a repeat of Germany 1933, ignorant leftists are scrambling to determine whether or not to leave the US or ""start a revolution."" The anxiety is palpable.
The New Yorker recently asserted in an arduous and rambling article spanning centuries of political history and every rhetorical cliche imaginable that, essentially, Trump is likely to win.
The outlet describes Kamala Harris as ""virtuous"" (which is laughable), but they suggest this trait is not respected enough within the American political sphere. They lament the undeniable shift of global politics to the conservative right while refusing to ask why it's happening? They simply default to the old low-IQ and low effort accusations of ""racism"" and ""xenophobia"". The New Yorker argues:
""Even when it is utterly self-destructive - as in Britain, where the xenophobia of Brexit cut the U.K. off from traditional allies while increasing immigration from the Global South—the apprehension that “we” are being flooded by frightening foreigners works its malign magic.
It’s an old but persistent delusion that far-right nationalism is not rooted in the emotional needs of far-right nationalists but arises, instead, from the injustices of neoliberalism...""
The mass immigration from the third world continues in Britain because the same progressive elitists are still in charge despite the Brexit vote. That's why the country is spiraling into a pit of criminality, mass stabbings and a rape epidemic. It's the reason why the British voted for Brexit in the first place.
Brexit and the end of mass immigration is the will of the majority of the people, just as it's the will of the majority of people in many parts if Europe and the US. Yet, leftists who pontificate endlessly about the virtues of democracy dismiss the majority when it suits them. It is this arrogance of the political left that has led directly to the rise of the right wing movement that so utterly terrifies them.
The problem is, leftists never take responsibility because they see this as an expression of weakness, and also because their moral relativism allows them to rationalize any behavior as necessary ""for the greater good."" Their main character syndrome spurs them to believe they are the ultimate good in the world, and if they are the ultimate good then anyone who dares oppose them must be the ultimate evil.
This is why they have a tendency to demonize their political opposition in extreme ways. The New Yorker describes Trump as singularly dangerous, comparing him to mobsters, tyrants and even cancer:
""Trumpism is a cancerous phenomenon. Treated with surgery once, it now threatens to come back in a more aggressive form, subject neither to the radiation of “guardrails” nor to the chemo of “constraints.” It may well rage out of control and kill its host...""
And this kind of rhetoric is exactly why there have been at least two assassination attempts on Trump's life; attempts which the leftist media then shamelessly blamed on Trump. It's also gaslighting, considering the level of tyranny Democrats have engaged in under Biden and the contempt they have displayed for American ideals over the past decade.
The fantasy world of the left is rife with paranoia built on a foundation of emotional sand rather than evidence. They see a new Trump term as the end of everything:
""Having lost the popular vote, as he surely will, he will not speak up to reconcile “all Americans.” He will insist that he won the popular vote, and by a landslide. He will pardon and then celebrate the January 6th insurrectionists, and thereby guarantee the existence of a paramilitary organization that’s capable of committing violence on his behalf without fear of consequences. He will, with an obedient Attorney General, begin prosecuting his political opponents...""
""When he begins to pressure CNN and ABC, and they, with all the vulnerabilities of large corporations, bend to his will, telling themselves that his is now the will of the people, what will we do to fend off the slow degradation of open debate?
Trump will certainly abandon Ukraine to Vladimir Putin and realign this country with dictatorships and against NATO and the democratic alliance of Europe. Above all, the spirit of vengeful reprisal is the totality of his beliefs—very much like the fascists of the twentieth century in being a man and a movement without any positive doctrine except revenge against his imagined enemies...""
The establishment media has imagined quite a reformation of American politics at the hands of Trump, and a lot of it actually sounds pretty good. But as many conservatives have noted, if Trump had authoritarian intentions why didn't he follow through on them during his first term?
Some would argue that he did too little in the face of the city burning antics of BLM, and that he should have pushed harder to stop the legal railroading of the J6 protesters who did little in comparison to the race rioters. Where is this uncompromising zealot that The New Yorker describes? He doesn't exist.
What is this really about? It's about the political left's unspoken fear of a justified reckoning. Deep down, they know they deserve punishment and they know most of the country has no interest in protecting them.
They've spent years instigating civil unrest, they attempted an authoritarian takeover of the country using covid mandates as a foil, they lied incessantly about the threat of a stagflation crisis, they colluded to violate the 1st Amendment as the Biden White House and Big Tech platforms worked together to censor public discourse online, and they have targeted American children with sexualized gender ideology in public schools in an attempt to convert them permanently to the far-left cult. They know what they have done and they know consequences are incoming.
A lot of them are talking about leaving the country should Trump prevail in November, as the New York Times reports. Their reasons vary, but worries of ""fascism"" top the list while others say they want to be able to trans their children (or abort their children) without interference. The reality is that no one will miss these people and the US would be better off without them. They would be doing the country a favor by running away.
Talk of ""revolution"" has been much less pronounced compared to 2016, and this suggests that leftists realize their grift is finally over. They are some of the most hated people on the planet, and for good reason. They spent the last several years burning every bridge and violating every principle that Americans hold dear in the pursuit of ultimate power. They're also losing popularity in Europe, it's not just an American trend.
Trump may or may not pursue an administration of ""vengeance"". It's likely he will not act on most of the scenarios the New Yorker describes. Democrats focus a lot on Trump as if he's the source of their ills.
What they don't understand is that it's not really Trump they should be worried about - It's the millions of people suffering under progressive governments and aggressive woke activism that present the biggest threat.
You can't simply engage in the wanton destruction of western culture, economics, freedom and morality and then pretend like you're a victim when the torches and pitchforks come calling.",2024-10-28
Zerohedge,"More Republicans Than Democrats Have Voted Early in Arizona, Nevada, & North Carolina","With just over a week to go before the Nov. 5 presidential election, more than 40 million people have cast early ballots so far.
As of Sunday afternoon, data provided by the University of Florida’s Election Lab shows 41.2 million voted by mail or early in person in the vast majority of states, with only a few states not reporting data.
Compared with four years ago, Republicans are returning more mail-in ballots and voting early in-person. Party affiliation does not mean that voters cast ballot for their party’s nominated candidate, meaning there is no way to definitively know what presidential candidate is ahead.
In states that report votes by party, registered Democrats have a 3.8 percent lead over registered Republicans, with 40 percent to 36.2 percent, respectively. Independent or minor party voters make up about 23.8 percent of the remainder, according to data provided by the lab.
Republicans have a 9-point advantage over Democrats during in-person early voting, while Democrats have a more than 11-point lead over Republicans for mail-in ballot returns, the data show.
As of Oct. 25, only 24.5 percent of mail-in ballots returned were from Republicans, while about 52.3 percent of Democrats did so, according to the Election Lab. Some 22.6 percent of returned mail ballots were from independents or those registered with minor parties.
Republicans in 2020 also had a smaller lead voting in-person early, the data show. At the time, some 40.2 percent of Republicans voted in-person early, while 37.5 percent were Democrats.
States that have reported no data so far include New York, Alabama, New Hampshire, and Oklahoma.
Swing-State Breakdown
In Nevada, Republicans have a 5.1 percent early voting lead—or 31,000 votes—over Democrats, the Election Lab’s data show. That state was called for President Joe Biden over Trump in 2020.
Meanwhile, Republicans have a 6.9-percent advantage over Democrats in Arizona, a state that only reports mail-in ballots. Biden was also certified the victor in Arizona by a slim, 10,000-vote margin four years ago.
Voting by mail is extremely popular in Arizona, with nearly 90 percent of voters having cast their ballots early, most by mail, in 2020. Election officials in Arizona can begin processing and tabulating mail ballots upon receipt, but results cannot be released until one hour after polls close.
Late last week, Republicans pulled ahead in North Carolina, a state won by former President Donald Trump in 2020. By Sunday, the lead increased marginally to about 1.1 percent, or about 30,000 votes, over Democrats, data show.
Earlier this month, Trump visited areas in North Carolina that were ravaged by Hurricane Helene, saying that some Americans in the region “felt helpless and abandoned and left behind by their government.”
“In North Carolina’s hour of desperation, the American people answered the call much more so than your federal government,” he said.
And in mid-October, Vice President Kamala Harris held a rally in Greenville, North Carolina, and told a crowd that she wants to “fight for the ideals of our country and to fight to realize the promise of America.”
Pennsylvania has only reported mail-in ballots as of Oct. 27, showing that Democrats have taken a more than 330,000-vote lead over Republicans. However, Democrats’ lead has narrowed in recent days, down about 19,000 votes since Oct. 24, data show.
Pennsylvania did not have a clear winner in 2020 for four days after Election Day, as officials sifted through a huge backlog of mail ballots. The state is among only a handful that do not permit election workers to process or tabulate mail ballots until 7 a.m. ET on Election Day, which means it will likely again take days before the outcome is known.
Georgia, Michigan, and Wisconsin do not report party affiliation via the Election Lab website.",2024-10-28
Zerohedge,Texas AG Ken Paxton Files Criminal Referral Outlining Act Blue Illegal Campaign Finance Activity,"Many people might think that Attorney General Ken Paxton filing a letter of notice for criminal referral to the U.S Dept of Justice is an act of futility, because the DOJ is not going to investigate or indict criminal conduct by leftist political operatives. However, there is a strategic process to follow, particularly if the Texas AG is likely to become the next U.S. Attorney General.
In a way this step-by-step proactive approach is exactly why my efforts to intercept fraudulent ballot printing operations in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania were targeted to the Postmasters General in specific locales. It is unlawful to use the U.S.P.S. to conduct fraud through the postal system. Additionally, it is specifically illegal for a postmaster to be provided with direct evidence of mail fraud, and to knowingly – with intent, allow further unlawful activity therein.
Texas AG Ken Paxton is following a procedural process that builds a legal pathway.
TEXAS – Attorney General Ken Paxton made a criminal referral to the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) detailing the results of an investigation that revealed how suspicious actors seemingly use ActBlue’s political fundraising platform to make illegal straw donations.
The investigation into ActBlue began in December 2023 following allegations that the company could be facilitating illegal campaign contributions. As a result, in August 2024 ActBlue began requiring donors using credit cards to provide “CVV” codes, a common security measure. That does not prevent all the abuses that Attorney General Paxton’s team has identified on ActBlue, including that straw donations apparently are being made on a large scale using false identities, through untraceable payment methods.
On Monday, Attorney General Paxton sent a petition for rulemaking to the Federal Election Commission (“FEC”) urging changes that would close loopholes that can be exploited to illegally funnel money into American elections. When the FEC previously considered adopting rules that could prevent straw donation schemes like those uncovered by the investigation, ActBlue opposed such changes.
“I have made a criminal referral to the U.S. Department of Justice based on the findings from our investigation into ActBlue. My investigation uncovered evidence showing that bad actors are likely using ActBlue’s platform to make illegal campaign contributions,” said Attorney General Paxton. “It is illegal to engage in election fraud and it is illegal to obscure one’s identity to flout election rules. The Department of Justice must take immediate action to prevent illegal conduct in our elections.” (link)
Reminder….. With the Legislative Branch compromised by their own creation, and with the Judicial Branch stuck inside an old paradigm of “national security” you can see how confronting the DOJ operation can only come from one place, THE OVAL OFFICE.
The President of the United States, hopefully Donald J Trump, is going to have to do what the other branches have failed to do, take apart the DOJ and change all the functions of Main Justice to their pre-Patriot Act status. This is not going to be easy and will take a very specific type of person as U.S. Attorney General who both understands the issue and can, more importantly, articulate the problem to the larger American public.
- The President Trump Attorney General needs to be ultra clean with a spine of steel and a laser focus. The AG needs to totally understand the goals and objectives, without being told what the goals and objectives are. The AG needs to be independent, stable, strategic, brutally honest and keenly confident in his/her communication style with the attack media.
President Trump cannot spend exhaustive time instructing the AG on critical priorities. The AG needs to operate with skill, focus and self-motivated energy. The AG will be the focus of the Lawfare crew for removal/recusal. (Weissmann, McCord, Eisen, etc.)
- The Deputy AG needs to be intensely capable to stay on task with minimal supervision. The DAG is the git-r’-done person, no excuses, no apologies, no explanations. Raw, brutal, cold, quiet and determined. The DAG needs eyes of a mouse and ears of an elephant. The DAG needs to be a sponge, with total loyalty to the mission. The DAG also needs to be the bridge to the FBI.",2024-10-25

Zerohedge,US Supreme Court Lets Virginia Purge Noncitizens From Voter Rolls,"The US Supreme Court has granted a request by Virginia officials to move forward with its removal of roughly 1,600 alleged noncitizens from the state's voter rolls - granting a request from state officials to pause a lower court order that blocked Virginia from continuing a systematic voter removal program launched in August.
""The application for stay presented to The Chief Justice and by him referred to the Court is granted. The October 25, 2024 order of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia ... is stayed pending the disposition of the appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit..."" reads the order, which passed by a vote of 6-3.
BREAKING: Supreme Court rules 6-3 to allow Virginia to remove noncitizens from its voting rolls, lifting an order that halted the program. pic.twitter.com/dLO0lnSyy6
— America (@america) October 30, 2024
As the Epoch Times noted on Monday, the application was filed in the case known as Beals v. Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights.
The application was directed to Chief Justice John Roberts, who oversees emergency litigation from Virginia.
The lead applicant, Susan Beals, is Virginia’s Commissioner of Elections.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit found unanimously on Oct. 27 that taking the names off the voter rolls within 90 days of an approaching federal election appears to violate the National Voter Registration Act.
Federal elections are scheduled for Nov. 5.
I’m glad Virginia stood up for election integrity and beat the Biden-Harris Administration’s attempt to allow noncitizens to vote. https://t.co/sYPZVMuHug
— Tom Cotton (@SenTomCotton) October 30, 2024
The Supreme Court previously held in Purcell v. Gonzalez (2006) that courts should not change rules close to an election because doing so creates a risk of causing confusion.
Virginia counters that the legal provision is not relevant because the names being removed are not those of U.S. voters.
But “that argument violates basic principles of statutory construction by focusing on a differently worded statutory provision that is not at issue here and proposing a strained reading of the Quiet Period Provision to avoid rendering that other provision absurd or unconstitutional,” the Fourth Circuit said.
Can we do this in all the other states where the Democrats are trying to ensure that illegals are able to vote? There’s a reason Democrats are doing this and I can assure you it’s not to “protect democracy.” https://t.co/0SWd2ItuEw
— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) October 30, 2024
Such an interpretation would be problematic because it would give the words “voters” and “registrant” an identical meaning, the circuit court said.
Moreover, Virginia had not demonstrated its appeal was likely to succeed or that it would suffer irreparable harm should the appeal be denied, the circuit court said as it affirmed an Oct. 25 ruling by U.S. District Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles.
Giles wrote that Virginia was still free to cancel the voter registration of noncitizens individually or to investigate “noncitizens who register to vote or who vote in Virginia’s election.”
The ruling applies only to Virginia’s “systematic” effort to remove noncitizens that began after Aug. 7, she added.",2024-10-30
Zerohedge,After The Deluge,"At 7:30 a.m. on Friday, Sept. 27, Chris Trusz was standing on one of the bridges spanning the Broad River in Chimney Rock. He wanted to get a photo. It had been raining steadily for 36 hours and the river was running 10 inches above normal. Trusz, who’d moved to the western North Carolina mountain town 18 months earlier, wasn’t worried; residents had been warned there might be a bit of flooding. He got his picture and walked up the hill to his home.
“Normally I have a sliver of a view of the river,” he said. “Now I’m looking and can see the river clearly.” By the time he got back to Main Street, the Broad was three times as wide and running 30 inches high. Within the hour, buildings had slid off their foundations, some taken down by the furious mud-colored current and disappearing completely.
“We were watching homes wash by, all kinds of debris,” said Trusz. Worse, he recalled, were the cars being carried away, some with their headlights still on.
“I can’t unsee that,” said Trusz, three weeks after Hurricane Helene took down several western North Carolina towns, paralyzed the entire region, and killed at least 123, a number that will almost certainly rise and may prove unknowable.
It is one of several terrible unknowns the residents of western North Carolina now face. That they were unprepared for Helene is not on them – neither was the government nor anyone else. The “once in a thousand years” storm was not supposed to happen here, 500 miles from the Gulf of Mexico and 2,100 feet above sea level. There had been no local evacuation order even as the storm barreled their way. It would dump 30 inches of rain on western North Carolina and create up to 140-mile-per-hour winds. It would bring down untold thousands of trees. It would knock out the electrical grid, cell phone service, and the water supply all at once. In a matter of hours, it would obliterate the everyday security people felt, leaving survivors blinking into a new reality, wondering if they could or should rebuild lives in a place whose fragility had just been betrayed.
“If you live here or own a business, where do you go when it’s completely wiped out? I mean, how do you start over from that?” asked Trusz, a property manager for Airbnb who’d just found out the company was forbidding area rentals until June 2025 at least.
Further betrayal would come, during America’s overheated election season, from politicians, partisans, and conspiracists attempting to use the destruction and death caused by Helene to score political points. While mainstream news outlets suggested the area was being commandeered by armed right-wing militias, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene was tweeting, “Yes they can control the weather” (no elaboration as to who “they” were).
Echoing a common complaint, Elon Musk claimed that “FEMA is not merely failing to adequately help people in trouble, but is actively blocking citizens who try to help!” Before long, Musk would instead be thanking Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg for “expediting approval for support flights.” Below the radar were the innumerable others stoking discord, including the person who tweeted at me, “Water Back on in Asheville NC. Feels like BLEACH on my skin. Very hot. Burning my face….” This just after he retweeted several racist memes and the claim that the death toll in Asheville was over 8,000.
Because of its unexpected and painful destruction, western North Carolina has become another symbol of America’s cultural divide. One side is the politicization of everything, as human suffering was quickly transformed into a partisan cudgel swung by party operatives and media outlets who fed the public versions of events that advanced their favored narratives. On the other side was the heroic story of people and government working together as best they could in cataclysmic circumstances to aid and comfort one another.
That second, hopeful story is what I found while reporting in and around Asheville last week. In a hotel with no running water, guests, some of whom had multiple trees fall on their homes, made do. While the scene could resemble a pajama party gone wrong, with people shuffling to the Porto-Sans in the driveway and choosing not to comment on the smell of body odor in the elevator, most folks showed concern for what their fellow travelers were going through. They left food and drink on a table in the lobby, next to a paper plate onto which someone had written “Take what you need.” They had neither the luxury nor desire to make political hay from their brethren’s misery. And when the taps turned back on, the water was clear if not yet potable, and when you washed with it, it did not burn.
Capitalizing on the misfortune of others is reprehensible, and no one I met in western North Carolina had the leisure time or the inclination to do so. Many are still without drinking water. Commercial districts have the same ghostly quality they had during COVID, and the shoulders of many roadways are piled with what was left of downed trees, the white oaks, maples, and pines that drew 14 million visitors a year, especially in late September and October, when the region blazes red and gold.
If many of those trees are now gone, what happens to the tourism economy and its $7.7 billion? What of Asheville’s major creative draw, the River Arts District, where floodwaters reached 27 feet and where what studio spaces remain have been taken down to the studs? Where do people find the courage, and the resources, to start again? And what if the thousand-year storm turns out to have a different schedule?
“I have childhood memories up there in Chimney Rock on Lake Lure, my granddaddy took me up there,” said Beverly Ramsey. “How do you rebuild something like that?”
Ramsey was driving to T-Birds, the bar she has frequented most days since Helene hit, not to drink but to see how she can help. The Weaverville lounge, usually known for its pool tables and karaoke, had been converted into a repository for donated goods, currently being organized by 25-year-old Alex Holt. Holt worked faster than someone running over hell’s half-acre, organizing the pet food and sleeping bags and propane tanks and maple syrup and other items brought on trailer trucks – so many that, 20 days post-Helene, they were backed up on Old Mars Mill Highway. How many were arriving a day?
“I couldn’t give you an exact number, they’re coming from Arkansas, Pennsylvania, Mississippi,” said Holt, who clearly had zero time to chat. “We’re just trying to meet everyone’s needs.”
“Can you imagine getting your period through all this?” Ramsey asked, sorting through a shopping bag a local woman had just dropped off, individual baggies holding six tampons and a two-pack of chocolate cupcakes.
Ramsey had been in Weaverville, a town of about 5,000 people 11 miles from Asheville, at her elderly mother’s home when Helene hit. As for how terrifying it initially was that morning: not very.
“I slept through it,” she said. Her main concern, when she woke up and saw the power was out, was being unable to make coffee. She decided to walk to a nearby Bojangles.
Forty-five minutes later she was back, the scene she encountered outside both impassable and making no sense. Dozens of big trees lay across the suburban street. Climbing over limbs and under fallen power lines, she came across three men using chainsaws to cut a hole in the fallen trees. Did they know what had happened? They did not; they had no cell service. Ramsey checked her own phone. No signal. Overhead, she heard the whomp whomp of a Chinook helicopter. What the hell was going on?
It was not until that night, when a neighbor used a power inverter to hook a car battery to his television, that Ramsey would begin to learn of the damage caused by Hurricane Helene. The flooding appeared to be the worst since The Great Flood of 1916 when the region experienced 26 inches of rain. Helene would dump 30 inches, or more than 40 trillion gallons, though Ramsey would not know as much for days; no one could, not with all communications cut, and roads crisscrossed with downed trees, and some washed away entirely. Other than by helicopter, there was no way in or out, and in some cases, people could not reach their closest neighbors, to say nothing of the outside world.
Help nevertheless got through. “That first day, people brought us gas, water,” said Ramsey, who let those who could not get home, or no longer had homes to get to, crash on her floor. Where some blamed the government for not immediately rushing to the rescue, Ramsey praised the self-reliance of her neighbors.
“Hillbillies and rednecks are a community. They want to talk about how Podunk we are and backwards. But no, we got this,” she said. “We need outside assistance, obviously. But we came together immediately.”
They mourn the deaths together, too. Ramsey mentions 11 members of the Craig family buried alive in a mudslide, and shows me the cover of a local paper, a photo of Alison Wisely and her two young sons, swept away, along with her fiance, when they left their car and tried to run for safety.
“And the farms, the water rushed out and took them down to the bedrock,” said Ramsey. “I mean, you don’t come back from that. That kind of property will never be farmed again. Not in our lifetime or even our children’s lifetime.”
While she has no idea when or whether her commercial cleaning business will reopen, Ramsey is optimistic about the future – and she isn’t.
“I don’t know that Asheville will be any different because it was already a tight community. Now as far as rebuilding places like Chimney Rock, I don’t know that that’s going to happen,” she said. “I have childhood memories up there. This is in the 70s, and very little has changed since then, as far as the aesthetics. So how do you rebuild something like that?”
Before the rebuilding, the clean-up. How much is complete and how much there is to go, three weeks post-Helene, is not possible to know. Asheville’s River Arts District looks as though it has undergone a bombing: two square miles of crumbled warehouses, brick piles, splintered lumber, and vehicles packed with mud from when the French Broad River, which runs parallel to the RAD, left the district underwater. The fate of the structures, many of them former mills and factories built around 1900, is unknown. What happens to a 120-year-old foundation that’s been sitting under 27 feet of water? Touring the district with Buttigieg on Oct. 17, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper struck a hopeful if vague note, saying the area would “come back” but probably “in a different way.”
Uncertainty continues as you drive east, on bridges until recently acting as catchments for debris and buildings packed with 12 feet of sludge, debris and more sludge pushed to roadsides and going on for miles. Everywhere, there are earthmovers, bucket trucks, linemen restringing electrical lines, water trucks bringing potable water – proof of life on a landscape that can otherwise appear post-apocalyptic, the town of Swannanoa leveled by the river of the same name, the town of Lake Lure sealed up tight.
Or nearly sealed. Lake House Restaurant was empty at 4 p.m. but for one bar patron when Rodolfo and Jose Hernandez came in for a bite. The brothers wore T-shirts that read, “S*E*R*T Swadley’s Emergency Relief Team,” the charitable arm of a chain of barbecue restaurants that makes it their business to get food to disaster zones.
“Brent Swadley, he bring a big, big kitchen and trailers from OKC. We get here last Thursday,” said Rodolfo, who is originally from Puebla, Mexico. He and Jose work as mechanics for the Swadley's vehicles, though here, they also serve food to work crews. “The people are very happy to get real food, barbecue, steak, ribs, turkey, ham,” says Rodolfo. “Brent Swadley, he has a good heart.”
An ecosystem of good hearts formed post-Helene: the S*E*R*T team; the hundreds of trucks pulling up to T-Birds; the AI developer who, the day after the hurricane, made it his business to figure out how to find, bottle, and deliver drinking water; the Asheville bakery giving free fresh-baked pastries to patrons who left 20s in the tip jar; the seemingly limitless number of churches (“You hear the state sometimes referred to the as the prong in the Bible Belt,” said Beverly Ramsey, who is also an ordained minister) being of service, including the man in a “Don’t Let the Bad Days Win” shirt unloading pallets of bottled water and baby diapers; private citizens volunteering to go door-to-door to do wellness checks; translators helping non-English speakers fill out aid applications; community centers providing relaxation rooms to exhausted road workers; and the man who keeps a backpack of emergency supplies at-the-ready at all times who brought his 9-year-old daughter with him as he carried life-sustaining goods to people unable to escape their mountain homes, people for whom the surprise of a little girl brought its own kind of sunshine.
“Kids are just as motivated to help people as adults are,” the man said, adding that he did not bring his daughter on the darker missions, the ones he would not talk about.
As the people of western North Carolina get their bearings, many who swooped in to help will move to the next disaster; S*E*R*T was also in Florida, providing meals to those hard hit by Hurricane Milton. What “recovery” looks like is as yet unknown, and already there are frustrations, if not always a logical place to put them. People cannot be mad at the storm, or not with any hope of restitution. A storm will never say, “My bad.” And so people are mad, for instance, at their insurance companies, when they find out their policies do not cover flood damage.
“He’s having an incredibly hard time,” said one retired insurance agent, whose Asheville colleague was so besieged that she and other agents “formed a triage team so all calls went to a human voice. People needed to lay out their heart to someone on the other end of the phone.”
If for naught: The agent estimated that no more than 2% of policy owners had elected to carry flood insurance, and why would they? Western North Carolina is above the floodplain; the area had not catastrophically flooded since the Great Flood of 1916, also known as “the flood by which all other floods are measured,” a flood Helene out-measured, leaving property owners understandably desperate for someone to tell them there’d be money coming to repair their lives.
The best insurance could do, said the agent, was “get them a declaration form that says they were not [covered] and they could bring that to FEMA,” the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which, along with other government agencies, was experiencing its share of post-Helene consumer hatred, some of it whipped up by keyboard warriors claiming FEMA was holding “special meetings” to steal people’s homes and confiscate donations (assertions debunked by a local congressman), and that a North Carolina National Guard helicopter had deliberately sabotaged a distribution center (based on rotor wash having accidentally blown over some donated goods).
“There’s been a lot of rumors on social media in particular, and they’re not helpful in terms of our ability to help people,” said Mike Cappannari, external affairs officer for FEMA. Looking tired but composed amid the hundreds of storm victims milling through a Disaster Recovery Center set up on the campus of A.C. Reynolds High School in Asheville, Cappannari said FEMA had about 2,000 responders in the region, that it was still tough to get to some remote areas, and that in some cases the agency was working in concert with the Department of Defense to create points of distribution as close to disaster sites as possible. As for the wilder stories online, such as FEMA workers being chased down by truckloads of armed vigilantes, “You just try and fight through that,” he said. “Fortunately, over the past handful of days, we’ve seen not as much of that and are just trying to encourage people to register for assistance with us and see how we can help.”
Hanging out with a volunteer friend on another part of the Reynolds campus, it was hard for Kim Pierce to know what help she needed.
“I lost everything,” said Pierce, a slip of a woman who’d closed on a new East Asheville condo on Monday, Sept. 23. It was to be the first home she would live in without any of her six grown children, a ground-floor unit for which she’d paid cash, a place she envisioned riding out her semi-retirement with other residents, most of them over 60.
What she did not envision: waking up on Friday, Sept. 27, to find her new yard underwater. She did not envision moving a few cherished items to the trunk of her car for safety, only to watch her car sink. She did not envision falling into and scrambling out of the rushing Swannanoa River, taking refuge with neighbors she had never met, eating soup with them in a daze, and, because she was perhaps spryer and certainly more stubborn, getting the names, addresses, and prescription medications of these strangers and pledging to get to the nearest fire station to implore the fire crew to rescue them. Which she was doing when her sons-in-law showed up at her condo, found it underwater, and figured she was dead.
“When I showed up [at my daughter’s], she came screaming out of the house, she’s sobbing and is like, ‘Mama, I was writing your eulogy!’” said Pierce. “It was so hard to see my child so traumatized.”
Hard, too, to envision the future when the accumulation and plans of 60-plus years disappear overnight. “There is beauty that comes out of ashes. And I am experiencing it. I see it in little glimpses,” she said. “And then I go back into this fog of, I’ve lost everything.”
“Where do you put 30 inches of rain?” asked Chris Trusz, overlooking the Broad River, running today at normal capacity.
The question answered itself as he walked Main Street, past splintered furniture; car-sized clumps of dried mud, wood, and wire; crushed delivery trucks, dented refrigeration and a winery left precariously cantilevered by the storm.
“They’re going to have to bring in so much fill to get back up to where you possibly could rebuild,” said Trusz. “Most people will, because it’s a strong little town, but I can’t blame people for wanting to leave.”
While work crews continued clearing the roads, and while Trusz had nothing but goodwill for private and public sector efforts (“The community, the 101st Airborne, FEMA, everybody’s been here helping out,” he said, waving at several truckloads of National Guard), life in Chimney Rock has yet to resume, residents and business owners still figuratively rising to the surface. While the river was cleaning itself, those sorting through what was left of Gale’s Chimney Rock Shop – the clothing, souvenirs, and photos that had been inside the 77-year-old store now outside in sodden piles on a cold October afternoon – moved with deliberate slowness, trying to assess what could be saved from what was gone forever.",2024-10-28
Zerohedge,"Whoopi Goldberg: Trump Will Break Up Interracial Marriages, Deport The Non-White Person","The media continues to make absurd assertions against Donald Trump in a desperate effort to derail his campaign just a week out from the election. The latest came via Whoopi Goldberg on The View who claimed that Trump plans to break up interracial married couples and deport the person who is not white.
Not only that, but Golderberg also claimed that Trump would then “put the white guy with someone else.”
It’s completely absurd claim that resides only in her warped reality.
“He’s not gonna be — he’s not gonna say, ‘Oh, you’re with a white guy, I’m gonna keep you from being deported,’” Goldberg blurted.
“No, he’s gonna deport you and put the white guy with someone else,” she ridiculously asserted.
“The man is out there!” she screamed wide eyed.

As if that wasn’t enough batshit crazy, The View then wheeled out “Morning Joe” host Mika Brzezinski who literally started crying and saying all Trump supporters are Nazis.
“These are the final hours,” she warned, adding “I come with such dire warnings, and I mean them from the bottom of my heart!” asserting that we are witnessing the “descent into fascism.”

Zerohedge,Who Is Actually Running The Country?,"Members of both American political parties and other concerned observers have been asking for a while now, ""Who's actually running the country?""
John Richardson, via The Gatestone Institute, says some answers include:
Former President Barack Obama, who, in November 2020, said on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert:
""People would ask me, knowing what you know now, do you wish you had a third term? And I used to say, ""You know what? If I could make an arrangement where I had a stand-in, a front man or front woman, and they had an earpiece in, and I was just in my basement in my sweats looking through the stuff, and then I could sort of deliver the lines, but somebody else was doing all the talking and ceremony, I'd be fine with that.""
George Soros, of whom the journalist Wayne Allen Root wrote:
""Obama take his marching orders from George Soros.""
The Chinese Communist Party, about whom Root wrote:
""[T]he real power behind the throne. The boss of bosses. The capo di tutti. China and the Chinese Communist Party. Everyone is taking orders from China and the CCP. China bribes all the politicians in America and around the world with billions in offshore bank accounts. China owns Biden and his family. China owns virtually the entire leadership of the Democratic Party -- and quite a few establishment RINO Republicans, too.... It's easy to see China is the top dog. You'd have to be blind, deaf or really dumb to not see that. Everything happening ... just happens to weaken and divide America while benefiting China.""
And of course Jill Biden, who was recently asked by the president to chair a Cabinet meeting.
More often, it seems, it is a cadre of unelected bureaucrats – a faceless politburo – who uphold the law or not, according to political expediency or whim.
American author and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy has called this group ""a machine.""
Are ""open borders"" legal or not? Are immigration laws being violated or not? Are illegal aliens, then, legal or not? Are prosecutions of presidential candidates within a month of a presidential election ""election interference"" or not? Were the deliberate lies of former US intelligence officials to the US public about the authenticity of Hunter Biden's laptop actionable ""election interference"" or not?
What we should probably be asking, as we head to November, is: ""Do we really want to go on living like that?""",2024-10-29
Zerohedge,"Trump, Former White House Staffers Reject John Kelly's ""Fascist"" Claims","Former President Donald Trump and previous members of his administration say that claims made by former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly are “patently false.”
Kelly, a retired Marine Corps general, worked for the Trump administration from 2017 to 2019. He has spoken out multiple times against Trump during the election—most recently in interviews with The New York Times and The Atlantic.
In those interviews, Kelly said Trump fitted the general definition of a fascist and alleged that the former president said he wanted “German generals,” like Nazi leader Adolph Hitler had.
Several members of the Trump administration, including former Vice President Mike Pence’s former chief of staff, Mike Ayers, have sharply disputed the claims.
“I’ve avoided commenting on intra-staff leaks or rumors or even lies as it relates to my time at the White House but General Kelly’s comments regarding President Trump are too egregious to ignore,” Ayers said on X.
“I was with each of them more than most, and his commentary is *patently false.*”
Mark Paoletta, general counsel of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), also spoke out against Kelly, writing on X:
“I don’t believe a word he says. He was a terrible chief of staff who dishonestly kept information from the President to pursue his own agenda.”
Trump himself denounced the stories on Oct. 23, saying Kelly “made up a story out of pure Trump Derangement Syndrome Hatred.”
“Even though I shouldn’t be wasting my time with him, I always feel it’s necessary to hit back in pursuit of THE TRUTH,” Trump said on Truth Social and X.
Both of Kelly’s interviews came out less than two weeks before Election Day, at a time when early voting is underway across several states, and Trump is starting to take the lead in battleground state polls.
Vice President Kamala Harris followed Kelly’s two stories by stating at a CNN town hall that she believed Trump to be a fascist.
Robert F. Kennedy Jr. responded directly to these comments on X, saying, “This is the kind of inflammatory poison that divides our nation and inspires assassins.”
The Atlantic also claimed Trump made disparaging remarks about a dead military servicemember and balked over her funeral expenses.
At a news conference in Austin, Texas, on Oct. 25, the former president also strongly denied making those claims.
“If they didn’t get the military funding, I was going to fund it myself,” Trump said about the funeral for Vanessa Guillen, 20, who was murdered in 2020 while stationed at an Army base in Texas that was then called Fort Hood.
Guillen’s slaying and dismemberment led to an outcry over sexual harassment at U.S. military bases, resulting in changes to laws and discipline of 21 Army personnel; some were faulted for allowing the prime suspect in her killing to escape and commit suicide.
On Friday, Trump thanked Guillen’s family for publicly denouncing The Atlantic’s allegations. The family came to show support for Trump as he addressed reporters at Million Air Austin, a private airplane service.
“The beautiful thing is that these people [Guillen’s relatives] were willing to come out and say it didn’t happen… they didn’t have to do this,” Trump said.
Guillen’s sister, Maya Guillen, and the family’s attorney, Natalie Khawam, made social media posts and TV appearances asserting that the article contained inaccuracies and misrepresentations.
Trump pointed out that the Atlantic’s article was timed to appear just before the Nov. 5 election, increasing the likelihood that a certain percentage of readers would believe what the magazine reported and hold it against his candidacy.
“So I talk about it because it was a terrible thing,” Trump said about the article after touching on multiple other topics, including illegal immigration and election integrity.

Zerohedge,Nevada Supreme Court Upholds Law On Mail-In Ballots,"Authored by Zachary Stieber via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),
Ballots that arrive by mail can be counted up to three days after Election Day, the Nevada Supreme Court ruled on Oct. 28.
The state’s top court turned away a challenge to a state law that says ballots that arrive without clear postmarks, provided they’re received no later than 5 p.m. on the third day after the election, shall be counted as having been postmarked on or before Election Day.
Nevada officials have interpreted the law as enabling the counting of ballots without any postmarks.
“A mail ballot that has no visible postmark should be interpreted to have an indeterminate postmark, and therefore should be accepted if it has been received by the clerk by mail not later than 5 p.m. on the third day following the election,” the Nevada Secretary of State’s Office said in guidance to county clerks earlier this year.
Republicans said the fact that the law states ballots must be “postmarked” to be counted and the exception is for ballots for which “the date of the postmark cannot be determined” means postmarks are still required.
“That caveat expressly requires the existence of ’the postmark' in order to apply,” they told the Nevada Supreme Court in an appeal.
In an order in August, Nevada District Court Judge James Russell had ruled that the provision lets mail ballots without postmarks be counted and that Republicans had failed to show it was “in the public’s interest to disenfranchise voters.”
The justices said on Oct. 28 that they assumed Republicans had standing, or a sufficient connection to the guidance, on the basis of competitive injury but that they were upholding the lower court decision because Republicans are not likely to prevail in their case.
The justices said both of the interpretations of the law are reasonable but pointed to how lawmakers, when discussing the bill, had talked about how they thought it would let ballots without postmarks be counted. They also noted that the purpose of the bill was, according to lawmakers, to expand the ways in which people vote and make it easier to vote.
“If a voter properly and timely casts their vote by mailing their ballot before or on the day of the election, and through a post office omission the ballot is not postmarked, it would go against public policy to discount that properly cast vote,” the state’s high court wrote. “Indeed, there is no principled distinction between mail ballots where the postmark is ‘illegible’ or ’smudged' and those with no postmark.”
In response to the ruling, a spokesperson for the Republican National Committee told The Epoch Times that the ruling goes against the state law.
“Requiring ballots to be postmarked on or before election day is a critical election integrity safeguard that ensures ballots mailed after election day are not counted. It is also a requirement of Nevada law,” Claire Zunk wrote in an email.
“By allowing Nevada officials to ignore the law’s postmark requirement, the state’s highest court has undermined the integrity of Nevada’s elections.”
The campaign of former President Donald Trump did not respond to a request for comment by publication time.
“This is great news for Nevada,” Athar Haseebullah, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada, wrote on social media platform X. “Changing rules a week before the election would have been unconscionable.”
Justice Douglas Herndon said he concurred with his colleagues on Republicans not showing they will suffer irreparable harm absent an injunction but sees the law as unambiguously not allowing the counting of ballots without postmarks.
Justice Kristina Pickering said that Republicans were not arguing that every ballot needed a postmark but only ballots that arrive in the days after the election. She said she shared Herndon’s concern with the majority’s decision but that she was not convinced of the Republican interpretation either. Pickering also said that it would not be in the public interest to reverse the lower court order so close to the election.",2024-10-30
Zerohedge,Texas AG Ken Paxton Files Criminal Referral Outlining Act Blue Illegal Campaign Finance Activity,"Many people might think that Attorney General Ken Paxton filing a letter of notice for criminal referral to the U.S Dept of Justice is an act of futility, because the DOJ is not going to investigate or indict criminal conduct by leftist political operatives. However, there is a strategic process to follow, particularly if the Texas AG is likely to become the next U.S. Attorney General.
In a way this step-by-step proactive approach is exactly why my efforts to intercept fraudulent ballot printing operations in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania were targeted to the Postmasters General in specific locales. It is unlawful to use the U.S.P.S. to conduct fraud through the postal system. Additionally, it is specifically illegal for a postmaster to be provided with direct evidence of mail fraud, and to knowingly – with intent, allow further unlawful activity therein.
Texas AG Ken Paxton is following a procedural process that builds a legal pathway.
TEXAS – Attorney General Ken Paxton made a criminal referral to the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) detailing the results of an investigation that revealed how suspicious actors seemingly use ActBlue’s political fundraising platform to make illegal straw donations.
The investigation into ActBlue began in December 2023 following allegations that the company could be facilitating illegal campaign contributions. As a result, in August 2024 ActBlue began requiring donors using credit cards to provide “CVV” codes, a common security measure. That does not prevent all the abuses that Attorney General Paxton’s team has identified on ActBlue, including that straw donations apparently are being made on a large scale using false identities, through untraceable payment methods.
On Monday, Attorney General Paxton sent a petition for rulemaking to the Federal Election Commission (“FEC”) urging changes that would close loopholes that can be exploited to illegally funnel money into American elections. When the FEC previously considered adopting rules that could prevent straw donation schemes like those uncovered by the investigation, ActBlue opposed such changes.
“I have made a criminal referral to the U.S. Department of Justice based on the findings from our investigation into ActBlue. My investigation uncovered evidence showing that bad actors are likely using ActBlue’s platform to make illegal campaign contributions,” said Attorney General Paxton. “It is illegal to engage in election fraud and it is illegal to obscure one’s identity to flout election rules. The Department of Justice must take immediate action to prevent illegal conduct in our elections.” (link)
Reminder….. With the Legislative Branch compromised by their own creation, and with the Judicial Branch stuck inside an old paradigm of “national security” you can see how confronting the DOJ operation can only come from one place, THE OVAL OFFICE.
The President of the United States, hopefully Donald J Trump, is going to have to do what the other branches have failed to do, take apart the DOJ and change all the functions of Main Justice to their pre-Patriot Act status. This is not going to be easy and will take a very specific type of person as U.S. Attorney General who both understands the issue and can, more importantly, articulate the problem to the larger American public.
- The President Trump Attorney General needs to be ultra clean with a spine of steel and a laser focus. The AG needs to totally understand the goals and objectives, without being told what the goals and objectives are. The AG needs to be independent, stable, strategic, brutally honest and keenly confident in his/her communication style with the attack media.
President Trump cannot spend exhaustive time instructing the AG on critical priorities. The AG needs to operate with skill, focus and self-motivated energy. The AG will be the focus of the Lawfare crew for removal/recusal. (Weissmann, McCord, Eisen, etc.)
- The Deputy AG needs to be intensely capable to stay on task with minimal supervision. The DAG is the git-r’-done person, no excuses, no apologies, no explanations. Raw, brutal, cold, quiet and determined. The DAG needs eyes of a mouse and ears of an elephant. The DAG needs to be a sponge, with total loyalty to the mission. The DAG also needs to be the bridge to the FBI.",2024-10-25
Zerohedge,"Trump's Attorneys Seek Election Case Dismissal, Say Special Council Appointment Unconstitutional","Former President Donald Trump’s attorneys argued in a new filing on Oct. 24 that Special Counsel Jack Smith’s superseding indictment should be dismissed since his appointment was unconstitutional.
“Everything that Smith did since Attorney General [Merrick] Garland’s appointment, as President Trump continued his leading campaign against President Biden and then Vice President Harris, was unlawful and unconstitutional,” Trump’s attorneys said in a filing to D.C. Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is overseeing his election interference case.
“That includes Smith’s separate violation of the Appropriations Clause by relying on an appropriation that does not apply in order to take more than $20 million from taxpayers,” the filing added.
The filing was a motion requesting that Chutkan allow Trump to submit another motion to dismiss based on the legality of Smith’s appointment. Trump is seeking not only dismissal of the superseding indictment but also an injunction preventing Smith from “spending additional public funds” while violating the Constitution.
It’s the latest attempt by Trump to obtain rulings that would severely weaken or end Smith’s prosecution, which restarted after months of delay as the Supreme Court weighed Trump’s appeal on presidential immunity.
Trump is seeking to dismiss the case based on the Supreme Court’s ruling that presidents have some immunity, as well as based on its decision from June in Fischer v. United States, which narrowed Smith’s application of an obstruction statute used against Jan. 6 defendants.
Trump’s latest filing echoes arguments from Florida Judge Aileen Cannon, who dismissed Smith’s classified documents case against Trump in the state. Both Trump and Cannon also cited Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, whose concurring opinion in the immunity decision raised doubts about the legitimacy of Smith’s appointment.
That case is headed towards the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit where Smith is seeking an appeal of Cannon’s decision. If the 11th Circuit and Chutkan return differing opinions on this issue, it could prompt the type of circuit split that reaches the Supreme Court.
Chutkan has already indicated that she would reject the type of arguments that Cannon used in dismissing the classified documents case. During a status conference on Sept. 5, she said that she didn’t find Cannon’s opinion “particularly persuasive.”
Cannon’s ruling conflicted with a 2019 judgment by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which upheld former special counsel Robert Mueller’s appointment. That 2019 decision wasn’t binding for Chutkan, Trump’s attorneys argued, because it was decided before the Supreme Court issued multiple decisions attempting to rein in agency power through a principle called the “major questions doctrine.”
That doctrine, which the Supreme Court applied in its decision striking down President Joe Biden’s student loan forgiveness, holds that laws should not be interpreted as allowing agencies to decide major questions unless explicitly stated by the text.
Because Congress didn’t provide a clear statement authorizing the appointment of special counsels like Smith, Trump’s attorneys said, his appointment was illegal.
Smith told the 11th Circuit that Cannon’s decision “needlessly casts doubt on longstanding practices in the Department of Justice and across the Executive Branch.”
He disputed Cannon’s ruling on statutory grounds but also took issue with her interpretation of the Supreme Court’s decision in U.S. v. Nixon. That case centered on former President Richard Nixon’s attempt to resist a subpoena from special prosecutor Leon Jaworski.
In that case, the court’s majority defended the special prosecutor’s appointment.
“Under the authority of Art. II, § 2, Congress has vested in the Attorney General the power to conduct the criminal litigation of the United States Government ... It has also vested in him the power to appoint subordinate officers to assist him in the discharge of his duties,” the 1974 majority opinion, authored by Chief Justice Warren Burger, read.
Cannon said in July that the court’s wording was dictum, or nonbinding, on future court decisions. Trump’s attorneys agreed.",2024-10-25
Zerohedge,"Americans Are More Dependent Than Ever On Government Handouts, New Report States","Payments from the government have become the fastest-growing source of income for Americans, according to a new study.
A report by the Economic Innovation Group (EIG), a public policy research organization, titled “The Great Transfer-mation,” states that Americans have become substantially more dependent on government support, with the share of national income coming from transfer payments more than doubling over the past 50 years.
Transfer payment programs include Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, unemployment and disability, food stamps, and veterans’ benefits.
Transfer payments increased from 8 percent of U.S. total income in 1970 to 18 percent today, the report states, crowding out private income from wages and investments.
“There is a large range of experiences driving transfer reliance across communities,” Benjamin Glasner, EIG economist and one of the report’s authors, told The Epoch Times. “But it’s unavoidable to look at the fact that transfer reliance has grown rapidly across the country, and it’s something we need to deal with.”
According to Federal Reserve data, government transfer payments increased from about $70 billion in 1970 to more than $6 trillion in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, before falling back to the current level of $4.3 trillion. According to the EIG report, if government transfer payments were spread evenly among all Americans, they would have amounted to an annual payment of $11,500 per person in 2022.
One factor driving much of the shift from private income to government dependence is that the U.S. population is, on average, getting older. According to demographic data from USAfacts, the percentage of Americans 65 years and older increased from 13.1 percent of the population in 2010 to 17.3 percent in 2022. During the same period, the percentage of Americans under the age of 20 fell from 26.9 percent to 24.4 percent.
“The primary driver that we found in our report is demographic related, specifically the fact that the country has aged so rapidly,” Glasner said. “And the transfer programs that target that aging population also have grown significantly more expensive over time.”
Of all government assistance payments in 2022, 56 percent went to the elderly, mostly for Medicare, the EIG report stated. Health care costs were a major factor, both because more Americans qualified for Medicare and Medicaid, and because the cost of medical treatment rose significantly.
According to data compiled by Peterson-KFF, a health care policy analytics organization, total health spending in the United States was $74.1 billion in 1970. By 2022 total health spending was $4.5 trillion, indicating an exponential increase in medical costs per capita.
Public Finances Under Strain
The growth in transfer payments have taken their toll on state and federal budgets.
The 2024 Pension Solvency and Performance Report, authored by Ryan Frost and Mariana Trujillo for Reason Foundation’s Pension Integrity Project, stated that public pensions are increasingly falling behind on their ability to pay.
As of 2023, the authors state, total unfunded public pension liabilities across the United States hit $1.59 trillion, and the median funded ratio was 76 percent. The U.S. federal deficit is currently $1.8 trillion, and interest payments on U.S. government debt increased from $31 billion in 1970 to more than $1 trillion today.
In addition, some analysts say that this growing dependence on government comes at the cost of personal autonomy and responsibility.
“The surge in transfer payments during the past 50 years is just one manifestation of the trend to politicize and tangle up all aspects of Americans’ lives with the government,” Steve Hanke, professor of Applied Economics at Johns Hopkins University and a member of the board of directors of the Federal Fiscal Sustainability Foundation, told The Epoch Times. “It results because of politicians’ inevitable attraction to buy votes by promising ‘free lunches,’ and the fact that politicians don’t face statutory or constitutional spending constraints.”
To illustrate the extent of the shift to government dependence, EIG created maps showing the percentage of income that came from transfer payments, broken down by county, over time.
In 1970, only about 1 percent of all U.S. counties reported that government transfers made up more than 25 percent of total income in their county; by 2022, more than half of U.S. counties reported dependence at that level.

Aging, Shrinking Populations
While the reasons for this dependence varied from region to region, aging populations, and outward migration were common themes, particularly in rural counties. Often, young people leave small towns for better jobs in cities, and this both increases the percentage of retired people and decreases the number of people earning private wages in rural areas.
In addition, as societies industrialize, people migrate from farms to cities, and women enter the labor force in larger numbers, and fertility rates fall. While this trend has been observed over the past several decades throughout the world, the United States has been experiencing this trend for two centuries.
In 1825, the average woman in America gave birth to more than six children, according to Statista, a data collection firm. As the United States industrialized and urbanized, the birth rate declined, hitting a low of two children per woman in 1940 before rebounding to 3.58 children in 1960, during the “baby boom” generation.
The minimum fertility rate to sustain a population is 2.1 children per woman. The United States dipped below this rate in 1973 and has remained below replacement level ever since, according to data from Macrotrends. While U.S. fertility rates increased marginally through 2008, they have since fallen back to the current rate of about 1.8 children per woman.
While countries such as Japan have seen their populations fall due to low fertility, the United States has experienced continuous population growth. But this is largely due to immigration rather than native-born Americans having children.
The Congressional Budget Office projects that, without immigration, America’s population will begin to shrink, starting in 2040.
Economic Security Versus Prosperity
The increasing dependence on the government for income raises the issue of how the United States can balance economic security for its dependents against overall economic growth and prosperity.
“The increased politicization of life will put a damper on economic prosperity,” Hanke said. “For every dollar taken out of one taxpayer’s pocket and put into another’s, there is a cost, an excess burden.
“This burden is the result of distortions thrown into the economy by imposing a tax, and the administrative costs of levying the tax and of running the government’s transfer payments system,” he said.
Arthur Laffer, a noted economist who specializes in tax policy, wrote in his 2023 book, “Taxes Have Consequences,” that raising taxes much beyond current levels will choke off economic growth, thus reducing the tax base.
“The more you redistribute, the greater will be the drop in total income,” Laffer said in a 2023 interview with The Epoch Times.
Consequently, governments are increasingly caught between a rock and a hard place regarding how to pay for social programs.
Interest payments on America’s federal debt are currently the third largest budget item, after Social Security and non-defense discretionary spending, and exceeding Medicare and military spending, an August 2024 report by the Peter G. Peterson Foundation states based on Congressional Budget Office projections published in June.
Treasury data for the fiscal year 2024, running Oct. 1, 2023, to Sept. 30, show that interest expense was $896 billion.
According to projections from the Congressional Budget Office, interest payments on the federal debt will double as a percentage of GDP by 2054 and will become the largest single item in the federal budget by 2051.
Potential Solutions
According to Glasner, there are three options for governments to continue providing transfer payments. The first is cutting benefits, but that appears to be politically untenable, and neither Democrats nor Republicans have expressed any intention to do so.
The second is raising taxes, he said, “but there’s some risk to that, because overdoing increases in taxation can potentially cut off sources of economic growth, undercutting our actual capacity to deal with this.”
The third and most viable option, Glasner argues, is to increase economic growth and private income. Among the ways to do this, he says, are “investments in research and innovation, better-designed immigration policy, and tax and regulatory policies that foster economic dynamism and increased participation in the workforce.”
Although America’s financial situation may appear dire, a September report from the Manhattan Institute titled “America’s Surprisingly Effective Welfare State,” argues that the United States is in better shape than many other Western nations.
While Europe’s social programs provide support payments regardless of need, America’s transfer systems are more selective and thus less costly while delivering more money to the poorest.
“Europe’s welfare states are dominated by costly publicly funded ‘social insurance’ programs, which attempt to fully support middle-class lifestyles through periods of unemployment, ill health, disability, or retirement,” the report states. “By contrast, American public entitlement programs are more focused on providing a safety net against poverty, and they more strictly limit eligibility for cash and health care benefits to those who are unable to work.”",2024-10-27
Zerohedge,Trump Election Odds Near 67% As Polymarket Whale Bets Another $2M,"Former United States President Donald Trump’s lead on the top blockchain-based betting market is nearing 67% as a mysterious whale continues to bet on his victory in the upcoming presidential election on Nov. 5.
Trump’s odds of winning the election surpassed 66.3% on the leading decentralized predictions market on Oct. 28, according to Polymarket data.

Trump’s odds increased after a Polymarket whale, or large holder, invested another $2 million worth of USD Coin USDC$1.00 tokens into pro-Trump bets.
The mysterious whale has spent $7.22 million on “Yes” shares, according to onchain intelligence firm Lookonchain, which wrote in an Oct. 28 X post:
“Since Oct 11, the whale has spent 7.22 million $USDC to buy 11.28 million ‘Yes' shares on Donald Trump winning the US election, with an unrealized profit of $256,000.”
With only seven days until the 2024 US presidential election, decentralized prediction markets may offer more accurate predictions than traditional polling systems, according to billionaire Elon Musk.
The Polymarket odds flipped in Trump’s favor on Oct. 4, marking a sharp reversal from September. By Oct. 12, Trump was leading by over 10 points, Cointelegraph reported.
Mysterious Polymarket whale seems unrelated to “Fredi9999”
The mysterious Polymarket whale, known as “zxgngl,” holds over 11.2 million “Yes” votes worth over $7.5 million, according to Polymarket data.

The increasing positions come after the top Trump bettor on Polymarket, “Fredi9999,” bolstered Trump’s odds above 60.2% by buying over $20 million worth of “Yes” shares up to Oct. 18.
Moreover, Fredi’s transaction patterns suggest that it controls four of the six largest Trump-voting accounts on Polymarket, all funded with Kraken deposits.

While 99% of zxgngl’s bets were also placed on Trump, their account was funded by Binance, not the Kraken exchange. Their transaction patterns are also different, with the last two Binance deposits being worth $338,000 and $1.68 million, respectively.

As for Fredi, the account is likely controlled by a person with deep confidence in a Trump victory, according to pseudonymous political bettor Domer, who told Cointelegraph:
“My guess is it is a true believer who is very rich and trying to make a big bet. He is getting more confident as the price goes higher and is in a confirmation bias loop where new information keeps increasing his confidence.”
US presidential elections fuel 565% prediction market growth
The upcoming US elections have boosted investor interest in prediction markets.
The betting volume on prediction markets rose over 565.4% in the third quarter to reach $3.1 billion across the three largest markets, up from just $463.3 million in the second quarter.

Zerohedge,"Ballot Drop-Boxes Torched In Portland, Vancouver - Could Affect Tightest US House Race","As pre-election passions intensify down the stretch to Election Day, two ballot drop-boxes in the adjacent cities of Portland, Oregon and Vancouver, Washington were torched with incendiary devices on Monday morning, incinerating hundreds of ballots and potentially affecting the outcome of one of the tightest US House races in the country. ""I strongly denounce any acts of terror that aim to disrupt lawful and fair elections in Washington state,"" said Washington Secretary of State Steve Hobbs in a statement.
The box in Portland fared better by far: Thanks to the successful activation of its internal fire-suppression system, only three ballots were damaged. However, in Vancouver, hundreds of ballots were fully destroyed as that box's anti-arson technology failed. Both boxes had systems designed to release a flame-suppressing powder when a certain temperature in the box is detected. The Vancouver box had last been emptied at 8:00 am on Sunday.

Hundreds of ballots destroyed.
I was told that dropping votes inside an unattended box on the street was a good idea.
No way to tell what votes were burned or who they even belonged to. Absolute insanity. pic.twitter.com/QIa7aIQYlu
The Portland box was attacked at 3:30 am and the Vancouver box at 4:00 am. Portland police released photos of a Volvo S-60 they think was involved in both incidents. They place the model year between 2001 and 2004. The sedan didn't have a front license plate, and cops weren't able to read the rear tag. Investigators suspect Monday's twin attacks are related to an earlier incident on Oct. 8 in Vancouver, in which a box was found aflame with some type of device lying next to it. Apparently, no ballots were harmed that time.
Vancouver sits inside Washington's 3rd Congressional District, home to what's widely viewed as the country's tightest House race. In 2022, Democratic Marie Gluesenkamp Perez beat Republican former Green Beret and CIA field agent Joe Kent by just 2,629 votes out of nearly 320,000 votes cast. This year's race is a rematch, and Gluesenkamp Perez is considered the House Democrat at greatest risk of being ousted. In an addition signal of Gluesenkamp Perez's peril, Trump won the district in both 2016 and 2020.
In turn, the Washington-3 race could decide control of the House. 538's simulator gives the GOP a 52% chance of keeping the reins. On the other hand, The Economist's model favors the Democrats by a 53% to 47% probability margin.
Considering Democrats account for 54% of mail-in ballots requested in Washington -- versus Republicans requesting 36% of total requests -- any attack on a drop-box would generally seem likely to benefit Republicans, particularly when those boxes are in urban areas that skew even more Democratic.
“We don’t know the motives behind these acts -- sounds like a series of three at this point -- but we do know that acts like this are targeted and intentional,” Portland Police Bureau Assistant Chief Amanda McMillan told reporters Monday. (Brilliant thinking, Sherlock!) “We are concerned about that intentional act trying to affect the election process.""
Clark County Washington auditor Greg Kimsey encouraged people who'd dropped ballots in the box after 11 am Saturday to call his office and request a new ballot. He said his department will increase ballot-pickup frequency, switch to evening collection, and hire monitors to provide 24-hour supervision of the boxes. He foolishly disclosed that the monitors will be ordered not to confront arsonists, and to instead merely call 911 if they see something suspicious -- maybe like flames and smoke pouring out of the box?
Last week, Phoenix, Arizona police arrested a suspect who allegedly set fire to a ballot drop-box situated at a post office in that city. About 20 ballots were believed to have been damaged in the incident that took place at 1:20 am.

Zerohedge,"Michigan's Early Voters Brave Long Lines, Break Records","Authored by Nathan Worcester via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),
As Michigan’s statewide early voting began on Oct. 26, long wait times discouraged more than a few would-be participants who spoke with The Epoch Times.
Bill Keller decided against sitting in a two-hour line in Farmington Hills.
“I think what I’ll do is absentee vote,” the supporter of Vice President Kamala Harris told The Epoch Times before he walked back to his car.
Farnsworth and Tricia Howard were deterred by the line at a site in Waterford Oaks.
Farnsworth, a retired United Auto Workers union representative, told The Epoch Times they planned to vote for former President Donald Trump in the hopes of ushering in “a new era.”
For all the attrition, the state posted record-breaking returns.
It is Michigan’s first presidential election to see the process of early voting, which was instituted via a 2022 ballot proposal to amend the state constitution, and Oct. 26 saw more than 145,000 early ballots cast.
“We’re starting a new tradition of early voting here in Michigan,” Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said in a statement announcing the figures.
The buzz of activity was reflected in the polling numbers. By late in the afternoon, 463 ballots had been pushed through the tabulator at the Farmington Hills site.
“This is a higher turnout than we expected,” said Dawn Raymond, who was overseeing early voting at the site.
She told The Epoch Times that things had gone well: “We haven’t had many people with any political issues that they’re trying to bring up with us when it’s something that we shouldn’t be discussing here.”
For senior citizen Leia, like many other voters, 2024 is about more than policy and dry statistics—it is charged with emotion. She and her husband Hans did not wish to use their real name for fear of reprisal.
A dietician, Leia described the election as her chance to oppose Trump, a man she likened to Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.
“Harris makes you feel good,” she said.
Leia’s husband, Hans, noted that his own brother-in-law was attending a nearby Trump rally. Harris held a rally in the state the same day.
“All my friends that like Trump think that somehow, that Trump’s going to make their lives better,” said Hans, a retired specialty store owner. “What the world would be like if Trump does everything he says he’s gonna do—that’s a scary, scary thought.”
A few feet away, Emma Wolford had just voted in her first election as a U.S. citizen.
“I moved to the U.S. from England when I was almost nine,” she said.
Trump earned her support.
“I left a socialist country and came here for a better future,” she said.
Wofford is a graduate of Hillsdale College, a school known for its conservatism. Some of her friends from that institution oppose Trump, she said.
Tricia Howard said her biggest motivator to vote was “the safety of our country.”
Her husband Farnsworth, who is a U.S. Army veteran, was particularly concerned about the border.
He isn’t happy that foreigners who entered the country illegally can get resources even as many American veterans are homeless.
The retired UAW union representative is also concerned about electric vehicle mandates.
Another couple, Adam and Michelle Stankus, waited roughly an hour in line at Waterford Oaks. They weren’t making a statement by showing up on day one of early voting—they just wanted to get it out of the way.
“Vote now, vote later, vote mail-in—it’s all the same,” Adam Stankus said.
They were glad to vote against Trump—“against fascism,” as Adam put it.
Matthew Kovach, who was waiting for his ride outside the Waterford Oaks site, said he came out to fight communism and globalism. To him, that meant voting for Trump.
Kovach was disabled after a serious car accident in 2021.
“They thought I was going to be a vegetable,” he recalled. He thanked God that didn’t happen.
“They say President Trump dodged death. I dodged death. That’s the only thing we’ve got in common,” he said with a laugh.
Kovach hopes to play hockey again someday. For now, he’s recovering his mobility. He brought his crutches to the early voting site in case of long lines.
Andy Kollin spent an hour and fifty minutes at the Farmington Hills site.
“I don’t want to see #45 [Trump] in office again,” he said when asked what brought him out on the first day of early voting.
Kollin said he was glad to see people turn out in high numbers, “whichever way they’re voting.”
Shortly before 4:30 p.m., a trio of young Michiganders appeared on the edge of the parking lot at the Waterford Oaks site. A young man and two young women were trying to cast their early ballots before the site closed for the day.
The Epoch Times jogged with them to the door, where they barely missed the cutoff. Nathan Rehm let out a groan.
“I’m more of a Trump guy,” said Rehm, an engineering student at Michigan State University (MSU). Winter Runyan and her sister, Gabby, both support Trump too.
“I just can’t imagine Kamala Harris sitting down with world leaders,” he said.
Rehm has grown more comfortable voicing support for Trump on campus. He wonders if hatred for the former president has ebbed
“What college major you are plays a role,” said Winter Runyan, who is also an MSU student. “He’s an engineering major, so I feel like a lot of people are more on the Republican side,” she said of Rehm.
As a health care student, Winter Runyan’s less inclined to reveal her political preference to her peers.
“I do feel judged, and I definitely think they’re going to have some view towards me,” she said, adding that she counts many Democrats among her friends.
The Runyan sisters work alongside each other. Gabby is a dispatcher, while Winter is an emergency medical technician. Winter wants to be a physician assistant.
Although the three weren’t pleased to miss out on the first day of early voting, they were determined to make their voices heard.
“We’ll be back tomorrow,” Winter Runyan said.",2024-10-28

As expected, she sought to lump Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and Vladimir Putin together in a segment on 'disinformation' this week.
""He's at it again!"" Nuland claimed of Putin, resurrecting talking points heavily featured in the prior two elections as well. She accused Musk of being in essence a useful idiot of the Kremlin, allowing Putin to use ""sophisticated tools"" on his X platform to 'interfere' and influence voters. ""And he has more sophisticated tools... He's got a brand new, very powerful tool, which is Elon Musk and X,"" Nuland claimed of Putin (and by extension Trump, according to her talking points).

""In 2020, the social media companies worked hard with the U.S. government to try to do content moderation, to try to catch this stuff as it was happening. This time, we have Elon Musk talking directly to the Kremlin and ensuring that every time the Russians put out something, it gets five million views before anyone can catch it,"" Nuland continued. And then she warned: ""Trump is taking Putin lessons, as autocrats around the world are.""
Maddow, for her part, added: ""For the United States to not be the leader of the free world, but rather in effectively a sort of 'Axis' with the dictators of Russia and China, and North Korea."" So clearly Maddow wanted to escalate the claims to put Trump in league with all dictators of the world, absurdly enough.
""For the United States to be allied with those countries instead of our traditional alliances -- I'm not sure people have absorbed the magnitude of what you're describing there,"" Maddow followed with.
Aaron Maté, an indepdent journalist who has spent years debunking key Russiagate talking points, issued the following commentary in reaction to the Nuland-Maddow interview segment...
* * *
For a third consecutive presidential election, Russiagate propagandists are accusing Russia of manipulating Americans into not voting for their preferred candidate. Here, Victoria Nuland complains that Twitter is no longer partnering with the US gov't to censor stories -- what she calls the ""content moderation"" that we saw ""in 2020.""
This is a reference to censoring journalism on Hunter Biden's laptop based on the CIA lie that it was ""Russian disinformation.""
Speaking of Russia and election interference, Nuland is well-versed in practicing it: as a senior State Dept. official, she was instrumental in funneling the Clinton-funded ""Steele dossier"" into the FBI. She personally authorized the early July 2016 meeting where Steele gave an FBI agent his dossier, which helped kick off the multi-year Russiagate scam.

This giant jump sent the YoY sales print up 2.16% YoY - the first annual gain since Nov 2021.
“Contract signings rose across all regions of the country as buyers took advantage of the combination of lower mortgage rates in late summer and more inventory choices,” NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said in a prepared statement.
“Further gains are expected if the economy continues to add jobs, inventory levels grow and mortgage rates hold steady.”

“After two years of sluggish home sales in 2023 and 2024, existing-home sales are forecasted to rise to 4.47 million in 2025 and more than 5 million in 2026,” Yun said in the release.
“During the next two years, expect a slower rate of growth in home prices that’s roughly in line with the consumer price index because of additional supply reaching the market.”

Zerohedge,The Thin Blue Line: University Professors Are Approaching Near Unanimity As A Democratic Lock,"The 2024 presidential election is shaping up to be the single most divisive election in our history.
The public is split right down the middle with almost every group splintering between former president Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.
There is, however, one group that seems almost unanimous: professors.
A new survey of more than 1,000 professors shows that seventy-eight percent will vote for Harris and only eight percent will vote for Trump. Other than a poll of the Democratic National Committee, there are few groups that are more reliably Democratic or liberal.
For anyone in higher education, the result is hardly surprising. The poll tracks what we already know about the gradual purging of departments around the country of conservative, libertarian, and dissenting professors.
Indeed, the lack of political and intellectual diversity may be turning some donors and even applicants from higher education. With failing revenue and applications, universities are starting to re-embrace commitments to neutrality on political issues.
Some, however, are doubling down on advocacy and orthodoxy.
In an op-ed this week, Wesleyan University President Michael Roth called on universities to reject “institutional neutrality” and officially support Kamala Harris. Calling neutrality “a retreat,” Roth compared Trump’s election to the rise of the Nazis and insisted that schools should “give up the popular pastime of criticizing the woke and call out instead the overt racism.”
He added, without a hint of self-awareness or irony, that “we should not be silenced because of fears of appearing partisan.”
In my book “The Indispensable Right: Free Speech in an Age of Rage,” I discuss the intolerance in higher education and surveys showing that many departments no longer have a single Republican as faculties replicate their own views and values.
So not only are professors voting en mass for Harris, Roth would have the schools themselves work openly for her election.
That ideological echo chamber is hardly an enticement for many who are facing rising high tuition costs with relatively little hope of being taught by faculty with opposing views.
There are obviously many reasons why faculty may reject Trump specifically, but this poll also tracks more generally the self-identification and contributions of faculty.
A Georgetown study recently found that only nine percent of law school professors identify as conservative at the top 50 law schools — almost identical to the percentage of Trump voters found in the new poll.
Notably, Roth acknowledged that the current lack of intellectual diversity in higher education had become so extreme that there might be a need for “an affirmative action program for conservatives.”
However, he and others continue to saw feverishly on the branch upon which we all sit in higher education in calling for even greater political advocacy.
There is little evidence that faculty members have any interest in changing this culture or creating greater diversity at schools. In places like North Carolina State University a study found that Democrats outnumbered Republicans 20 to 1.
Recently, I had a debate at Harvard Law School with Professor Randall Kennedy on whether Harvard protects free speech and intellectual diversity.
This year, Harvard found itself in a familiar spot on the annual ranking of Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE): dead last among 251 universities and colleges.
Harvard has long dismissed calls for greater free speech protections or intellectual diversity. It shows.
The Harvard Crimson has documented how the school’s departments have virtually eliminated Republicans. In one study of multiple departments last year, they found that more than 75 percent of the faculty self-identified as “liberal” or “very liberal.”
Only 5 percent identified as “conservative,” and only 0.4% as “very conservative.”
Consider that, according to Gallup, the U.S. population is roughly equally divided among conservatives (36%), moderates (35%), and liberals (26%).
So Harvard has three times the number of liberals as the nation at large and less than three percent identify as “conservative’ rather than 35% nationally.
Among law school faculty who have donated more than $200 to a political party, a breathtaking 91 percent of the Harvard faculty gave to democrats.
The student body shows the same bias of selection. Harvard Crimson previously found that only 7 percent of incoming students identified as conservative. For the vast majority of liberal faculty and students, Harvard amplifies rather than stifles their viewpoints.
This does not happen randomly. Indeed, if a business reduced the number of women or minorities to less than 5 percent, a court would likely find de facto discrimination.
Yet, Kennedy rejected the notion that the elite school should strive to “look more like America.”
It is not just that schools like Harvard “do not look like America,” it does not even look like liberal Massachusetts, which is almost 30 percent Republican.
Our students are being educated by faculty taken from the same liberal elite of just 26 percent of our nation.
Some sites like Above the Law have supported the exclusion of conservative faculty. Senior Editor Joe Patrice defended “predominantly liberal faculties” by arguing that hiring a conservative law professor is akin to allowing a believer in geocentrism to teach at a university.
The result is that law students at schools like Harvard have relatively few faculty to reflect the views of half of the judiciary and the majority of the Supreme Court.
Likewise, having a faculty that ranges from the left to the far left further marginalizes the small number of conservative students.
The impact of this academic echo chamber is evident in surveys showing that 28 percent of Harvard students engaged in self-censorship — a figure doubling since just 2021.
Given my respect for Professor Kennedy, I was surprised that he dismissed the sharp rise in students saying that they did not feel comfortable speaking in classes. Referring to them as “conservative snowflakes,” he insisted that they simply had to have the courage of their convictions.
This ignores that they depend upon professors for recommendations and their challenging the orthodoxy at the school can threaten their standing.
Moreover, Kennedy defended cancel campaigns or “disinvitations” of speakers as a form of free speech. As students see faculty supporting the cancelling of conservative or libertarian or dissenting speakers, it is hardly an invitation to speak freely yourself in class.
There was a hopeful aspect, however, to the debate. Before the debate the large audience voted heavily in favor of Harvard’s position. However, after the debate, they overwhelming voted against Harvard’s position on free speech.
It is an example of how exposure to opposing views can change the bias or assumptions in higher education.
There is little likelihood that Harvard or higher education will change. It is like the old joke about how many psychiatrists it takes to change a light bulb. The answer is just one but the bulb really has to want to change.
Academics like Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC Berkeley law school, have denounced conservative justices as mere “partisan hacks.” Other faculty have joined in claims that Trump and his supporters are “fascists” out to destroy democracy. It is only likely to get worse after the election.
The political polling of professors reflects the near complete cleansing of colleges of conservative faculty. The question is whether donors or applicants will continue to support an echo chamber that has become ideologically deafening.

Zerohedge,Overton Window Shifts Towards Liberty,"There's been a seismic shift in the mood of the American people. Have you noticed?
The propaganda and manipulation by Democrats, Deep State non-profits (funded by radical leftist billionaires), and corporate media outlets have lost control of the narratives just days before the presidential election—they're no longer effective at propping up Kamala Harris—as a majority of American people reject censorship, wokeism and whatever this is...

Americans are now more interested in upholding the values of the West, the US Constitution, and the Declaration of Independence, with some youth seeking traditionalism. The far-left slant of the Overton window during the Biden-Harris administration appears to be shifting the other way/ or perhaps widening.
The Overton Window is a range of acceptable policy ideas within mainstream political debate. For years, corporate MSM, radical leftist non-profits, and far-left activists in government and corporations have artificially pushed the window to the left, force-feeding Americans into radical leftist ideas to transform the nation towards a pathway towards socialism/or 21st-century communism.
History may show that Elon Musk's X and former President Trump shifted the Overton Window from a leftist extreme to more of a center-right. Americans are increasingly giving up on woke pronouns, instead focusing on ""Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.""
Musk has shown MSM's matrix has glitched, with an X post stating, ""The refreshing cool breeze of a wide open Overton Window.""

Zerohedge,"Former Vatican Ambassador Calls Kamala ""An Infernal Monster Who Obeys Satan""","Former Vatican Roman Catholic Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò endorsed Donald Trump for president this week, urging that Kamala Harris represents “an anti-Catholic, anti-Christian, and anti-human vision of society.”
Viganò, who was the Vatican’s ambassador to the US from 2011 to 2016, writes in a letter to Catholics “The choice is between a conservative President, who is paying with his very life for his fight against the deep state, and an infernal monster who obeys Satan.”

“For a Catholic, there can be no question: voting for Kamala Harris is morally inadmissible and constitutes a very grave sin. Nor is it morally possible to abstain, because in this war declaring oneself neutral means allying oneself with the enemy,” he further asserts.
A vote for Trump “means firmly distancing ourselves from an anti-Catholic, anti-Christian, and anti-human vision of society,” Viganò continues, adding “It means stopping those who want to create a hellish dystopia that is even worse than the one announced by George Orwell.”
Viganò urges that Trump is “the only possible choice to counter the globalist coup that the woke Left is about to implement definitively, irreparably, and with incalculable damage for future generations.”
The former archbishop further describes Harris as a George Soros “puppet,” who is controlled directly by Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton.
Viganò was excommunicated from the Catholic Church in July after repeatedly voicing opposition to the current Pope and modern changes made to the Roman Catholic Church.
He was extremely outspoken in opposing COVID vaccines, charging that public health authorities were conducting “experimentation on the entire world population,” and slamming the Catholic church for going along with it.

Zerohedge,"LGBT Activists Meet With Pope, Urge Him To End Vatican Opposition To Trans Ideology","LGBT activists have a strange obsession with religious acceptance, specifically from the Catholic Church. Rational minds would argue that if a group is diametrically opposed to your lifestyle then you would avoid associating with that group. Why clamor for their attention?
In the early days of the gay rights movement the attitude of proponents was essentially that they would go their own way - All they wanted was for religious taboos to no longer be codified into law and used to regulate their lives. It sounds fair enough, but the problem with the political left is their underlying agenda of incrementalism and their unhealthy tendencies toward moral relativism.
In other words, give them an inch and leftists will steal a mile. They see compromise as an invitation to dominate. Giving concessions to a leftist is the same as inviting a vampire into your house; do it once and they'll keep coming back to feed whenever they please.
The gay rights issue is a perfect example of this ugly habit. In the 1990s the community was widely accepted in the west, the only right they didn't enjoy was to have their marriages recognized nationally. They claimed that once that right was achieved they would ask nothing more of the Christian community or the church. And of course, that was a lie.
Today, gay and trans rights groups demand that all church denominations accept trans ideology and trans membership. This includes gay and trans church leaders that teach ""tolerance"", mixing activist mantras into religious lessons and supporting ""trans visibility"". Going their separate ways is not enough and lack of association is unacceptable. Leftists require that their beliefs be adopted by everyone everywhere.
The Vatican under Pope Francis has been surprisingly reticent to welcome the trans movement into the fold, despite Francis being a devout globalist on more than a few hot button issues. Earlier this year the Pope called gender ideology the 'worst danger today', noting:
‘I would like to emphasize one thing: It is very important that we have this meeting, this meeting between men and women, because today the worst danger is gender ideology, which erases differences.’
In response, LGBT activist groups are increasing their focus on pressuring the Vatican to change their public position. Trans representatives met with the Pope this month in an 80 minute private discussion. The group included a Catholic sister who works with LGBTQ people, a member of the transgender community, and a U.S. medical doctor who helps run a clinic providing gender-affirming hormonal care for adults.
“I really wanted to share with Pope Francis about the joy that I have being a transgender Catholic person,” Michael Sennett, who took part in the meeting, told Reuters.
Sennett, a transgender man (a biological woman) from Boston, said she told the pontiff about “the joy that I get from hormone replacement therapy and the surgeries that I’ve had that make me feel comfortable in my body.” The group say they specifically urged the Pope to reconsider his opposition to gender affirming care (sex change hormones and surgeries).
It's not know exactly what was said during the event, but activists that met with the Pope claim he expressed an interest in appointing bishops in the US that are 'more open' to transgender Catholics. Considering the idea is a violation of multiple Biblical ideals and doctrines, it's hard to say how this would be possible.
As mentioned, this scenario sounds once again like the incrementalism of the progressive left. It starts with compromises on LGBT membership, then trans ideology makes its way into the church, then it takes over the church and you end up with this disturbing result:
Activists claim they just want to worship like other Christians do, but that's not the trend we see in the western world. The argument being promoted is that Christianity must ""adapt to the times"" and that Biblical beliefs must ""evolve."" It's the typical futurist method of removing opposing systems that act as obstacles to their control. The notion is that everything new is better and everything old should be abandoned. It's the Marxist view of religion, which does not compromise.
Even for those that are not religiously inclined the end game should be obvious - The inevitable erasure of Christianity. The push for Trans affirmation by the Vatican is likely an attempt to destroy conservative ideological opposition from within while installing a new kind of religion in Christianity's place.",2024-10-27

Zerohedge,"Judge Denies Request To Grant Nearly 1,900 South Carolina Voter Registrations To 17-Year-Olds","Authored by Tom Ozimek via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),
A judge has denied a request by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of South Carolina to compel South Carolina’s Department of Motor Vehicles (SCDMV) and State Election Commission to reopen voter registration in the state and add thousands of eligible 17-year-olds to the voter rolls ahead of the upcoming presidential election.
The ruling, issued on Oct. 25 by Judge Daniel Coble of the Richland County Court of Common Pleas, was handed down in response to a lawsuit brought by the advocacy group, which sought emergency relief to correct what it argued was a systemic error by the SCDMV that prevented eligible 17-year-olds from being registered to vote.
South Carolina law allows 17-year-olds who will turn 18 by Election Day to be added to voter rolls, but an apparent glitch in the SCDMV’s computers did not transmit the registration forms of around 17,000 would-be voters to the State Election Commission (SEC) even though the youths checked a box to register when they applied for a state ID or driver’s licenses.
“Although thousands of these individuals were eligible to register to vote, were entitled to easily register through their SCDMV transaction, timely provided state officials with the information necessary to register, and indicated a desire to do so, SEC is unwilling to add them to the voter rolls or otherwise protect their fundamental right to cast a ballot in the 2024 general election,” the ACLU’s complaint reads.
While around 6,000 of the affected 17-year-olds managed to register to vote some other way, that still left nearly 11,000—and possibly many more—affected by the issue, the ACLU said in a statement.
“Of those that are not currently registered, it is not yet known how many selected ‘Yes’ on the form indicating that they would like to register to vote,” the group stated. “Because this information is not coded electronically in the SCDMV database, a hand count will be required.”
To date, the DMV has positively identified 1,896 who asked to be registered when applying for a driver’s license but weren’t added to the rolls, according to the South Carolina Daily Gazette. In court, attorneys for the defendants argued that reopening voter registration after early voting has already begun and adding the 1,896 affected voters to the rolls would disrupt the voting system.
While the judge expressed sympathy for the impacted voters, he sided with the defendants, ruling that the ACLU’s emergency request to reopen voter registration after the deadline was too drastic and disruptive.
“After careful consideration of the parties’ written motions and oral arguments, this Court finds that the relief sought by Plaintiff is too drastic and would likely violate the separation of powers doctrine,” the judge wrote in the order. “As SEC Defendant stated, there is no effectual relief that this Court could grant and even if it attempted to, the relief sought would create disorder in the voting system.”
However, Coble did not dismiss the case, meaning that the broader legal challenge to the SCDMV’s failure to register eligible 17-year-olds will continue to proceed through the courts.
The ACLU said in a statement following the ruling that the judge’s decision doesn’t end the case, signaling the group’s intent to continue the legal battle.
“Our government failed these young voters, and now the same government is making excuses rather than making things right. When ‘It’s too hard to fix’ becomes an acceptable reason to disenfranchise voters, we know that there’s work to do,” ACLU of South Carolina legal director Allen Chaney said in a statement on X.
Data released on Oct. 25 by the SEC shows that around 511,000 ballots have been cast in the first four days of early voting in South Carolina.",2024-10-28
Zerohedge,"Fraud Found Among 2,500 Voter Registration Forms Submitted En Masse In PA County","Police in the 2024 battleground state of Pennsylvania are investigating some 2,500 voter registration forms that were submitted in two massive batches -- and investigators say that 60% of the forms they've checked so far are fraudulent. All of the ballots were submitted in Lancaster County, but two other counties are scrutinizing similarly suspect batches. While officials say it's the work of a ""large-scale canvassing operation,"" they're not yet saying who's behind it.
The roughly 2,500 applications landed at or near Pennsylvania's Oct 21 registration deadline; some observers are speculating that the timing may have been tactical, with the intent of exploiting time-pressure administrators would be under ahead of the Nov. 5 Election Day. However, as they examined the massive heap of forms, application processors were immediately alarmed by what they saw:
- Multiple applications with the same handwriting and signatures
- Many forms filled out on the same day
- Applications for previously-registered voters whose signatures on the forms did not match the ones on file
That prompted a police investigation, and Lancaster County detectives soon confirmed many of the applications were fraudulent. Indications of fraud included:
- Inaccurate addresses
- False personal identification information
- False names
- Names that didn't match the Social Security Number on the form
In many cases, forms had accurate data, but the supposed applicants told detectives they had neither requested nor completed the forms, and confirmed that the signatures were not theirs. In all, 60% of the applications that have been vetted so far were found to be fraudulent.
""It's believed that the fraudulent voter registrations are connected to a large-scale canvassing operation for voter registrations that date back to June,"" said Lancaster County District Attorney Heather Adams in a Friday press conference. ""The majority of applications received are dated August 15 and after. Those canvassing for voter registrations were employed and paid to obtain voter registration applications.""
Adams declined to provide details about the canvassing organization, or the names of individual suspects. The fraudulent forms included registrations for both Democrats and Republicans. However, ""for the general election, [the party affiliation of a bogus registration] really wouldn't matter,"" noted Adams. She did note that the canvassing operation primarily took place at shopping centers, parking lots, parks, grocery stores, sidewalks and businesses. The fraudulent activity took a variety of forms, from completely bogus applications to ones where a real voter had started registering but then decided not to move forward, only to have an application submitted for them anyway.
""Forgery of an application, which we have seen evidence of, would be a felony of the third degree punishable by up to seven years in prison and a $15,000 fine,"" said Adams, adding that one provision of the legal code would also enforce a 10-year loss of voting privileges.
Adams said they had all available detectives assigned to the case, who are working under pressure of the approaching Election Day. ""[The fraud] appears to be an organized effort at this point,"" she said, and noted that two other Pennsylvania counties are investigating similarly suspicious batches of registration applications. She declined to name them, but the Berks County DA told the Philadelphia Inquirer ""We believe we have some and will be looking into them."" Pennsylvanians can check their own voter registration status at this link.
""The description of paid canvassers approaching voters on the streets of Lancaster City and mentioned boroughs does not meet the description of GOP and affiliated campaign volunteers,” Lancaster County GOP chair Kirk Radanovic told Lancaster Online. In a more narrowly-worded distancing from the alleged crimes, vice-chair of the Lancaster County Democrats said, ""We have no reason to believe it was affiliated with any Democratic candidate’s campaign in the county.”
Most of the 2,500 applications were submitted in the name of people who live in the City of Lancaster, the Keystone State's 10th-most populous city. Per the 2020 census, about 40% of its 58,000 residents are Latino, 39% white, and 13% black.
Florida State University election law expert Michael Morley told the Inquirer that canvassing operations that center on per-application payments and quotas incentivize bogus registrations. However, he says it's rare for those registrations to culminate in fraudulent votes. ""Even if it gets through, that’s sort of the end of the line. It’s not part of a bigger picture plot to steal the election,” he said.
With its 19 electoral votes, Pennsylvania is the biggest prize among the seven swing states that also include Georgia (16), North Carolina (16), Michigan (15), Arizona (11), Wisconsin (10) and Nevada (6). In 2020, Joe Biden officially won the state by only 80,555 votes out of more than 6.8 million counted statewide. Two million of Biden's 2020 Pennsylvania votes came via mail, compared to just under 600,000 for Trump.
The revelation from Lancaster County comes in the same week that at least a dozen Mesa County, Colorado ballots were found to have been stolen and mailed in -- and three of them are going to be counted anyway. However, despite that and the far bigger story now unfolding in the most valuable swing state, please repeat the establishment mantra: Organized voter fraud is just a right-wing conspiracy theory.",2024-10-26

Trump’s odds of winning the election surpassed 66.3% on the leading decentralized predictions market on Oct. 28, according to Polymarket data.

Trump’s odds increased after a Polymarket whale, or large holder, invested another $2 million worth of USD Coin USDC$1.00 tokens into pro-Trump bets.
The mysterious whale has spent $7.22 million on “Yes” shares, according to onchain intelligence firm Lookonchain, which wrote in an Oct. 28 X post:
“Since Oct 11, the whale has spent 7.22 million $USDC to buy 11.28 million ‘Yes' shares on Donald Trump winning the US election, with an unrealized profit of $256,000.”
With only seven days until the 2024 US presidential election, decentralized prediction markets may offer more accurate predictions than traditional polling systems, according to billionaire Elon Musk.
The Polymarket odds flipped in Trump’s favor on Oct. 4, marking a sharp reversal from September. By Oct. 12, Trump was leading by over 10 points, Cointelegraph reported.
Mysterious Polymarket whale seems unrelated to “Fredi9999”
The mysterious Polymarket whale, known as “zxgngl,” holds over 11.2 million “Yes” votes worth over $7.5 million, according to Polymarket data.

The increasing positions come after the top Trump bettor on Polymarket, “Fredi9999,” bolstered Trump’s odds above 60.2% by buying over $20 million worth of “Yes” shares up to Oct. 18.
Moreover, Fredi’s transaction patterns suggest that it controls four of the six largest Trump-voting accounts on Polymarket, all funded with Kraken deposits.

While 99% of zxgngl’s bets were also placed on Trump, their account was funded by Binance, not the Kraken exchange. Their transaction patterns are also different, with the last two Binance deposits being worth $338,000 and $1.68 million, respectively.

As for Fredi, the account is likely controlled by a person with deep confidence in a Trump victory, according to pseudonymous political bettor Domer, who told Cointelegraph:
“My guess is it is a true believer who is very rich and trying to make a big bet. He is getting more confident as the price goes higher and is in a confirmation bias loop where new information keeps increasing his confidence.”

Zerohedge,Is Kamala The Bigger Threat To The Constitutional Order?,"Vote. Don't vote. I don't care. Just stop telling me that Vice President Kamala Harris is going to save democracy.
Do I wish Republicans had nominated a more coherent, principled, competent candidate for the presidency? Of course. But if anyone is under the impression Democrats tapped such a person, I have news. Spend some time trying to decipher Harris' swirling, platitude-ridden, incoherent rhetoric and you will only be further convinced that we live in an idiocracy.
Sure, there are many reasons why a movement conservative might feel uncomfortable voting for former President Donald Trump. I get it. I'm not a fan. But there are plenty of completely rational reasons to vote for him, as well. First and foremost, the existence of the contemporary Democratic Party.
Liz Cheney, and other Never Trumpers, tell me that the former president poses a uniquely dangerous threat to the Constitution, and thus, I must set aside any policy disagreements with Democrats and put country over politics.
No doubt, this kind of self-glorification feels great, but it doesn't really comport with reality.
For one thing, most of the Left's scariest warnings about Trump are fiction. I don't believe The Atlantic when it tells me that Trump is a would-be Hitler. I'm sorry, I don't believe he's going to throw all his political enemies in concentration camps. Save the story for the next Mueller investigation.
Considering recent history, in fact, it's clear to me that the Left is far more adept and willing to weaponize the state to punish their enemies. And I'm not just talking about the unprecedented lawfare launched at Trump. I'm talking about debarring lawyers. I'm talking about raiding the homes of pro-life activists. I'm talking about the spying on Catholic churches and the Justice Department's chilling speech by smearing parents who stood up to authoritarian school boards as terrorists.
Moreover, even if Trump acted on his worst instincts, the damage would likely be confined to his own presidency. Trump is about Trump. Harris and Democrats, though, have openly embraced a string of consequential, long-term attacks on the constitutional order. Ones that we can never come back from.
Sorry, I don't accept that a woman who once complained to CNN's Jake Tapper that ""millions and millions of people"" were speaking ""without any level of oversight or regulation, and that has to stop"" is going to be my champion of the Constitution.
Harris' running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz recently argued that there is ""no guarantee"" for free speech when it came to ""misinformation"" or ""hate speech,"" ""especially around our democracy."" If this were a properly functioning republic, Walz would be thrown to the curb.
No honest person could possibly believe Democrats are better for free expression.
Let's not forget either that Harris once promised to bypass Congress and sign an executive order seizing rifles from millions of law-abiding Americans. Though Democrats like to pretend otherwise, the Second Amendment is still part of the Constitution.
Indeed, Harris is in no position to lecture anyone about any governing norms.
She frequently praises Biden for ignoring courts and ""forgiving"" student loans by forcing taxpayers to foot the bill. She supports trashing the legislative filibuster, empowering slim majorities to destroy any semblance of federalism. Harris has backed bills that would have overturned thousands of state laws, allowing national Democrats to strip state election security measures, make abortion legal until crowning, compel local religious hospitals to perform gender transition surgeries, shut down religious foster care organizations, and many other outrages.
None of this is to even speak of her efforts to destroy the Supreme Court. Harris, who gleefully took part in the vile smearing of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, supports packing the court -- the most serious attack on the judicial branch since President Franklin Roosevelt's effort in the 1930s. Senate Democrats say it is ""virtually certain"" they will pass a ""Supreme Court reform"" bill that, among other assaults on the judicial branch, will empower legislators to strip individual justices of their power.
This is all just blatantly authoritarian stuff.
Right now -- in part, because of Trump -- the court is the only institution in the United States that properly functions. There is no telling what kind of arsonist Harris and Democrats would install.
At the very least, I know Trump has a track record of not only nominating decent jurists but sticking with them under massive pressure.
It is odd, indeed, that Democrats, who support price controls, state mandates and a slew of other economic intrusions that force corporations to bend to their will, are constantly warning us about the specter of ""fascism.""
We have no clue if the Trump presidency plays out. Trumpism is whatever Trump says it is whenever he feels like it. It might well be a disaster. But Harris offers me nothing.",2024-10-25
Zerohedge,"Americans Are More Dependent Than Ever On Government Handouts, New Report States","Payments from the government have become the fastest-growing source of income for Americans, according to a new study.
A report by the Economic Innovation Group (EIG), a public policy research organization, titled “The Great Transfer-mation,” states that Americans have become substantially more dependent on government support, with the share of national income coming from transfer payments more than doubling over the past 50 years.
Transfer payment programs include Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, unemployment and disability, food stamps, and veterans’ benefits.
Transfer payments increased from 8 percent of U.S. total income in 1970 to 18 percent today, the report states, crowding out private income from wages and investments.
“There is a large range of experiences driving transfer reliance across communities,” Benjamin Glasner, EIG economist and one of the report’s authors, told The Epoch Times. “But it’s unavoidable to look at the fact that transfer reliance has grown rapidly across the country, and it’s something we need to deal with.”
According to Federal Reserve data, government transfer payments increased from about $70 billion in 1970 to more than $6 trillion in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, before falling back to the current level of $4.3 trillion. According to the EIG report, if government transfer payments were spread evenly among all Americans, they would have amounted to an annual payment of $11,500 per person in 2022.
One factor driving much of the shift from private income to government dependence is that the U.S. population is, on average, getting older. According to demographic data from USAfacts, the percentage of Americans 65 years and older increased from 13.1 percent of the population in 2010 to 17.3 percent in 2022. During the same period, the percentage of Americans under the age of 20 fell from 26.9 percent to 24.4 percent.
“The primary driver that we found in our report is demographic related, specifically the fact that the country has aged so rapidly,” Glasner said. “And the transfer programs that target that aging population also have grown significantly more expensive over time.”
Of all government assistance payments in 2022, 56 percent went to the elderly, mostly for Medicare, the EIG report stated. Health care costs were a major factor, both because more Americans qualified for Medicare and Medicaid, and because the cost of medical treatment rose significantly.
According to data compiled by Peterson-KFF, a health care policy analytics organization, total health spending in the United States was $74.1 billion in 1970. By 2022 total health spending was $4.5 trillion, indicating an exponential increase in medical costs per capita.
Public Finances Under Strain
The growth in transfer payments have taken their toll on state and federal budgets.
The 2024 Pension Solvency and Performance Report, authored by Ryan Frost and Mariana Trujillo for Reason Foundation’s Pension Integrity Project, stated that public pensions are increasingly falling behind on their ability to pay.
As of 2023, the authors state, total unfunded public pension liabilities across the United States hit $1.59 trillion, and the median funded ratio was 76 percent. The U.S. federal deficit is currently $1.8 trillion, and interest payments on U.S. government debt increased from $31 billion in 1970 to more than $1 trillion today.
In addition, some analysts say that this growing dependence on government comes at the cost of personal autonomy and responsibility.
“The surge in transfer payments during the past 50 years is just one manifestation of the trend to politicize and tangle up all aspects of Americans’ lives with the government,” Steve Hanke, professor of Applied Economics at Johns Hopkins University and a member of the board of directors of the Federal Fiscal Sustainability Foundation, told The Epoch Times. “It results because of politicians’ inevitable attraction to buy votes by promising ‘free lunches,’ and the fact that politicians don’t face statutory or constitutional spending constraints.”
To illustrate the extent of the shift to government dependence, EIG created maps showing the percentage of income that came from transfer payments, broken down by county, over time.
In 1970, only about 1 percent of all U.S. counties reported that government transfers made up more than 25 percent of total income in their county; by 2022, more than half of U.S. counties reported dependence at that level.

Aging, Shrinking Populations
While the reasons for this dependence varied from region to region, aging populations, and outward migration were common themes, particularly in rural counties. Often, young people leave small towns for better jobs in cities, and this both increases the percentage of retired people and decreases the number of people earning private wages in rural areas.
In addition, as societies industrialize, people migrate from farms to cities, and women enter the labor force in larger numbers, and fertility rates fall. While this trend has been observed over the past several decades throughout the world, the United States has been experiencing this trend for two centuries.
In 1825, the average woman in America gave birth to more than six children, according to Statista, a data collection firm. As the United States industrialized and urbanized, the birth rate declined, hitting a low of two children per woman in 1940 before rebounding to 3.58 children in 1960, during the “baby boom” generation.
The minimum fertility rate to sustain a population is 2.1 children per woman. The United States dipped below this rate in 1973 and has remained below replacement level ever since, according to data from Macrotrends. While U.S. fertility rates increased marginally through 2008, they have since fallen back to the current rate of about 1.8 children per woman.
While countries such as Japan have seen their populations fall due to low fertility, the United States has experienced continuous population growth. But this is largely due to immigration rather than native-born Americans having children.
The Congressional Budget Office projects that, without immigration, America’s population will begin to shrink, starting in 2040.
Economic Security Versus Prosperity
The increasing dependence on the government for income raises the issue of how the United States can balance economic security for its dependents against overall economic growth and prosperity.
“The increased politicization of life will put a damper on economic prosperity,” Hanke said. “For every dollar taken out of one taxpayer’s pocket and put into another’s, there is a cost, an excess burden.
“This burden is the result of distortions thrown into the economy by imposing a tax, and the administrative costs of levying the tax and of running the government’s transfer payments system,” he said.
Arthur Laffer, a noted economist who specializes in tax policy, wrote in his 2023 book, “Taxes Have Consequences,” that raising taxes much beyond current levels will choke off economic growth, thus reducing the tax base.
“The more you redistribute, the greater will be the drop in total income,” Laffer said in a 2023 interview with The Epoch Times.
Consequently, governments are increasingly caught between a rock and a hard place regarding how to pay for social programs.
Interest payments on America’s federal debt are currently the third largest budget item, after Social Security and non-defense discretionary spending, and exceeding Medicare and military spending, an August 2024 report by the Peter G. Peterson Foundation states based on Congressional Budget Office projections published in June.
Treasury data for the fiscal year 2024, running Oct. 1, 2023, to Sept. 30, show that interest expense was $896 billion.
According to projections from the Congressional Budget Office, interest payments on the federal debt will double as a percentage of GDP by 2054 and will become the largest single item in the federal budget by 2051.
Potential Solutions
According to Glasner, there are three options for governments to continue providing transfer payments. The first is cutting benefits, but that appears to be politically untenable, and neither Democrats nor Republicans have expressed any intention to do so.
The second is raising taxes, he said, “but there’s some risk to that, because overdoing increases in taxation can potentially cut off sources of economic growth, undercutting our actual capacity to deal with this.”
The third and most viable option, Glasner argues, is to increase economic growth and private income. Among the ways to do this, he says, are “investments in research and innovation, better-designed immigration policy, and tax and regulatory policies that foster economic dynamism and increased participation in the workforce.”
Although America’s financial situation may appear dire, a September report from the Manhattan Institute titled “America’s Surprisingly Effective Welfare State,” argues that the United States is in better shape than many other Western nations.
While Europe’s social programs provide support payments regardless of need, America’s transfer systems are more selective and thus less costly while delivering more money to the poorest.
“Europe’s welfare states are dominated by costly publicly funded ‘social insurance’ programs, which attempt to fully support middle-class lifestyles through periods of unemployment, ill health, disability, or retirement,” the report states. “By contrast, American public entitlement programs are more focused on providing a safety net against poverty, and they more strictly limit eligibility for cash and health care benefits to those who are unable to work.”",2024-10-27
Zerohedge,2 Lawmakers Attempt The Impossible: Saving Social Security,"Authored by Mark Tapscott via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),
More members of Congress, 329, co-sponsored the Social Security Fairness Act (SSFA) than nearly any other legislative proposal in 2024, but that may not be evidence of lawmakers’ eagerness to fix what ails the retirement pension program—the bill doesn’t address the fundamental insolvency issue.
The SSFA would end two provisions of current law that reduce benefits for millions of public employees at all levels of government with separate pension systems. Eliminating the provisions means more Social Security benefits for such workers.
In other words, the SSFA would increase the total amount of Social Security benefits paid out without providing new revenues to fund them. Even so, the bipartisan proposal is likely to pass Congress and President Joe Biden—who promised in his 2020 campaign to eliminate the provision—is expected to sign it into law when lawmakers reconvene after the election.
For decades, Social Security has been the untouchable “third rail” of American politics that virtually no Democrat or Republican dares to propose changing for fear of angering legions of elderly and disabled voters who depend on the program.
Approximately 70 million Americans are beneficiaries, making Social Security the largest federal entitlement program.
The Social Security Trustees’ latest report projects that the system will become insolvent in 2035 unless Congress approves major reforms soon.
Meanwhile, the ratio of workers paying into the system to beneficiaries is heading downward. The ratio in 1950 was 16 workers to one beneficiary; today that ratio is 2.8 workers per beneficiary. Plus, retirees are living longer today, drawing more benefits over time.
Politicians increase benefits, but are loathe to increase Social Security taxes or slash benefits.
The seemingly impossible challenge for Congress and the White House is how to reform Social Security if increased taxes and reduced benefits are untouchable. The last president to propose a major reform was George W. Bush, who shortly after being re-elected in 2004, suggested privatizing the system.
Under that proposal, Americans would have been allowed to divert some of their Social Security taxes into government-approved private investment funds. Bush hastily dropped the plan after opposition in both parties and in the mainstream media exploded.
More recently, two lawmakers have ventured beyond the raise-taxes-reduce-benefits dilemma to explore other ways of saving Social Security before it becomes insolvent.
Raising the Tax Cap
Rep. John Larson (D-Conn.) has introduced his Social Security 2100 Act repeatedly in recent years, and it has gained strong support (188 co-sponsors) among his Democratic colleagues. Larson is the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee’s Subcommittee on Social Security.
During a floor speech earlier this year, Larson said that “more than five million of our fellow Americans have worked and paid into the system and get below poverty level checks from their government.”
Larson noted, however, that it has been decades since Congress approved changes designed to shore up the Social Security system’s finances. He also rejected suggestions from House Republicans that a study commission be created to recommend reforms.
“It’s long overdue that we not study this—how about we do what we’re elected to do by the public and actually vote,” he said.
“I commend President Biden for saying, look, the way we’re going to pay for this is by lifting the cap ... on people making more than $400,000 a year.”
Larson’s bill would not hike the Social Security tax rate, but would apply Social Security taxes to all taxpayers making more than $400,000 annually. The present salary cap on Social Security taxes is set at $168,600.
“Millionaires have already stopped paying into the Social Security program. Bill Gates stopped paying back in January. That is wrong, it’s not right, but to lift that cap will allow us to not only extend the solvency of Social Security, but increase benefits across the board,” he said.
According to an analysis by the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, an individual making $500,000 annually only pays Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) levies on the first $168,600 of income, which equals $10,453 a year. Under the Larson proposal, the same individual would pay $31,000 in FICA levies, nearly three times as much.
Larson did not respond to requests for comment.
The Big Idea
Venturing even further into reform is Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana doctor and ranking Republican on the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.
Cassidy calls his proposal the “Big Idea” and it is based on the creation by Congress of a new $1.5 trillion investment fund that is totally separate from the Social Security Trust Fund—which receives FICA revenues that pay for benefits.
Asked by The Epoch Times how the new fund would be financed, Cassidy said “that is open to negotiation. You could sell government assets to fund it over time, you could borrow it and put it in there.
“Folks say ‘But wait a minute, isn’t that going to increase your debt?’ It turns out you’re not spending it, you’re putting it into escrow. And according to the Congressional Budget Office, that’s going to be considered a wash.”
The Big Idea escrow fund would be managed by an independent company that would bid for the job, assume a fiduciary responsibility for the results and invest the fund in a conservative portfolio of private sector entities to function like Sovereign Wealth funds.
“[Wall Street executive John] Paulson and [former President Donald] Trump have talked about creating a Sovereign Wealth fund. Advisers to Joe Biden have talked about creating a Sovereign Wealth fund. Now what we’re talking about with our Big Idea is somewhat of a Sovereign Wealth fund,” Cassidy said. Paulson is often mentioned as a potential Secretary of the Treasury if Trump is re-elected.
The same approach is already in use in the pension field, Cassidy said, with the federal government’s Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) for civil servants, the U.S. National Railroad Retirement Trust, Wisconsin’s public employee retirement system, and the Canadian government pension system.
Cassidy said the fund is projected to generate sufficient profits to cover 75 percent of Social Security’s revenue shortfall and that he is open to alternative approaches to covering the remaining 25 percent.
“Combined with some relatively minor tweaks to the program, at the end of 75 years, all the accumulated debt would be paid off, and the Social Security program would be able to cover its obligations in perpetuity,” he said in an earlier statement.
Asked how misuse would be avoided, Cassidy said “we’ve got a couple of mechanisms, we had the Heritage Foundation help us draft the way by which to prevent political meddling.” He said former Comptroller General David Walker has also suggested several solutions.
Cassidy said he supports a ban on investing in firms based in China, an issue that ensnared TSP managers in 2019 when Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) highlighted the risks of federal worker contributions investing in Chinese firms.

Zerohedge,"The ""Righteously Pissed Off"" Are Ready To Go To Work To Fix Whatever They Can","Speaking of Abortion...
“Good rule of thumb: those who frequently use the word “disinformation” are the ones most likely to be pushing it”
- Elon Musk
What were they thinking after they shoved “Joe Biden” into the abyss, like an old refrigerator over the edge of the landfill, and afterward settled — instantly it appears, with no process at all — on Kamala Harris to lead the party to victory in the fall election?
I will tell you: they were not thinking at all.
The collective mind of the Democrat elite was a vast vacuum devoid of thought, mass, or light, like a corner of deepest space, lacking even a particle of cosmic debris to evoke the existence of existence.
Such mindlessness was the consummate expression of a party that for eight years worked every angle of political mental illness toward the loss of its mind, driven by whatever dark energy seeks escape from truth, life, and God — whatever is opposite of creation and being. What you are witnessing is a colossal act of being un-born. The party put out a call to the universe and the universe ordered. . . an abortion of the Democratic Party! You are reminded again: be careful of what you wish for.
And so do things stand one week before the election. You have not seen such a vivid demonstration of slowly-and-then-all-at-once since the implosion of Lehman Brothers as the collapse of the Democratic Party this fateful October. Poor Kamala is just collateral damage at this point. She goes out before some manufactured audience and seven-minutes onstage delivering a door-dash order of precooked blather is all she can stand before being overwhelmed by the emptiness and futility of her task. . . and then she flees back to the waiting limousine (and the chardonnay bottle).
Meanwhile, her allies — that is, the Democratic Party’s allies — play their own roles in this political abortion. The LA Times and the WashPo declined their usual proforma endorsements, two kisses of death. Those actions last week provoked nervous breakdowns in both newsrooms, cries of anguish, resignations, professional suicides. The news media find themselves in a peculiar position, having gone along for years with the gathering mental illness of the Democratic Party, like incompetent parents in a large dysfunctional family, offering unconditional support for their kids’ intolerable and unacceptable behavior.
They are flying to pieces now on the CNN chat panels. James Carville, the party’s shriveled Gollum, has gone to IV infusions of Jim Beam, seems like. Jake Tapper gets Sunday schooled by JD Vance and turns into a mewling cat-lady right before your eyes. Anderson Cooper goes all waxy and mute. Joy Reid surrenders to echolalia as her MSNBC fans are subjected to the guest list of P. Diddy’s “freak-offs,” ranting about Hitler. Lawrence O’Donnell is looking more and more like Vincent Price in Return of the Fly. Reality-optional hardly suffices to describe cable news these days.
You’ve got to ask: can they just let it be? Can they just let go of their insane Jacobin rebellion now and let it fade into history? Then, kick back, recuperate, get their minds right, put their house and family in order, and move on as a legit political faction in a functioning republic? Or, do they burn the asylum down?
The signals are troubling. They are chattering about Mr. Trump “using the military” against them in the months to come — as if the Abrams tanks were going to roll up to DNC headquarters and blast away. By now, you know that such thoughts expressed by Democratic pols and news pals are always projections of their own wishes. The New York Times published just such a classic paranoid projection exercise last week “. . . telling Americans that if he [Trump] wins, he plans to bend, if not break, our democracy.”
Surely it is too late, with early voting well underway, to stop any ballot harvesting and other election shenanigans as engineered by master fraudster Marc Elias. In fact, frauds are already being discovered (e.g., Lancaster County, PA.) Not a good look. It is exactly what a conspiracy (to commit election fraud) means in law, and the actual people who cooked the ballots and transported them are going to rat-out those who instructed them to do it. Wait for that, and wait for it to pop up elsewhere around the country. This time, watchers are watching, much more carefully.
Of course, you know there will be long delays, perhaps a week or more, before definitive election results will get posted. The country’s in a bad way, really frightened of what these desperate Democrats with their mitts still on the levers of power might do. Judge Merchan is scheduled to deliver his bit of mischief November 26 in the New York “Stormy Daniels hush money” case. You can bet that the Supreme Court will squash him like a sow-bug five minutes later and vacate his stupid case.
Reasonable observers (Rickards, Armstrong) are whispering about martial law and blood in the streets following the election. Yet Mr. Trump’s MAGA legions, appear supernaturally confident now, fortified with a sense of mission. They’re righteously pissed-off about all the hoaxes, the lawfare, the swarming illegal migrants, their squandered tax dollars, and much more. But they are ready to go to work, eager to put their shoulders to the wheel to fix whatever they can and, as they do, the death of the Democratic Party is one abortion they will not shed any tears over.

Zerohedge,"Ballot Drop-Boxes Torched In Portland, Vancouver - Could Affect Tightest US House Race","As pre-election passions intensify down the stretch to Election Day, two ballot drop-boxes in the adjacent cities of Portland, Oregon and Vancouver, Washington were torched with incendiary devices on Monday morning, incinerating hundreds of ballots and potentially affecting the outcome of one of the tightest US House races in the country. ""I strongly denounce any acts of terror that aim to disrupt lawful and fair elections in Washington state,"" said Washington Secretary of State Steve Hobbs in a statement.
The box in Portland fared better by far: Thanks to the successful activation of its internal fire-suppression system, only three ballots were damaged. However, in Vancouver, hundreds of ballots were fully destroyed as that box's anti-arson technology failed. Both boxes had systems designed to release a flame-suppressing powder when a certain temperature in the box is detected. The Vancouver box had last been emptied at 8:00 am on Sunday.

Hundreds of ballots destroyed.
I was told that dropping votes inside an unattended box on the street was a good idea.
No way to tell what votes were burned or who they even belonged to. Absolute insanity. pic.twitter.com/QIa7aIQYlu
The Portland box was attacked at 3:30 am and the Vancouver box at 4:00 am. Portland police released photos of a Volvo S-60 they think was involved in both incidents. They place the model year between 2001 and 2004. The sedan didn't have a front license plate, and cops weren't able to read the rear tag. Investigators suspect Monday's twin attacks are related to an earlier incident on Oct. 8 in Vancouver, in which a box was found aflame with some type of device lying next to it. Apparently, no ballots were harmed that time.
Vancouver sits inside Washington's 3rd Congressional District, home to what's widely viewed as the country's tightest House race. In 2022, Democratic Marie Gluesenkamp Perez beat Republican former Green Beret and CIA field agent Joe Kent by just 2,629 votes out of nearly 320,000 votes cast. This year's race is a rematch, and Gluesenkamp Perez is considered the House Democrat at greatest risk of being ousted. In an addition signal of Gluesenkamp Perez's peril, Trump won the district in both 2016 and 2020.
In turn, the Washington-3 race could decide control of the House. 538's simulator gives the GOP a 52% chance of keeping the reins. On the other hand, The Economist's model favors the Democrats by a 53% to 47% probability margin.
Considering Democrats account for 54% of mail-in ballots requested in Washington -- versus Republicans requesting 36% of total requests -- any attack on a drop-box would generally seem likely to benefit Republicans, particularly when those boxes are in urban areas that skew even more Democratic.
“We don’t know the motives behind these acts -- sounds like a series of three at this point -- but we do know that acts like this are targeted and intentional,” Portland Police Bureau Assistant Chief Amanda McMillan told reporters Monday. (Brilliant thinking, Sherlock!) “We are concerned about that intentional act trying to affect the election process.""
Clark County Washington auditor Greg Kimsey encouraged people who'd dropped ballots in the box after 11 am Saturday to call his office and request a new ballot. He said his department will increase ballot-pickup frequency, switch to evening collection, and hire monitors to provide 24-hour supervision of the boxes. He foolishly disclosed that the monitors will be ordered not to confront arsonists, and to instead merely call 911 if they see something suspicious -- maybe like flames and smoke pouring out of the box?
Last week, Phoenix, Arizona police arrested a suspect who allegedly set fire to a ballot drop-box situated at a post office in that city. About 20 ballots were believed to have been damaged in the incident that took place at 1:20 am.

Zerohedge,After The Deluge,"At 7:30 a.m. on Friday, Sept. 27, Chris Trusz was standing on one of the bridges spanning the Broad River in Chimney Rock. He wanted to get a photo. It had been raining steadily for 36 hours and the river was running 10 inches above normal. Trusz, who’d moved to the western North Carolina mountain town 18 months earlier, wasn’t worried; residents had been warned there might be a bit of flooding. He got his picture and walked up the hill to his home.
“Normally I have a sliver of a view of the river,” he said. “Now I’m looking and can see the river clearly.” By the time he got back to Main Street, the Broad was three times as wide and running 30 inches high. Within the hour, buildings had slid off their foundations, some taken down by the furious mud-colored current and disappearing completely.
“We were watching homes wash by, all kinds of debris,” said Trusz. Worse, he recalled, were the cars being carried away, some with their headlights still on.
“I can’t unsee that,” said Trusz, three weeks after Hurricane Helene took down several western North Carolina towns, paralyzed the entire region, and killed at least 123, a number that will almost certainly rise and may prove unknowable.
It is one of several terrible unknowns the residents of western North Carolina now face. That they were unprepared for Helene is not on them – neither was the government nor anyone else. The “once in a thousand years” storm was not supposed to happen here, 500 miles from the Gulf of Mexico and 2,100 feet above sea level. There had been no local evacuation order even as the storm barreled their way. It would dump 30 inches of rain on western North Carolina and create up to 140-mile-per-hour winds. It would bring down untold thousands of trees. It would knock out the electrical grid, cell phone service, and the water supply all at once. In a matter of hours, it would obliterate the everyday security people felt, leaving survivors blinking into a new reality, wondering if they could or should rebuild lives in a place whose fragility had just been betrayed.
“If you live here or own a business, where do you go when it’s completely wiped out? I mean, how do you start over from that?” asked Trusz, a property manager for Airbnb who’d just found out the company was forbidding area rentals until June 2025 at least.
Further betrayal would come, during America’s overheated election season, from politicians, partisans, and conspiracists attempting to use the destruction and death caused by Helene to score political points. While mainstream news outlets suggested the area was being commandeered by armed right-wing militias, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene was tweeting, “Yes they can control the weather” (no elaboration as to who “they” were).
Echoing a common complaint, Elon Musk claimed that “FEMA is not merely failing to adequately help people in trouble, but is actively blocking citizens who try to help!” Before long, Musk would instead be thanking Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg for “expediting approval for support flights.” Below the radar were the innumerable others stoking discord, including the person who tweeted at me, “Water Back on in Asheville NC. Feels like BLEACH on my skin. Very hot. Burning my face….” This just after he retweeted several racist memes and the claim that the death toll in Asheville was over 8,000.
Because of its unexpected and painful destruction, western North Carolina has become another symbol of America’s cultural divide. One side is the politicization of everything, as human suffering was quickly transformed into a partisan cudgel swung by party operatives and media outlets who fed the public versions of events that advanced their favored narratives. On the other side was the heroic story of people and government working together as best they could in cataclysmic circumstances to aid and comfort one another.
That second, hopeful story is what I found while reporting in and around Asheville last week. In a hotel with no running water, guests, some of whom had multiple trees fall on their homes, made do. While the scene could resemble a pajama party gone wrong, with people shuffling to the Porto-Sans in the driveway and choosing not to comment on the smell of body odor in the elevator, most folks showed concern for what their fellow travelers were going through. They left food and drink on a table in the lobby, next to a paper plate onto which someone had written “Take what you need.” They had neither the luxury nor desire to make political hay from their brethren’s misery. And when the taps turned back on, the water was clear if not yet potable, and when you washed with it, it did not burn.
Capitalizing on the misfortune of others is reprehensible, and no one I met in western North Carolina had the leisure time or the inclination to do so. Many are still without drinking water. Commercial districts have the same ghostly quality they had during COVID, and the shoulders of many roadways are piled with what was left of downed trees, the white oaks, maples, and pines that drew 14 million visitors a year, especially in late September and October, when the region blazes red and gold.
If many of those trees are now gone, what happens to the tourism economy and its $7.7 billion? What of Asheville’s major creative draw, the River Arts District, where floodwaters reached 27 feet and where what studio spaces remain have been taken down to the studs? Where do people find the courage, and the resources, to start again? And what if the thousand-year storm turns out to have a different schedule?
“I have childhood memories up there in Chimney Rock on Lake Lure, my granddaddy took me up there,” said Beverly Ramsey. “How do you rebuild something like that?”
Ramsey was driving to T-Birds, the bar she has frequented most days since Helene hit, not to drink but to see how she can help. The Weaverville lounge, usually known for its pool tables and karaoke, had been converted into a repository for donated goods, currently being organized by 25-year-old Alex Holt. Holt worked faster than someone running over hell’s half-acre, organizing the pet food and sleeping bags and propane tanks and maple syrup and other items brought on trailer trucks – so many that, 20 days post-Helene, they were backed up on Old Mars Mill Highway. How many were arriving a day?
“I couldn’t give you an exact number, they’re coming from Arkansas, Pennsylvania, Mississippi,” said Holt, who clearly had zero time to chat. “We’re just trying to meet everyone’s needs.”
“Can you imagine getting your period through all this?” Ramsey asked, sorting through a shopping bag a local woman had just dropped off, individual baggies holding six tampons and a two-pack of chocolate cupcakes.
Ramsey had been in Weaverville, a town of about 5,000 people 11 miles from Asheville, at her elderly mother’s home when Helene hit. As for how terrifying it initially was that morning: not very.
“I slept through it,” she said. Her main concern, when she woke up and saw the power was out, was being unable to make coffee. She decided to walk to a nearby Bojangles.
Forty-five minutes later she was back, the scene she encountered outside both impassable and making no sense. Dozens of big trees lay across the suburban street. Climbing over limbs and under fallen power lines, she came across three men using chainsaws to cut a hole in the fallen trees. Did they know what had happened? They did not; they had no cell service. Ramsey checked her own phone. No signal. Overhead, she heard the whomp whomp of a Chinook helicopter. What the hell was going on?
It was not until that night, when a neighbor used a power inverter to hook a car battery to his television, that Ramsey would begin to learn of the damage caused by Hurricane Helene. The flooding appeared to be the worst since The Great Flood of 1916 when the region experienced 26 inches of rain. Helene would dump 30 inches, or more than 40 trillion gallons, though Ramsey would not know as much for days; no one could, not with all communications cut, and roads crisscrossed with downed trees, and some washed away entirely. Other than by helicopter, there was no way in or out, and in some cases, people could not reach their closest neighbors, to say nothing of the outside world.
Help nevertheless got through. “That first day, people brought us gas, water,” said Ramsey, who let those who could not get home, or no longer had homes to get to, crash on her floor. Where some blamed the government for not immediately rushing to the rescue, Ramsey praised the self-reliance of her neighbors.
“Hillbillies and rednecks are a community. They want to talk about how Podunk we are and backwards. But no, we got this,” she said. “We need outside assistance, obviously. But we came together immediately.”
They mourn the deaths together, too. Ramsey mentions 11 members of the Craig family buried alive in a mudslide, and shows me the cover of a local paper, a photo of Alison Wisely and her two young sons, swept away, along with her fiance, when they left their car and tried to run for safety.
“And the farms, the water rushed out and took them down to the bedrock,” said Ramsey. “I mean, you don’t come back from that. That kind of property will never be farmed again. Not in our lifetime or even our children’s lifetime.”
While she has no idea when or whether her commercial cleaning business will reopen, Ramsey is optimistic about the future – and she isn’t.
“I don’t know that Asheville will be any different because it was already a tight community. Now as far as rebuilding places like Chimney Rock, I don’t know that that’s going to happen,” she said. “I have childhood memories up there. This is in the 70s, and very little has changed since then, as far as the aesthetics. So how do you rebuild something like that?”
Before the rebuilding, the clean-up. How much is complete and how much there is to go, three weeks post-Helene, is not possible to know. Asheville’s River Arts District looks as though it has undergone a bombing: two square miles of crumbled warehouses, brick piles, splintered lumber, and vehicles packed with mud from when the French Broad River, which runs parallel to the RAD, left the district underwater. The fate of the structures, many of them former mills and factories built around 1900, is unknown. What happens to a 120-year-old foundation that’s been sitting under 27 feet of water? Touring the district with Buttigieg on Oct. 17, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper struck a hopeful if vague note, saying the area would “come back” but probably “in a different way.”
Uncertainty continues as you drive east, on bridges until recently acting as catchments for debris and buildings packed with 12 feet of sludge, debris and more sludge pushed to roadsides and going on for miles. Everywhere, there are earthmovers, bucket trucks, linemen restringing electrical lines, water trucks bringing potable water – proof of life on a landscape that can otherwise appear post-apocalyptic, the town of Swannanoa leveled by the river of the same name, the town of Lake Lure sealed up tight.
Or nearly sealed. Lake House Restaurant was empty at 4 p.m. but for one bar patron when Rodolfo and Jose Hernandez came in for a bite. The brothers wore T-shirts that read, “S*E*R*T Swadley’s Emergency Relief Team,” the charitable arm of a chain of barbecue restaurants that makes it their business to get food to disaster zones.
“Brent Swadley, he bring a big, big kitchen and trailers from OKC. We get here last Thursday,” said Rodolfo, who is originally from Puebla, Mexico. He and Jose work as mechanics for the Swadley's vehicles, though here, they also serve food to work crews. “The people are very happy to get real food, barbecue, steak, ribs, turkey, ham,” says Rodolfo. “Brent Swadley, he has a good heart.”
An ecosystem of good hearts formed post-Helene: the S*E*R*T team; the hundreds of trucks pulling up to T-Birds; the AI developer who, the day after the hurricane, made it his business to figure out how to find, bottle, and deliver drinking water; the Asheville bakery giving free fresh-baked pastries to patrons who left 20s in the tip jar; the seemingly limitless number of churches (“You hear the state sometimes referred to the as the prong in the Bible Belt,” said Beverly Ramsey, who is also an ordained minister) being of service, including the man in a “Don’t Let the Bad Days Win” shirt unloading pallets of bottled water and baby diapers; private citizens volunteering to go door-to-door to do wellness checks; translators helping non-English speakers fill out aid applications; community centers providing relaxation rooms to exhausted road workers; and the man who keeps a backpack of emergency supplies at-the-ready at all times who brought his 9-year-old daughter with him as he carried life-sustaining goods to people unable to escape their mountain homes, people for whom the surprise of a little girl brought its own kind of sunshine.
“Kids are just as motivated to help people as adults are,” the man said, adding that he did not bring his daughter on the darker missions, the ones he would not talk about.
As the people of western North Carolina get their bearings, many who swooped in to help will move to the next disaster; S*E*R*T was also in Florida, providing meals to those hard hit by Hurricane Milton. What “recovery” looks like is as yet unknown, and already there are frustrations, if not always a logical place to put them. People cannot be mad at the storm, or not with any hope of restitution. A storm will never say, “My bad.” And so people are mad, for instance, at their insurance companies, when they find out their policies do not cover flood damage.
“He’s having an incredibly hard time,” said one retired insurance agent, whose Asheville colleague was so besieged that she and other agents “formed a triage team so all calls went to a human voice. People needed to lay out their heart to someone on the other end of the phone.”
If for naught: The agent estimated that no more than 2% of policy owners had elected to carry flood insurance, and why would they? Western North Carolina is above the floodplain; the area had not catastrophically flooded since the Great Flood of 1916, also known as “the flood by which all other floods are measured,” a flood Helene out-measured, leaving property owners understandably desperate for someone to tell them there’d be money coming to repair their lives.
The best insurance could do, said the agent, was “get them a declaration form that says they were not [covered] and they could bring that to FEMA,” the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which, along with other government agencies, was experiencing its share of post-Helene consumer hatred, some of it whipped up by keyboard warriors claiming FEMA was holding “special meetings” to steal people’s homes and confiscate donations (assertions debunked by a local congressman), and that a North Carolina National Guard helicopter had deliberately sabotaged a distribution center (based on rotor wash having accidentally blown over some donated goods).
“There’s been a lot of rumors on social media in particular, and they’re not helpful in terms of our ability to help people,” said Mike Cappannari, external affairs officer for FEMA. Looking tired but composed amid the hundreds of storm victims milling through a Disaster Recovery Center set up on the campus of A.C. Reynolds High School in Asheville, Cappannari said FEMA had about 2,000 responders in the region, that it was still tough to get to some remote areas, and that in some cases the agency was working in concert with the Department of Defense to create points of distribution as close to disaster sites as possible. As for the wilder stories online, such as FEMA workers being chased down by truckloads of armed vigilantes, “You just try and fight through that,” he said. “Fortunately, over the past handful of days, we’ve seen not as much of that and are just trying to encourage people to register for assistance with us and see how we can help.”
Hanging out with a volunteer friend on another part of the Reynolds campus, it was hard for Kim Pierce to know what help she needed.
“I lost everything,” said Pierce, a slip of a woman who’d closed on a new East Asheville condo on Monday, Sept. 23. It was to be the first home she would live in without any of her six grown children, a ground-floor unit for which she’d paid cash, a place she envisioned riding out her semi-retirement with other residents, most of them over 60.
What she did not envision: waking up on Friday, Sept. 27, to find her new yard underwater. She did not envision moving a few cherished items to the trunk of her car for safety, only to watch her car sink. She did not envision falling into and scrambling out of the rushing Swannanoa River, taking refuge with neighbors she had never met, eating soup with them in a daze, and, because she was perhaps spryer and certainly more stubborn, getting the names, addresses, and prescription medications of these strangers and pledging to get to the nearest fire station to implore the fire crew to rescue them. Which she was doing when her sons-in-law showed up at her condo, found it underwater, and figured she was dead.
“When I showed up [at my daughter’s], she came screaming out of the house, she’s sobbing and is like, ‘Mama, I was writing your eulogy!’” said Pierce. “It was so hard to see my child so traumatized.”
Hard, too, to envision the future when the accumulation and plans of 60-plus years disappear overnight. “There is beauty that comes out of ashes. And I am experiencing it. I see it in little glimpses,” she said. “And then I go back into this fog of, I’ve lost everything.”
“Where do you put 30 inches of rain?” asked Chris Trusz, overlooking the Broad River, running today at normal capacity.
The question answered itself as he walked Main Street, past splintered furniture; car-sized clumps of dried mud, wood, and wire; crushed delivery trucks, dented refrigeration and a winery left precariously cantilevered by the storm.
“They’re going to have to bring in so much fill to get back up to where you possibly could rebuild,” said Trusz. “Most people will, because it’s a strong little town, but I can’t blame people for wanting to leave.”
While work crews continued clearing the roads, and while Trusz had nothing but goodwill for private and public sector efforts (“The community, the 101st Airborne, FEMA, everybody’s been here helping out,” he said, waving at several truckloads of National Guard), life in Chimney Rock has yet to resume, residents and business owners still figuratively rising to the surface. While the river was cleaning itself, those sorting through what was left of Gale’s Chimney Rock Shop – the clothing, souvenirs, and photos that had been inside the 77-year-old store now outside in sodden piles on a cold October afternoon – moved with deliberate slowness, trying to assess what could be saved from what was gone forever.",2024-10-28
Zerohedge,"At Least A Dozen Colorado Ballots Stolen And Mailed In, Officials Say","Reinforcing concerns that many Americans have with voting that isn't done in-person, at least 12 Colorado mail-in ballots were stolen, filled out with forged signatures, and submitted -- and three of them are going to count anyway. Announced by state officials on Thursday, the thefts all affected voters in western Colorado's Mesa County, but the discovery leaves people wondering how many other forged ballots may have gone undetected elsewhere in the state and across the country.
""The Department of State learned that at least 12 ballots appear to have been intercepted before reaching voters,"" said Secretary of State Jena Griswold's office in a statement. ""Those ballots were voted and then returned to the Mesa County Clerk and Recorder via USPS mailboxes. This issue was flagged during Colorado’s secure signature verification process.""
Rather than sending them upon request, Colorado mails ballots to every registered voter in the state -- that's about 4 million ballots making their way through the postal system and before being left in mailboxes, a great many of which are unsecured. In addition to returning ballots via the postal service, Coloradans can also use drop boxes.
Several of the victimized voters were surprised to receive notifications that their ballots -- which they hadn't submitted -- required curing because their signatures didn't match digital signatures in the state database. Griswold said the handwriting on multiple ballots seemed to indicate the same individual completed each of them.
While sharing some details about the theft, Griswold, a Democrat, was tight-lipped about the detail most people want to know: which candidate(s) were meant to benefit from this crime? If her name sounds familiar, it's because Griswold attempted to exclude Donald Trump from Colorado's 2024 ballots on the claim he'd incited an insurrection in 2021. In May, the US Supreme Court ruled against her.
Donald Trump must be held accountable for his actions. He incited an insurrection and tried to steal an election from the American people. I hope #SCOTUS affirms the Colorado Supreme Court's decision to bar him from the ballot. pic.twitter.com/LFfRPNNh51
— Jena Griswold (@JenaGriswold) February 11, 2024
Perhaps the most troubling detail about the Mesa County situation is that three of the fraudulent ballots will not be removed from the count. They were flagged for review, but then a single election judge approved them all. After that action, there's no mechanism for remedy or removal, officials say. The judge who approved the three forged ballots has been reassigned. ""Everybody affected will be offered a new ballot,"" Griswold told reporters.
""Colorado’s elections are safe and secure. This attempt at fraud was found and investigated quickly because of all the trailblazing processes and tools Colorado has in place like signature verification, ballot tracking, and the curing process,"" said Griswold. ""Every eligible Colorado voter will be able to make their voice heard this election.” Griswold's boast seems excessive, given 25% of the known fraudulent ballots are being counted anyway. Uneasy Colorado voters can check the status of their ballots by visiting Go Vote Colorado.
Mesa County is in Colorado's expansive 3rd congressional district. It's currently represented by Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert, but she's now making a run to represent eastern Colorado's 4th district instead. She only won reelection in 2022 by about 500 votes and would have faced long odds against the same better-funded opponent, Adam Frisch. The Economist projects Boebert will win the 4th-district in a landslide. Neither of Colorado's Senate seats are up for election this year. Meanwhile, Polymarket gives Kamala Harris a 94.8% chance winning Colorado's 10 electoral votes.",2024-10-25
Zerohedge,"Fetterman: Trump Support In PA Is 'Astonishing,' Musk Factor Is 'Going to Really Matter'","Democratic Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman is working to help Kamala Harris win the Keystone State's 19 electoral votes, but can't help but marvel at the intense, highly-visible support for Donald Trump he sees across the pivotal battleground.
Agreeing ""one hundred percent"" with the idea that Trump has a special connection with Pennsylvanians, Fetterman told the New York Times that while Democrats may have trouble grasping it, the phenomenon is undeniable:
“There’s a difference between not understanding, but also acknowledging that it exists. And anybody who spends time driving around, and you can see the intensity. It’s astonishing.
I was doing an event in Indiana County. Very, very red. And there was a superstore of Trump stuff, and it was a hundred feet long, and it was dozens of T-shirts and hats and bumper stickers and all kinds of, I mean, it’s like, Where does this all come from? It’s the kind of thing that has taken on its own life. And it’s like something very special exists there. And that doesn’t mean that I admire it. It’s just — it’s real.""
Trump won Pennsylvania by 44,292 votes in 2016 and lost it by 80,555 in 2020. While the 2024 race appears to be another close one, six of the last seven Pennsylvania polls tracked by RealClear Polling put Trump in the lead, by margins ranging from one point to three points. Polymarket bettors are bullish on a Trump win: As this is written, the prediction market gives Trump a 63% chance of winning the state. As for his odds of winning the nationwide contest, Trump has edged up to a 2024-campaign-high of 66.5%, while Harris has fallen to 33.7%.
Fetterman also acknowledged the formidable campaign power of Elon Musk, who's been sharing rally stages with Trump, holding his own town halls, and handing out million-dollar random prizes to registered swing-state voters who sign a petition:
""Now Musk is joining him. I mean, to a lot of people, that’s [Marvel Comics Iron Man billionaire alter-ego] Tony Stark. That’s the world’s richest guy. And he’s obviously and undeniably a brilliant guy, and he’s saying, 'Hey, that’s my guy for president.' That’s going to really matter.""
Addressing a key election issue, Fetterman distinguished himself from many in his party by reiterating the importance of having a secure border so American communities aren't overwhelmed by people needing support.
Fetterman, who no longer identifies as a Progressive, chided fellow Democrats for being in a state of denial about the negative impact of a large and uncontrolled flow of destitute third-worlders. ""[They're] trying to tell people, 'well, don’t believe your eyes, it’s going to be OK, it’s all working out.' It’s not,"" said the ever-slovenly Fetterman, who showed up for his video-recorded interview with the Times dressed something like a destitute third-worlder himself -- in a black hoodie and gym shorts.
Fetterman added:
""I’m the most pro-immigration guy there is. But that has to be compatible with a secure border, and I will never listen to anyone’s other side until you can explain, like, how? How do we take care of them? Where did those resources come from? And where do they go? Nobody could provide a serious answer to that.""

Zerohedge,CNN Data Analyst Admits Trump On Course To Win Popular Vote,"CNN’s data analyst Harry Enten suggested Friday that Donald Trump could be on course to win the popular vote on November 5th.
That hasn’t happened for a Republican candidate for 20 years.
If it happens, Trump will almost certainly win the electoral college and the election.
Enten noted that a New York Times/Siena College poll was released last week showing Trump tied with Kamala Harris at 48% in the national popular vote.
“Everyone has been talking about this idea that Trump may win in the Electoral College, but Kamala Harris may win the popular vote, but Trump may finally get his great white whale,” Enten stated.
He added that Wall Street Journal and CNBC polls also have Trump ahead of Harris in the popular vote.
There's a real shot Trump may get his great white whale: winning the popular vote. Polls show the race nationally is basically even as Trump runs far ahead of where he polled in 2016 or 2020.

“Part of my job is to warn our viewers, on either side of the aisle, of an event that may occur, that they don’t necessarily like, and Donald Trump winning the popular vote could ABSOLUTELY happen,” Enten urged.
He added “You might as well wrap your minds around it now folks if you don’t like Donald Trump,” noting that Democrat supporters heads are currently “exploding.”

Zerohedge,Steve Bannon Released From Prison After Serving 4 Months For Contempt Of Congress,"Authored by Sam Dorman via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),
Steve Bannon, who served as a top White House adviser early on in the Trump administration, was released from prison on Oct. 29 after serving four months for contempt of Congress.
“The four months in federal prison not only didn’t break me, it empowered me,” he said during his “WarRoom” podcast. “I am more energized and more focused than I’ve ever been in my entire life.”
Bannon, 70, was serving time in the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut. His release comes after a federal judge on Oct. 22 denied his request for early release. Bannon entered prison in July after the Supreme Court refused to take up his request to avoid his four-month sentence.
LET’S FUCKING GO!!!! pic.twitter.com/LOkm4HKYlQ
— Maureen Bannon (@maureen_bannon) October 29, 2024
When he began serving his sentence in July, Bannon called himself a “political prisoner.”
“I am proud of going to prison,” he said at the time, adding that he was standing up to Attorney General Merrick Garland and what he called a “corrupt” Justice Department.
A jury convicted him in 2022 for two counts of contempt of Congress after he refused to comply with requests from the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol breach.
Bannon, 70, claimed that former President Donald Trump had extended executive privilege over his testimony. Bannon’s attorney, David Schoen, told the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit that the district court had wrongly excluded evidence surrounding another attorney advising Bannon that he didn’t have to comply with the subpoenas because Trump had invoked that privilege.
“At a bare minimum, it’s required that the defendant know or understand that his or her conduct was unlawful or wrong,” Schoen told the court in November 2023.
“Mr. Bannon acted in the only way he believed and understood from his lawyer that the law permitted him ... to behave in response to the subpoena.”
The appeals court said that under its precedent, Bannon’s advice-of-attorney defense “is no defense at all.”
STEVE BANNON IS BACK, and his return monologue is insanely powerful.

Now you see why they silenced him before the election.… pic.twitter.com/JLcwIXw5x6
“As both this court and the Supreme Court have repeatedly explained, a contrary rule would contravene the text of the contempt statute and hamstring Congress’s investigatory authority,” Judge Brad Garcia said, writing for the court.
“Because we have no basis to depart from that binding precedent, and because none of Bannon’s other challenges to his convictions have merit, we affirm.”
Bannon faces other criminal charges in New York, where a judge has set Dec. 9 as the start date for the trial in his border fundraising case. Prosecutors allege that Bannon helped funnel more than $100,000 to a co-founder of the nonprofit WeBuildTheWall Inc. who was allegedly getting a secret salary after Bannon and others had promised donors that every dollar would be used to help construct a wall along the U.S.–Mexico border.
Bannon has pleaded not guilty to money laundering and conspiracy charges, calling them “nonsense.” In 2021, Trump pardoned Bannon in a federal case similar to the one he’s currently facing from New York prosecutors.
That case was brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s office, which also prosecuted Trump for alleged election interference involving a payment to adult performer Stephanie Clifford, known as Stormy Daniels. Trump similarly pleaded not guilty.
Bannon entered prison the same month that another former Trump White House adviser, Peter Navarro, exited under similar circumstances. Navarro claimed executive privilege in defying a congressional subpoena, but D.C. District Judge Amit Mehta said he hadn’t shown enough evidence the privilege was asserted.
Trump is facing potential prison time for his role in the events of Jan. 6, 2021, but has successfully avoided trial in Washington. His appeal on presidential immunity resulted in a landmark Supreme Court case and a lengthy delay of the pre-trial process for special counsel Jack Smith’s prosecution of him.

Zerohedge,Will Democrats Accept the Results of the 2024 Presidential Election?,"Picture this scenario on November 6: the American presidential election has taken place, and Donald Trump is the winner with well over 300 Electoral College votes, legitimately and decisively beating Kamala Harris. Democrats are in an uproar, making wild claims of election interference from foreign entities like Russia just like in 2016, and threatening to block certification of the election unless their candidate of choice is installed.
By attempting to nullify the votes of over half of the country, Democrats have chosen to wage war against Americans who don’t agree with them. It is their last-ditch effort to cling to power and they don’t care what damage is done to the country in the process. The damage done, in fact, is part of the plan.
An army of lawyers from both sides is being deployed across the nation in anticipation of massive voter fraud, similar to what went on during the 2020 election. While Republicans are out there to identify and prevent the fraud, Democrats are obfuscating and concealing their efforts to count ballots multiple times, stop the rejection of invalid ballots, and keep objective observers from reporting on the mishandling of ballots by those intent on committing election fraud. Democrats are actually working to allow non-citizens to vote.
So-called fact-checkers point out that this only applies to local and state elections, not federal elections. Don’t fall for this misdirection. Why have Democrats, from Joe Biden on down, pushed so hard to allow non-citizens to vote? Once voting by non-citizens in local and state elections is legitimized, America as we have known it for more than 240 years will no longer exist.
All this will be followed by escalating the lawfare against Trump with possible prison sentencing between the election and inauguration in one or more of the criminal cases he faces.
It is especially true with the Jack Smith case in D.C., which is a blatant, partisan case of election interference. We are convinced that all of the cases against Trump will ultimately be dismissed on appeal as they have no legitimate basis; however, the Democrats will push forward anyway as they have no concern over what legal precedence they are setting, nor do they care about the damage they’re doing to the institution of Congress. It’s all about holding power.
Democrats in Congress with stage-four Trump Derangement Syndrome, especially the clown-like Jamie Raskin (D-MD), have already said the quiet part out loud. Raskin says if Trump should win, combining an Electoral College win even with a potential popular vote victory (which current polls are showing), they will immediately challenge the results under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, tying up the election results beyond January 20, 2025. These Democrats will stop at nothing to destroy America by invoking a second Civil War (Raskin’s own words) if necessary.
Can you imagine the chaos and damage a lame-duck Biden-Harris administration can inflict on the United States between Election Day and Trump’s second inauguration on January 20, 2025? With executive orders coming from an increasingly infirm and vengeful Joe Biden (with help from Dr. Jill and his puppet masters like Barack Obama and even Nancy Pelosi, who forced Biden to abandon his reelection bid under threat of invoking the 25th Amendment). These are people who will do anything to retain power, including preventing Trump from taking the oath of office.
Democrats have become everything they have accused Trump of intending to do. In his first term, Trump took no action to lock up Hillary Clinton, who is now out promoting her third memoir, Something Lost, Something Gained (a title that lacks even a basic sense of self-awareness as it heads to the $5.95 remainder racks, hopefully by Christmas). Will she ever stop relitigating the results of the 2016 election?
At some point, the Supreme Court will be forced to step in, possibly on an emergency basis, to save our democracy from Democrats and their Deep State political thugs who will refuse to participate in the peaceful transfer of power. It’s the ultimate example of projection.
It’s a sad state of affairs but one that can be remedied in the future if we reinstate integrity in our election systems. That is, making sure that the people’s votes actually count and are not manipulated by loosening rules to satisfy those who would cheat in order to attain or keep power. Every illegitimate vote cancels out a legitimate vote.
Election integrity starts with requiring photo identification. Thirty-six states require photo ID; 14 states and the District of Columbia don’t.
If we can require photo ID to buy a pack of cigarettes or a beer in a bar, or a driver’s license to operate a motor vehicle, we can require it to exercise our most sacred right to vote. It doesn’t disenfranchise anyone except those not eligible to vote, like immigrants who entered the United States illegally and lack proper identification. Requiring proof of identity does not make it harder to vote; it makes it harder to cheat.
With some degree of integrity restored to America’s election process, the people’s legitimate voices will be heard loud and clear. This will deliver the presidency back to Donald Trump with a clear mandate to “drain the swamp” that is Washington, D.C.
Once Trump returns to the White House in 2025, with no worry about a reelection bid in 2028, he can complete the house cleaning he started when he took office in 2017. It will be the best lame duck presidency in American history.
Trump can remove the unelected political appointees running the alphabet agencies (starting with the FBI, the CIA, and especially the NSA) as well as the leadership class in the military. Today we have 44 four-star generals—there are no current five-star generals or admirals since the passing of Omar Bradley in 1981—commanding 2.86 million members in the military as opposed to during World War Two when 16 million men were under arms being commanded by just four five-star generals and admirals. Including the military, those bureaucracies must be completely dismantled and rebuilt from the ground up by individuals who care about America, not an administrative state that cares only about amassing personal power.
Now is the time to make Election Day a national holiday and to require day-of and in-person voting across the nation with the results known the following day. Reasonable exceptions can be made for members serving in the military and true hardship cases.
Going forward for the next presidential election (it’s too late for this year’s presidential election), to ensure election integrity, absentee ballots will need to be submitted, along with proper identification, no later than November 1, 2028, so they can be counted in advance of Election Day in 2028.
If we can politically pander to a small segment of the population by making Juneteenth a national holiday, we can certainly benefit all citizens by having Election Day nationalized. Our democracy deserves nothing less.",2024-10-26
Zerohedge,Kamala Harris Wins Nickelodeon's 'Kids Choice' Presidential Election Poll,"The election has been decided, 52% Harris versus 48% Trump and Kamala cackles all the way to the Oval Office, at least, according to a long running Nickelodeon kids poll. The event has over 32,000 participants casting their virtual vote, which was open from Oct. 3-23. This might seem like desperation, but the children have spoken and the establishment media claims this is a good sign for Democrats.
Though Nickelodeon emphasized that its Kids Vote is “an informal non-scientific poll, meant for entertainment purposes only,” the media argues that election-time event has a fairly strong track record. The mock election has taken place every election year since 1988. Since that time, the poll has accurately predicted the winner of the U.S. presidential election every four years save for 2004 and 2016.
The results of the poll were officially announced Monday night during a half-hour special. Nickelodeon also partnered with The National Association of Media Literacy Educators on a guide for parents that focuses on media literacy. “Kids Pick the President” is part of the company’s “Our World” global prosocial initiative, which seeks to “inspire kids and provide them with tools to activate their individual and collective agency,” according to a press release.
It should be noted that ""Media Literacy"" organizations are consistently rife with far-left pro-corporate media propaganda and they are at the forefront of efforts to establish woke ideology as a cultural standard. They lobby to create a government controlled censorship structure for social media, all while demonizing contrary positions and facts as ""conspiracy theory"" and ""dangerous speech"".
It's not surprising that a company like Nickelodeon leans to the far-left and that their presidential ""poll"" for kids shows a Harris win. But, let's not forget what Kamala Harris actually thinks of younger people's cognitive abilities:
Maybe Harris polls well with the stupid kids? She has no biological children of her own, so we can't ask them.
The obvious argument is, of course, who cares? Why would anyone take an informal poll of children seriously? Previous accuracy of the poll is more likely due to the fact that children overhear their parents political views and then vote the way their parents would. In this sense, the poll could be considered a potential window into the common American household.
Nickelodeon admits that Harris' win is by the narrowest margin in the event's history except for Barack Obama in 2008, which is interesting. One would think the children would be so thoroughly indoctrinated that they would be voting for Harris and against Trump by the largest margin ever. That's not the case, if the results are to be believed.
While all polling has resulted in questionable data over the years (2016 being the most shocking revelation of all time on the inaccuracy of polling), the majority of data coming in for the 2024 election suggests a near certain Trump win in the electoral college. Trump leads Harris in 7 key battleground states. He is also edging towards a potential win of the majority of the popular vote.
The Nickelodeon poll wrongly predicted a loss for Trump in 2016, but the tots can't be right all the time. If the previous election in 2020 is any indication, it's true that Trump could still lose unless the margin of votes in his favor is so spectacularly high that no creative accounting is possible.",2024-10-29
Zerohedge,Stepping On The Snake,"One can roll all of the majority of grievances into one basic event, the government stepping on the snake. The famous Gadsden Flag of “Don’t Tread On Me,” a warning to the Brits to mind their own affairs, or they might get bitten, is a favorite of the patriots against the decades-long process of violating their rights. It’s a warning revived during the Tea Party days, now fifteen years hence. But they have been stepping on them.
What the US Government loves to do, is step on the snake; to grind it into the ground and since 1787, they have not been bitten. It’s our responsibility to future generations to retaliate for the injustices of our time. Each generation has a duty, as I see it, to deliver the nation to the next generation with a full compliment of rights and freedoms.
In that endeavor, we have thus far failed, but a new day dawns.
It’s difficult to imagine the depth and width of patriotic zeal that has slowly been eroded over the past few centuries, but it is a great reservoir that the current regime continues to draw on to inflict mass casualties on the people without significant backlash. This is largely due to a misunderstanding of loyalty.
The government likes to project symbols as the objects of loyalty, while eroding freedoms in darkness. So they shine a bright light on the flag “Old Glory,” as it’s sometimes called, that represents the past obedience of the government to its charter, the U.S. Constitution. In the meantime, they have hollowed out that document by ignoring it all along the way, from Executive Branch expansion as a means of doing a backward illegality that is the purview of congress, i.e., all spending bills have to originate in the House. But if the Executive Branch creates FEMA or the EPA, it becomes incumbent on congress to fund it with the excuse that they could simply defund it, should it get out of control. Well, that’s exactly what’s happened over and over again, except the House doesn’t have the political will to stand up for the people and defund anything. They have been terrorized by the bureaucrats that give example after example of bad things that they will be blamed for if they defund a single thing.
They like to shine a bright light on the capitol building and the Washington Monument, even the White House to appeal to patriotism, while none of those things function as intended. During the whole of the Biden Administration, the Executive Branch has run itself. The DOJ doesn’t worry about committing crimes, because who is going to hold it accountable? FEMA and the border patrol fall under their purview as well as the FBI. No one can hold them accountable, but they can defund them. Our congress, who has oversight, has been unwilling to restrain its excesses.
All of this is a challenge to patriots to do something about it, knowing that whatever they might do will be cast as an attack on the flag, the congress or the cynically termed “democracy.” We saw that on January 6th. It had a chilling effect on the right to assemble and petition for a redress of grievances as intended. The constitutional right violates the security of the corrupt government and is suddenly deemed unpatriotic, an insurrection, rather than what it was, a right to petition the government to correct an openly and arrogantly stolen election.
The point is, the government will fight back with everything it has to keep the people enslaved to their bastardization of the constitution and the denial of rights of the people. It takes a brave population to shrug off those charges, repudiate the “unpatriotic” theme with action, but look at what’s been endured since January 6th, 2021 and you’ll understand the lengths to which they will go and the methods by which you can operate.
First, don’t give them a timeline, or an opportunity to infiltrate. The very existence of opposition assembly arises from Obama and sending SEIU out to do his bidding against those who protested Obamacare. I know, I was there, I saw it, including the buses and the sign-in sheets by which these public servants were paid for their time to counter unpaid, patriotic, citizen-organized protests. This is a tactic that has been used over and over with Antifa and BLM in later-stage government’s attacks on freedom of speech and the right to assemble.
Anytime the government sponsors or pays counter-protesters, it is a violation of the First Amendment. Simple as that. They are acting unlawfully. To counter all of this, the people must be much more aware of their rights and especially the law with the willingness to report such crimes to the Sheriff or DA of the jurisdiction. That, specifically, is in violation of 18 USC 41 Conspiracy against rights, where any two people gathered to deny any right, in this case, intimidate you from exercising one’s right to petition the government for a redress of grievances through fear for one’s safety, they have committed a crime. One can tell the difference by where the “counter protesters” are placed. If it is within sight and sound of original protesters, the right has been violated.
This all points to one ultimate conclusion. If the government is invested in denying any right of the people, it actually serves as an injury for which consequences can be expected. That is the justification, the act in defense of the constitution that defeats their claims of “unpatriotic acts.” In order to be unpatriotic, one has to be defying the constitution, not the illegal actions of the government itself. Denying that criticism, through counter-protestors or censorship of social media is in violation of the law.
While I admit this all sounds like official gobbledegook that has no weight or stamina in a corrupt court, it is. But I’m not arguing the law, but the justification for consequences for stepping on the snake. Getting one’s mind right for the upcoming festivities is as important as any other preparation. It will endure one during hard times knowing that despite what the captured media might say, they acted rightfully and legally in the eyes of compatriots. This was the preparatory work not done prior to January 6th.
There will be another January 6th, they’re begging for it and will, like then, create it, if it won’t be brought to them wrapped in shiny paper and a ribbon. The response, unlike then, must be a full-throated denunciation and demand for the real criminals to be exposed.

Former President Trump sat down with Joe Rogan for a three-hour interview on Friday. Several days later, the viral interview appears to have been censored on the video-sharing platform.
On early Tuesday morning, Rogan addressed censorship concerns by uploading the full video on X. He said, ""Since there's an issue with searching for this episode on YouTube here is the full podcast with Trump.""

A quick YouTube search for Rogan's interview with Trump does not yield results for the original video, suggesting that the platform may be suppressing it. The only way to watch the video is to go directly to Rogan's channel.
On X, David Heinemeier Hansson, CTO of software company Basecamp, wrote, ""Tried to find the Rogan/Trump interview on YouTube but no matter what I search, it's not coming up. Would be beyond bonkers if they're actively trying to suppress it. Must be a glitch, right?""

Meanwhile, if the suppression of the Rogan-Trump interview sounds wild, in MSM, there's a complete, full-blown panic meltdown underway.
Several major newspapers have rejected endorsing any political candidate, which has only sparked a shitstorm at The Washington Post, which for decades endorsed leftist candidates.
Jeff Bezos, the owner of WaPo, published an Op-Ed overnight explaining his decision not to endorse Harris because the paper faces ""credibility concerns.""
""Lack of credibility isn't unique to The Post. Our brethren newspapers have the same issue. And it's a problem not only for media, but also for the nation. Many people are turning to off-the-cuff podcasts, inaccurate social media posts and other unverified news sources, which can quickly spread misinformation and deepen divisions,"" Bezos said.

Zerohedge,Supreme Court Passes On 2nd Amendment Challenge To Federal Gun Law,"Authored by Matthew Vadum via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),
The Supreme Court has sidestepped a challenge to a federal law prohibiting felons from possessing firearms.
Instead of scheduling oral argument in the case filed by Lorenzo Garod Pierre, on Oct. 21, the court granted the petition and immediately overturned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit ruling that Pierre was appealing.
The Supreme Court did not provide reasons for its decision. No justices dissented.
The Supreme Court directed the 11th Circuit to reconsider its ruling in Pierre’s case in light of United States v. Rahimi, a decision the high court issued in June that the federal government said “clarified the methodology for determining whether a firearms regulation complies with the Second Amendment.”
In Rahimi, the justices upheld Section 922(g)(8) of Title 18 of the U.S. Code, a federal law that bars people under domestic violence-related restraining orders from possessing firearms.
Specifically, they found that the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution isn’t violated when an individual is disarmed after a court has found him to pose a credible threat to the physical safety of another.
Pierre said in his petition that he was charged in July 2022 with violating Section 922(g)(1) of Title 18 of the U.S. Code for knowingly possessing a firearm after being convicted of a felony. Court papers did not provide details of the prior felony conviction.
Pierre asked the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida to throw out the felony-level indictment, arguing that it was “unconstitutional in light of” New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen, which the Supreme Court handed down in June 2022. In Bruen, the nation’s highest court held that firearms restrictions must have a historical analogue and that the Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms in public for self-defense.
A magistrate judge filed a report that recommended denying the motion to dismiss. Magistrate judges are appointed to assist federal district judges.
Pierre objected, and the district court refused to dismiss the charge, finding that prior 11th Circuit rulings “squarely foreclosed” the constitutional challenge and were not undermined by the Bruen precedent.
Pierre lodged an appeal with the 11th Circuit arguing that his conviction “as applied” ran afoul of the Second Amendment. In an as-applied challenge, a litigant argues that a statute or regulation is unconstitutional in the context of a specific case.
On March 12, the 11th Circuit affirmed the district court in a two-page decision, holding that the circuit court’s prior rulings were binding in the case.
Pierre argued in his petition that, since Bruen was decided, federal courts of appeals have been split on whether a “defendant may mount a challenge that his individual circumstances do not supply a basis, consistent with the Second Amendment, for stripping the right” to possess firearms.
The 11th Circuit says felons are “categorically ‘disqualified’ from exercising their Second Amendment right,” but the Seventh and Ninth circuits allow defendants to file as-applied challenges to charges under Section 922(g)(1).
The Supreme Court should grant review to resolve the circuit split, the petition states.
U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued in a Sept. 16 brief that the Supreme Court should grant the petition and send the case back to the 11th Circuit with instructions to review its ruling in light of Rahimi.
The Rahimi decision contains within it the proper legal standard for evaluating the Pierre case because it “clarified the methodology for determining whether a firearms regulation complies with the Second Amendment.”
And because the Supreme Court vacated judgments in five separate challenges to Section 922(g)(1) in July and sent those cases back to circuit courts for review in light of Rahimi, “consistent with that practice, the Court should grant the petition ... in this case, vacate the court of appeals’ judgment, and remand for further consideration in light of Rahimi,” Prelogar said.
The Epoch Times reached out for comment to Pierre’s attorney, Brian Taylor Goldman of Holwell, Shuster, and Goldberg in New York City, and the U.S. Department of Justice but had received no replies as of publication time.",2024-10-28
Zerohedge,Election Battles For State Legislature Supermajorities Heat Up,"Authored by Austin Alonzo via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),
While Congress stagnates, America’s state houses are drafting and passing policies affecting millions. Now, more than ever, those legislative bodies operate without input from an opposition party or dissenting governor.
As of Oct. 21, there are 23 Republican trifectas, 17 Democratic trifectas, and 10 divided governments where neither party holds trifecta control, according to Ballotpedia. A trifecta means one party holds the state governorship and a majority in the state house and senate.
Heading into November’s general election, legislative supermajorities exist in 57 of the 99 legislative chambers in the union, according to data compiled by state and local government consultancy Stateside.
Republicans hold 41 of those veto-proof advantages, while Democrats own 20. All told, there is a partisan supermajority in at least one house of the Legislature in 35 of the 50 states.
However, in 14 of those states, the supermajority is held by an advantage of three seats or less. Michael Behm, Stateside’s co-CEO and principal, told The Epoch Times that organizations aligned with the Democratic and Republican parties are spending heavily on down-ballot races that could make or break a supermajority in the coming legislative term.
Even though voter interest is low in statehouse races compared with high-profile campaigns for national offices, Behm and others who spoke with The Epoch Times said the stakes are high. Most of the legislative actions that affect the public, such as policy on abortions, education, energy, health care, taxes, and transportation, come from decisions made in statehouses.
“With the federal government being so polarized and hamstrung these days, the action is at the state level,” Behm said.
Supermajorities
The definition of a supermajority varies from state to state. Generally, attaining a supermajority means a state legislative body has enough members from one party to pass laws without any votes from the minority party and enough votes to override the governor’s vetoes.
Heading into the 2024 general election, Republicans hold a supermajority in both houses of the state Legislature in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, West Virginia and Wyoming.
Additionally, Republicans hold a supermajority in one chamber of the Legislature in Iowa, Mississippi, and South Carolina.
Democrats own a supermajority in both houses of the state Legislature in California, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, and Rhode Island. Democrats have a supermajority in one chamber of the state Legislatures of Colorado, Connecticut, and Nevada.
Behm said that’s the largest number of supermajorities he has ever observed in state legislatures. Ideologically, the domination of the legislatures by a single party reflects intense political polarization in these states, he said.
Chris Cooper, director of the Haire Institute for Public Policy at Western Carolina University, said a supermajority effectively limits the governor’s power to carry out policy priorities in a state with a divided government.
Four governors—Kansas’s Laura Kelly, Kentucky’s Andy Beshear, North Carolina’s Roy Cooper, and Vermont’s Phil Scott—preside over divided state governments in which the opposition party holds a legislative supermajority.
The four governors’ legislatures stripped them of much of their policymaking potency. In June, Scott, a Republican, told members of the news media, “I think the power has gotten to their head,” referring to the Democrat-controlled Vermont General Assembly’s overriding of six of his vetoes in a single override session.
In North Carolina, a supermajority almost wholly nullifies the will of a governor who already commands limited influence under the state’s constitution, Chris Cooper said.
With their supermajority, Republicans passed new abortion restrictions, drafted new election laws, and further throttled back Gov. Roy Cooper’s power during the most recent legislative session.
“They have taken away appointment power from the North Carolina governor,” Chris Cooper said. “They have made a number of changes that make the already powerful state Legislature into something even more powerful.”
National Efforts
Behm said the rise of legislative supermajorities can be attributed to growing involvement from national partisan groups known as 527 organizations. These are tax-exempt entities that can receive and spend unlimited amounts of money to influence federal, state, and local politics and elections.
Three decades ago, statehouse races were usually local contests directed and financed by city and state chambers of commerce, unions, and other parochial political organizations, Behm said. Now, national groups such as the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC) and Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC) invest vast national resources into the state’s legislative caucuses.
Behm said both party committees use professionals to recruit candidates and organize the partisan campaigns designed to build majorities in statehouses.
“These 527 groups have turned state legislative races into national races,” Behm said.
Chris Cooper said Republicans began to take over the statehouses in 2010 when the Republican Party introduced an initiative known as Project REDMAP. The plan called for investing huge sums into state legislative races that were previously overlooked in Washington and flipping chambers to the GOP.
“They did as advertised,” he said. “They turned maps red.”

Zerohedge,"Fetterman: Trump Support In PA Is 'Astonishing,' Musk Factor Is 'Going to Really Matter'","Democratic Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman is working to help Kamala Harris win the Keystone State's 19 electoral votes, but can't help but marvel at the intense, highly-visible support for Donald Trump he sees across the pivotal battleground.
Agreeing ""one hundred percent"" with the idea that Trump has a special connection with Pennsylvanians, Fetterman told the New York Times that while Democrats may have trouble grasping it, the phenomenon is undeniable:
“There’s a difference between not understanding, but also acknowledging that it exists. And anybody who spends time driving around, and you can see the intensity. It’s astonishing.
I was doing an event in Indiana County. Very, very red. And there was a superstore of Trump stuff, and it was a hundred feet long, and it was dozens of T-shirts and hats and bumper stickers and all kinds of, I mean, it’s like, Where does this all come from? It’s the kind of thing that has taken on its own life. And it’s like something very special exists there. And that doesn’t mean that I admire it. It’s just — it’s real.""
Trump won Pennsylvania by 44,292 votes in 2016 and lost it by 80,555 in 2020. While the 2024 race appears to be another close one, six of the last seven Pennsylvania polls tracked by RealClear Polling put Trump in the lead, by margins ranging from one point to three points. Polymarket bettors are bullish on a Trump win: As this is written, the prediction market gives Trump a 63% chance of winning the state. As for his odds of winning the nationwide contest, Trump has edged up to a 2024-campaign-high of 66.5%, while Harris has fallen to 33.7%.
Fetterman also acknowledged the formidable campaign power of Elon Musk, who's been sharing rally stages with Trump, holding his own town halls, and handing out million-dollar random prizes to registered swing-state voters who sign a petition:
""Now Musk is joining him. I mean, to a lot of people, that’s [Marvel Comics Iron Man billionaire alter-ego] Tony Stark. That’s the world’s richest guy. And he’s obviously and undeniably a brilliant guy, and he’s saying, 'Hey, that’s my guy for president.' That’s going to really matter.""
Addressing a key election issue, Fetterman distinguished himself from many in his party by reiterating the importance of having a secure border so American communities aren't overwhelmed by people needing support.
Fetterman, who no longer identifies as a Progressive, chided fellow Democrats for being in a state of denial about the negative impact of a large and uncontrolled flow of destitute third-worlders. ""[They're] trying to tell people, 'well, don’t believe your eyes, it’s going to be OK, it’s all working out.' It’s not,"" said the ever-slovenly Fetterman, who showed up for his video-recorded interview with the Times dressed something like a destitute third-worlder himself -- in a black hoodie and gym shorts.
Fetterman added:
""I’m the most pro-immigration guy there is. But that has to be compatible with a secure border, and I will never listen to anyone’s other side until you can explain, like, how? How do we take care of them? Where did those resources come from? And where do they go? Nobody could provide a serious answer to that.""

Zerohedge,76% Of Americans Are Worried About Post-Election Violence: Poll,"Authored by Tom Ozimek via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),
A new poll shows that the vast majority of Americans are at least somewhat worried about a possible outbreak of violence following the fast-approaching Nov. 5 presidential election.
The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll, released on Oct. 28, found that 41 percent of registered voters were “extremely” or “very” concerned about post-election political violence, with another 35 percent saying they are “somewhat” concerned about an outbreak of unrest after Election Day.
A higher percentage of Americans (82 percent) said they were at least “somewhat” concerned about increased political violence directed at election officials or political figures. The specter of violence has hung over much of the presidential campaign due to two assassination attempts against former President Donald Trump, while President Joe Biden said recently he’s confident the election will be “free and fair” but is unsure whether it will be “peaceful.”
The findings of the AP-NORC survey align with the results of a recent Scripps News/Ipsos poll, which showed that 62 percent of Americans believe that an outbreak of post-election violence is at least “somewhat” likely. At the same time, over half (51 percent) of those polled by Scripps News/Ipsos said they would support using the U.S. military to prevent election-related violence, including 61 percent of Republicans.
The use of the U.S. military to respond to political violence has become a heated topic of discussion in recent weeks after Trump said he wasn’t concerned about election-related violence because, if chaos were to truly break out, the National Guard—or even regular military units—could step in to restore order.
“I think it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military, because they can’t let that happen,” Trump said in an Oct. 13 interview with Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo, in response to a question about the potential for an outbreak of election-related violence. The former president added that he wasn’t worried about potential Election Day chaos being fomented by his supporters or foreign actors, but instead by people he labeled “radical left lunatics” and the “enemy from within.”
Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign seized on Trump’s remarks, saying that Americans should find them alarming.
“Trump is suggesting that his fellow Americans are worse ‘enemies’ than foreign adversaries, and he is saying he would use the military against them,” Ian Sams, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, said in a statement.
Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), dismissed those concerns as unfounded campaign rhetoric. In an Oct. 27 interview on CNN, Vance said that when Trump spoke about using the U.S. military against the “enemy from within” he was not referring to political opponents but to extreme cases like the far-left activists who “burn down our cities,” referring to the chaos that engulfed parts of the country in the summer of 2020 following the death of George Floyd.
The poll showing a growing public concern about election-related violence was released with just eight days of campaigning left before Election Day. Over 45 million early votes have already been cast.
Meanwhile, the vast majority—92 percent—of local election officials have taken steps to increase security for poll workers, election infrastructure, and voters ahead of the 2024 election, according to a survey conducted earlier this year. The survey also showed that election-related safety concerns have reached or exceeded levels recorded in the prior election cycle.",2024-10-30

Zerohedge,Will Democrats Accept the Results of the 2024 Presidential Election?,"Picture this scenario on November 6: the American presidential election has taken place, and Donald Trump is the winner with well over 300 Electoral College votes, legitimately and decisively beating Kamala Harris. Democrats are in an uproar, making wild claims of election interference from foreign entities like Russia just like in 2016, and threatening to block certification of the election unless their candidate of choice is installed.
By attempting to nullify the votes of over half of the country, Democrats have chosen to wage war against Americans who don’t agree with them. It is their last-ditch effort to cling to power and they don’t care what damage is done to the country in the process. The damage done, in fact, is part of the plan.
An army of lawyers from both sides is being deployed across the nation in anticipation of massive voter fraud, similar to what went on during the 2020 election. While Republicans are out there to identify and prevent the fraud, Democrats are obfuscating and concealing their efforts to count ballots multiple times, stop the rejection of invalid ballots, and keep objective observers from reporting on the mishandling of ballots by those intent on committing election fraud. Democrats are actually working to allow non-citizens to vote.
So-called fact-checkers point out that this only applies to local and state elections, not federal elections. Don’t fall for this misdirection. Why have Democrats, from Joe Biden on down, pushed so hard to allow non-citizens to vote? Once voting by non-citizens in local and state elections is legitimized, America as we have known it for more than 240 years will no longer exist.
All this will be followed by escalating the lawfare against Trump with possible prison sentencing between the election and inauguration in one or more of the criminal cases he faces.
It is especially true with the Jack Smith case in D.C., which is a blatant, partisan case of election interference. We are convinced that all of the cases against Trump will ultimately be dismissed on appeal as they have no legitimate basis; however, the Democrats will push forward anyway as they have no concern over what legal precedence they are setting, nor do they care about the damage they’re doing to the institution of Congress. It’s all about holding power.
Democrats in Congress with stage-four Trump Derangement Syndrome, especially the clown-like Jamie Raskin (D-MD), have already said the quiet part out loud. Raskin says if Trump should win, combining an Electoral College win even with a potential popular vote victory (which current polls are showing), they will immediately challenge the results under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, tying up the election results beyond January 20, 2025. These Democrats will stop at nothing to destroy America by invoking a second Civil War (Raskin’s own words) if necessary.
Can you imagine the chaos and damage a lame-duck Biden-Harris administration can inflict on the United States between Election Day and Trump’s second inauguration on January 20, 2025? With executive orders coming from an increasingly infirm and vengeful Joe Biden (with help from Dr. Jill and his puppet masters like Barack Obama and even Nancy Pelosi, who forced Biden to abandon his reelection bid under threat of invoking the 25th Amendment). These are people who will do anything to retain power, including preventing Trump from taking the oath of office.
Democrats have become everything they have accused Trump of intending to do. In his first term, Trump took no action to lock up Hillary Clinton, who is now out promoting her third memoir, Something Lost, Something Gained (a title that lacks even a basic sense of self-awareness as it heads to the $5.95 remainder racks, hopefully by Christmas). Will she ever stop relitigating the results of the 2016 election?
At some point, the Supreme Court will be forced to step in, possibly on an emergency basis, to save our democracy from Democrats and their Deep State political thugs who will refuse to participate in the peaceful transfer of power. It’s the ultimate example of projection.
It’s a sad state of affairs but one that can be remedied in the future if we reinstate integrity in our election systems. That is, making sure that the people’s votes actually count and are not manipulated by loosening rules to satisfy those who would cheat in order to attain or keep power. Every illegitimate vote cancels out a legitimate vote.
Election integrity starts with requiring photo identification. Thirty-six states require photo ID; 14 states and the District of Columbia don’t.
If we can require photo ID to buy a pack of cigarettes or a beer in a bar, or a driver’s license to operate a motor vehicle, we can require it to exercise our most sacred right to vote. It doesn’t disenfranchise anyone except those not eligible to vote, like immigrants who entered the United States illegally and lack proper identification. Requiring proof of identity does not make it harder to vote; it makes it harder to cheat.
With some degree of integrity restored to America’s election process, the people’s legitimate voices will be heard loud and clear. This will deliver the presidency back to Donald Trump with a clear mandate to “drain the swamp” that is Washington, D.C.
Once Trump returns to the White House in 2025, with no worry about a reelection bid in 2028, he can complete the house cleaning he started when he took office in 2017. It will be the best lame duck presidency in American history.
Trump can remove the unelected political appointees running the alphabet agencies (starting with the FBI, the CIA, and especially the NSA) as well as the leadership class in the military. Today we have 44 four-star generals—there are no current five-star generals or admirals since the passing of Omar Bradley in 1981—commanding 2.86 million members in the military as opposed to during World War Two when 16 million men were under arms being commanded by just four five-star generals and admirals. Including the military, those bureaucracies must be completely dismantled and rebuilt from the ground up by individuals who care about America, not an administrative state that cares only about amassing personal power.
Now is the time to make Election Day a national holiday and to require day-of and in-person voting across the nation with the results known the following day. Reasonable exceptions can be made for members serving in the military and true hardship cases.
Going forward for the next presidential election (it’s too late for this year’s presidential election), to ensure election integrity, absentee ballots will need to be submitted, along with proper identification, no later than November 1, 2028, so they can be counted in advance of Election Day in 2028.
If we can politically pander to a small segment of the population by making Juneteenth a national holiday, we can certainly benefit all citizens by having Election Day nationalized. Our democracy deserves nothing less.",2024-10-26
Zerohedge,Quiet Before The Storm,"“I just can’t wait for this campaign to be over.”
–The American people
Enjoy these last nasty days of the presidential election – they are the quiet before the storm. As long as the race continues, each side’s anger is reined in by the hope of victory. Once a winner is declared, the loser’s rage will erupt. This political Vesuvius promises to inflame the land as events unfold in these final days to maximize furious disappointment
Donald Trump’s side is becoming ever more confident of victory. In recent weeks, RealClearPolitics Polling Averages show Harris’ national lead evaporating while Trump has moved slightly ahead in all six battleground states. Betting markets are now giving Trump the edge.
Still, the polls are very close, and Harris may win. If Trump could insist that he won the 2020 race when all the polls predicted his defeat, just imagine his response if he fails when he appeared to be succeeding. He will not go quietly into the good night.
Kamala Harris, meanwhile, has settled on a closing argument that focuses on Trump’s alleged unsuitability for office. As the candidate herself describes her opponent as an unstable threat to the Constitution, her surrogates are once again comparing him to Hitler, Stalin, and Mussolini. They honestly believe this rhetoric, which will make it impossible for them to bow to his ascension.
We have seen this movie before. The Democrats refused to accept Trump’s victory in 2016; he still won’t concede that President Biden won in 2020. As before, neither side will blame themselves for defeat; they will lash out at their perceived enemies. Each will advance their favored conspiracy theory – Trump will rail against the press and deep state, Democrats against foreign influence and misinformation – but both will cast the result as illegitimate.
This is what happens when you are controlled by tribal emotion, when your politics are governed by psychology rather than policy. People have too much invested in the outcome – literally, their sense of self – to engage in soul searching (at least in the short run).
Because of the different structures of each party, a Harris loss would be far more destructive to the country.
In its current incarnation, the GOP is a bottom-up party. None of its ranking eminences wanted Trump to be the nominee in 2016; almost all of them hoped he would go away after his 2020 defeat. The MAGA rank and file felt differently.
If Trump loses, he will fume and smolder and inflame the body politic. Millions of his supporters will be outraged. But they are largely powerless to influence events. Jan. 6 may have been a dark day in American history, but it was a brief action by a small number of people that was never repeated. Most Republicans condemned the assault and resigned themselves to living peaceably during the Biden presidency. If Trump loses once more, party leaders will, as in 2020, admit defeat and denounce efforts to overturn the result. Frankly, they will be happy to turn the page on the Trump era.
The Democrats, by contrast, are a top-down party. While no one should be surprised by a repeat of the contained violence their supporters unleashed around Trump’s inauguration, the real action will occur once more in the corridors of power.
In a repetition of Trump’s first term, party leaders will refuse to accept his election. An army of Democratic Party lawyers is amassed, awaiting instructions on how, and where, to challenge the results. If, as the polls suggest, Democrats retake the House, they have already floated the idea of refusing to seat him, invoking the Civil War-era 14th Amendment to claim he is a Jan. 6 “insurrectionist.” Assuming that gambit fails, they will almost certainly launch multiple impeachment efforts against him while their stenographers in legacy media continuously cast him as an existential threat to the Republic. As during Trump’s first term, every day will be a nonviolent version of Jan. 6. You cannot, after all, find common ground with Hitler.
It pains me to say that the next four years will be more bitter than the last eight. We, the people, have painted ourselves into a corner by turning to the unforgiving world of politics to find identity and meaning. Will we ever find the courage to say enough?

Zerohedge,"Shocking Rise In Whale, Dolphin, & Porpoise Strandings As Wind Farms Proliferate Around British Coast","Over the last decade as offshore wind farms proliferated around the U.K., there has been a disturbing rise in coastline strandings of whales, dolphins and porpoises. Since the turn of the century, strandings have more than doubled and are now running at over 1,000 animals a year. The slaughter has been largely ignored by the mainstream media that runs with the agreed narrative that offshore wind is environmentally friendly and is the key to achieving Net Zero by 2050.
In fact, wind turbines, whether on or off the shore, are a clear danger to many endangered species and concerns are mounting about their widespread and harmful effects on the natural world. Years ago, the great cause in environmentalism was to save the whales, but these concerns seem to have abated of late, while the slaughter of millions of onshore bats, along with the destruction of many types of large raptors, is simply ignored.
Andrew Montford of Net Zero Watch has updated his graph on the stranding of U.K. cetaceans and compared it to the rise of offshore wind capacity.
Both totals have soared in recent years. Is there a causal link? Perhaps not one that would inconvenience Net Zero fanatics, but Montford says the suggestion of a causal relationship “remains very strong”.
The Daily Sceptic has reported in the past about the mounting casualties of whales stranded off the north eastern coast of the United States in the wake of massive offshore windfarm construction. There have been around 300 fatalities in the last five years, and many suggest the extensive sonar soundings, pile driving and heavy concentrated vessel traffic is causing havoc with aquatic feeding, breeding and migration up and down the coast.
The latest U.K. stranding figures have been reported to Ascobans, a UN environmental conservation body for cetaceans in the NE Atlantic. Commenting on the “shocking” figures, the environmental writer and campaigner Jason Endfield called them “a wake-up call to those planning to further industrialise our seas in the name of renewable energy, and especially offshore wind farms”. In his view, it made no sense to increase ocean noise to levels that are “literally unbearable for marine mammals”.
The great cover-up of this environmental disaster continues with massive industrial parks being erected around the coasts of many countries. In the U.K., the incoming Labour government is committed to a massive expansion with the Mad Miliband spraying around billions of pounds in additional subsidies to boost an industry that would not exist in a free market.
To the fore in blowing smoke over the issue is Greenpeace USA’s senior oceans campaigner Arlo Hemphill who claims there is “no evidence whatsoever” connecting wind turbines to whale deaths. “It’s just a cynical disinformation campaign,” says another Greenpeace spokesman. The mainstream media often goes along with this narrative as shown by recent tweets from Agence France-Presse reporter Manon Jacob. He dismissed the focus on wind farms as a red herring “when offshore wind remains thus far marginal in the U.S. and scientific evidence of large marine mammal deaths is lacking”. This is the same Jacob who wrote a recent ‘fact check’ of the Daily Sceptic that was so bad and misleading it should feature in future journalism schools as an example of how not to criticise well-sourced material.
The investigative science journalist Jo Nova has a different take on the matter:
“Researchers have known since at least 2013 that pile drivers were permanently deafening porpoises, leaving them presumably to die miserable deaths wandering blindly through dark or murky seas. Where were all the professors of marine science, paid by the public to know these things, and where was the BBC?”
Spread the word, she continued.
Fifty years ago, environmentalists would have raised hell about a thousand dead whales and dolphins. Now they are part of the cover-up. “They don’t want to draw attention to the blubber on the beach in case people start asking hard questions,” she observed.
There are however some signs that the ‘nothing to see here, guv’ line is starting to crack. A recent essay in Watts Up With That? suggested that an impact statement from the U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) had finally acknowledged the harm caused by offshore wind farms. Examining leases off the New Jersey and New York coast covering over 488,000 acres, the BOEM hints that these developments are not entirely benign “despite being repeatedly framed as environmentally friendly solutions to the climate crisis”. Marine mammals, sea turtles, birds and fish could suffer due to noise, habitat displacement and changes in migration patterns, it is said. Even bats, says WUWT?, which are not typically associated with offshore environments, could be affected.
The essay noted that this latest BOEM work may signal a more cautious approach, “perhaps influenced by increasing legal challenges, public backlash, and even emerging scientific research indicating that wind turbines are not as harmless as once believed”.",2024-10-30
Zerohedge,The Changed Meaning Of Nationalism,"Few words in the English language have such migratory meanings as nationalism.
It has changed again in our time.
Today it suggests self-determination of peoples against a growing global hegemon in a range of areas from finance to agriculture to health to the uses of the military and surveillance.
Those who call themselves nationalists affirm the rights of a people in a defined geography to manage their own lives apart from impositions of the neoliberal order, which is deeply weakened as compared with a decade ago.
The book that set this recent change in motion is “The Virtue of Nationalism” by Yoram Hazony, published in 2018.
He argues that nationalism—a wide diversity of governing principles among sovereign nations—is essential for the preservation of freedom, tradition, and cultural meaning. It is not aggressive but merely protective, a barrier to impositions by international agencies, manipulative finance, and a howling secular media. The book became a sensation among conservatives mainly because it broke a taboo of the use of the term.
When I first read it, I was fully prepared to oppose the idea. Having been intellectually shaped in a period of the old consensus, I had presumed that all forms of nationalism have a toxic root as compared with the aspiration of universal human rights and global cultural norms. The experience of pandemic controls, imposed simultaneously the world over, shifted my own views because it was a paradigmatic case of the illiberalism of globalism. No longer did internationalism imply freedom; quite the opposite. This experience forced me to consider what I might have missed.
There were only three nations that resisted compulsory measures such as lockdowns, business closures, population masking, and then shot mandates. They were Sweden, Tanzania, and Nicaragua.
In each case, the reason came down to some form of: that is not how we do that here. Sweden embraced traditional public health principles. Nicaragua said that lockdowns would harm their people. Tanzania rejected lockdowns because something seemed sketchy about the whole scheme.
World media howled in fury at these three nations, hoping for failure from them all, as if to punish any country that dared to go a different way.
All three ended up with similar or better health outcomes without having destroyed their citizens’ lives or trampling on rights and liberties in law. In practical terms, the COVID response wrecked the association many people (including me) held between globalism and freedom.
Globalism today is more likely to be seen as a danger not only to sovereignty but also to the rights of peoples.
The controversy over nationalism began in the late 19th century as multinational empires began to fall apart and new nations were formed out of language groups, ethnicities, and religious groupings in France, Germany, Spain, and Italy. To shore up the status of the remnants of the Holy Roman Empire under ecclesiastical control was the whole point of the calling of the first Vatican Council in 1869. The Pope sought affirmation of his own political infallibility in order to retain the Papal states, but that effort failed (the council only affirmed doctrinal infallibility under rare conditions). A century later, a second Vatican Council made the point and affirmed the rights of religious liberty.
In between those two periods, the meaning of nationalism shifted one way then another. The great theorist of nationalism in the late 19th century was Ernst Renan and his famous speech “What Is a Nation?” (1882). The essay still holds up as a long history of the idea of the nation, and sets forth reasonable parameters concerning central principles of organizing them. He delineates five factors: religion, language, territory, heritage, and ethnicity (race), each of which can be benign or threatening depending on circumstances.
The essay was just what was needed at these times, and ended up having great influence following the Great War, which finally ended shattering the Habsburg and Prussia monarchies and codifying democracy as the preferred political system. Russia’s revolution introduced further trauma as that monarchy too collapsed. Looking back, it is a wonder that the UK monarchy served the period at all but it was only through making every compromise possible with parliamentary control plus the affirmation of religious liberty.
The self-determination of nations became the central slogan of postwar policy, a slogan pushed by the Woodrow Wilson administration as the map of Europe was redrawn in ways that proved unsustainable. Nonetheless, in those years, nationalism was regarded as benign and even necessary for peace, even as elites rallied around new globalist institutions such as the League of Nations as guarantors of the principle of non-aggression. Self-determination generally affirmed the right of a people to govern themselves through plebiscite.
Article 22 of the League of Nations said:
“To those colonies and territories which as a consequence of the late war have ceased to be under the sovereignty of the States which formerly governed them and which are inhabited by peoples not yet able to stand by themselves under the strenuous conditions of the modern world, there should be applied the principle that the well-being and development of such peoples form a sacred trust of civilisation ...”
The controversies over nationalism were hardly finished, however, as democratic institutions in Germany collapsed following economic crisis and political upheaval. What took its place was the aggressive nationalism of the Nazi Party together with the rise of Imperial Japan, leading to a repeat and intensification of the first world war. Out of this experience came the discrediting of the nationalist idea, particularly as it pertained to race and language. The German attempt to cobble together a racial state out of lost territory had plunged the world into the most murderous conflict in the history of humanity.
Following the war, globalism took center stage again with the creation of the International Monetary Fund, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the World Bank, and the United Nations, while multinational alliances dominated much of the world. Nationalism was discredited yet again, and that’s where we stood for the better part of four decades. The crackup of the Soviet Union and its satellites changed the constellation yet again, as break-off states recaptured their historic names and many peoples in the world found new meaning in national identity.
Since 1990, the struggle between globalism and nationalism has been a defining feature of world politics but it took time to hit Western industrialized democracies. With the UK decision to withdraw from the European Union, a new nationalism took hold that was resisted strongly by globalist ambitions.
Was the new nationalism liberal? That’s a complicated question. In places yes, and, in places, no. The drive toward immigration restriction was an inevitable consequence of refugee upheavals all over Europe and the United States. The push to repudiate the World Trade Organization’s ambition for a tariff-free world came after decades of industrial loss. All of this was already taking place when the pandemic controls hit with stunning ferocity, as the World Health Organization imposed experimental methods of virus control—as if governments could somehow conquer the microbial kingdom through force.
The bitter combination of lockdowns, the refugee crisis, and sketchy plans for zero emissions that threaten industrialization itself kicked the nationalist spirit into overdrive, as populist movements have swept the world. The two sides have lined up in predictable ways: those advocating sovereignty and those wanting to preserve what remains of the neoliberal order. That is the essential dynamic of our times.
Where does that leave freedom lovers in their opinions about nationalism? It puts us where we were back in the 1880s with Renan’s outlook: whether and to what extent freedom is best guaranteed by the national principle depends on time and place. Regardless, based on what we are seeing in politics today, there is no stopping the eventual replacement of the neoliberal order with a world of sovereign nations, some liberal and some not.

Zerohedge,CNN Data Analyst Admits Trump On Course To Win Popular Vote,"CNN’s data analyst Harry Enten suggested Friday that Donald Trump could be on course to win the popular vote on November 5th.
That hasn’t happened for a Republican candidate for 20 years.
If it happens, Trump will almost certainly win the electoral college and the election.
Enten noted that a New York Times/Siena College poll was released last week showing Trump tied with Kamala Harris at 48% in the national popular vote.
“Everyone has been talking about this idea that Trump may win in the Electoral College, but Kamala Harris may win the popular vote, but Trump may finally get his great white whale,” Enten stated.
He added that Wall Street Journal and CNBC polls also have Trump ahead of Harris in the popular vote.
There's a real shot Trump may get his great white whale: winning the popular vote. Polls show the race nationally is basically even as Trump runs far ahead of where he polled in 2016 or 2020.

Zerohedge,Leftists Are Terrified About What Will Happen To Them If Trump Wins The Election,"After being indoctrinated for almost a decade to believe that their political opponents are secret Nazis ready to install a fascist regime, it's not surprising that Democrats are freaking out over recent polls indicating a potential Trump win in the November elections. Convinced that America 2024 is going to be a repeat of Germany 1933, ignorant leftists are scrambling to determine whether or not to leave the US or ""start a revolution."" The anxiety is palpable.
The New Yorker recently asserted in an arduous and rambling article spanning centuries of political history and every rhetorical cliche imaginable that, essentially, Trump is likely to win.
The outlet describes Kamala Harris as ""virtuous"" (which is laughable), but they suggest this trait is not respected enough within the American political sphere. They lament the undeniable shift of global politics to the conservative right while refusing to ask why it's happening? They simply default to the old low-IQ and low effort accusations of ""racism"" and ""xenophobia"". The New Yorker argues:
""Even when it is utterly self-destructive - as in Britain, where the xenophobia of Brexit cut the U.K. off from traditional allies while increasing immigration from the Global South—the apprehension that “we” are being flooded by frightening foreigners works its malign magic.
It’s an old but persistent delusion that far-right nationalism is not rooted in the emotional needs of far-right nationalists but arises, instead, from the injustices of neoliberalism...""
The mass immigration from the third world continues in Britain because the same progressive elitists are still in charge despite the Brexit vote. That's why the country is spiraling into a pit of criminality, mass stabbings and a rape epidemic. It's the reason why the British voted for Brexit in the first place.
Brexit and the end of mass immigration is the will of the majority of the people, just as it's the will of the majority of people in many parts if Europe and the US. Yet, leftists who pontificate endlessly about the virtues of democracy dismiss the majority when it suits them. It is this arrogance of the political left that has led directly to the rise of the right wing movement that so utterly terrifies them.
The problem is, leftists never take responsibility because they see this as an expression of weakness, and also because their moral relativism allows them to rationalize any behavior as necessary ""for the greater good."" Their main character syndrome spurs them to believe they are the ultimate good in the world, and if they are the ultimate good then anyone who dares oppose them must be the ultimate evil.
This is why they have a tendency to demonize their political opposition in extreme ways. The New Yorker describes Trump as singularly dangerous, comparing him to mobsters, tyrants and even cancer:
""Trumpism is a cancerous phenomenon. Treated with surgery once, it now threatens to come back in a more aggressive form, subject neither to the radiation of “guardrails” nor to the chemo of “constraints.” It may well rage out of control and kill its host...""
And this kind of rhetoric is exactly why there have been at least two assassination attempts on Trump's life; attempts which the leftist media then shamelessly blamed on Trump. It's also gaslighting, considering the level of tyranny Democrats have engaged in under Biden and the contempt they have displayed for American ideals over the past decade.
The fantasy world of the left is rife with paranoia built on a foundation of emotional sand rather than evidence. They see a new Trump term as the end of everything:
""Having lost the popular vote, as he surely will, he will not speak up to reconcile “all Americans.” He will insist that he won the popular vote, and by a landslide. He will pardon and then celebrate the January 6th insurrectionists, and thereby guarantee the existence of a paramilitary organization that’s capable of committing violence on his behalf without fear of consequences. He will, with an obedient Attorney General, begin prosecuting his political opponents...""
""When he begins to pressure CNN and ABC, and they, with all the vulnerabilities of large corporations, bend to his will, telling themselves that his is now the will of the people, what will we do to fend off the slow degradation of open debate?
Trump will certainly abandon Ukraine to Vladimir Putin and realign this country with dictatorships and against NATO and the democratic alliance of Europe. Above all, the spirit of vengeful reprisal is the totality of his beliefs—very much like the fascists of the twentieth century in being a man and a movement without any positive doctrine except revenge against his imagined enemies...""
The establishment media has imagined quite a reformation of American politics at the hands of Trump, and a lot of it actually sounds pretty good. But as many conservatives have noted, if Trump had authoritarian intentions why didn't he follow through on them during his first term?
Some would argue that he did too little in the face of the city burning antics of BLM, and that he should have pushed harder to stop the legal railroading of the J6 protesters who did little in comparison to the race rioters. Where is this uncompromising zealot that The New Yorker describes? He doesn't exist.
What is this really about? It's about the political left's unspoken fear of a justified reckoning. Deep down, they know they deserve punishment and they know most of the country has no interest in protecting them.
They've spent years instigating civil unrest, they attempted an authoritarian takeover of the country using covid mandates as a foil, they lied incessantly about the threat of a stagflation crisis, they colluded to violate the 1st Amendment as the Biden White House and Big Tech platforms worked together to censor public discourse online, and they have targeted American children with sexualized gender ideology in public schools in an attempt to convert them permanently to the far-left cult. They know what they have done and they know consequences are incoming.
A lot of them are talking about leaving the country should Trump prevail in November, as the New York Times reports. Their reasons vary, but worries of ""fascism"" top the list while others say they want to be able to trans their children (or abort their children) without interference. The reality is that no one will miss these people and the US would be better off without them. They would be doing the country a favor by running away.
Talk of ""revolution"" has been much less pronounced compared to 2016, and this suggests that leftists realize their grift is finally over. They are some of the most hated people on the planet, and for good reason. They spent the last several years burning every bridge and violating every principle that Americans hold dear in the pursuit of ultimate power. They're also losing popularity in Europe, it's not just an American trend.
Trump may or may not pursue an administration of ""vengeance"". It's likely he will not act on most of the scenarios the New Yorker describes. Democrats focus a lot on Trump as if he's the source of their ills.
What they don't understand is that it's not really Trump they should be worried about - It's the millions of people suffering under progressive governments and aggressive woke activism that present the biggest threat.
You can't simply engage in the wanton destruction of western culture, economics, freedom and morality and then pretend like you're a victim when the torches and pitchforks come calling.",2024-10-28

Trump further asserted that Biden and Harris are “perfect vessels because they’ll never give them a hard time. They’ll do whatever they want.”
He continued, “I know many of them. It’s just an amorphous group of people. But they’re smart and they’re vicious, and we have to defeat them. And when I say the ‘enemy from within,’ the other side go crazy.”
Trump added that these people “are doing such harm to our country with their open border policies, record-setting inflation, ‘Green New Scam,’ and everything else they are doing. But we’re not going to let it happen any longer. We’re going to have the biggest victory in the history of our country on November 5 … We’re going to make America great again.”
Elsewhere during his speech, Trump urged that his party is one of real unity and inclusion, while the other side is intent on fomenting hatred and division.

Zerohedge,On That Latest Trump Accuser,"By now it’s part of the playbook. It’s predictable. Expected.
Right before the election, another woman will allege she was sexually assaulted by Donald Trump. And now they’re trying to link Donald Trump to Jeffrey Epstein.
This time the accuser is Stacey Williams, a former Sports Illustrated model who struggled as an actress before turning Democrat operative.
According to an exclusive from The Guardian (more on that below), Williams was groped either “in the late winter or early spring of 1993” after “Epstein suggested during a walk they were on that he and Williams stop by to visit Trump at Trump Tower.”
The Guardian continued:
Moments after they arrived, she alleges, Trump greeted Williams, pulled her toward him and started groping her. She said he put his hands “all over my breasts” as well as her waist and her buttocks. She said she froze because she was “deeply confused” about what was happening. At the same time, she said she believed she saw the two men smiling at each other.
The details of the “sexual assault” were alleged “on a call on Monday [October 21, 2024] organized by a group called Survivors for Kamala, which supports Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris.”
Why did Williams come forward now, and not in 2016 or 2020? She explained that while she was enjoying life as a “private citizen,” she “watched what has happened to women who come out and it is so horrifying and abusive. The thought of doing that, especially as a mother with a child in my house, was just not possible.”
What a “scoop” for Guardian reporters Stephanie Kirchgaessner and Lucy Osborne. Coincidentally – if you believe in such coincidences – Lucy Osborne had the exclusive September 17, 2020 interview with Amy Dorris, who alleged Trump sexually assaulted her at the 1997 US Open.
ZeroHedge already found one big issue with her story: the timeline doesn’t work.
In any event, it seems the Democrats have Lucy Osborne and The Guardian on speed dial to serve as their preferred vehicle for the now-expected “sexual assault” October surprise against Trump. Two alleged victims with similar stories, both Democrats, who are referred to the same reporter before the Presidential election.
Who put these “victims” in contact with Osborne? The best guess is someone affiliated with the Democratic party. As with the Dorris allegation from 2020, other media outlets are starting to run the Stacey Williams allegations. The Guardian just got the ball rolling - yet again. Sexual assault and the link to Epstein. Truly dirty stuff.
And truly unbelievable stuff. Stacey Williams is a longtime Democrat who followed “her life long passion for organizing by working with Clean Tech for Obama.”
Clean Tech for Obama – apparently with the help of Stacey Williams – would raise over $2 million for then-candidate Barack Obama in 2008. And Obama paid them back. Members of this group would go on to join the Obama Administration and influence the distribution of billions of dollars back to their friends, industries, and former companies.
According to a 2012 US House Oversight Report:
Sanjay Wagle has most recently served as Renewable Energy Advisor to DOE under Secretary Chu, where he helped oversee the $11 billion renewable energy program under the Recovery Act. Wagle was an Obama fundraiser for the 2008 presidential campaign, garnering much of his support through his Clean Tech for Obama group. Another venture capitalist that has acquired an influential role at DOE, his industry colleagues believed that Wagle, among others, “would help ensure commercial successes from ‘the steady flow of dollars coming out of DC.’”
We grabbed this picture from Clean Tech for Obama’s Flickr account. It’s from a 2008 fundraiser in San Fransisco. Is that Stacey Williams with the camera? We’re leaning yes but can’t be sure…
“Clean Tech for Obama” evolved into “Clean Tech for Hillary” in 2016 and has since rebranded into The Cleantech Party, a Democratic fundraising group that supports “clean energy and climate action” – and candidates like Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Nancy Pelosi, and other Democrats both in the House and Senate. They’ve partnered with MoveOn.org and other progressive groups, such as SwingLeft and Voices for Progress. Here they are with Nancy Pelosi.
It’s unclear whether Stacey Williams is still involved with that group. We do know that she has been a Democratic donor in the past - and it’s reasonable to assume her affiliation with the Democratic movement has only strengthened in the age of Trump.
She may still be a Democratic donor to this day. If not by financial contributions, then certainly by other means.",2024-10-25
Zerohedge,"Trump ""Violent Rhetoric"" Needs ""Close Monitoring"": Political 'Scientists'","Political scientists determine Trump uses more violent language than Obama by comparing the Republican’s campaign speeches to the Democrat’s White House addresses
President Donald Trump’s “violent rhetoric” is getting worse, according to two political scientists.
University of California Los Angeles doctoral student Nikita Savin and UCLA Professor Daniel Treisman reached their conclusion after analyzing Trump campaign and presidential speeches from 2015 to 2024.
They compared it to President Barack Obama’s White House weekly addresses, even though a campaign speech is different in tone than a formal address. They have also said Hillary Clinton’s violent language is part of her “toughness” as a female politician confronting stereotypes.
“While politicians’ rhetoric does not always predict their actions, Trump’s increasing attachment to violent language and populist themes may offer insight into his future approach, whether as president or in defeat,” they wrote in The Conversation.
This recent article is based on a study published in July and updated this month. “As political scientists, we believe the rise of such rhetoric merits close monitoring because of its potential implications for the broader political landscape,” they wrote.
Over the summer, Treisman made similar warnings. “How Trump’s vocabulary will evolve in the coming months remains to be seen,” Treisman stated in a news release for UCLA. “But the rising temperature of his rhetoric bears watching.
Trump uses a “violent tone” and a “controversial rhetorical style,” the political scientists wrote for The Conversation.
The study relies on a dictionary that Treisman himself developed with another researcher.
His language is close to “authoritarian figures such as Kim Jong Un and Fidel Castro,” the scholars wrote.
The political scientists wrote that Trump uses “aggressive” language, such as promising to “drain the swamp.”
Old Trump used to not be as bad, according to the academics.
They wrote:
Trump’s rhetorical style has undergone significant changes since he launched his first presidential campaign. During his initial run in 2015-2016, his language became more inclusive, with a rise in the use of “we” and “the people” and fewer references to elites and social groups he views negatively (“them”).
Once in office, however, his speeches exhibited a more combative style. His use of violent language surged, and references to “them” became more frequent.
This evolution suggests that Trump’s rhetoric is adaptable, changing in response to political contexts and the audience he aims to engage.
“His increasing use of inflammatory language and swear words after taking office contrasts with the more measured tone he adopted during his 2016 campaign,” they wrote.
Biden was much better, according to the researchers.
“Despite being president during the start of two foreign wars and other ongoing conflicts abroad, Biden’s use of violent vocabulary during both the 2020 and 2024 presidential campaigns was consistently less than Trump’s,” UCLA wrote in its summary.
(Biden’s administration has labeled pro-lifers as an “extremist threat” and warned of a “dark winter” if enough Americans didn’t take the COVID-19 jab).
The scholars also explained away violent imagery from Hillary Clinton.
“Hillary Clinton’s use of violent words in her 2015-2016 campaign slightly exceeded Trump’s relatively moderate level at that time, which could reflect Clinton’s desire to show ‘toughness’ given stereotypes of women leaders being less hawkish,” UCLA stated in its news release, paraphrasing the researchers.",2024-10-29

""This isn't about ""election misinformation."" Obviously. As pretty much everyone knows, I have always acknowledged that Joe Biden won the 2020 election.

Zerohedge,"US Pending Home Sales Exploded Higher In September As Mortgage Rates Fell, But...","Existing home sales slumped (14 year low), but new home sales surged in September, so today's Pending Home Sales data is the tiebreaker for just what a shitshow the US housing market is.
And the winner is... Pending home sales surged 7.4% MoM (+1.9% exp) in September - that is the biggest MoM jump since the COVID lockdowns (June 2020)...
Source: Bloomberg
This giant jump sent the YoY sales print up 2.16% YoY - the first annual gain since Nov 2021.
“Contract signings rose across all regions of the country as buyers took advantage of the combination of lower mortgage rates in late summer and more inventory choices,” NAR Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said in a prepared statement.
“Further gains are expected if the economy continues to add jobs, inventory levels grow and mortgage rates hold steady.”
The total pending home sales index rebounded off record lows...

September saw mortgage rates decline rapidly back below 7.00%, but since then mortgage applications have collapsed as mortgage rates surged back to 7.25% since The Fed cuts rates (that's not supposed to happen)...

Pending sales rose in all regions of the US, increasing 9.8% in the West, 7.1% in the Midwest, 6.7% in the South and 6.5% in the Northeast, NAR data show.
Yun expected slower appreciation in home prices to boost sales over the next couple years.
“After two years of sluggish home sales in 2023 and 2024, existing-home sales are forecasted to rise to 4.47 million in 2025 and more than 5 million in 2026,” Yun said in the release.
“During the next two years, expect a slower rate of growth in home prices that’s roughly in line with the consumer price index because of additional supply reaching the market.”
