Breitbart,"Russia Practices 'Massive Nuclear Strike' in Air, Sea, and Land Launches","“Important to have modern and constantly ready-to-use strategic forces” says Vladimir Putin as Russia rattles its sabre with tests meant to simulate a “massive nuclear strike”.
Russia says it has launched a large scale nuclear exercise, which they claim included flying a land-launched missile over 3,500 miles across the country as well as submarine launches and strategic bombers. The Kremlin has now published video footage of several tests that took place Tuesday, with senior figures making the purpose of the exercises.
Defence Minister Andrei Belousov said the purpose of the launches was practising “a massive nuclear strike by strategic offensive forces in response to a nuclear strike by the enemy”, a clear warning to the West that follows now-years of heightened nuclear talk as Moscow moves to dissuade the U.S. and allies from becoming further involved in its invasion of Ukraine.
Meanwhile Russian President Vladimir Putin said that although he didn’t want to see the country “involved in a new arms race”, nevertheless “we will maintain nuclear forces at the level of necessary sufficiency” and new launch systems and missiles were being developed. These would sharpen Russia’s response times by being faster to launch, and would have new capabilities to evade missile defence screens, it was asserted, even if nuclear weapons are an “extremely exceptional measure”.
Putin further remarked of the exercising of his Strategic Deterrent Forces: “Given the growing geopolitical tensions and the emergence of new external threats and risks, it is important to have modern and constantly ready-to-use strategic forces”.
The launches were concentrated around the extreme north-west, and the extreme east of Russia. In the case of a Yars ICBM launch test, Russian state media asserts it began at the the ‘Plesetsk state test cosmodrome’ near Archangesk on the White Sea, the missile flying across the north of the country some 3,500 miles to the ‘Kura test site in Kamchatka’, the Peninsula in far-eastern Russia on the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk.
The seaborne missile tests Sineva and Bulava ballistic missiles were also, broadly speaking in the enormous geographic terms of the vast Russian federation, in these neighbourhoods. The test of one submarine-launch nuclear missile was from the Barents Sea, the Arctic-circle Atlantic fringe waters north of the White Sea from the nuclear submarine Novomoskovsk. The other was from Russia’s Pacific coast, launched by the Knyaz Oleg nuclear submarine from the Sea of Okhotsk.
Russia also published footage of a series of “Tu-95MS strategic missile carrier” strategic bombers taxiing and taking off.
At the same time, but not officially linked, South Korea has warned that North Korea — now a closer Russian ally as the two collaborate over the Ukraine War — was preparing for nuclear and missile tests of its own.
Moscow has drilled its nuclear forces in recent years, including in 2024, 2023, and 2022, but this week’s latest series of tests comes shortly after the country announced a change in its nuclear doctrine earlier this year. Under the new rules as articulated by President Putin, ” aggression against Russia by any non-nuclear state, but “with the participation or support” of a nuclear one, should be considered a joint attack”. Further, Russia said it could use nuclear weapons even against a non-nuclear threat, if such an attack against Russia or Belarus constituted a “critical threat to sovereignty”.
The West has also exercised its nuclear deterrent this year. NATO held its annual nuclear drills as normal earlier this month with Operation Steadfast Noon, involving eight military bases, 2,000 personnel and 60 aircraft from 13 nations and focussed on the North Sea.",30/10/2024
Breitbart,Nolte: Trump and Republican Senate Challenger Lead in Wisconsin,"The final Insider Advantage poll out of Wisconsin shows both Donald Trump and Republican U.S. Senate challenger Eric Hovde with a slim lead.
The pollster surveyed 800 likely voters on October 26-27 and found former President Trump leading sitting Vice President Kamala Harris 49 to 48 percent.
In the U.S. Senate Race, Hovde leads incumbent Democrat Tammy Baldwin by the exact same level of support and margin: 49 to 48 percent.
In the presidential race, this is yet another poll showing Trump with a tiny but stubborn lead in the Dairy State. In the RealClearPolitics (RCP) average poll of state polls, Trump holds a half-point lead over Harris in Wisconsin. The last six polls out of that state have either been tied or Trump +1.
This slim but persistent Trump lead has been the case in six of the seven swing states for two weeks now. In the RCP average poll of state polls, Trump is +0.4 in Pennsylvania, +0.9 in North Carolina, +2.3 in Georgia, +0.7 in Nevada, +1.3 in Arizona, and down only -0.3 in Michigan.
On the U.S. Senate front, what had been considered a safe Democrat seat is now up for grabs. In the RCP average poll of state polls, Baldwin only leads by +0.7. She has been steadily losing ground for five weeks as Hovde has gained. Thanks to Montana and West Virginia, Republicans are almost certain to capture the U.S. Senate this cycle. Winning Wisconsin would merely be the icing on cake.
Republican U.S. Senate challengers are also closing in on Democrat incumbents Ohio. Both are margin-of-error races now, all within a point, which means anything can happen next week.
andWith a race this close, it’s hard to tell from the non-stop flood of polls what’s happening and who’s truly winning. So, I say, look to the campaigns. Trump is having fun and preparing for rallies in states considered out of reach a month ago — Virginia, New Hampshire, and New Mexico. Meanwhile, Kamala is pulling advertising out of North Carolina and screaming Hitler!
As far as the left-wing media, they have been reduced to pretending to care about a joke about Puerto Rico told by a comedian three days ago. It’s just pathetic, and will be even more pathetic after Puerto Rico Senator Zoraida Buxo endorses Trump in Pennsylvania tonight — a major development that will not only rub egg in the left’s face but step on Kamala’s big Washington DC speech tonight.
I don’t know who will win, but I know Trump believes he’s winning and Kamala and her corporate media allies believe she’s losing.

Breitbart,Sen. Tom Cotton Barnstorms Nation Campaigning for 'Rock Solid Republican Senate Majority',"Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) is putting in long hours and elbow grease to ensure Republicans rip the gavel from Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY).
Cotton will hit his tenth state this week campaigning for Senate Republican candidates, providing a significant shot in the arm for challengers and Republicans in a pivotal campaign year.
Democrats currently enjoy a 51 to 49 seat majority. While Republicans are favored to win the chamber, Cotton wants to run up the score in November to ensure a future Donald Trump administration has the support it needs to advance its legislative agenda and confirm the nominees to carry out its mission.
“President Trump is going to need a rock solid Republican Senate majority to implement his agenda of peace through strength, a secure border, and lower prices,” Cotton told Breitbart News. “It’s a privilege to work alongside our great Republican candidates and incumbents.”
Democrats have all but surrendered West Virginia, where Republican Gov. Jim Justice is a shoe-in to win. That victory would split the Senate 50-50.
In all the battleground states where Republicans are fighting for majority, Cotton has been there.
It starts with the red states where Republicans are battling Democrat incumbents.
Cotton joined Republican Tim Sheehy in Montana in September for a “Save America Rally.” Polls Sheehy is running far ahead of incumbent Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT). And he traveled to Ohio in October to campaign alongside Republican Bernie Moreno, who is leading in polls over another endangered Democrat incumbent, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH).
Victories in those red states would give Senate Republicans the gavel, but Cotton and the NRSC aren’t satisfied. Cotton has barnstormed swing states on behalf of candidates too as Republicans seek to run up the score.
Cotton campaigned in Michigan with former Republican Rep. Mike Rogers and in Nevada with Republican candidate Sam Brown in September. In October, Cotton campaigned with Republican Dave McCormick in Pennsylvania – the most watched state in the run-up to Election Day, as well as in Wisconsin, where Republican Eric Hovde has shocked Democrats who had taken the seat for granted.
Cotton isn’t finished. Tuesday he will visit Arizona to campaign with Republican Kari Lake.
His work in campaigns across the country stands out.
“Sen. Cotton has been a great ally to NRSC as we fight to take back the Senate majority from Chuck Schumer and the radical Democrats,” NRSC Communications Director Mike Berg told Breitbart. “NRSC is grateful that Sen. Cotton is barnstorming competitive races on behalf of our candidates in toss-up races.”
But Cotton isn’t taking Republican incumbents’ victories for granted either.
He campaigned in Florida with Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) in late October as Scott fends off a challenge from former Democrat Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell.
And Cotton will travel to Texas Wednesday with his colleague Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and to Nebraska Friday to campaign with Sen. Deb Fischer (R-NE).
Cruz is battling liberal Democrat Rep. Colin Allred (D-TX), a former NFL player who has come under fire recently for his record supporting men in women’s sports. Fischer is running against an independent candidate tied to Democrats – who are suspiciously not running a candidate of their own in the race.
Both Cruz and Fischer lead the polls in the waning days of the campaign, but Cotton will be there to help them across the finish line.

Cotton’s Nebraska visit Friday will mark at least his tenth in-person campaign visit on behalf of Republican Senate candidates – a remarkable showcase of energy and determination from a legislative body often depicted as lacking both.
Cotton is running for Senate Republican Conference Chair next Congress, the third-ranking GOP leadership slot.

Breitbart,U.S. Marines Successfully Test Israel's Iron Dome System,"The U.S. Marines have successfully tested a modified version of Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system, which was invented in Israel and developed with funding from the United States.
The Israeli Ministry of Defense said Tuesday:
The system is based on an American radar and command-and-control center, combined with the Iron Dome (Tamir) interceptor and a mobile launcher developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Raytheon as a prime contractor.
During the training, the Marines fully operated the system, leading to the successful interception of targets. Additionally, the continuous launch capability of the Iron Dome interceptors from a mobile launcher, developed specifically for the Marines, was tested.
The training followed the completion of an entire training program and a series of tests as part of the development and acquisition plan led by the Marines to assess a new prototype system for medium-range intercept capability (MRIC).
The successful training demonstrated the forces’ proficiency in fully operating the system, the performance of the mobile launcher developed for the Marines, and the capabilities of the Iron Dome interceptor in relevant and challenging interception scenarios.
The Tamir interceptor can intercept cruise missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and various rockets, artillery shells, and mortars. The interceptor is developed by Rafael, which partnered with Raytheon as prime contractor in adapting it to the Marine Corps’s configuration and in training support.
The success of the live-fire exercise marks a significant milestone toward the operational deployment of the first prototype battery for the Marines.
The Iron Dome is often touted as an example of how U.S. aid to Israel helps America as well by funding advanced research and development by Israeli scientists and engineers that can then be used to strengthen U.S. forces.

Breitbart,"Seoul, Japan Warn North Korea Preparing Nuclear Test Site -- Possibly in Time for U.S. Election","The South Korean Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) reportedly told lawmakers on Wednesday that it had reason to believe communist North Korea has refurbished the Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site, unused since 2017, and could potentially detonate a nuclear weapon in time for the U.S. presidential election.
Separately, a Japanese government spokesman said on Wednesday that Tokyo is considering the possibility that the communist Kim regime conducts a nuclear test in the near future, citing “relevant data.”
North Korea has illegally tested its nuclear weapons seven times in its history, the majority of them during the tenure of former American President Barack Obama. The last test occurred in 2017, fueling rumors that the bombs had damaged Punggye-ri beyond repair. In 2018, North Korea staged the “dismantling” of the site with a small explosion outside of its entrance, charging journalists $10,000 to attend the event. Pyongyang also limited its belligerent rhetoric at the time in response to the successful policies of former President Donald Trump.
Dictator Kim Jong-un has increased his talk of violence since current President Joe Biden took power. In January 2023, Kim ordered an “exponential increase” in the number of nuclear weapons his officials should manufacture to prepare to potential active war with South Korea and America. He repeated that call in September and reportedly tested the readiness of nuclear-capable missiles last week.
According to South Korean lawmakers who attended a closed-door DIA briefing, Seoul believes that Kim successfully completed reparations of the Punggye-ri site.
“The officials suggested the North could launch an ICBM to verify its atmospheric reentry technology, at a timing targeting the US presidential election in November,” the Japanese news network NHK reported. “The officials also said preparations inside the Punggye-ri nuclear test site in the northeast of the country are almost complete.”
NHK added that officials “have not ruled out North Korea going ahead with its seventh nuclear test around the time of the US presidential election.”
The South Korean news agency Yonhap quoted lawmaker Reps. Lee Seong-kweun and Park Sun-won, who shared that the DIA said “preparations are nearly complete for an ICBM-class long-range missile, including a space launch vehicle.” They also shared the possibility of a nuclear test or intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test timed to coincide with the American election.
In Japan, government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters that the government there also has reason to believe that North Korea “may undertake further provocative actions, such as launching various missiles, a satellite, or conducting a nuclear test.” The Japanese government offered less information than what was reported out of Seoul; the spokesman said the government was analyzing “relevant data” to lead to that conclusion.
During his public appearance last week to inspect nuclear weapons facilities, Kim suggested that North Korea needs to have its nuclear weapons ready to fire as a result of alleged threats from the United States.
“As I have stressed on several occasions recently, the U.S. strategic nuclear means pose an ever-increasing threat to the security environment of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,” North Korean state media quoted Kim as saying, “and the prospective threats urgently demand that the DPRK [North Korea] bolster up its war deterrent definitely and take a thoroughgoing and strict counteraction posture of its nuclear forces, he said.”
Kim’s visit reportedly involved ensuring the “readiness for action of the strategic deterrent [nuclear weapons] directly related with the security of the country, including the functions and capabilities of the elements of launch-related facilities.”
The potential of a North Korean nuclear test also surfaces as reports indicate that Pyongyang is deploying thousands of troops to Russia to aid in the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Kim signed a mutual defense agreement with Russian strongman Vladimir Putin in June whose terms remain unknown but many observers feared could require North Korea to aid the Russian war effort. South Korea’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) suggested this week that North Korea has already deployed at least 3,000 soldiers to Ukraine. South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday, offering intelligence assistance but not committing to direct military interference in the war.
“We must thoroughly assess all possibilities and prepare countermeasures. I urge everyone to engage in risk management with a heightened sense of vigilance,” Yoon said during a cabinet meeting on Tuesday.
Yoon, a conservative, has suggested that Seoul could potentially develop its own nuclear weapons program to protect itself from a North Korean attack.
“The Republic of Korea could deploy tactical nuclear weapons or possess its own nukes,” Yoon said in January 2023, shortly after Kim Jong-un vowed to “exponentially increase” the number of nuclear warheads at his disposal. The comment prompted panic in Washington, where Biden sent a U.S. nuclear submarine to South Korea’s port city of Busan to assure Yoon that he was committed to protecting Seoul.
Multiple polls in the past decade indicate that the idea of developing an independent nuclear arsenal is popular among South Koreans.
“When asked to choose between a domestic nuclear weapons program and the stationing of U.S. nuclear weapons in South Korea, similar to that of the past, the public overwhelmingly preferred an independent arsenal,” the Washington Post detailed in 2022, “underscoring the desire among South Koreans for greater autonomy over how and when nuclear weapons would be deployed on their behalf.”",30/10/2024
Breitbart,Report: 'Free Gaza' on Devices That Set Fire to Ballot Drop Boxes in Washington State,"“Free Gaza” was found marked on incendiary devices used to burn ballot drop boxes in Washington state earlier this week, according to news reports, suggesting for the first time that the arson may have had a political motive.
As Breitbart News reported, hundreds of ballots cast by voters were destroyed in the attack on the ballot drop boxes:
Hundreds of ballots in Washington state were potentially damaged after authorities reported that a Vancouver ballot drop box was burned in a Monday morning arson.
…
Hundreds of ballots were inside the box at the time of the fire, though it is not immediately clear how many may have been damaged, Clark County Auditor Greg Kimsey said.
…
Investigators told the local station that the incident is believed to be connected to another drop box arson incident in Portland, Oregon.
ABC News reported Tuesday that “Free Gaza” markings had been found on incendiary devices linked to the fires:
Ballot boxes in Oregon and Washington were set on fire with incendiary devices early Monday in what authorities believe are connected incidents, police said.
The devices used in the arson incidents carried markings with the expression “Free Gaza,” two sources familiar with the ongoing investigation told ABC News.
…
The sources said the incendiary device used in the first arson, back on Oct. 8, had “Free Gaza” and “Free Palestine” on it. The two subsequent devices, set off in the early hours of Monday morning in Vancouver, Washington and nearby Portland, Oregon, carried the slogan “Free Gaza.”
It is unclear whether the devices were meant to convey that message, or to distract from the true motive in the fires.

Breitbart,Paul Pelosi Attacker David DePape Receives Life in Prison,"The man who attacked former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s (D-CA) husband, Paul Pelosi, was sentenced to life in prison on Tuesday, without the possibility of parole.
Prior to the life sentence being issued in the state case, DePape’s attorneys reportedly requested a new trial, according to ABC News. This request was denied by San Francisco County Judge Harry Dorfman.
In May, DePape was sentenced to 30 years in prison in a federal case for having attacked Paul with a hammer at the Pelosi residence in California. DePape was also found guilty of attempting to kidnap Nancy, who was not home at the time DePape showed up.
LISTEN: Paul Pelosi’s 911 Call
San Francisco Police DepartmentThe Pelosi family issued a statement in response to DePape’s “sentence of life without parole,” noting that it gives their “Pop some measure of legal justice” and hopefully sends a “message to others that political violence against elected officials or their family members” is not okay:
Since the violent break-in and shout of “where’s Nancy?” two years ago, not a day goes by that we do not think of this devastating assault, its trauma — or the possibility of future attacks. Today’s sentence of life without parole gives our Pop some measure of legal justice and, we hope, a message to others that political violence against elected officials or their family members will not be tolerated, minimized or condoned. We must each do our part to build a peaceful democracy.
DePape, who is a former Canadian nudist activist, arrived at the Pelosi home in October 2020 with the intention of talking to Nancy about Russian interference that took place in the 2016 presidential election.
The Guardian reported in November 2023, DePape had testified that along with speaking with Nancy about the Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, he had “planned to” dress up in an “inflatable unicorn costume and upload his interrogation of her online.”
During his testimony before a federal jury, DePape expressed that he was “sorry” he had hurt Paul and added that “he was never” his target.
As Breitbart News’s Nick Gilbertson previously reported, body camera footage showed the front door of Nancy and Paul Pelosi’s home opening, and a police officer can be heard saying, “Hi, how are you doing?” as DePape and Paul — who appears to be wearing a button-down shirt and underwear, are standing inside.
Police officers instructed DePape to “drop the hammer,” and both men can be seen with one hand on the hammer. DePape responds with, “Nope,” before he can be seen wrestling the hammer out of Paul’s hand and swinging toward him.
WATCH: Paul Pelosi Attack Footage
In a letter to Judge Dorfman, Paul wrote that “it took many months” after the attack to “reclaim” his home and “well-being”:
It took many months to reclaim my home and well-being. I still keep away from media and video of the attack for my own peace of mind. Even after testifying in federal and state criminal trials, I do not read the coveragae or willingly revisit the events. My family and friends were traumatized by the attack — and many political spouses with whom I have grown close during my wife’s service in Congress have been both sympathetic to me and scared for their own safety. To protect my healing, I still do not address the assault with my wife or anyone else. Nor do I discuss the trauma experienced by my wife who remains under 24-hour security two years later even though she is no longer serving as Speaker of the House. Even now, we do not answer our landline phone or our front door due to ongoing threats. We cannot fully remove the stain on the floor in the front entryway where I bled. As recently as this summer, we had to improve security measures at our home due to ongoing threats.
CNN reported that in the aftermath of the attack, Paul was left with a skull fracture and sustained other injuries to his arms. Paul underwent surgery for his skull fracture and other injuries, a spokesman for Nancy confirmed to the outlet.",29/10/2024
Breitbart,Harris Denies Lack of Support Among Black Men: 'Brothers Aren't Saying That',"Vice President Kamala Harris did not seem to recognize that her support among black men has sunk to a historic low.
Nationwide polling shows Harris is running about 12-15 percent below President Joe Biden’s black voter support in 2020.
WATCH — CNN’s Enten: Kamala Harris Is “Very, Very Weak” with Black Men and Women:
Only 80 percent of black men support Harris, a Washington Post/Ipsos poll recently revealed, while an NAACP poll found one in four under the age of 50 showed support for former President Donald Trump.
Black voters appear to be trending toward leaving the Democrat party. From 2018 to 2022, the Republican share of the black vote jumped from nine percent to 13 percent.
“What is your strong push to any black man right now that feels like you’re not speaking directly to them and about the things that they should care about for their families and for themselves,” Lauren Larosa asked Harris on the Breakfast Club.
“The brothers aren’t saying that,” Harris replied
Trump’s increased support among the black community has rung the alarm bells for the Harris campaign. It recently published an “Agenda for Black Men.” That agenda included legalizing marijuana, a new loan program, preferred banking options for entrepreneurs, preferred apprenticeship and mentorship programs, and preferred expanded health screenings.
“Marijuana? That’s just disrespectful,” Wainwright said. “We’re fathers. We live in these communities. We want to get kids off that stuff.”
WATCH — Clyburn: “Yes I Am Concerned” About Black Men Voting for Trump:
A part of Trump’s campaign message to black voters is the justice system’s select weaponization against him. Citing legal discrimination against the black community historically, Trump believes some black voters might relate to Biden’s weaponization of justice against him.
“A lot of people said that’s why the Black people like me, because they have been hurt so badly and discriminated against, and they actually viewed me as I’m being discriminated against,” Trump told a black audience in South Carolina in October.

Breitbart,Tabatabai Reassigned After Iran Concerns,"Ariane Tabatabai, an official who has drawn public scrutiny due to her apparent links to the Iranian regime, has reportedly been reassigned following months of inquiries and complaints by Republican members of Congress.
As Breitbart News reported in June:
Several lawmakers who previously demanded the Biden administration revoke the security clearance of a high-level State Department appointee and conduct an investigation into her troubling ties to the hardline anti-American Iranian regime refused to back down, resolving to continue to “ring the bell” and demand real answers and accountability, after the Biden administration rebutted and stonewalled their demands while refusing to provide a serious explanation.
…
In the letter, which is addressed to President Biden and provided in full to Breitbart News, the lawmakers expressed “serious concerns” over the Biden administration’s choosing to hire Ariane Tabatabai as a senior advisor to the Office of the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security.
“Tabatabai, in multiple public appearances, has echoed Iranian regime talking points and has made excuses for Iran’s oppressive government,” it continued. “She has downplayed the significance of dissatisfaction that Iranians have with their government, stating that protesting is a ‘feature in the Islamic Republic’ and is an ‘inherent part of Iranian public life.’”
The letter also blasts Tabatabai for having argued that “the U.S. must acknowledge Iran’s presence in Syria and accept Iran’s support of militants” as well as having claimed that Iran has “affirmed its place as a significant regional force.”
Describing Iran as “one of American’s greatest adversaries” that poses a “significant threat” to the region and U.S. allies there, the letter goes on to blast Iran for its radical ideology and policies.
…
After demonstrating Iran’s clear determination to obtain nuclear weapons for non-peaceful purposes, the letter notes Tabatabai’s father’s role as a senior faculty member at the state-controlled University of Tehran as well as his alleged role in President Hassan Rouhani’s “inner circle.”
In addition, the letter describes Tabatabai’s father’s public appearances with President Rouhani as well as being photographed with the grandson of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Islamic Republic’s founder and leader of the 1979 revolution.
The Biden-Harris administration had defended Tabatabai’s role and assured Congress that she had passed background checks.
In recent weeks, however, her name emerged in unconfirmed reports that the U.S. had been leaking information about Israel’s plans to attack Iran. It was never confirmed that there was a leak, nor that Tabatabai was the supposed leaker, but her documented support for the Iranian regime made her a target.
Ynet, an Israeli news website, reported Tuesday that the Biden-Harris administration chose to “move her to a position overseeing education and training within the Defense Secretary’s office.”
Ynet added:
Tabatabai served as the head of the Office of Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict, a role that gave her unique access to high-level classified intelligence and information on nearly all U.S. covert operations. Her new position, by contrast, provides significantly limited access to intelligence and classified operational plans.
…Tabatabai, an American of Iranian descent, previously held access to highly classified information. She formerly worked with Robert Malley, President Joe Biden’s ex-special envoy for Iran, who was dismissed about a year ago over improper connections with the Islamic Republic.
There are several people with radical past associations currently serving in key positions in the Biden-Harris administration. Maher Bitar, the director of intelligence for the National Security Council in the White House, was an activist in the radical Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), which lately has been responsible for anti-Israel, antisemitic, and sometimes violent “encampments” on university campuses all across the United States.

Breitbart,Kamala Deploys Hollywood Elite Jennifer Lopez to Las Vegas as Trump Expands Swing State Lead,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Kamala Harris has Bruce Springsteen, Taylor Swift and Beyoncé. Donald Trump has Kid Rock, Waka Flocka Flame and Hulk Hogan.
As the 2024 campaign whirls into its final week, Democrats are noticeably leaning on their star power advantage, calling on a diverse range of celebrities to endorse Harris, invigorate audiences and, they hope, spur people to the ballot box.
Democrats have long enjoyed a celebrity advantage and used it to close out presidential campaigns when attention and energy are critical. That upper hand has grown during Trump’s rise, a period that saw scores of celebrities, even apolitical stars, break their silence and speak out against the Republican leader. The advantage often means raucous, fiery events in the closing days of a race, but history — namely Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign — highlights how the energy at those events can sometimes paper over broader issues with a candidate.
Weeks before the election on Oct. 20, Harris got an assist from music legend Stevie Wonder in Jonesboro, Georgia, who rallied churchgoers with a rendition of Bob Marley’s “Redemption Song.” Days later in Atlanta, Harris and former President Barack Obama headlined a rally that featured a performance by Springsteen and speeches from famed filmmaker Spike Lee and actor Samuel L. Jackson. The campaign followed that up a day later with a rally in Texas featuring a performance by Willie Nelson and a speech from Beyonce.
Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris’ running mate, has also benefited from the celebrity push. Singer-songwriter James Taylor performed at events with the governor in North Carolina earlier in the month. And Walz, along with Harris, spoke at an event in Michigan on Monday that included a five-song set from singer-songwriter Maggie Rogers.
“I come for Harris,” said Ashley Oberheide, a neighborhood resident who attended the outdoor Harris rally held in Ann Arbor’s Burns Park. “I love that musical acts are getting behind her, but I am always here for Harris.” She called Rogers an “added bonus.”
Audrey Hudson, a University of Michigan nursing student who voted for the first time days before the rally, described her attendance as “doing a civic duty combined with seeing an artist I love.”
“I’m here to support Kamala and Walz as well but Maggie Rogers, I have loved her music since I was in middle school. She’s had a huge impact on me,” said Hudson, who added that she thinks artists like Rogers are more relatable to young voters and can impact how they vote.
Ann Arbor resident Rachel Lieberman, 29, shared that the rally in her hometown was her third Harris event and that Rogers was a “cherry on top” she believes will help drive out the youth vote.
“I think it’s all part of getting the younger generations mobilized to vote,” Lieberman said.
Harris and Democrats aren’t just leaning on performances at events, either. After Tony Hinchcliffe, a comedian who spoke at Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden on Sunday, called Puerto Rico “a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean,” the Democrat’s campaign received public support from rapper Bad Bunny, Jennifer Lopez and artist Ricky Martin, three of the best known Puerto Rican celebrities. The three have over 300 million followers combined on different social media platforms.
Many of the events are part of Harris’ “When We Vote We Win” concert series that aims to spur supporters to vote early in key battlegrounds. And she is expected to have more high-profile endorsers in the coming days.
When she campaigns in Wisconsin on Wednesday, her rally in Madison will feature performances from Gracie Abrams, Mumford & Sons, Remi Wolf and The National’s Matt Berninger and Aaron Dessner. On Thursday, her rally in Arizona will have Los Tigres del Norte, a famed norteño band originally from Sinaloa, Mexico. And finally, on Friday, Harris will headline a rally in Las Vegas featuring Maná, a Mexican pop rock band originally from Guadalajara, Mexico, and a speech from Lopez.
The 2020 campaign was a celebrity outlier. Because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, large campaign events were uncommon, especially on the Democratic side. Celebrities appeared in social media videos for then-former Vice President Joe Biden, who went on to defeat Trump.
Trump does enjoy the support of celebrities with a deep appeal to his core base of voters, like singer Lee Greenwood, television personality Dr. Phil McGraw and former football stars like Brett Favre, Antonio Brown and Le’Veon Bell. Country singer Jason Aldean recently spoke at a Trump rally in Georgia and Nick Bosa, a star defensive lineman for the San Francisco 49ers, recently jumped into a teammate’s post-game interview to show a MAGA hat.
But the Republican candidate largely doesn’t have an answer for Harris’ celebrity-infused events. Trump, whose career has turned him into a celebrity, often provides the star power at his events. And when a celebrity like Hinchcliffe makes headlines at a Trump event, it can cause problems for the Republican campaign.
The focus on celebrity events is typified by raucous events in arenas and often leaves Democrats upbeat and hopeful about their chances. But the strategy can also paint over issues: When crowds are juiced by celebrities and musical performances, problems with a candidate’s message or hold on an important base of voters can be obscured, a trend that was highlighted by former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s failed 2016 run.
The final week of Clinton’s campaign eight years ago was a veritable red carpet of musical icons and celebrities. Her final rally as a candidate, a feverish event in North Carolina, was headlined by Jon Bon Jovi and Lady Gaga. Her final event with former President Barack Obama culminated in a performance by Springsteen on Independence Mall in Philadelphia. She capped her campaign in Ohio with a performance from Jay Z and Beyonce in Cleveland. And just days earlier she filled Bayfront Park Amphitheater in downtown Miami, Florida with an eye-popping performance by Lopez.
“We just heard Jennifer perform ‘Let’s Get Loud.’ Well, I say, ‘Let’s Get Loud’ at the voting booth. You can vote early. Don’t wait another day to vote, ” Clinton exclaimed.
The Clinton campaign left each respective battleground state invigorated that the energy they felt at the event could carry them to victory.
Days later, Clinton lost North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida, and then-businessman Trump was elected president.",30/10/2024
Breitbart,Walz: Being in the Room for Afghanistan Withdrawal Will Help Harris if She's President,"During an interview with Columbus, GA CBS affiliate WRBL on Tuesday, 2024 Democratic vice presidential candidate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) stated that being in the room for the Afghanistan withdrawal will help his running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris if she becomes president.
WRBL’s Chuck Williams asked, [relevant exchange begins around 4:10] “Vice President Harris has been a — has been in the room for key national security issues, namely the Afghanistan withdrawal, the Iraq — the Israeli war and Ukraine and Russia. How do — are you confident that those experiences will help her as she — if she becomes commander-in-chief?”
Walz answered, “I do. And not only am I confident, I think the folks who were there and the folks who were with Donald Trump have made it clear, whether it’s John Kelly or Gen. Milley, folks that are saying, look, Donald Trump doesn’t have the capacity to do this, and I think these are really intractable issues, but they can be solved if we have United States leadership building a coalition around this. So, I think the Vice President’s been in the room with 150 world leaders, she has the temperament to be able to build this, and she has made it clear, we’re going to stand with our allies and we’re going to stand against totalitarianism. So, yes, I do believe she has it and I think who were closest to both Donald Trump and the Vice President — 700 national security professionals — signed on to support the Vice President.”

Breitbart,"Harris Co-Chair: She's Different from Biden, He Didn't Have Problem of 'Lowering Costs'","On Tuesday’s broadcast of CNN’s “Laura Coates Live,” Harris Campaign Co-Chair Mitch Landrieu stated that 2024 Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris differentiated herself from President Joe Biden “by saying, listen, I love the President, we did great work together, but I have different problems than he had, the most important of which is lowering costs for the American people. And I think she addressed it really very forthrightly and better tonight than she has in the past.”
Host Laura Coates asked, “On that point of her trying to distinguish herself from Biden, was there a key moment in that speech that you think voters will connect to to suggest, yes, she will be different?”
Landrieu answered, “Well, first of all, it was an incredible night. I was there, and there were 70,000 people there. … We were going to go to Madison Square Garden, but we couldn’t fit. So, we had to go there. It was just a huge turnout and it was exuberant and it was joyful and the environment in which she gave the speech was really uplifting and hopeful, which is what the speech was. It was a fairly detailed speech. She laid out, in clear detail, what the risks are of re-electing Donald Trump. She talked about the fact that, behind her, was the Resolute Desk, and, in seven days the people are going to decide whether she’s going to be sitting there or Donald Trump’s going to be sitting there and she reminded the public that Donald Trump has already talked about, out of his own mouth, spending his time talking about his enemies list, and the fact that she had a to-do list. And then she’s talked about how she is going to build an opportunity economy for all of us, not just some of us, and distinguished herself from Joe Biden by saying, listen, I love the President, we did great work together, but I have different problems than he had, the most important of which is lowering costs for the American people. And I think she addressed it really very forthrightly and better tonight than she has in the past.”

Breitbart,Cops: Man Broke Trump Tower Windows After Seeing Former President,"A 21-year-old Chicago man told police that whenever he sees former President Donald Trump it causes him to be violent.
The suspect, Andrew Brierly, is accused of breaking windows at the Trump International Hotel & Tower during mental health episodes he suffered this year, CWB Chicago reported on Tuesday, noting the damage due to the incidents reached $145,000.
An image shows the suspect in the case:
On October 16, he allegedly threw rocks, breaking six windows at the location on North Wabash. A security officer at the complex recognized the suspect, telling law enforcement he did the same thing on May 17, the CWB Chicago article said, citing a police report.
Brierly was later arrested at his home.
“A Chicago police supervisor noted in the report that Brierly told officers that seeing Trump while having an episode ‘makes him do it.’ Judge Deidre Dyer released Brierly to await trial,” the article read.
Social media users commented on the CWB Chicago report, one person writing, “As a Trump supporter in Chicago I see Harris signs everywhere. Do I smash shit and act like a little bitch? No. I think ‘what an idiot’ shake my head and live my best life.”
“Toxic Trump Derangement Syndrome,” another user commented.
Authorities have charged Brierly with two counts of criminal damage between $10,000 and $100,000.
In 2023, the Chicago location was put on lockdown when a woman with a rifle walked into the building, Breitbart News reported at the time, noting SWAT officers responded to the scene:
The SWAT team reported to an apartment on the 27th floor, where the armed woman “allegedly went after [sic]” claiming she was “tired of being abused by her husband,” according to the Chicago Sun-Times.
The woman forced the SWAT team into a standoff that reportedly lasted three hours.
Officers also partially blocked off streets surrounding the Trump International Hotel and Tower. Authorities said the incident was “domestic-related,” and there was no threat to the public.
According to the Trump International Hotel & Tower website for its Chicago location, “The shimmering glass building soars 92 stories above Michigan Avenue and the Chicago River, offering breathtaking views of the city and Lake Michigan.”
“In September 2008, Trump International Hotel & Tower, Chicago became the tallest completed residential building in the world,” the site reads.",29/10/2024

Breitbart,Watch — Biden Trashes Trump Voters: ‘The Only Garbage I See Floating Out There Is His Supporters’,"President Joe Biden overshadowed his vice president’s closing argument just one week before the election by trashing American voters and calling Trump supporters “garbage.”
Vice President Kamala Harris delivered her closing argument in front of the White House on Tuesday night, but soon-to-be former President Joe Biden said ahead of the big event that Trump supporters are “garbage.” Per the Associated Press:
Biden told reporters Tuesday that he will not attend Harris’ speech because the event is “for her,” but he planned to watch it on television. Ahead of Harris’ remarks, Biden is reacted to a comic calling Puerto Rico garbage at a Trump rally last weekend by saying, “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.”
According to NBC reporter Gabe Gutierrez, Biden said in the full quote: “Donald Trump has no character. He doesn’t give a damn about the Latino community…just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage?…The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.”
The president was referring to statements made by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe during former President Donald Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden in which he referred to the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, home to American citizens, as a “floating island of garbage.”
After the president’s remarks went public, the White House attempted to walk the statement back by saying he was only referring to Hinchcliffe.
JD Vance, running mate for former President Trump, condemned the remarks as an attack on half the country.
“This is disgusting. Kamala Harris and her boss Joe Biden are attacking half of the country. There’s no excuse for this. I hope Americans reject it,” said JD Vance.
Other Trump surrogates and supporters condemned the remarks:",29/10/2024
Breitbart,Election Interference: Google Buries Joe Rogan's Trump Interview on YouTube Search,"Joe Rogan’s three-hour interview with former President Donald Trump on Friday’s episode of The Joe Rogan Experience was buried in the search results on Google’s YouTube on Monday, after having surpassed 34 million views within less than 72 hours of being posted.
On Monday night, Breitbart News searched “Rogan Trump” in the YouTube search bar, which returned results for videos about the podcast episode and other similar political videos — but not the actual interview itself. Similar searches, including the full names of both Rogan and the former president had similar results.
In our test, Breitbart News scrolled down the YouTube page to review more than 50 videos and did not successfully find Rogan’s interview with Trump on Friday’s episode of The Joe Rogan Experience.
YouTube announced in a Monday evening X post that the video-streaming platform was aware that Rogan’s original interview with Trump “didn’t appear prominently,” adding that the company was working to “resolve” the issue.
“[With respect to] Joe Rogan/Pres. Trump interview and [YouTube] search results: Since airing Friday, the interview has generated over 34 million views on YouTube and counting, making it Joe Rogan’s most viewed episode of the year,” YouTube said.
“For some searches on Monday the original 3-hour interview didn’t appear prominently,” the video platform continued. “Short excerpts uploaded by the Joe Rogan channel appeared, but we know it was frustrating for users looking to find the full video.”
“We’ve worked to resolve this and viewers will begin seeing the full podcast in more YouTube search results soon,” YouTube added.
Social media users aired their frustration with Google’s video-streaming platform in the comment section of Rogan’s YouTube video featuring his three-hour interview with Trump.
“Dear YouTube… STOP HIDING THIS,” one YouTube user demanded.
“Shame on YouTube for hiding this from the search results,” another echoed.
“STOP HIDING THIS INTERVIEW!” a third exclaimed.
“YOUTUBE IS TRYING TO HIDE THIS PODCAST,” another proclaimed.
“33.7 million views, and you can’t search this. The machine is getting worried!” another declared.
“The fact that YouTube has a video with 33mil views in 2 days and doesn’t show it on the first page when I search for it — [YouTube] coping badly,” another stated.
“Damn, YouTube didn’t want me to find this,” another surmised.
“I typed in YouTube Search “Joe Rogan Trump” and this video never popped up,” another explained, before accusing YouTube of “throttling.”
“This was extremely more difficult to find than it should have been,” another echoed.
“Why is YouTube hiding this from trending when it is the #1 most watched video?” another inquired.
Another simply stated, “Shame on Google for censorship,” while another wrote, “Looks like YouTube doesn’t want us to see this anymore.”
“How is this not #1 trending?” another asked, adding, “33 million in 2 days is crazy!”
“Imagine how many more views there would be if YouTube actually listed the video,” another commented.
“YouTube still hiding this from the search results. I had to go to Joe Rogan’s page and click ‘videos’ just to find it,” another YouTube user wrote just before 9:00 p.m. EST on Monday.
As of 9:20 p.m. EST on Monday, searching “Rogan Trump” still does not return results for Rogan’s original interview with Trump within the first 50 videos that appear on the platform, but searching “Joe Rogan Trump” does — according to a search test by Breitbart News.
At the time of publishing, Rogan’s original YouTube video has garnered more than 35.8 million views.
Joe Rogan responded to Google’s search chicanery by posting the entire episode on Elon Musk’s X platform.

Breitbart,"Dem Gov. Shapiro on Biden 'Garbage' Remark: I Wouldn't Say That, Shouldn't Attack Voters","On Tuesday’s broadcast of CNN’s “The Source,” Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) reacted to President Joe Biden’s comments about supporters of 2024 Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump by saying that Biden’s words are “certainly not words that I would choose, and I think it’s important that we remain focused on the contrast between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump and not attacking supporters of either candidate.”
Shapiro said that he had not heard the comments until that very moment, “So, I’m kind of giving you my fresh reaction to it. I would never insult the good people of Pennsylvania or any Americans, even if they chose to support a candidate that I didn’t support. I think the real issue here is Donald Trump and his inability to simply say comments like that are wrong, to simply stand up for his fellow Americans. He is incapable of doing that.”
Host Kaitlan Collins then asked Shapiro if he thinks Biden should clarify his remarks.
Shapiro responded, “Well, I think President Biden’ll decide what he wants to say. It’s certainly not words that I would choose, and I think it’s important that we remain focused on the contrast between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump and not attacking supporters of either candidate.”

Breitbart,Exclusive: Ex-Dem Operative Reveals ‘Out of Touch’ Donors Took Over Party,"Big donors have “taken over” the Democrat party, which has sidelined its democratic processes and become completely “out of touch” with the needs of the working class, “which they have now lost,” according to newly former Democrat campaign operative and fundraiser Evan Barker.
Barker’s disillusionment deepened during the recent DNC convention, which she described as a “giant corporate infomercial” where she witnessed big-money influence overshadowing the party’s democratic processes with the “coronation” of Kamala Harris at the behest of elite donors.
In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News, Barker described how her lifelong loyalty to the Democratic Party shifted to growing disenchantment and eventual regret for her involvement with Soros-funded campaigns, citing the 2024 DNC convention as a turning point.
After leaving the Democrat gathering, she posted a video expressing her disillusionment with the Party’s shift away from working-class values, saying she “wanted nothing to do with it at that point.” The clip went viral overnight, amassing millions of views, as she insisted she “must have struck a nerve.”
Early Political Involvement
Barker began her career at 17, motivated by a working-class background and firsthand experience with healthcare struggles. Starting as an alternate delegate for Hillary Clinton, she switched to supporting Barack Obama in the 2008 primary. After stints organizing for Democrats, including Clinton’s 2016 campaign which she found “inauthentic,” she became a top fundraiser for the Party and worked nationally for progressive candidates.
“All in all, I probably raised at least $50 million for Democrats,” she says.
She describes eventually getting “re-energized” to support the Democrat Party after Donald Trump’s election. However, she eventually became “disillusioned” with both the party’s centrist figures and, later, the progressive candidates she initially championed.
“When I was working for one fundraising firm, I helped a lot of progressive candidates — some were ‘squad’ members, but also ‘squad’-like candidates — believing they were the answer to the more corporate, centrist Democrats,” she said. “But then I soon became very disillusioned with them, too, after the summer of 2020, when I saw how they were all overtaken by identity politics, wokeness and DEI.”
“And that was honestly a huge part of shedding my democratic identity,” she added.
The Donor Class ‘Coronation’ of Kamala
The turning point, according to Barker, was this year’s Democratic National Convention.
“I was truly hoping to see a contested convention,” she said, referring to a process where candidates present platforms directly to voters for a final selection. Instead, she saw what she describes as a “coronation” of Kamala Harris with substantial donor influence behind her candidacy.
“I really, really wanted to see a bunch of different people get on stage and just be forced to say what they stand for, what their vision was for the party, and then have people vote on that,” she said. “I thought that could have been a really incredible moment for them.”
“Instead,” she explained, “they did exactly what they always do — just like they did to Bernie multiple times — by not even allowing a primary this year and simply coronating Kamala Harris.”
Barker voiced frustration with what she saw as the party’s contradiction between its rhetoric and actions.
“It’s just so laughable to see so much hypocrisy there after all I’ve heard from Democrats for the past few years is that ‘democracy is on the ballot’ and how Trump is supposedly trying to end it,” she said.
“So why aren’t you giving us any real reflection of democracy here?” she questioned. “You’re not giving people any choice.”
She highlighted a recent report that prominent donors, such as Laurene Powell Jobs, circulated polling data aimed at persuading other high-profile donors of Harris’s electability, effectively sidelining other candidates.
“Clearly, there was a whole operation behind the scenes,” she said. “This would not have happened, in my opinion, without donor pressure — there’s no way.”
Barker further criticized the lack of policy discussion at the convention, labeling it a “corporate infomercial” disconnected from the struggles of working-class Americans, noting that Democrats “have completely abandoned” working class people like her family.
“Working in fundraising, it was a lot to go up [to the DNC] and just to see the way that the donor suites were intermingled with the corporate media suites, and it just felt so gross,” she stated. “I felt like I was in a giant corporate infomercial with the most elite and out of touch people in the world.”
“I just felt disgusted [there] hearing the most generic platitudes that are empty, that mean nothing, like ‘joy’ and ‘brat,’ and it just made me so upset,” she added, noting that she actually left the DNC a day early and “didn’t even care at that point to hear Harris speak,” rejecting an offer to meet with the vice president.
Democratic Priorities: Losing the Working Class
The former Democratic fundraiser expressed frustration with the Democrat Party’s “tone deaf” reliance on fear-based messaging, claiming it’s focused on “identity politics” and rhetorical comparisons, like calling Trump “Hitler,” rather than on concrete economic issues such as “tariffs, taxes, and Social Security.”
She argues that such tactics alienate working-class voters, who are more concerned with “material things that will impact people’s lives.”
“Trump has the working class now — a multiracial working class — and Democrats should be panicking,” she stated. “They should be shitting themselves that they’ve lost the support of working people.”
“Even Bernie recently pointed out that you can’t win without the working class. But instead, they’re catering to donors and recycling the same rhetoric, like calling Trump ‘Hitler’ or warning about the end of democracy — issues far removed from the priorities of people struggling just to pay their bills,” she explained, noting that as a former Democrat, it’s “infuriating to see the party so out of touch.”
Hypocrisy on Big Money in Politics
Highlighting her experience with donor calls, Barker alleged that the Democratic Party only criticizes dark money when they don’t benefit from it.
“They’re really only against money in politics when it’s not being spent for them,” she said. “That’s the cold, hard truth.”
She recounted how candidates would criticize figures like Tesla CEO Elon Musk for donations to Republican causes while simultaneously courting donations from billionaires such as Alexander Soros, which, she claims, led to a “crack” in her loyalty to the party.
“It’s just such a clear hypocrisy. This was the first crack for me, working in fundraising and seeing this hypocrisy play out constantly on a daily basis, and almost every single donor call that I would do with candidates,” she said.
Pointing out that while Tim Walz criticized Musk for trying to “buy the election,” he’s also seen “cozying up” with George Soros’s son at his New York mansion around the time of the DNC events.
“What a freaking sanctimonious hypocrite,” she said of Walz. “I literally cannot think of anything more hypocritical.”
Slamming Harris and Walz as “self-righteous” and “super hypocritical” on accepting big and dark money in politics while condemning it in others, she suggested that Republicans, especially those like Senator Josh Hawley who “avoid corporate funds,” could be “good messengers” on the issue.
“Democrats only like to decry money in politics when the money isn’t being spent on them,” she reiterated. “It’s the ultimate hypocrisy. It’s just it’s how they are. It’s their MO.”
Criminal Justice: Overtaken by Wokeness
Barker also shared regret over her support of progressive District Attorney campaigns funded by major donors, alleging that criminal justice policies backed by certain left-wing donors were “out of touch” and ultimately harmful to minority communities.
“White-guilted, upper-class liberals in the Democratic Party think decriminalizing everything is the answer, but it actually hurts poor black and brown communities the most,” she said. “They’re left to deal with the fallout, while rich liberal donors — including George and Alexander Soros — remain untouched by these policies as they stay in their ivory towers.”
“These communities actually favor more police, not less,” she added, noting “this whole approach has only made the situation more racist and worse for communities and people of color.”
Citing personal experiences with crime in San Francisco, she argued that policies decriminalizing petty theft up to certain amounts have worsened conditions in underserved neighborhoods.
“I’ve been living in San Francisco for the past year — unfortunately — and my car’s been broken into three times,” she said. “I see it all the time and it’s made me realize, ‘Oh my god, I can’t believe I supported the groups that helped get [former San Francisco DA] Chesa Boudin elected.’”
“I really regret it,” she admitted, “and now I’m trying to right those wrongs.”
Donor Influence on Harris: a “Complete Empty Vessel”
Barker criticized Harris as lacking consistent principles, suggesting she “says whatever she needs to say at the time to win.”
She argues that the vice president doesn’t have the conviction typical of more steadfast progressives, like Bernie Sanders.
“I don’t think she has real values. Obviously she said really progressive things, but I think she’s a complete empty vessel. She’s not like a Bernie progressive that has always been consistent and said the same thing,” she stated.
“She literally will just say anything,” the former campaign operative added. “She’s empty. She doesn’t have her own convictions, policies or ideas.”
Additionally, she expressed disappointment with Harris’s decision to select Tim Walz for outreach to the Rust Belt, suggesting it demonstrated a lack of understanding of cultural differences between regions.
“Picking Tim Walz was such a huge mistake. It just shows how out of touch they are,” she said. “You pick a super-progressive prosecutor from Berkeley, California to represent the whole country, and then expect Walz to connect with the Rust Belt? Give me a break. There’s a massive cultural gap between Minnesota and places like Ohio or Pennsylvania.”
“As someone from Missouri, I can tell you, Minnesota is way more like California,” she added.
Barker then noted that “a culturally relevant choice” like Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, might have had stronger appeal in swing states.
“Josh Shapiro would’ve been a much better choice,” she said, “but maybe the Democratic Party’s too antisemitic for a Jewish VP.”
“I honestly can’t think of another reason they’d overlook him — it just doesn’t add up,” she added.
With the 2024 election approaching, she expressed concern that a potential Kamala Harris presidency would be beholden to the interests of wealthy donors, rather than to the voters, saying she would simply be a “puppet for the donor class and their interest” if she were to be elected.
She pointed to recent reports suggesting that influential donor circles had lobbied aggressively for Harris and argued that her record lacked evidence of core policy convictions.
“They know Kamala has no backbone, she has no convictions, she has nothing she really believes in,” Barker insisted. “So I’m sure they will get the job done with her if she is elected — 100 percent.”
Barker is not alone in her frustration.
Audrey McNeal, a 22-year-old former DNC delegate, recently announced she’s leaving the Democratic Party.
In a video shared on social media, McNeal explained, “In 2020, I was elected at 18 to become one of the youngest delegates… But this year, I’m casting my ballot for Donald Trump.”
Meanwhile, former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (I-HI), who ran for president as a Democrat in 2020, declared her switch to the Republican Party during a Trump rally in Greensboro, North Carolina, last week.
The matter comes as Democrats face mounting pressure to reconnect with their working-class base and address growing criticisms of donor influence overshadowing grassroots priorities ahead of the upcoming election.
Recent polling shows that Democrats are struggling to retain support from working-class voters across key states, while recent Gallup polling showed more Americans either identify as Republicans or are more in line with the GOP than Democrats, Breitbart News reported.
In a national poll from NY Times/Sienna released Friday, Trump surged to a one-point lead over Kamala Harris, 47 to 46 percent.
On Sunday, NBC national political correspondent Steve Kornacki noted that a series of new polls all showed Trump ahead of Harris.",28/10/2024
Breitbart,Hezbollah Terrorists Tap Naim Qassem to Succeed Hassan Nasrallah as Leader,"Hezbollah’s ruling Shura Council on Tuesday announced the terrorists have chosen Naim Qassem to replace longtime dictator Hassan Nasrallah as leader of the jihadist organization and Lebanese political party.
Nasrallah’s three decades of power ended suddenly on September 27, when an Israeli bomb destroyed the bunker he was hiding in. Hezbollah’s first choice to replace Nasrallah, his cousin and lookalike Hashem Safieddine, was killed by an Israeli airstrike soon afterward, although his death was not officially confirmed until October 22.
Qassem became Hezbollah leader largely by the process of elimination, although the 71-year-old joined the terrorist group as a religious scholar soon after its founding and he has been one of its deputy leaders since 1991. He often addresses foreign media as one of Hezbollah’s top spokesmen.
Qassem has a few clear deficiencies as top leader, including a general lack of charisma, fewer advantageous family and political connections than Safieddine possessed, and lower religious status than Nasrallah and Safieddine. Those two wore black turbans, indicating they claimed to be descendants of Islam’s prophet Muhammad. Qassem wears a white turban, indicating he does not have descendant status.
Qassem has delivered three televised speeches since Nasrallah was eliminated. In a speech on October 8, he broached the possibility of negotiating a ceasefire with Israel, although he also claimed Hezbollah was devising a “new calculation” to inflict “pain” on the Israelis.
“The solution is a ceasefire, we are not speaking from a position of weakness. If the Israelis do not want that, we will continue,” he threatened in a speech on October 15.
Despite this defiant rhetoric, observers noted Qassem’s offer of ceasefire negotiations came with no strings attached for the Palestinians and Gaza, a significant softening of the stance Hezbollah took before much of its leadership perished in a string of pager explosions, walkie-talkie explosions, and Israeli airstrikes.
The Israeli government suggested, through its Arabic-language Twitter account, that Qassem should probably focus on beefing up his ceasefire offers.
“His tenure in this position may be the shortest in the history of this terrorist organization if he follows in the footsteps of his predecessors Hassan Nasrallah and Hashem Safieddine. There is no solution in Lebanon except to dismantle this organization as a military force,” said the Israeli response to Qassem’s appointment.
Israel’s military operation in Lebanon continued on Monday, including airstrikes in the eastern Bekaa Valley that killed at least sixty people, according to the Lebanese health ministry. The Bekaa Valley is a heavily militarized Hezbollah stronghold.

IDFIsraeli strikes also hit the coastal city of Tyre on Monday, after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) warned civilians to evacuate the city center. The Lebanese health ministry claimed 7 people were killed and 17 injured in the strikes.
Israel began its operation against Hezbollah on September 30 after almost a year of Hezbollah rocket attacks against Israeli civilians. The IDF has said its goal is to dismantle Hezbollah’s weapons and infrastructure with “limited, localized, targeted raids.”",29/10/2024
Breitbart,Steve Bannon: 'Federal Prison Not Only Didn't Break Me -- It Empowered Me',"Steve Bannon is more “energized” and “focused” than ever to help former President Donald Trump return to the White House, he told listeners Tuesday during his opening monologue on War Room.
After serving a four-month federal prison sentence for not complying with a subpoena from the House “Select January 6 Committee,” Bannon said he is “more energized” and “focused” than ever.
“The four months in federal prison not only didn’t break me — it empowered me,” Bannon said. “I am more energized and more focused than I’ve ever been in my entire life, and I can see clearly, just like in 2016 and in 2020, exactly what’s going on here and what we have to do to defeat it.”
“Nancy Pelosi sent me to a federal prison. She sent me to a federal prison as a political prisoner to do two things, to make sure that she tried to tamp down the power of this show … and also to break me,” he continued.
“We’re going to deliver a knockout blow to your progressive insanity on five November, and then we’re going to secure the deal after that,” he said.
Bannon also commented on the Harris campaign’s strategy of claiming former President Donald Trump is a “fascist.”
Bannon defied a subpoena from the partisan January 6 Committee, whose members were hand-picked by then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).

Breitbart,Report: Harris to Make Closing Campaign Pitch -- Give Me Another Chance,"Vice President Kamala Harris’s closing pitch on Tuesday will feature a request for four more years of power to fix the problems facing America, a report detailed.
Harris’s closing argument, scheduled to be delivered in front of the White House on the National Mall, is meant to counteract why many Americans feel worse off today than four years ago under former President Donald Trump.
Under the Biden-Harris administration, costs increased by about 20 percent across the board on average, Russia invaded Ukraine, Hamas and Iran attacked Israel, illegal migrants invaded the southern border, and the nation suffered the deadly Afghan withdrawal.
“There’s a big difference between he and I,” Harris said Monday about her closing speech. “If he were elected, on day one he’s going to sit in the Oval Office working on his enemies list. On day one, if I am elected, which I fully expect to be, I will be working on behalf of the American people on my to-do list.”
Politico reported on Harris’s scheduled speech Tuesday night:
In her speech, which is expected to draw the vice president’s largest audience between now and when polls close on Election Day, Harris will not focus her remarks on democracy and Jan. 6, according to a senior campaign official. But with the White House in the background, the venue will serve as an implicit reminder. And Harris will draw a broader contrast with Trump, arguing explicitly that Trump is focused on himself and his “enemies” list, while she will prioritize her “to-do” list to lower costs and help Americans, said the official, granted anonymity to speak candidly about a speech still in development.
…
The campaign believes the symbolic nature of the venue will bolster Harris’ closing message. Just as her team did with a stop in Houston last week to elevate abortion rights, they’re using Tuesday night’s location to telegraph a larger, national message: By returning to a site where Trump infamously delivered his speech on Jan. 6, 2021 in which he urged his followers to “fight like hell,” Harris aides say she has the perfect place to deliver a contrasting message about how she plans to govern.
The tone of the speech is expected to be optimistic and forward-looking, as she works to outline what her presidency will look like and calls for Americans to “turn the page” on the Trump era — a line that has become a hallmark of her short campaign. She will vow to put the country first, above party and herself, and to serve for both Republicans and Democrats.
“She’s thinking about this as laying out a vision, and she’s got to do it as clearly and concisely as she can, recognizing that there are people for whom, yes, they get this big picture democracy,” an anonymous Democrat close to the Harris campaign told Politico. “But there are also people who just want to know you’re going to keep the country safe, or that you’re gonna work on getting prices down, and just need to know that you are going to do that.”
Anonymous Harris campaign officials tried on Monday to reframe the presidential race in a positive light by leaking an internal “cautiously optimistic” assessment to the New York Times. The spin, which may or may not be true, is a drastic change from what the Harris campaign’s previously signaled: that it was an underdog in a deadlocked race.

Breitbart,Democrats Despair as Harris's Economic Message Ignored by Voters,"It’s the economy, voters agree. Democrats increasingly embrace that credo and despair Vice President Kamala Harris’s message of economic salvation is being ignored as former President Donald Trump boasts a sizeable advantage on what many Americans say is their No. 1 issue, a report Tuesday reveals.
A report by Alexander Bolton in The Hill sets out that while random “fear and loathing” character attacks by Harris against Trump are being increasingly used on the stump voters are more interested in hearing about the economy. The piece states:
Some Democratic strategists view Harris’s scathing criticisms of Trump as necessary and effective, but they acknowledge she could be doing a better job of talking about the economy — a challenge that also vexed President Biden before he dropped his bid for reelection.
One major Democratic donor told The Hill that Harris hasn’t properly made the case on the economy and is therefore struggling to meet the kitchen table concerns of voters of all ages.
“Her economic message hasn’t broken through,” the donor said. “And the economy is the issue most people care about. She narrowed the gap a little on the issue, but she’s left a lot of people wondering about her vision.”

RSBN / YouTubeThe outlet notes a recent Reuters/Ipsos found voters maintain Trump has a better approach than Harris on the economy, by a margin of 46 percent to 38 percent.
The survey found some 61 percent of voters in battleground states say the economy is on the “wrong track.”
The Hill piece comes as Breitbart’s own John Carney writes economic indicators presage a big Trump win because the upcoming election will likely turn on the issue Americans have repeatedly called most pressing: the economy.
Who do they trust most on the issue in a country currently battling high inflation and lackluster growth?

Breitbart,CatholicVote Ad Claims Kamala Harris Connected to Anti-Catholic Group,"The advocacy group CatholicVote launched an ad campaign connecting Vice President Kamala Harris with the anti-Catholic group Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence (SPI).
The SPI are a group of LGBTQ activists who dress up as Catholic nuns and perform lewd activities in public as a mockery the Catholic faith. The ad from CatholicVote features Harris in a photograph with SPI members “Sister Roma” and “Saint Honey Mahogany” at a San Francisco Pride event in 2019.
“Why is Kamala Harris posing with the founder of an anti-Catholic hate group? They mock our faith. The sisters are men who dress in lewd imitation of Roman Catholic nuns that intentionally mock and degrade Christians,” the ad says.
“A drag queen comes in and sort of pulls Jesus off the cross. For Catholics, it’s hard to imagine anything more offensive. Kamala Harris doesn’t care about Christians in this country. Kamala Harris stands with they/them, not with you. Christian’s can’t stay home November 5th,” it continues.
CatholicVote President Brian Burch differentiated SPI from other LGBTQ activist groups in a statement.
“Let’s be clear: the ‘Sisters’ are no ordinary LGBT activist group. They are a ‘drag’ troupe whose whole purpose is to mock and harass Catholics,” he said.
“Members of the SPI dress in nun costumes to ridicule real Catholic religious sisters.…They regularly hold “Hunky Jesus” competitions, where adult drag performers dress as Our Lord and even His Holy Mother – and perform stripteases, simulate sex acts, and mock the crucifixion. In one horrific case, SPI members even tricked a Catholic archbishop into giving them Holy Eucharist – then took it off to desecrate it in a mock-Mass,” he added.",30/10/2024
Breitbart,GOP Senators: Will Senate Dems 'Condemn' Biden’s ‘Garbage’ Remark?,"Democrats have been more than willing to name-call over the years, smearing Trump supporters as racist, xenophobic, and the “worst people in the world,” so will they condemn President Biden calling half the country “garbage?” Senate Republicans want to know.
“Shameless Senate Democrats have spent years attacking Trump supporters,” Senate Republicans wrote following Biden referring to Trump supporters as “garbage.” They used Arizona Senate hopeful Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) as an example, noting that he referred to Trump supporters as the “worst people in the world.”
“So will they condemn Joe Biden as he calls half the country ‘garbage’?” they asked on social media.
Gallego made his “worst people” remark during a 2016 interview. In other words, he has held this view for quite some time.
“I think Donald Trump ran a xenophobic campaign that drew out the worst people in the world that we are not going to appeal to and never will,” Gallego said at the time, also referring to Trump voters as “dumb.”
Senate Republicans provided a few other examples of the sheer vitriol as well.
“Do Jon Tester, Sherrod Brown, Bob Casey, Elissa Slotkin, Tammy Baldwin, Ruben Gallego, Jacky Rosen, and Colin Allred agree with Biden that Trump supporters are ‘garbage’?” they asked, noting that Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT) once asserted that Trump’s support is rooted in “scared white voters.” Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) accused some of Trump’s supporters of being racist, stating that “35 percent of Americans that support President Trump love President Trump, because he plays to the anger and fear and resentment and often to racism of not all but some of his supporters.” And Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) concluded that Trump supporters are essentially immoral.
“These Democrats have spent years attacking Donald Trump and his supporters as deplorable and racist, even calling them ‘the worst people in the world,'” National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) Spokesman Philip Letsou said in a statement.
“Now that they’re shamelessly pandering for support from Trump supporters, voters need to know if they will condemn Joe Biden’s disgusting remarks or fall in line yet again,” he added.
President Joe Biden’s “garbage” remark largely overshadowed Vice President Kamala Harris’s closing argument, which she delivered on the Washington, DC, Ellipse.
Biden later tried to backtrack, maintaining that he was only referring to the comedian Trump’s campaign had on stage at Madison Square Garden.
“Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage—which is the only word I can think of to describe it,” he said.
“His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation,” Biden added.
Trump responded directly on social media shortly after midnight, delivering a powerful statement which included this: “You can’t lead America if you don’t love the American People.”",30/10/2024
Breitbart,"The Nation: WaPo, LA Times ‘Betraying Democracy’ by Not Endorsing Harris","The Washington Post and Los Angeles Times are “betraying democracy” by refusing to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, according to the left-wing magazine The Nation, which contends billionaire owners Jeff Bezos and Patrick Soon-Shiong blocked Harris endorsements to gain the good graces of an “authoritarian and fascistic” Trump, should he win the presidency again.
In a pointed critique in The Nation on Tuesday, the magazine’s national affairs correspondent, John Nichols, argues that by avoiding endorsements, particularly of Harris, these influential newspapers are undermining the historic mission of the press to “speak truth to power.”
According to the author, billionaire publishers “who censor endorsements that offend Donald Trump confirm their scorching disregard for the traditions of a free press.”
“The founders of the American experiment did not establish constitutional protections for media outlets so that hedge-fund managers could strip newspapers for parts, or billionaires could make them political playthings,” he writes.
Nichols, who co-wrote It’s OK to Be Angry About Capitalism with Senator Bernie Sanders, argues that while billionaire owners like Bezos and Soon-Shiong have positioned themselves as “saviors of journalism” — a portrayal he calls a “fantasy” embraced even by some journalists — this ownership was never intended to support the long-term good of their publications.
“No long-term good was ever going to come of giving Amazon’s Jeff Bezos control of The Washington Post or biotech billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong control of the venerable Los Angeles Times,” he writes, suggesting their interests lie more in influence than integrity.
He notes that, while the two billionaires initially invested heavily in these publications to help them “adjust to the digital age,” it was “only a matter of time before they abused their ownership status in order to achieve their own economic and political ends.”
The piece claims this shift became evident last week, after both the Post and the Times — under direction from their owners — abstained from endorsing a candidate in the 2024 presidential race.
Bezos and Soon-Shiong, Nichols writes, imposed this decision on their editorial teams despite the fact that many journalists at both newspapers have written extensively about the perceived “threat posed by Trump’s bid for a second term.”
According to the essay, credible accounts suggest that both newspapers’ editorial boards were “prepared to endorse Kamala Harris” until their publishers stepped in. Nichols characterizes this intervention as “overt gifts to Trump,” sidelining the editorial voices of two major national publications.
He also insists that readers see the decision not to back Harris as more than “an act of surrender to a Republican whose campaign has trafficked in racist and xenophobic messaging,” suggesting instead that it qualifies as “preelection cowardice” by billionaire owners who, by avoiding confrontation with Trump, signal a willingness to yield to his agenda if he returns to power.
The author writes that this choice conveys that the Post and the Times, two of the country’s most influential publications, may be prepared to “bend to the will of an increasingly authoritarian and fascistic commander in chief” should he win the presidency again.
On Friday, the Washington Post announced that it would not be endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris in the upcoming presidential election.In an opinion piece written by William Lewis, a publisher and chief executive officer for the newspaper, the Post explained that they were “returning to” their “roots of not endorsing presidential candidates.”
The Washington Post will not be making an endorsement of a presidential candidate in this election. Nor in any future presidential election. We are returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates.
As our Editorial Board wrote in 1960:
“The Washington Post has not ‘endorsed’ either candidate in the presidential campaign. That is in our tradition and accords with our action in five of the last six elections. The unusual circumstances of the 1952 election led us to make an exception when we endorsed General Eisenhower prior to the nominating conventions and reiterated our endorsement during the campaign. In the light of hindsight we retain the view that the arguments for his nomination and election were compelling. But hindsight also has convinced us that it might have been wiser for an independent newspaper in the Nation’s Capital to have avoided formal endorsement.”
The Post’s non-endorsement of Harris in the election followed that of the Los Angeles Times, the hometown newspaper of Harris, which also refused to endorse her, despite previously endorsing President Joe Biden, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and former President Barack Obama.
Harris has also faced non-endorsements from the Teamsters Union, even though polling showed that nearly 60 percent of the Teamsters members supported Trump, while 34 percent expressed support for Harris.",29/10/2024

Breitbart,Trump Campaign Challenges Kamala Harris to Disavow Biden's 'Garbage' Insult,"The Trump-Vance campaign demanded Tuesday evening that Vice President Kamala Harris “disavow” President Joe Biden’s comment that Trump supporters were “garbage.”
The comment triggered an explosive reaction in the media just as Harris was delivering her “closing argument” in Washington, DC, stepping on her final message.
The Associated Press reported: “Reacting to a comic calling Puerto Rico garbage at a Trump rally last weekend, Biden said, ‘The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.'”
NBC reporter Gabe Gutierrez, gave a fuller version of the quote: “Donald Trump has no character. He doesn’t give a damn about the Latino community…just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage?…The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.”
Politico tried to claim that Biden was just referring to “Trump supporters who said such things about American citizens.” The White House provided a different spin, saying Biden was using an apostrophe — “supporter’s” — to refer simply to the comedian who had told the offensive joke. Even CNN had trouble accepting that version of events.
The Trump campaign responded with a statement attributed to campaign secretary Karoline Leavitt:
President Trump is backed by Latinos, Black voters, union workers, angel moms, law enforcement officers, border patrol agents, and Americans of all faiths — and Harris, Walz, and Biden have labeled these great Americans as fascists, Nazis, and now, garbage. There’s no way to spin it: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris don’t just hate President Trump, they despise the tens of millions of Americans who support him. Kamala does not deserve four more years. President Trump will be a president for ALL Americans.
The campaign also challenged Vice President Harris to “disavow” Biden’s remarks, including a list of critical comments:
Kamala Harris’ governing partner just insulted tens of millions of Americans. Will Kamala apologize and disavow Joe Biden’s remarks?
Biden said: “The only garbage I see floating out there is [Trump] supporters.”
Senator J.D. Vance said: “This is disgusting. Kamala Harris and her boss Joe Biden are attacking half of the country. There’s no excuse for this. I hope Americans reject it.”
Sen. Marco Rubio said in Allentown, PA: “He’s talking about the Border Patrol. He’s talking about nurses. He’s talking about teachers. He’s talking about everyday Americans who love their country and want to dream big again…and I hope their campaign is about to apologize for what Joe Biden just said. We are not garbage. We are patriots who love America.”
Donald Trump Jr. said: “Team Kamala thinks all Trump supporters are ‘garbage.’ Alexis Nungaray lost her daughter at the hands of an illegal alien that Kamala Harris allowed into our country. She isn’t garbage, she’s an amazing American whose daughter would be alive today if it wasn’t for Kamala Harris.”
Trump Campaign National Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt responded: “Joe Biden and Kamala Harris hate America and don’t deserve four more years. Kamala must answer for this disgraceful attack on tens of millions of Americans.”
Harris aides were reportedly leaking to Axios that Biden was “both unpopular and undisciplined,” but she herself had not yet responded as of 10:45 p.m. ET on Tuesday evening.

Breitbart,Report: Harris Campaign Manipulates Reddit with Sophisticated Astroturfing Plan,"The Harris-Walz campaign is reportedly manipulating the social media platform Reddit and breaking the rules in order to control the narrative on the site and make Vice President Kamala Harris appear more popular than she actually is, according to a new investigation by the Federalist.
While Reddit is a notoriously leftist platform infamous for its censorship of a large community of Trump supporters, Harris’s campaign is deploying its staffers to manipulate the site’s algorithm even further via a massive “astroturfing” operation, which is in direct violation of platform’s Terms of Service, according to a report by the Federalist.
The term “astroturfing” refers to a fake grassroots campaign, which involves campaign staffers or volunteers posing as ordinary people to create the illusion that there is more support being expressed in favor of a particular candidate or issue than there actually is.
“It’s no different than a shady company paying a team to write a bunch of fake Amazon reviews about their product to make it appear to be a better and more popular product than it is,” the Federalist noted.
When this strategy is used on Amazon, it can manipulate people to buy certain products, thinking they are more popular than they are. When the same strategy is deployed for elections, it can reward a falsely advertised candidate with more votes.
The Harris-Walz campaign reportedly keeps a spreadsheet to track of its astroturfing efforts, which involves staffers spamming the “Politics” subreddit (reddit forums on a particular topic) — and other subreddits — with pro-Harris propaganda, and then having volunteers who pretend to be random users who just so happened to stumble upon the content post favorable comments.
The Federalist accessed the campaign’s Discord server and found that every weekday morning paid Democrat staffer Gabrielle Lynn communicates a “Daily Messaging Guidance” for Reddit, which usually consists of articles and data that the Harris-Walz campaign wants to boost, and “key messaging” that campaign volunteers need to stick to.
This information is assembled by official Harris-Walz staffers and is added to a Google Spreadsheet titled “Reddit Organizing.” From there, volunteers called “Lead Posters” — who are Reddit savvy — choose what they think will best resonate with users on the platform.
After posting to Reddit, the campaign’s Lead Posters then go back to the spreadsheet and update it with links to their posts, so that campaign volunteers can then spam the posts with likes and comments, making them appear more active, which then triggers the site’s algorithm to make the content more visible to users.
Harris-Walz campaign volunteers are reportedly working with a database of more than 100 subreddits that they target with campaign propaganda.
“Kamala’s posters, however, don’t simply spam links haphazardly. They use a calculated, sequential post timing metric to avoid Reddit’s built-in spam filters,” the Federalist reported.
Given that this activity violates Reddit’s Terms of Service, Harris-Walz campaign volunteers often discuss how to avoid getting banned while they spam the platform and carry out their astroturfing agenda, according to internal Discord chats obtained by the Federalist.
With regards to how effective this shady strategy has been, the Federalist noted that the Harris-Walz campaign’s own data reveals that over the course of 15 days, its volunteers were able to make 2,551 posts to Reddit, which have so far garnered more than 5.7 million upvotes and 418,000 comments.
Staffers and volunteers posing as regular individuals and spamming Reddit with propaganda and false favorability is clearly an effort by the Harris-Walz campaign to manipulate votes in the 2024 presidential election.

Breitbart,NYC Mayor Eric Adams Running His Own 'Horrific' Migrant Busing Back to Texas,"New York City Mayor Eric Adams’ administration has admitted to busing 4,500 migrants from the Big Apple to Texas despite the mayor’s oft-repeated accusation that busing migrants is an act of cruelty and immorality.
In 2022, when buses from Texas were rolling into New York City, Adams decried the Texas governor’s actions, calling them “horrific.”
“This is horrific, when you think about what the governor is doing,” Adams said in August of 2022.
“It is unimaginable what the governor of Texas has done, when you think about this country, a country that has always been open to those who were fleeing persecution,” the Democrat mayor continued.
“We’ve always welcomed them. And this governor is not doing that in Texas. But we are going to set the right tone of being here for these families,” he said, claiming that they were “forced on the bus.”
But now, Fox News is reporting that the Adams administration has been engaging in a busing program of its own and sending migrants right back to Texas and several other states.
According to the report, city hall has been using taxpayer funds to buy bus and plane tickets for migrants who volunteer to leave the Big Apple.
At least 4,500 migrants have now been shipped out of the city.
Migrants have been sent not just to Texas, but also to states including Illinois, Colorado, Florida, and even elsewhere in New York.
City hall now confirms that 2,297 tickets were purchased for Texas between February and July of this year. Destinations in the Lone Star State include Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio. The costs to the city have totaled around $13.8 million, Fox News reported.
A mayoral spokesman explained the program saying, “Whenever they have a desire where they want to go back to somewhere else, we buy their tickets. It is mostly planes, but we also buy bus tickets.”
For his part, Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott is accusing the Adams government of being hypocritical with the busing program.
“Border Czar Kamala Harris and the federal government continues to refuse to enforce federal immigration laws already on the books and do their jobs to secure the border,” Abbott spokesperson Andrew Mahaleris said, “allowing record-high levels of illegal immigrants, deadly drugs like fentanyl, and weapons to surge into our state and country.”
“Hypocritical Mayor Adams said busing migrants is ‘morally bankrupt,’ while Harris called transporting migrants ‘political theater’ and they’re doing the same thing themselves,” Mahaleris added. “Until Border Czar Harris steps up and does her job to secure the border, Texas will continue utilizing every tool and strategy to respond to the Biden-Harris border crisis.”

Breitbart,MSNBC Faces Backlash from Jewish Trump Supporters After Nazi Rally Comparison,"MSNBC is facing backlash for comparing former President Donald Trump’s recent Madison Square Garden event to a pro-Nazi rally held at the same New York City venue in 1939 after splicing in 85-year-old footage of the crowd doing Seig Heil salutes in between clips of the Republican’s Sunday audience.
One of the far-left network’s anchors, Jonathan Capehart, called Trump’s packed rally “chilling” because of the German American Bund’s completely unrelated event at the arena:
“But that jamboree happening right now, you see it there on your screen in that place is particularly chilling because in 1939, more than 20,000 supporters of a different fascist leader, Adolf Hitler, packed the Garden for a so-called pro-America rally,” Capehart said while rolling black-and-white footage of Nazi fans.
Historian and CNN contributor Ruth Ben-Ghiat concurred with Capehart’s comparison, calling the Trump rally an “overt Nazi parallel.”
The segment upset thousands of Trump fans, with several Jewish supporters of the former president saying MSNBC was “mocking the Holocaust and diminishing the memory of the millions of Jews who perished during that period”:
Journalist Yaakov Strasberg wrote on X, “Please explain to all of us Orthodox Jewish Trump supporters (the vast majority of Orthodox Jews) how it’s a ‘Nazi rally'”:
Social media influencer Shane Ginsberg poked fun at the media outlet’s claims, writing, “I’m Jewish. I went to the Nazi rally. I’m voting for Trump. Any questions?”:
Proud “Jewish New York Republican” Debra Lea posted a video to X to set the record straight, calling out the “mainstream media”:
While on the vice presidential campaign trail, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) also compared Trump’s rally to the 1939 Nazi event, telling his supporters in in Las Vegas, Nevada, to “Google” it on Sunday:
Breitbart News fact-checked these desperate “Nazi” comparisons and claims coming out of the Democrat camp, noting that Jewish people have also held anti-Nazi rallies at Madison Square Garden.
The Trump War Room also pointed out that the Democrat National Conventions were held at Madison Square Garden several times throughout the decades:",28/10/2024
Breitbart,Trump Unveils Plan to Seize Cartel Assets for 'Migrant Crime' Restitution,"Former President Donald Trump unveiled a policy plan on Tuesday to seize cartel and gang assets, which will be used to establish a “compensation fund to provide restitution for the victims of migrant crime.”
Trump laid out his latest policy vision while speaking at his seaside Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida.
“I am announcing that for the first time, under my administration, we will be seizing the assets of the criminal gangs and drug cartels, and we will use those assets to create a compensation fund to provide restitution for the victims of migrant crime,” Trump said.
“The government will help in the restitution,” he added.
Trump has spotlighted “migrant crime” throughout his campaign to underscore the horrific effects of extreme illegal immigration under the Biden-Harris administration.
In February, a Venezuelan national in the country illegally allegedly kidnapped and murdered 22-year-old University of Georgia nursing student Laken Riley while she was out for a morning jog.
A grand jury in Athens, Georgia, indicted Jose Antonio Ibarra, 26, on murder, kidnapping, and assault with intent to rape charges. Authorities first encountered Ibarra along the southern border near El Paso, Texas, in September 2022.
“Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials cited ‘detention capacity’ as the reason Ibarra was awarded parole and released into the U.S. interior despite there having been available detention space,” Breitbart News’s John Binder reported.
In another horrific case, two Venezuelan nationals have been charged with capital murder in the killing of 12-year-old Houston girl Jocelyn Nungarary in June.
The illegal immigrants– Johan Jose Martinez-Rangel, 22, and Franklin Pena, 25– allegedly lured Nungarary under a bridge from a 7-11 close to her home and assaulted her for two hours before strangling her to death. Her body was found in a shallow creek.
Nungaray’s mother, Alexis, joined Trump on stage during his Texas rally on Friday to say her daughter’s murder was “due to the Biden-Harris policies.”
“They made her a target … and now I will forever be a grieving mother, and my son will forever be a grieving brother who will no longer get to grow up with his sister,” she told the crowd.
In August 2023, an illegal alien MS-13 gang member allegedly murdered Rachel Morin, a 37-year-old mother of five, in Maryland. On August 5, 2023, Rachel never returned from a walk she took on the Ma & Pa Heritage Trail in Harford County, and her body was recovered along the trail the following day.
Prosecutors allege that El Salvaorian national Victor Antonio Martinez Hernandez, 23, raped, bludgeoned, and strangled Morin to death. The Tulsa Police Department arrested Hernandez in connection with the muder in June 2024.",29/10/2024
Breitbart,JD Vance Blasts Kamala Backer for Doubling Down on Biden Calling Trump Supporters 'Garbage',"Sen. JD Vance (R-OH) blasted Silicon Valley investor and Vice President Kamala Harris supporter Vinod Khosla, as he doubled down on President Joe Biden calling Trump supporters “garbage.”
Khosla is one of the many billionaires backing Harris and he is completely undeterred by Biden’s now viral remarks about half the country.
“Garbage is an understatement for MAGA extremists,” he said in part:
This prompted Vance, Trump’s running mate, to openly wonder if Harris will return his contributions.
“One of Kamala Harris’s biggest donors is doubling down on calling half the country ‘garbage,'” Vance observed, asking, “Will Kamala and her campaign return his contributions?”
“Or will they continue to insult half of the country for the sin of thinking Kamala Harris isn’t good at her job?” he pressed.
Biden’s remark largely overshadowed Harris’s D.C. Ellipse speech, as he stated that, “Donald Trump has no character,” later adding, “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.”
Biden tried to save face, and the establishment media was more than willing to help with the spin, as the 81 year old attempted to make it seem as if he was only referring to the comedian Trump’s campaign had on stage at Madison Square Garden on Sunday.
“Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage—which is the only word I can think of to describe it,” he said.
“His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation,” he added, to no avail.
“A mother mourning her son who died of a fentanyl overdose is not garbage. A truck driver who can’t afford rising diesel prices is not garbage. A father who wants to afford groceries is not garbage,” Vance said right after the news of Biden’s comments broke.
“Kamala Harris and Joe Biden ought to be ashamed of themselves,” he added.
Trump issued a direct response shortly after midnight, contrasting his campaign of “positive solutions to save America” with Harris’s “campaign of hate.”
“She has spent all week comparing her political opponents to the most evil mass murderers in history. Now, on top of everything, Joe Biden calls our supporters ‘garbage,'” he said.
“You can’t lead America if you don’t love the American People. Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have shown they are both unfit to be President of the United States,” he continued, adding that he is “proud to lead the biggest, broadest, and most important political coalition in American history.”
“We are welcoming historic numbers of Latinos, African Americans, Asian Americans, and citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed,” Trump added. “It is my desire to be the President of all the people.”",30/10/2024
Breitbart,Nasty Kamala Glooms in Highly Negative Closing Speech Bashing Trump,"WASHINGTON, DC – Vice President Kamala Harris brought a dark and gloomy tone to her highly partisan closing argument speech on the Ellipse Tuesday night, which was delivered to an audience clearly culled from the Democrat base.
Harris’s remarks were in utter contrast to the “joy” she and Democrats attempted to manufacture at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago just two months ago.
She opened her speech with a vicious attack on Trump rather than a policy platform or a positive vision for the future if she wins. Harris baselessly and falsely said Trump would use the U.S. military against American citizens, and claimed he is “unstable.”
“This is not a candidate for president who is thinking about how to make your life better. This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power, ” Harris said.
“Donald Trump has spent a decade trying to keep the American people divided and afraid of each other. That is who he is,” she added in her extremely divisive speech.
She also referred to him as a “petty tyrant.”
The inflammatory rhetoric comes as Harris has taken to equating Trump, who was nearly assassinated twice since July, to a fascist in the home stretch of the race, as he dominates Democrats in early and mail-in-voting numbers compared to the margins from four years ago, in what turned out to be a razor-thin election.
Harris’s attacks come as Trump was highly critical of her rhetoric while he addressed reporters from Mar-a-Lago earlier Tuesday. Trump said that Harris is running a campaign of “absolute hate.”
“She’s running on a campaign of demoralization and really a campaign of destruction,” Trump said. “But really, perhaps more than anything else, it’s a campaign of hate, a campaign of absolute hate.”",29/10/2024
Breitbart,Harris Co-Chair: 'Don't Understand Why We Put So Much Emphasis' on Her Past Praise of Defund the Police,"On Tuesday’s broadcast of CNN’s “The Lead,” Harris-Walz Campaign Co-Chair Rep. James Clyburn (D-SC) responded to 2024 Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris’ past praise of the Defund the Police movement by stating that “I don’t understand why we put so much emphasis on that,” she’s gotten criticized for being too aggressive as a prosecutor, and “when you pursue your profession, sometimes, people tend to misrepresent exactly what the real facts are. So, I think that she has done a tremendous job in all the professions she has had. None of us are perfect. But all of us are in pursuit of perfection.”
Host Jake Tapper said, “Vice President Harris has never specifically called for defunding the police, but, in 2020, when the movement was big, she did praise the Defund the Police movement for questioning police budgets. And I wonder if you fear at all that these nuanced abstractions make her vulnerable to people not knowing exactly where she stands on issues. For example, in June 2020, I asked you about the Defund the Police movement, and you said, ‘Nobody is going to defund the police.’ A pretty explicit position that she did not take.”
Clyburn responded, “Well, that’s right, because I believe very strongly in the police, I also believe there’s probably unfairness, and I also know that we have rogue cops and we have ministers that need to be defrocked. We have these in all professions. There are lawyers that get disbarred. And when this happens, we don’t get rid of the profession. We get rid of those who…in some way, do something untoward. So, the same thing goes with police. We believe in the police, we support the police, we want to call upon them when we need them, and we will fund them for that purpose. But that doesn’t mean we’re not going to hold them accountable like we hold all other professionals accountable.”
Tapper then said, “But that’s my point. You’re kind of proving my point, because that is a very clear policy statement. And that’s not what Kamala Harris was saying in 2019, 2020, when she was talking about, well, it’s good that they’re bringing attention to police budgets, etc. And that gives Trump the room to say, she’s all over the map on this issue, just like she is with fracking and others.”
Clyburn responded, “Well, I don’t understand why we put so much emphasis on that, and when we see the other side accusing her of over-policing when she was a district attorney, I’ve heard people accuse her of being too forceful in that job. She was attorney general, she has been accused in that regard as well. So, we all have these detractors, no matter what you do. Very few people will really admit to wrongdoing. And so, when you pursue your profession, sometimes, people tend to misrepresent exactly what the real facts are. So, I think that she has done a tremendous job in all the professions she has had. None of us are perfect. But all of us are in pursuit of perfection.”

Breitbart,"Politico Hauls Biden's 'Garbage', Covers Up Smear of Trump Supporters","Leftwing Washington outlet Politico regularly carries water for Democrats, but Tuesday night they hauled President Joe Biden’s “garbage,” attempting to cover up the president’s attack on Donald Trump’s supporters by disingenuously chopping up his statement.
Biden’s latest gaffe quickly escalated into a major headache for Vice President Kamala Harris, who reportedly has rebuffed Biden’s attempts to join her on the campaign trail.
Politico’s coverup is an acknowledgment of just how damaging Biden’s comments – which are already being compared to Hillary Clinton’s “basket of deplorables” comment from 2016 – could be to Harris.
Sen. JD Vance (R-OH), Trump’s running mate, isn’t letting Politico get away with it. He called Politico’s reporting a “scandal” and laid bare the outlet’s flimsy coverup.
‘”The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.’ That’s a direct quote” from Biden, Vance tweeted. “That’s what Kamala Harris’s boss said.”
He included a screenshot showing how Politico chopped up Biden’s quote that read, “Biden, in a Zoom call with the organization Voto Latino, said “the only garbage” was the “hatred” of Trump supporters who said such things about American citizens.”
“Do Jon Lemire, Alexander Burns, Politico have an ounce of integrity?” Vance asked. “Will they correct this obvious falsehood?”
“The fact that these ‘journalists’ are covering for a catastrophic error from Kamala’s campaign is a scandal,” Vance tweeted, along with the clip of Biden’s clear attack on Trump supports.
Politico‘s Lemire leaned in to the deception. He tweeted a transcript of what he called “the full Biden quote from the Zoom tonight, which is being taken out of context.”
It appears Lemire thought a transcript of Biden’s stumbling, repeated words, and abrupt – often mid-word – departure to a new thought would bolster Politico’s case. It is unlikely to mollify Vance, Trump supporters, or most who heard Biden’s comment.
But more significantly, Lemire’s reported transcript does not match what Biden said – or Politico’s original reporting.
The Trump campaign blistered Lemire for his cleanup backfire.
“Politico is desperately trying to clean up Biden’s disgusting comments, but they can’t even do that right,” Taylor Budowitch tweeted. “Lemire’s doctored transcript doesn’t even match his original reporting, which also failed to capture the correct context. Watch the video Jon Lemire and try again!”
Donald Trump Jr. ridiculed Lemire as well, pointing out that by coverup Biden’s comments, its Harris who benefits.”This wasn’t some accident from Politico,” he tweeted.
“Leftist hack Jon Lemire tried to do clean up for Team Kamala and lied about what was said to protect her. He didn’t realize that video was going to come out that would expose him as a liar and Dem propagandist!!!”
Biden’s team tried to clean up the mess from his growing scandal through a spokesman, who told NBC News Biden was referring to the comedian who supported Trump and insulted Puerto Rico.
The Harris campaign has leaned into a joke from comedian Tony Hinchcliffe during Sunday’s massive Trump rally at Madison Square Garden, using it to attack Trump in the waning days of the campaign as Harris’s hopes dim.
Vance hit Harris and her establishment media allies, challenging them to report Biden’s statement accurately.
“Will the networks that obsessively covered a joke from a comedian at a Trump rally cover the fact that the Kamala Harris campaign is insulting half of the country?” he tweeted. “Will they even report honestly on this disgusting behavior from our present leadership?”

Breitbart,Poll: Donald Trump Leading Kamala Harris by Three Points Nationally,"Former President Donald Trump is leading Vice President Kamala Harris by three-points nationally, according to a recent poll.
An AtlasIntel poll, conducted between October 25-29, 2024 of 3,032 likely voters, found that Trump was leading with 49.5 percent of support, while Harris received 47 percent of support.
Green Party candidate Jill Stein received 0.8 percent of support.
In a head-to-head race between Harris and Trump, 49.8 percent of likely voters expressed support for Trump, while 48.1 percent expressed support for Harris.
When asked which candidate they rejected “more,” 50.1 percent said Harris, while 48.6 percent said Trump.
The results of the AtlasIntell poll come as a New York Times/Siena College national poll found that Trump held a one-point lead over Harris, 47 percent to 46 percent.
Breitbart News’s Wendell Husebo has previously reported that early voting numbers, especially in swing states seem to be in “favor of” Trump.
Early vote trends in swing states favor of former President Donald Trump and suggest “the election will be over on election day before we know who votes,” political analyst Mark Halperin said Tuesday on The Morning Meeting.
In an Economist/YouGov survey, 39 percent of respondents expressed the belief that Trump would win, while 36 percent said they believed that Harris would win the election, and 25 percent of respondents said they were “not sure” which candidate would win.",29/10/2024
Breitbart,Bob Casey Faces Ad Blitz from Catholic Group Focusing on Democrats' Bigotry,"Embattled incumbent Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) is facing a new ad blitz from the conservative Frontiers of Freedom super PAC that focuses on the anti-Catholic bigotry of the Democratic Party.
As Breitbart News has reported, Frontiers of Freedom has been targeting vulnerable Democrats in states with large Latino and Catholic populations, starting in the southwest and moving to the industrial Midwest. Democrats have made the group’s message easier with Vice President Kamala Harris’s snub of the Al Smith charity dinner in New York earlier this month, and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s mock “communion” with an online influencer.
More recently, Harris said that she would not honor religious exemptions for religious people opposed to abortion.
The latest ads, in both English and Spanish below, note Democrats’ increasing hostility to the Catholic faith, but focus on Casey’s record specifically.
“Casey is a pro-abortion extremist supporting unrestricted, up-to-the-moment-of-birth abortions, paid for by taxpayers,” the ad says.
In a statement, Frontiers of Freedom explained:
[T]he super PAC is making a direct appeal to the 250,000 Hispanics who live in the Philadelphia area, airing two-minute Spanish-language ads on morning and evening news about the Casey’s and the Democrat Party’s record of anti-Catholic bigotry.
“Casey is particularly vulnerable because of his far-left record. When Hispanic voters—especially Hispanics who attend Catholic Mass—come to learn about their senator’s record of anti-Catholic bigotry, they are going to be stunned,” said George Landrith, president of Frontiers of Freedom.
…
The ad focuses on the candidates’ “cruel war” against the Little Sisters of the Poor, Democrats’ imposition of an “unconstitutional religious test” against Catholics nominated to serve in the federal judiciary, the left’s support of gender ideology, and their persecution of Catholics who uphold the Church’s teachings on life.
The group’s ads appear to have moved the needle, as many of the Democrats it has targeted face increasingly tough challenges in formerly safe states.

Breitbart,Major Pro-Harris Super PAC Airs Intimidating Ads in Predominantly Black Areas,"One of the largest super PACs backing Vice President Kamala Harris is targeting large black urban areas in swing-state cities with “creepy,” deceptive, and intimidating ads that ominously warn: your voting history is public and accessible to “friends, family, and neighbors.”
Future Forward, a super PAC supporting the Harris-Walz ticket, has launched an ad campaign in cities with large black populations, emphasizing that voter records indicating if individuals voted are public and easily accessible to community members.
The ads, which are being aired heavily in major swing-state cities like Atlanta, Detroit, Milwaukee, and Philadelphia, have raised eyebrows for their intimidating and quasi-official presentation.
One ad opens with a bold “election alert,” declaring in a stern and authoritative voice, “Who you vote for is private, but if you vote is public information.”
“After this election, your voter record will be updated, and your friends and family will be able to see how often you vote,” it continues, demanding viewers “do your civic duty” by voting.
Behind the text is an emblem reminiscent of an official government seal, which reads “National Voter Report,” giving the appearance of an official advisory.
Another ad explains that while “who you vote for is secret,” but “whether you vote is public information.”
“Your friends, family, and neighbors can look up your voting records,” it warns.
Future Forward PAC’s approach has generated criticism for its intimidating tone toward voters, many who may fear social repercussions for low turnout.
One social media user described it as an “extremely creepy” and “borderline threatening” message.
Another suggested the ads carry a “not-so-veiled threat,” while another described them as conjuring up “dystopian vibes.”
“This insane dystopian ad threatening ‘your friends and family’ will know if you voted or not is somehow very real and being aired by Kamala Harris’s allies across the country,” wrote one social media user.
“We are at the stage of the election where Dems are running ads threatening to name and publicly shame their low-propensity voters,” another stated.
The ad campaign reflects the Democratic Party’s focus on high-stakes swing states where black voter turnout is crucial to their electoral strategy. In 2020, urban black voter turnout helped secure Biden’s win, but recent polls show slipping support among black men and Hispanic voters. With Trump gaining ground, Future Forward PAC, backed by Silicon Valley donors, unleashed over $700 million to bolster Harris and other Democrats this cycle.
A dark money giant funded by key tech donors including Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings and secretive nonprofits like the Sixteen Thirty Fund, Future Forward PAC spent over $100 million backing Joe Biden in 2020, ranking as the third largest advertiser of the election. By 2024, the group had raised close to $400 million, with $25 million from its Super PAC and the rest from dark-money sources.
Future Forward remains central to Democratic efforts, bolstered by significant contributions from left-wing donors, including George Soros, Michael Bloomberg, and a slew of progressive billionaires. As Harris’s main super PAC, it received a $9 million donation from a fund tied to the League of Conservation Voters in August, alongside $3 million from Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz.
The PAC, the biggest spender in the campaign by far, aims to flood airwaves during the last weeks leading up to the election with pro-Harris ads and aggressively push for progressive policies through highly unconventional strategies.",29/10/2024
Breitbart,"Kamala Harris Surrenders in NC, Withdraws Nearly $2M Ad Spend","Democrat presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris is waving the white flag in North Carolina, surrendering the state to former President Donald Trump as her campaign withdraws nearly $2 million in planned ad buys from television stations statewide one week before the election.
The more than $1.7 million in canceled ad buys by Harris’s campaign in North Carolina suggests that her team believes, given polling data and early vote data, that the Tar Heel State is no longer in play for her.
Trump’s senior campaign adviser Chris LaCivita jumped at the news on Tuesday morning, celebrating Harris’s team giving up on the state one week before the election:
More than 3 million people have already voted in early voting in North Carolina, which can be done via mail-in absentee ballot or via in-person locations around the state. Republicans, interestingly, for the first time ever actually lead the early vote–North Carolina provides the partisan breakdown and demographic data on early voters in the state–something they have done now for more than a week. This remarkably consistent GOP lead has shocked political observers, and comes as demographic data also suggests Democrats face serious issues in competing at the top of the ticket in the state. Black voter turnout is down approximately 3 percent from 2020, and about 1 percent more men than women, as compared with 2020, are voting in the state. These strong headwinds against Harris in North Carolina were proving to be a major issue for her in the closing days of the campaign as she set to flip the only battleground state out of seven nationwide that Trump won in 2020. For comparison purposes, again Trump won North Carolina in 2020–and the electorate per the early voting data based on millions of votes cast so far suggests a much more GOP-friendly electorate even than then.
In addition, older voters are turning out in much higher numbers while younger voters are dropping off from last time:
So all of this makes sense as to why Harris would withdraw from the state in any serious way. Democrats also face similar issues in Arizona and Nevada, where Republicans also lead in both states. Georgia, meanwhile, does not provide partisan breakdown of voters since there is no partisan registration in the state but out of the millions who voted early there the demographic breakdown suggests major issues for Democrats in the Peach State. Cumulatively, the big picture of the data set publicly available seems to suggest that Democrats are losing the so-called “Sun Belt” states of North Carolina, Arizona, Nevada, and Georgia in a big way–forcing the race back up north to the upper “Rust Belt” states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Harris faces major problems in each of those places as well, and Trump seems to be making inroads beyond the traditional battlegrounds too as he seeks to compete in bluer states like Virginia, New Hampshire, Minnesota, and New Mexico.",29/10/2024
Breitbart,Exclusive -- Karoline Leavitt: Trump 'Has Not Taken One Day Off',"Former President Donald Trump has been out straight, not taking a single day off, and he has no plans to do so, Trump campaign national spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said during an appearance on Breitbart News Daily, walking through his plans as the election stands just one week away.
Leavitt said Trump and his team got to Florida around 2:00 a.m. Tuesday after being in Georgia for a full day of campaigning following the Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday.
“Today, President Trump is off to more states. He’ll be in more states. On Thursday, he’s literally traveling all over the country, hitting every single battleground state — Pennsylvania, Georgia, again, he’ll be in North Carolina, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, and Wisconsin — all over the next seven days. So it’s a busy schedule. We’ve been doing this now for 60 days straight,” she said, adding, “The president has not taken one day off, and he won’t be taking any time off between now and Election Day.”
“We are laser focused on winning,” she said, previewing “rally after rally after rally” in states all across the country over the next week, with multiple rallies packed into single days.
Meanwhile, Harris will be delivering her final campaign pitch Tuesday on Washington, DC’s Ellipse. Leavitt predicted it will fall short.
“Kamala giving her closing remarks today at the place where she thinks is the most effective for her campaign — I think we would respectfully disagree with that. I think going to a small business that’s struggling or going to the southern border might be a better closing message, because that’s what people actually care about,” Leavitt said.
“But Kamala is out of touch. Her closing message is that President Trump is a fascist, which is obviously not true. It’s a lie. It’s dangerous rhetoric. It’s dividing the country. It’s dishonest. Kamala doesn’t even believe it. She just can’t run on policy. She can’t run on her record. She’s been a disaster,” she said, contrasting Harris’s plans with Trump’s, as he held a press conference at Mar-a-Lago on Tuesday morning discussing the border crisis and real world consequences of the Biden-Harris open borders policies as countless Americans have lost loved ones to illegal immigrant criminals.
LISTEN:
“He’ll be speaking to the press and countering Kamala Harris’s message before she gives it, and driving home the sharp contrast between Harris and her closing message and himself and his closing message, which is very simple: Kamala broke it. President Trump is going to fix it. She broke the border, broke our economy, broke our standing in the world. Only President Trump has the solutions,” Leavitt added.

Breitbart,Fact Check: Harris Falsely Claims Trump Wants to 'Jail' Political Enemies,"CLAIM: Former President Donald Trump “wants” to jail his political opponents, Vice President Kamala Harris claimed on Tuesday during her partisan final campaign pitch in Washington, DC.
VERDICT: False. Donald Trump has repeatedly said his revenge will be the country’s massive success if he is reelected.
Moreover, Trump did not prosecute two-time failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton after he won in 2016.
Trump also indicated last week that he may pardon Hunter Biden.
“Unlike Donald Trump, I don’t believe people who disagree with me are the enemy. He wants to put them in jail,” she told supporters on the National Mall.
The DOJ, under the Biden-Harris administration, levied multiple indictments against the former president once it became clear he would be the Republican Party’s nominee.
“We gotta lock him up,” said Biden last week before backtracking on his remarks. “Lock up him politically. Lock him out, that’s what we have to do.”
Many of Trump’s allies were also prosecuted, such as Steve Bannon, who was released from federal prison on Tuesday.

Breitbart,"Harris Co-Chair: Biden's 'Garbage' Remarks 'Unfortunate', 'He Cleaned Them Up'","On Tuesday’s broadcast of CNN’s “Laura Coates Live,” Harris Campaign Co-Chair Mitch Landrieu stated that President Joe Biden’s comments about Trump supporters and garbage “were unfortunate.” And cleaned them up “by saying he was referring to the comments that were made that day by the seven speakers” and “cleaned them up a little bit and said, I’m not talking about human beings.”
Landrieu said, “First of all, the President cleaned that up later tonight by saying he was referring to the comments that were made that day by the seven speakers. Now, people want to watch two different split-screens. They should go back and look at all the speakers that spoke before [Trump] ascended to the stage and the speakers tonight at the Kamala Harris event. Ours was civic. It was civil. It was thoughtful. It was about coming together as one people. Nobody could watch those seven or eight speakers before Donald Trump and not believe that Donald Trump knew about it. The other thing that I would like to say about it is this: I know we’re concentrating on the comedian — the comedian’s language, which was awful. But there was nothing said that day that Donald Trump himself has not said, I think President Biden’s comments today were unfortunate. I think he cleaned them up a little bit and said, I’m not talking about human beings. Because when you begin to dehumanize individuals, it means you can do what you will with them.”

Breitbart,Poll Shows Vote on Florida Abortion Measure Could Be Extremely Close,"A survey shows a proposed abortion amendment in Florida garnering enough support to pass within the poll’s margin of error.
A Florida Atlantic University poll released on Tuesday found that the measure, called Amendment 4, has the support of 58 percent of voters, the Orlando Sentinel reported. That percentage is just short of the 60 percent needed to pass; however, the survey’s margin of error is ±3 percentage points, showing that the amendment could narrowly pass or fail.
Thirty-two percent of survey respondents say they are against the measure, while 11 percent are unsure. The survey was conducted with 913 registered Florida voters between Oct. 19-27. (It is not clear why the numbers add up to 101%.)
If Florida voters pass Amendment 4 with at least 60 percent support in November, the abortion amendment would undo the state’s six-week limit and basically create a permanent right to abortion in the state constitution that could only be undone with another ballot measure or an uphill legal battle. The abortion measure also essentially allows for abortions throughout pregnancy under certain conditions.
Amendment 4, bars the state from restricting abortion before viability, approximately 24 weeks, or later in pregnancy “when necessary to protect the patient’s health, as determined by the patient’s healthcare provider.”
It reads:
No law shall prohibit, penalize, delay, or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patient’s health, as determined by the patient’s healthcare provider. This amendment does not change the Legislature’s constitutional authority to require notification to a parent or guardian before a minor has an abortion.
The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) has come out against the amendment, saying it “threatens women’s safety.” The AHCA warned that the measure’s vague language could lead to the overturning of at least 20 abortion-related laws, including parental consent, if it is passed.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) has also spoken out against the abortion amendment and said it was “written in a way that’s intentionally designed to deceive voters.”
Various polls within the past few months have shown the amendment narrowly failing or passing, often within the margin of error (see here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, and here). A recent poll from the New York Times and Siena College showed the abortion measure with only 46 percent support — well below what is needed for passage.
Ballot measures are particularly effective as an offensive weapon because they are basically irreversible — they change a state constitution, take precedence over laws passed by state legislatures, and can only be overturned by another ballot measure or lengthy legal battles. Abortion ballot measures are typically propped up by left-wing organizations and affiliates with deep pockets — such as Planned Parenthood and the ACLU — out-of-state dark money groups, and billionaires with eugenicist leanings, oftentimes outspending pro-life organizations by double or triple. This year, some pro-abortion groups reported outraising pro-life groups 8-to-1.
READ MORE: These Ten States Have Abortion on the Ballot in November
Every single pro-abortion-related ballot measure since the fall of Roe has been successful. During the 2022 special elections, Kansans rejected a ballot measure that would have established that the state Constitution does not include a right to abortion. During the 2022 midterms, voters in California, Michigan, and Vermont codified abortion into their constitutions. At the same time, voters in Montana rejected a ballot measure that would have given rights to babies born alive in botched abortions. Voters in Kentucky also rejected an amendment similar to the one in Kansas. Last November, Ohioans also voted to codify the supposed right to abortion in their state Constitution via Issue 1.
The New York Times pointed out that none of those abortion measures have topped 60 percent support in those states. The highest total support was in Kansas in 2022, at 58.97 percent support.
The battle over the proposed abortion amendment in Florida is particularly high-stakes: Florida is the only state in the southeastern region of the United States that has abortion on the ballot in November, and all states in this region limit abortion completely or at six weeks, except for North Carolina, which limits abortions at 12 weeks. If Florida voters pass the amendment, the state would likely, once again, become an abortion destination state for the region.

Breitbart,Harris Claims Biden ‘Clarified’ Smear of Trump Supporters as ‘Garbage',"Vice President Kamala Harris claimed on Wednesday that President Joe Biden clarified his statement that Trump supporters are “garbage” and disagreed with demonizing “people based on who they vote for.”
“The only garbage I see floating out there is his [Trump] supporters,” Biden said Tuesday.

I respect the fact that we all have so much more in common than what separates us, and that most people want a president that understands that, that gets that and approaches their role of leadership that way. I’ve been very clear from my earliest years as a prosecutor.
“Do you sympathize with any voters who do feel offended by or insulted by the ‘garbage’ comment?” a reporter asked Harris, who dodged the question.
“I am ranked for President of the United States, I will be traveling to three states today,” she replied:
The White House, meanwhile, released a transcript of Biden’s smear and added an apostrophe to “supporters” and an em-dash to make it apparently change the meaning of Biden’s statement.
Trump also posted a response shortly after midnight:
While I am running a campaign of positive solutions to save America, Kamala Harris is running a campaign of hate. She has spent all week comparing her political opponents to the most evil mass murderers in history.
Now, on top of everything, Joe Biden calls our supporters “garbage.”
You can’t lead America if you don’t love the American People. Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have shown they are both unfit to be President of the United States.

Breitbart,Speaker Johnson: 'We're Going to Have a Demographic Shift in This Electorate',"Wednesday, during an appearance on FNC’s “Jesse Watters Primetime,” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) offered his predictions on what lies ahead for the November 5 election.
Johnson said he expected the turnout would show a “demographic shift.”
“So Speaker, the House no one talks about,” Watters asked. You hear about the Senate. No one talks about the House much. If Donald Trump wins back the White House and the Democrats control the House, what’s that going to look like?
“Well, they won’t, if they did, they would impeach Donald Trump on day one,” Johnson replied. “I mean, it would be an absolute disaster. But luckily, that is not going to happen, Jesse. I’ve been traveling around the country nonstop. I’ve done campaign events now in over 240 cities across 40 states. There is an energy out there. Something is happening. President Trump said that at Madison Square Garden the other night, he is exactly right. It is difficult to articulate, but there’s a real energy out there. We’re going to have a demographic shift in this electorate, Jesse. Mark my word: We’re going to have a record number of Hispanic and Latino voters who have come into the Republican Party, a record number of African American and Black voters. We are going to have a record number of Jewish voters, union workers — demographics that have not historically been with us in large numbers. They are there now.”
“I mean, her speech tonight — I had to listen to it, too because we were going to comment on it,” he continued. “I mean, it was empty. I mean, it was uninspired. It was angry. Eric said it right. There is no substance to Kamala Harris. People say she’s an empty suit. It’s worse than that. She’s actually a costume. She’s wearing a costume. She’s trying to be something that she’s not. And you said well earlier, her record, she had the most liberal voting record of the modern era in the U.S. Senate. She is a San Francisco radical. So, the empty campaign rhetoric is just not working. The people aren’t buying it, and they’re on our side. We’re going to grow the House Majority. We’re going to take back the Senate, and Donald J. Trump is going back to the White House, that’s what’s going to happen.”

Breitbart,Donald Trump Answers Biden: 'You Can’t Lead America if You Don’t Love the American People',"“You can’t lead America if you don’t love the American People,” former President Donald Trump responded in the uproar after President Joe Biden described millions of Republican supporters as “garbage.”
Trump tweeted his response shortly after midnight:
While I am running a campaign of positive solutions to save America, Kamala Harris is running a campaign of hate. She has spent all week comparing her political opponents to the most evil mass murderers in history. Now, on top of everything, Joe Biden calls our supporters “garbage.”
You can’t lead America if you don’t love the American People. Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have shown they are both unfit to be President of the United States.
I am proud to lead the biggest, broadest, and most important political coalition in American history. We are welcoming historic numbers of Latinos, African Americans, Asian Americans, and citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. It is my desire to be the President of all the people.
Biden’s “garbage” insult came as he and other Democrats were arguing that Trump’s alleged contempt for Latinos was revealed by a comedian at his rally in Madison Square Garden. The Associated Press reported Biden’s comments;
“Just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage. Well, let me tell you something, I don’t, I don’t know the Puerto Rican that I know, the Puerto Rico where I’m fr — in my home state of Delaware. They’re good, decent honorable people,” he said.
The president then added: “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American. It’s totally contrary to everything we’ve done, everything we’ve been.”
Trump’s description of Harris’ campaign as “a campaign of hate” comes after Harris, Biden, and many other Democrats smeared Trump and GOP voters as unAmerican, racists, fascists and Nazis.
For example, on October 28, Barack Obama said the Trump rally included “the most racist, sexist, bigoted stereotypes.”
On October 23, CNN host Anderson Cooper asked Harris “Do you think Donald Trump is a fascist?”
“Yes, I do. Yes, I do,” she replied.
In the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton described Trump’s supporters as “irredeemables” and as a “basket of deplorables.”",30/10/2024
Breitbart,Harris Co-Chair: 'Very Real Possibility' Harris Will Have 'Further Movement' Towards Stance That's More Critical of Israel,"On Tuesday’s “CNN News Central,” Harris-Walz Campaign Co-Chair Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) responded to a question on if 2024 Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris will change America’s policy towards Israel by stating that Harris and President Joe Biden have stood by Israel, while also being critical of it and there’s a “very real possibility that there will be further movement in that direction.”
After playing video of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) saying that he will push to change American policy towards Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if Harris is elected and that there’s a much better shot of changing American policy if Harris wins, co-host Brianna Keilar asked, “Do you think that Harris will change U.S. policy towards Netanyahu, as Sanders is saying she will?”
Coons responded, “Well, look, Sen. Sanders speaks for a lot of people who have concerns about Netanyahu’s future path. In fact, our caucus leader, our Majority Leader, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY), gave a speech on the floor of the Senate months ago now calling on a change in — calling on the Israeli people to make a change in direction in terms of their leadership. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have stood strongly by Israel, defending Israel when attacked by Iran, defending Israel against proxies in the region. But they have also raised repeated concerns about humanitarian issues in Gaza. And, just a few weeks ago, the secretary of state and secretary of defense sent a letter to the Israeli government saying, you have to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza, to not do so is a violation of law. I think that shows both the balance in the President and Vice President’s position, and the very real possibility that there will be further movement in that direction.”
He continued, “I agree with what the Senator said, which is former President Trump will do nothing to constrain Prime Minister Netanyahu, in terms of his chosen direction of imposing harsher and harsher consequences on the Palestinian people. We do need to remember that all of this is a result of Hamas and Hamas’ actions, both continuing to hold hostages beneath Gaza and conducting the war in a way that was designed to cause as many Palestinian casualties as possible.”
Keilar then asked, “Do you think that Harris will change U.S. policy towards Netanyahu? And does that mean — doesn’t that mean changing policy towards Israel? Isn’t this one and the same?”
Coons responded, “Well, it’s clear that you will have a more balanced policy with Vice President Harris. She has repeatedly expressed concern about the humanitarian consequences of this war, the Palestinian civilian deaths and the costs of it, while standing strongly by Israel. You haven’t heard a single expression from Donald Trump. So, if you have a choice between former President Trump and Vice President Harris, I think you’ll see a balanced approach towards the war in Gaza and keeping Israel safe, and you will not see that approach from Donald Trump.”

Breitbart,Report: The Kamala Harris Astroturf Machine Manipulates 'Community Notes' on Elon Musk's X/Twitter,"An investigation has revealed that the Kamala Harris presidential campaign is deceptively manipulating the “community notes” feature on Elon Musk’s X platform to censor criticism and spread election disinformation.
The Federalist reports that the Kamala Harris presidential campaign has been caught red-handed manipulating the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) in an effort to censor criticism and spread election disinformation. This revelation is part two of an ongoing investigation into how the Harris-Walz campaign is deceptively using online platforms to artificially manufacture consensus and skirt election laws. Previously, the investigation exposed the Harris campaign manipulating Reddit with a sophisticated astroturf machine run off of the Discord chat and community platform.
One specific goal of the campaign, as stated by a user on the Discord server, is to get volunteers to swarm X and “block [community notes] we don’t like.” Community Notes is a feature implemented by X’s owner, Elon Musk, to provide a more neutral way of dealing with misleading tweets. Select users can propose notes to be added to tweets, indicating that the information is wrong, misleading, or requires important context. Other users can then vote on the accuracy and necessity of the proposed notes.
Despite the Harris campaign’s official X accounts being conduits for disinformation and dishonest presentations of the Trump-Vance campaign, virtually none of their false and misleading tweets have Community Notes appended to them. This discrepancy is likely due to the campaign directing volunteers on its Discord server to vote down Community Notes, even when those notes accurately point out the campaign’s deceptive tactics.
The Harris-Walz Discord server also has a “Twitter (X) Community Notes Training” module, which teaches users how to quickly increase their “Rating Impact” to write their own Community Notes with a high enough status. Paid Democrat staffers are writing dubious Community Notes on X to undermine GOP and Trump messaging, then encouraging volunteers to rate them positively.
While X’s Community Notes upvoting system is designed to mitigate political bias better than Reddit’s, the Harris-Walz campaign’s attempt to manipulate the feature hasn’t been as successful. Nonetheless, their actions still grossly violate X’s Terms of Service, which prohibit artificially amplifying information.

Breitbart,CNN's Collins: 'Hard' to Buy Spin on Biden's 'Garbage' Comments When You Can Watch Video,"On Tuesday’s broadcast of CNN’s “The Source,” host Kaitlan Collins stated that it’s hard to buy the White House’s attempt to clean up President Joe Biden’s statement about supporters of 2024 Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump “when you can listen to it for yourself” by just watching the video of the remarks.
While speaking with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D), Collins played video where Biden said, “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. His — his — his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American.”
She then stated that “it sounds like he’s calling Trump supporters, there, garbage.”
Collins added, “[T]he White House is trying to say that what President Biden was saying — they’re putting an apostrophe there on ‘supporters’, saying it’s the singular, I guess referring to the comedian, that supporter’s comments. It’s hard to really look at that when you can listen to it for yourself.”

Breitbart,Nevada Measure Sets the Stage to Create Right to Abortion in 2026,"An amendment that would create a constitutional right to abortion is on the ballot in Nevada.
The measure is called Question 6, and would allow abortions until “fetal viability” for any reason, which is around 22 to 24 weeks of pregnancy. It would allow abortions throughout pregnancy “when necessary to protect the health or life of the pregnant individual.” It reads:
Should the Nevada Constitution be amended to create an individual’s fundamental right to an abortion, without interference by state or local governments, whenever the abortion is performed by a qualified healthcare professional until fetal viability or when necessary to protect the health or life of the pregnant individual at any point during the pregnancy?
If the proposed measure passes in November by a simple majority, it would have to pass again in 2026 before being added to the constitution, per state law.
According to the Nevada Secretary of State, a “no” vote would keep the state constitution in its current form and “would not impact the availability of abortion as a statutory right under Nevada law.”
In Nevada, a statute was upheld through a referendum vote in 1990 allowing abortion through 24 weeks of pregnancy. The law allows abortions throughout pregnancy when the life of the mother is in danger or for health reasons.
Nevada is one of ten states where abortion is on the ballot in November.
Ballot measures are particularly effective as an offensive weapon because they are basically irreversible — they change a state constitution, take precedence over laws passed by state legislatures, and can only be overturned by another ballot measure or lengthy legal battles. The measures are typically propped up by left-wing organizations and affiliates with deep pockets — such as Planned Parenthood and the ACLU — out-of-state dark money groups, and billionaires with eugenicist leanings, oftentimes outspending pro-life organizations by double or triple. This year, some pro-abortion groups reported outraising pro-life groups 8-to-1.

Breitbart,Poll: Trump Edges Out Harris in Battleground Michigan,"It is a tight race in battleground Michigan, where former President Donald Trump is edging out Vice President Kamala Harris by a sliver, according to a survey from Emerson College Polling/RealClearWorld.
The latest survey, released one week from the election, shows Trump taking a one-point lead in Michigan with 49 percent to Harris’s 48 percent support. This represents a slight shift from the October 10 survey, which showed Trump and Harris tied with 49 percent support each.
For greater perspective, in August, Harris had a three-point lead over Trump in this survey, which reduced to two points in September.
RELATED: Feel the Joy! Kamala Met with Awkward Silence When She Asks Everyone to Shout Their Name
C-SPANSpencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, said it is clear that this race in the state remains a toss up just one week out from the election.
With leaners, Trump maintains the lead, with 50 percent support to Harris’ 49 percent.
The survey also examined the Senate race, which is also tight, with Democrat Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) leading Republican Mike Rogers by two percentage points — 48 percent to the Republicans’ 46 percent.
Notably, independents break for Trump by two points — 47 percent to 45 percent — on the presidential ballot, but they lean Democrat in the Senate race, going for Slotkin over Rogers with a nine-point advantage.
More via the survey:
The top issue for Michigan votes is the economy at 48%, followed by immigration (9%), healthcare (9%), threats to democracy (8%), and abortion access (8%),
Voters who say the economy is their top issue break for Trump 63% to 33% and immigration 96% to 4%, while voters who find healthcare to be the top issue support Harris 72% to 23%, and threats to democracy 90% to 10%.
This survey, taken October 25-27, 2024, among 1,000 likely voters, has a +/- 3 percent margin of error. It coincides with two more Michigan surveys released this week, showing Trump up in the state as well.
A Patriot Polling survey released this week showed Trump leading by one percentage point in the swing state and independents swinging his way.
An InsiderPolling survey told a similar story, showing Trump up by one in the swing state.
Trump flipped Michigan for the first time in six presidential elections in 2016.
The current RealClearPolitics average of polls shows Harris up by an average of 0.3 percent in the state.",29/10/2024
Breitbart,More Celebrities Cancel Washington Post Subscriptions After Jeff Bezos Op-Ed Calling Paper Not Credible,"Hollywood screenwriter David Simon, creator of The Wire and We Own the City, announced that he had canceled his subscription to the Washington Post, adding his name to the many celebrities who announced that they were dumping the paper after the decision was made to cancel its endorsement of Kamala Harris for president.
Simon, a former Baltimore Sun journalist took to his X account and told his fans that he was canceling his subscription to the paper.
The writer blasted Post owner Jeff Bezos for the op ed he published in the wake of the decision not to endorse Kamala Harris (Or Donald Trump) for the election that is only a week away.
In his Monday op ed, Bezos wrote that Americans do not find his paper or the other, competing, papers either “credible” or “accurate” because of their obvious bias.
Bezos cited a poll that found that only 31 percent of Americans have any trust in the media. And he thinks it is time to begin to correct that trust deficit. This, he said, is why the paper did not make an endorsement for 2024.
That explanation, though, was not good enough for the far-left TV writer.
“Just read the insights of Jeff Bezos in his opinion piece in The Post,” Simon exclaimed in his X post. “I wasn’t going to join 200,000 others and cancel my subscription because doing so won’t hurt Bezos — he paid more for his yachts than his newspaper — and, yes, the Post newsroom where good people, and some friends still labor continues providing meaningful journalism. But, my god, this man’s insipid defense of his own transparent cowardice is provoking.”
So, Simon admitted, “I cancelled.”
“I wasn’t going to do it. I probably shouldn’t, and certainly, if this technobrat oligarch ever releases his grip on what needs to be an independent newsroom and editorial board, indifferent to the financial positions of its publisher, then I’ll return. But this kind of abuse of a public trust by a publisher is unacceptable,” he bloviated.
But Simon was not alone. A growing list of other celebrities, including far-left horror writer Stephen King, film directors Paul Feig and Rob Reiner, Star Wars actor Mark Hammill, actors Jeffrey Wright, Bradley Whitford, George Takei, and Jon Cryer, and more.

Breitbart,Job Creators Network Unleashes Massive Times Square Billboard: 'KAMALA BROKE IT … TRUMP WILL FIX IT',"Job Creators Network, America’s largest small business advocacy group, is back with another massive billboard in the heart of Times Square New York, this time reminding Empire State residents and passersby that the issues facing the nation, from rampant crime to illegal immigration, the crushing cost of food and energy, didn’t exist when former president Donald Trump left office but all exploded under President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.
“With one week left before Election Day, we are making the closing case to American voters that Kamala Harris is the status quo candidate that has kneecapped the economy, left the southern border wide open, and compromised the American Dream,” Alfredo Ortiz, Chief Executive Officer of the Job Creators Network, said in a statement.
“Meanwhile, as the billboard emphasizes, Donald Trump will help—as Harris previously put it—‘turn the page’ on this disaster.”
The billboard comes at a critical juncture in the campaign for Harris, where voters, still ranking the economy the numbers one issue in the election, say they trust Trump more on fiscal issues.
Breitbart’s John Carney notes:
When asked who is best able to handle the issue of inflation, 51 percent of registered voters view Trump as better, according to the Wall Street Journal. Forty-three percent say Harris. Trump’s lead is actually larger than it was in August, when the Wall Street Journal found that 48 percent said Trump would be better on inflation and 43 percent said Harris.
Last month, Job Creators Network rolled out a rotating billboard in Times Square, highlighting the harsh economic reality millions of Americans face under Biden and Harris. The massive ads, meant to “dismantle campaign spin from the Democrats by showing how consumer prices are still rising even as the inflation rate falls,” were timed just ahead of the primetime debate between Harris and Trump.

Breitbart,Fact Check: Kamala Harris Claims Trump Sent 'Armed Mob' to U.S. Capitol,"CLAIM: Vice President Kamala Harris claimed that former President Donald Trump “sent an armed mob” to the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021.
VERDICT: False.
While speaking from the Ellipse in Washington, DC, on Tuesday night, Harris delivered her closing statements. In her closing statement, Harris claimed that Trump had “sent an armed mob” to the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, though the riot had started even before Trump finished speaking.
“We know who Donald Trump is,” Harris told the crowd. “He is the person who stood at this very spot nearly four years ago and sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol to overturn the will of the people in a free and fair election. An election that he knew he lost.”
Harris’s comments come as other Democrats, such as President Joe Biden have also claimed that Trump “encouraged” protesters to go to the Capitol.
As Breitbart News’s Bradley Jaye has previously reported, Trump has previously “countered that not only did he authorize additional security after protesters entered the Capitol but in fact had requested and approved National Guard troops in advance”:
Trump countered that not only did he authorize additional security after protestors entered the Capitol but in fact had requested and approved National Guard troops in advance — information which was omitted by Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s anti-Trump J6 Committee.
“I was all set to bring in the National Guard,” Trump said, bashing the committee for only releasing information strategically to damage Trump. “They heard that, they say them coming, and they left immediately.”
Breitbart News’s Joel Pollak has previously reported that former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) ended up walking back a claim that Trump “incited” the riot on January 6.
Pollak noted that “the question of incitement” was key to Democrats’ argument against Trump during his second impeachment trial, adding that Trump’s defense team, at the time, pointed out that the riot had already started prior to Trump finishing his speech:
The question of incitement was central to Democrats’ argument against Trump in his second impeachment trial. Trump’s defense team noted that the riot had begun before Trump finished speaking, and that he explicitly told supporters: “I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.”
Byron York, chief political correspondent with the Washington Examiner, wrote in the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal in October 2021, that of roughly “670 people” who had been charged in the January 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, there were “82” who were facing “weapons-related charges”:
For each charge, prosecutors have specified the weapon the defendant is accused of using. Here is a representative list of those weapons: A helmet. A baton. A crutch. A walking stick. Handgun. Pepper spray. Flagpole. Knife. Baseball bat. Crowd control barrier. Police shield. Hockey stick. Axe. Metal sign. Desk drawer.
Obviously, guns are the most serious concern. Of the 670, five suspects — Christopher Michael Alberts, Lonnie Leroy Coffman, Mark Sami Ibrahim, Cleveland Grover Meredith Jr. and Guy Wesley Reffitt — are charged with possessing firearms. But none are charged with using them during the riot.
York continued:
The big picture: Only a small percentage of the people at the “armed insurrection” were armed with anything. And just five of them — less than 1% of those charged — have been charged with possessing firearms, which are the traditional weapon of choice for modern armed insurrectionists. One of them didn’t even arrive until after it was all over. And none fired the weapons. And that is the problem with the “armed insurrection” talking point.
York added in his article that while what occurred on January 6 was a “riot” and “there was fighting” and “property damage,” the Department of Justice prosecutions did “not make the case that” it had been an “armed insurrection.”
In a post on X, Trump also called for protesters to “remain peaceful” and for “no violence.”
“I am asking for everyone at the U.S. Capitol to remain peaceful,” Trump wrote. “No violence! Remember, WE are the Party of Law & Order – respect the Law and our great men and women in Blue. Thank you!”",29/10/2024
Breitbart,Wife of Miami Dolphins Star: 'A Vote for Kamala is a Vote for War',"Devon Mostert, the wife of Miami Dolphins running back Raheem Mostert, has come out against Vice President Kamala Harris, saying that a vote for her would be a vote for war.
In an Instagram Story on Tuesday, Mostert shared a segment from former Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard’s speech at Madison Square Garden in which she said that Harris could cause nuclear war in the future.
“An attack on America is going to happen. It’s not a matter (of) if … it’s a matter of when. AS HEARTBREAKING AS THAT IS (and I pray every day it doesn’t) … but it’s only a matter of a time. And a draft WILL happen,” Mostert said.
Mostert then took a swipe at the Biden administration for its withdrawal from Afghanistan and said a vote for Kamala Harris would be a “vote for war.”
“The side who doesn’t even acknowledge our fallen military service members?!?! The Biden administration’s (*let’s NOT forget, Kamala is currently the VP) withdrawal from Afghanistan was HORRIFIC – killed 13 of our own and left our allies for slaughter by the Taliban! Kamala said during the debate, ‘there is no one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone in any war zone around the world – the first time this century.’ – THAT’S A LIE,” she said.
“A vote for Kamala is a vote for war. NOBODY on the international stage is going to take HER seriously,” she concluded.
As noted by Fox News, Mostert recently generated backlash when she knocked Kamala’s criticism of Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for his emergency response to Hurricanes Helene and Milton.
“I really don’t think that Kamala’s comments about him add up,” Mostert told Fox News. “He is focused on taking care of his Floridians, and that’s exactly where his focus should be.”
Mostert said she received racist backlash for her comments.",29/10/2024
Breitbart,James Woods Rips Biden Calling Trump Voters 'Garbage': 'Send This Worthless Fool Back to His Basement',"Actor James Woods sounded off on Tuesday after President Joe Biden referred to Trump voters as “garbage” just as before Vice President Kamala Harris could deliver her closing argument.
Sharing a clip of the president’s comments on social media, Woods said, “So, here is the president calling any American voting for the Republican candidate ‘floating pieces of garbage.’ Let’s send this worthless fool back to his basement, send his cackling border czar back to San Francisco, and reclaim America from these vermin.”
President Joe Biden overshadowed Vice President Kamala Harris’s closing argument just one week before the election by trashing American voters and calling Trump supporters “garbage.” She delivered her closing argument in front of the White House on Tuesday night, but soon-to-be former President Joe Biden said the following in an interview just before her speech: “Donald Trump has no character. He doesn’t give a damn about the Latino community … just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage? … The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.”
The president was referring to statements made by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe during former President Donald Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden in which he referred to the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, home to American citizens, as a “floating island of garbage.”
After serious political blowback from both Democrats and Republicans, Biden sent out a social media post attempting to spin comments as just being about the comedian Trump’s campaign had on stage at Madison Square Garden on Sunday.
“Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage—which is the only word I can think of to describe it. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation,” the president said.
The president and the White House spin of his comments on Tuesday have not resonated, with even Democrats and CNN saying his statement was directed at Trump voters. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) said that he disagrees with the president’s statement and that he does not hold his view.
“I’m giving you my fresh reaction to it. I would never insult the good people of Pennsylvania or any Americans even if they chose to support a candidate that I didn’t support,” said Shapiro.",30/10/2024
Breitbart,Canada’s Liberals Call for Secret Ballot to Oust Prime Minister Trudeau,"Members of the Liberal Party of Canada are calling for a secret ballot to determine if Prime Minister Justin Trudeau should step down as the leader of the party, Canadian media reported on Monday.
“I’m very much in favor of a secret ballot. I think it’s time that we clear the air,” Liberal MP Helena Jaczek told CTV News on Monday.
Jaczek said she had “no idea” if Trudeau would reconsider his determination to remain as party leader and prime minister candidate against the Conservative Party, which is currently about 20 points ahead in the polls.
“I would hope that he is considering what he heard from his caucus, from a number of people in his caucus, I think that is significant. Our duty is to report to the prime minister what is going on in our constituencies, and a number of people shared that information,” she said.
Jaczek was referring to a feisty caucus meeting last Wednesday in which Liberal back-benchers lashed out at the increasingly unpopular Trudeau and asked him to step aside.
The unhappy Liberals wrote Trudeau a letter, setting Monday as the deadline to make his decision, but he did not even wait that long, insisting shortly after the caucus meeting that he would remain as party leader.
“I do think that a secret ballot where everyone agrees to accept the results of that vote would help ensure unity with the caucus, unity within our party,” Ontario MP Yvan Baker told CTV, seconding Jaczek’s sentiments.
“Frankly, a secret ballot is the best way for MPs to vote without being worried about consequences or attribution of any kind,” Baker added, pointing to one of the major reasons the rebels want a secret ballot. Some of them are convinced the number of Liberals who wish to oust Trudeau is much larger than the handful who have signed a petition to that effect, but they are afraid to speak out because Trudeau will retaliate against them.
Liberal MP Sean Casey, an outspoken Trudeau critic who signed the petition, seemed confident a secret ballot would draw far more anti-Trudeau votes than the petition has.
“He’s convinced he’s the right guy. I think he’s getting bad advice,” Casey said of the prime minister.
Some of Trudeau’s critics wistfully suggested he was only putting on a show by insisting he will stand for election again because the moment he agreed to resign he would become a crippled lame duck. Others sounded notes of weary resignation, suggesting they want a secret ballot so they can take some concrete action to clear their consciences, even if the ballot fails and Trudeau remains.
The vast majority of the Liberal caucus seems unwilling to force Trudeau out, and so does the majority of the Liberal electorate. CTV cited polls that said only 32 percent of Liberal voters think Trudeau should step aside, while 52 percent want him to remain.
Trudeau’s cabinet rallied in his defense on Tuesday and rejected the secret ballot idea, insisting it is time to “move on” from the notion of dumping the party leader.
“If you want to express yourself in the Liberal caucus, you stand up and talk. But the Prime Minister has been very clear: he’s the Leader. He’s going to take us into the next election,” said Employment Minister Randy Boissonnault.
Other cabinet ministers argued that continuing to talk pointlessly about jettisoning Trudeau would only weaken the Liberal Party in a tough race against the Conservatives and their leader, Pierre Poilievre.
“One thing that unites us all is we want to beat Poilievre and we have to remain focused on organizing and planning a campaign to do that,” said Tourism Minister Soraya Martinez Ferrada.
Not everyone in the caucus thinks they can beat Poilievre and a few of the most apprehensive Liberals are talking about bailing out.
“I’m a Liberal and I’m a proud Liberal, but there’s also a time when I’m going to have to look in the mirror and say, ‘OK, what do I do here? How do I sit in a caucus where I don’t really agree with who’s leading that caucus?’” New Brunswick MP Wayne Long told the Times-Colonist on Monday.
“That’s just something I think to myself, and I think maybe a lot of other MPs are just going to have to decide for themselves over the coming day or week,” Long said.
Long, and any other Liberals who feel as he does, might need to start packing their parachutes quickly. Next Tuesday brings a deadline set by the Bloc Quebecois party to receive certain legislative concessions from the Liberals. If they do not get what they want, the Bloc has threatened to throw in with the Conservatives to hold a no-confidence vote and bring the Trudeau administration down. Trudeau has survived a few recent confidence votes, but only with the help of the Bloc Quebecois.
“The Bloc has received absolutely nothing from Justin Trudeau. Trudeau offered them nothing. It’s time for the Bloc to work for Quebecers rather than working for Trudeau and vote for a carbon tax election,” Conservative leader Poilievre taunted at a press conference on Monday.",29/10/2024
Breitbart,"JD Vance Rips Tim Walz's Video Game Gaffe, Low Football IQ","Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance ripped Democrat VP candidate Tim Walz over his recent campaign video game event launched to try and make an appeal to young male voters.
Walz, who has touted his time as a high school football coach — though he was just an assistant — but despite his celebrated manliness, the Harris-Walz Democrat ticket seems to be bleeding support among young male voters. So, to solve that voter deficit, Walz recently hosted an event during a livestream event to play Madden football on Twitch.
Walz, though, made a strange comment during the live stream when he insisted that New York Democrat Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez “could run a mean pick 6,” Fox News reported.
“And I can call an audible on the play,” Walz added. “We both know that if you take the time to draw up a playbook, you’re gonna use it.”
Informed football fans, though, quickly pointed out that a “pick six” is not a play but the result of a defensive player making an interception and running the ball for a six-point touchdown.
Vance piled on.
“Those of you that know football know that you don’t run a pick-six. A pick-six is something that happens accidentally on the football field. You run like a spread offense or a West Coast offense,” Vance needled.
Vance also noted that a real football guy would know all this, especially if he was supposed to be a coach. He even joked that Trump knows “more about working at McDonald’s than Kamala Harris does,” in reference to Donald Trump’s popular McDonald’s campaign event, where he worked at a McDonald’s.
“Politics is a little absurd from time to time, and sometimes we oughta poke fun at the absurdity of our political process,” Vance added.

Breitbart,"Colonies Owe UK a 'Debt of Gratitude', Says Tory Leadership Candidate","Conservative Party leadership hopeful Robert Jenrick rebuked the growing call for reparations to Caribbean countries and argued that former British colonies instead owe the United Kingdom a “debt of gratitude” for the enduring institutions leftover from the Empire.
While the governing Labour Party has fallen into kowtow mode in the face of demands from anti-British leftist radicals and Caribbean politicians to hand over reparations for historical colonialism, former immigration minister Robert Jenrick has called for a rejection of the “bizarre, unpatriotic belief that we should be embarrassed about our history.”
“It has seeped into our national debate through universities overrun by Leftists peddling pseudo-Marxist gibberish to impressionable undergraduates,” the Conservative MP wrote in the Daily Mail, adding: “Our island story is remarkable in many ways. One thing we have never been, however, is uniquely bad.”
The Tory leadership contender, who has tracked to the right while facing off with former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch to replace failed PM Rishi Sunak at the helm of the Conservative party, called for a more “balanced” approach to British history, in which the ills of the past are acknowledged while at the same time being “proud” the Empire’s achievements.
“I’m not ashamed of our history. It may not feel like it, but many of our former colonies – amid the complex realities of Empire – owe us a debt of gratitude for the inheritance we left them,” he declared.
Jenrick pointed to the various British political and judicial institutions which have remained largely intact in post-colonial nations to this day and noted that countries that the Empire previously ruled are in a far better position than ex-colonies of other European powers, such as France.
The Conservative leadership candidate’s article comes as members of the Labour Party are urging Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to consider reparations for slavery and colonialism.
MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy, for example, argued that reparations are needed to confront “the deep-rooted inequalities that still shape our world today.”
While Starmer initially said that London would not consider financial payments to former colonies, the prime minister appeared to potentially walk this back by signing a Commonwealth communique calling for “discussions on reparatory justice with regards to the trans-Atlantic trade in enslaved Africans and chattel enslavement” to come to a “a common future based on equity”.
Conversely, Jenrick put forward that Britain has already made great sacrifices in atoning for historical wrongs, such as the great expense, in both blood and treasure, spent to eradicate the Transatlantic slave trade by the British, which the former immigration minister said “cost an estimated 1.8 per cent of our GDP between 1808 and 1867 – over twice what we spend on overseas aid today.”
“The British Empire broke the long chain of violent tyranny as we came to introduce – gradually and imperfectly – Christian values,” the MP wrote.
Jenrick also contended that Britain could have preserved much of its Empire had it chosen not to take on the scourge of Nazi Germany but, under the leadership of Sir Winston Churchill, “willingly gave up our imperial treasures” for the betterment of others.
“The result was a free Europe, and a lost Empire. Of that we can be proud,” he proclaimed.",30/10/2024
Breitbart,‘Trump Wins Big’ Meme Stock Surges in China,"A private company in China with a name that riffs on “Trump Victory” surged by ten percent in value on Monday and Tuesday, even as blue-chip stocks on the Chinese market slid by up to one percent.
The stock in question is for a company called Wisesoft in English, whose Chinese name is “Chuan Da Zhi Sheng.” The name becomes something of a pun in Mandarin Chinese, because it sounds like “Trump Victory,” or more precisely, “Trump Wins Big.”
Chinese investors are fond of choosing obscure stocks based on their amusing names, or “meme stocks,” as analysts call them. At the dawn of the Year of the Dragon in 2023, stocks whose names alluded to dragons sold extremely well.
“It’s fair to say that China’s stock market still lacks maturity, and investors often act irrationally,” market researcher Wang Zichen sighed to the Hindustan Times on Wednesday.
The “Trump Wins Big” stock definitely seems to sell more briskly when Chinese investors are feeling bullish about Donald Trump’s political fortunes. The stock exploded in value when Trump launched his 2016 presidential campaign, for example. It surged again in October when Trump’s social media company reportedly surpassed Elon Musk’s X in market valuation.
“The stock has doubled to 19.98 yuan (US$2.80) over the past month, against an around 20 per cent rise of the index on China’s stimulus plan,” the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Tuesday.
Sadly for Wisesoft’s investors and management, the company’s actual products do not ride Donald Trump’s coattails. Wisesoft makes computer hardware and software for air-traffic controllers. About 90 percent of its customers are in China. The company has been posting quarterly losses for years, including a $3.8 million loss for the first nine months of 2024.",30/10/2024
Breitbart,"ADP Says Private Sector Added 233,0000 Jobs, More Than Twice Expectations","U.S. businesses added 233,000 jobs in October, marking the strongest employment gain in over a year, according to new data from payroll processor ADP.
Economists had forecast just 115,000 new jobs for October in the ADP report.
While ADP’s monthly data has historically been an imperfect predictor of the government’s official employment figures, trends in the two reports typically align over time. ADP now says that its survey is not intended to predict the official figures. Instead, it aims to provide an independent assessment of the labor market.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics, expected to release its employment figures this Friday, is anticipated to report a more modest 110,000 new jobs added in October. The lower forecast for the government’s report partly reflects challenges such as the recent Boeing strike and disruptions caused by Hurricanes Milton and Helene, both of which are expected to impact October’s job numbers.
The much stronger-than-expected results is likely to bring further scrutiny of the decision last month by the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point. The Fed said it was cutting to fend off further weakness in the labor market—but the October ADP figures show no signs of softness.
Manufacturing employment fell in the month, while mining and construction added jobs. The biggest source of job growth was private education and health services, where employment expanded by 53,000. Trade, transportation, and utilities added 51,0000 jobs, leisure and hospitality added 37,000 jobs, and professional and business services added 31,000.",30/10/2024
Breitbart,Fact Check: Kamala Harris Falsely Claims Trump Would Impose A National Sales Tax,"Claim: Kamala Harris on Tuesday night accused Donald Trump of proposing a national sales tax.
Harris said that Trump would pay for his proposed tax cuts with a “20 percent national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported.”
Verdict: False.
President Trump has not proposed a national sales tax.
Harris was likely referring to Trump’s proposal to raise tariffs on imports. Tariffs are paid by companies that import goods from abroad and not by consumers. They are not a sales tax.
Studies of the tariffs Trump imposed during his 2017-2021 term have shown that some of the cost of tariffs ultimately fell on importers and some fell on the exporting countries. The tariffs were not passed through to consumers and did not act as a tax on households, as the low level of consumer inflation during the Trump years shows.
Tariffs do not tend to raise consumer prices. As Mary Amiti of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Research and Statistics Group, Princeton University’s Stephen Redding, and Columbia University’s David Weinstein wrote in one of the most widely cited studies of Trump’s tariffs, “trade theory has long stressed that tariffs applied by a large country should drive down foreign prices.” (That study was not friendly to tariffs, by the way. It concluded that U.S. firms paid for most of the tariffs. But it did not find that the tariffs were passed through from businesses to households.)
As Breitbart Business Digest explained:
When Trump came into office on a promise of tearing up international agreements and imposing tariffs, many of his critics were quick to claim the president was starting a trade war. Establishment economic forecasters on the left and right confidently predicted that Trump’s tariffs would hurt the U.S. economy and raise consumer prices.
Eight years ago, these claims were at least plausible on their face. It had been generations since the U.S. had invoked a muscular trade strategy that included broad tariffs rather than just piecemeal tariffs on products that were illegally being dumped into U.S. markets. The anti-tariff crowd did not have much evidence to support their claims, but it had been so long since we had used trade tariffs strategically that there was not all that much direct evidence on the other pro-tariff side either.
What Trump had on his side was economic theory. You would not know it from the way many economists talk about tariffs, but standard economic theory supports Trump’s claim that tariffs are often paid for by the country whose exports are subject to the increased duties and not by the country importing the goods. Trade theory has long found that tariffs applied by a large economy such as the U.S. tend to drive down foreign prices, as exporting nations have no other choice to offload their excess production.
In fact, it’s long been known to economists that imposing a tariff can improve the terms of trade so much that domestic prices of imported goods subject to the tariff actually fall. This is known as the Metzler Paradox after economist Lloyd Metzler who first wrote about the idea all the way back in 1949. What’s more, by increasing the incentives to invest in domestic production, the tariffs can increase global output of the tariffed goods, which also puts downward pressure on prices.
Price theory also tells us that tariffs are unlikely to raise consumer prices. Although many people imagine that the prices they pay at the cash register are an accumulation of the costs of their inputs, the reality is pretty much the opposite. Consumer demand determines the price of the final product, which then determines the prices of the components and labor that go into making the product. So, when a tariff raises the cost of imports, in a competitive economy there’s no real way for merchants to pass on the cost.
In any case, imports make up only a small portion of consumer purchases so even if the cost of tariffs were passed through to consumers, the effect would not amount to a national sales tax.
There were similar claims that tariffs would raise consumer prices when Trump imposed tariffs in 2019 but consumer prices did not rise.",29/10/2024
Breitbart,Karoline Leavitt: Democrat Party Has Turned into the 'Anti-Trump Party',"The Democrat party has morphed into the “anti-Trump party,” Trump campaign national spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said during an appearance on Breitbart News Daily ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris delivering her final campaign message on the D.C. Ellipse.
“It’s the closing argument. I think it makes it very simple for voters, right? You can’t really elect someone who created the problem in hopes that they will solve the problem. She has a chance to solve it right now. She’s sitting — she and Joe Biden sit in the White House. They could craft policy. They could secure the border with the sign of a pen. They’ve refused to do so for years now, and have allowed this open border invasion to continue,” Leavitt said, blasting Harris for running on fixing the country, when she could have done precisely that for that last three and a half years.
WATCH — MSNBC’s Menendez: People Have “the Audacity” to Demand Harris Tell Them More About Plans:
“So Kamala is running to fix the country that she broke, and it just doesn’t work. It’s like hiring the arsonist to put out the fire,” she added, noting that the left and establishment media are “trying to convince people not to believe their own eyes.”
“They’ve done this with the border. They did it with the economy. They said Biden almost was working. They said the border was secure. Now they’re trying to say that the president was exhausted — just total BS. People see him campaigning all over the country, holding massive rallies at Madison Square Garden and in every state. You know, their message is not based on reality, and that’s why it’s failing,” she said, blasting Harris’s final message, as she has continued to embrace the “Trump is Hitler” rhetoric espoused by her counterparts.
“It’s disgusting that this is their closing pitch, and that’s what the Democrat party has turned into: The anti-Trump party, not the party that stands for anything,” she said, explaining that they exist to stand against Trump and “spread these lies.”
LISTEN:
“And you know how they know it’s lies and they don’t actually believe themselves? … If you look at Democrats in blue wall states, Michigan and Wisconsin and Minnesota, where President Trump is either leading or closing the gap, Democrats that are running for Senate or the House in those states are running ads cozying up to President Trump, saying that they worked with him on legislation,” she said, noting that anyone who really believed Trump was akin to Hitler would not cozy up to him.
“You don’t cozy up to Hitler, ok? And that’s how you know they don’t actually believe this lie. … It’s really quite sad, but it’s very dangerous, and it’s dividing our country, and it has already led to two assassinations on President Trump’s life, which makes it … even worse,” she added.

Breitbart,"Biden Rejects Accusations of Irrelevancy and Heads to Scranton, Pennsylvania, on Campaign Trail","Departing President Joe Biden on Monday rejected allegations he has been ignored and abandoned by Vice President Kamala Harris on the campaign trail, confidently asserting he was bound for his hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, to prove the doubters wrong.
AP reports Biden, in an exchange with reporters, played down the fact he hasn’t campaigned side-by-side with Harris since their joint Labor Day campaign appearance in Pittsburgh and he’s held few public campaign appearances with Democrats in the competitive races that could turn the voting tide.
“I’ve done a lot of surrogate stuff, and the fact of the matter is that I’ve also had to continue to be president at the same time,” the octogenarian told media representatives after casting his early vote on Monday in his home state of Delaware.
Biden maintained he and Harris still “talk all the time.” He added he has also made several visits to battleground states in his official capacity in recent months, and he plans to do more campaigning in the days ahead in Pennsylvania, including his childhood hometown of Scranton (population 75,682).

Biden’s claim of relevancy to the Harris campaign defies other reports he is simply being ignored as the nowhere man, as Breitbart News reported.
Three people told Axios the Harris campaign keeps saying they’ll get back to Trump’s team on when to send him out into the field – and then simply move on.
The Harris campaign views Biden as a political liability since his defenestration but doesn’t want to say directly they have no need for his efforts.
Democrats and some of Biden’s staff keep walking on eggshells around Biden’s delicate sensibilities even as he delivers obscure and sometimes self-contradictory attacks when he is allowed out for campaigning.

Breitbart,Trump Campaign on Harris Dark Speech: She Lies to Cover Results of 'Her Terrible Policies',"The Trump campaign said that Vice President Kamala Harris lied, name-called, and clung to the past in her closing argument speech “to avoid admitting the truth” about her and President Joe Biden’s “terrible policies.”
After Harris trashed Trump in her highly partisan remarks, which were packed with insults and lies, at the Ellipse in Washington, DC, Trump Campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt issued a statement.
“Kamala Harris is lying, name-calling, and clinging to the past to avoid admitting the truth — the migrant crime crisis, sky-high inflation, and raging world wars are the result of her terrible policies,” Leavitt said.
“Kamala’s first day in office was over 1,300 days ago, and she has spent the past four years working hand-in-hand with Joe Biden to destroy our country – but now, she is lying about her record because she has zero policy solutions to offer,” she added.
Leavitt concluded that Trump’s closing argument “is simple: Kamala broke it; he will fix it.”
Harris opted to open her speech with a vicious attack on Trump, who she has begun equating to a fascist and a “petty tyrant” in the home stretch of the campaign.
“This is not a candidate for president who is thinking about how to make your life better. This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power, ” Harris said after baselessly and falsely claiming Trump would use the military against American citizens if elected.
Hours earlier, Trump, who faced two assassination attempts in recent months, was highly critical of Harris and her nasty rhetoric, saying she is running a campaign of “absolute hate.”
“She’s running on a campaign of demoralization and really a campaign of destruction,” Trump said. “But really, perhaps more than anything else, it’s a campaign of hate, a campaign of absolute hate.”",29/10/2024
Breitbart,Anonymous Harris Aides Try to Reframe Campaign with Fresh Assessment,"Anonymous Harris campaign officials tried to reframe the presidential race on Monday in a positive light by leaking an internal assessment to the New York Times.
The spin, which may or may not be true, is a drastic change from what the Harris campaign’s previously signaled: that it was an underdog in a deadlocked race.
The reorientation follows weeks of negative headlines for the Harris campaign and the appearance of it losing momentum to former President Donald Trump, who appears to be enjoying the campaign trail.
Anonymous Harris officials indicated the campaign is “cautiously optimistic” about Vice President Kamala Harris’s “chances of victory, saying the race is shifting in her favor” in battleground states.
National and swing state polling suggests Harris and Trump are virtually tied. Early voter data, which is more valuable than polling at this point in the race, indicates a stronger position for Trump, although it is unclear if the data will continue to trend in the right direction.
The Times’ Reid J. Epstein, Lisa Lerer and Maggie Haberman reported the Harris campaign shift in tone:
Top Democratic strategists are increasingly hopeful that the campaign’s attempts to cast former President Donald J. Trump as a fascist — paired with an expansive battleground-state operation and strength among female voters still energized by the end of federal abortion rights — will carry Ms. Harris to a narrow triumph. Even some close to Mr. Trump worry that the push to label him a budding dictator who has praised Hitler could move small but potentially meaningful numbers of persuadable voters
…
Officials within the Harris campaign and people with whom they have shared candid assessments believe she remains in a solid position in the Northern “blue wall” states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, saying internal polling shows her slightly ahead in all three — though by as little as half a percentage point.
They think she remains competitive across the four Sun Belt battleground states. Arizona and North Carolina appear to be the toughest swing states for Ms. Harris, these Democrats said, and they feel better about Georgia and Nevada.

They think, we have seen that movie, I can live with it for four more years. It’s not the same movie. It’s the sequel to Scream where it’s that much bloodier.”

Breitbart,"Assassination Tool: Fitness App Strava Exposes Location of Donald Trump, Other World Leaders","An investigation by French newspaper Le Monde has revealed that the confidential movements of former President Donald Trump, a target of multiple assassination attempts, as well as other world leaders can be easily tracked online through the fitness app Strava, which is used by multiple Secret Service members along with other protective details worldwide.
AP News reports that the French newspaper Le Monde has uncovered a significant security vulnerability that allows the confidential movements of world leaders, including former President Donald Trump, Kamala Harris, and other prominent figures like French President Emmanuel Macron, to be easily tracked online. The investigation found that some of the security personnel tasked with protecting these high-profile individuals use the popular fitness app Strava, which records and shares their workouts with a global community.
Le Monde‘s journalists identified 26 U.S. Secret Service agents, 12 members of the French Security Group of the Presidency of the Republic (GSPR), and six members of the Russian Federal Protection Service (FSO), all responsible for presidential security, who had public accounts on Strava. By tracking the movements of these bodyguards, the newspaper was able to pinpoint the locations of the leaders they protect, even when the trips were meant to be private and not listed on official agendas.
In one example, Le Monde traced the Strava activity of French President Emmanuel Macron’s bodyguards to determine that he had spent a weekend in the Normandy seaside resort of Honfleur in 2021, despite the trip not being on his official schedule. Similarly, the whereabouts of First Ladies Melania Trump and Jill Biden could also be determined by tracking their bodyguards’ Strava profiles.
The U.S. Secret Service, in a statement to Le Monde, said that while its staff are not allowed to use personal electronic devices while on duty during protective assignments, they do not prohibit employees from using social media in their personal time. The Secret Service stated that they do not believe the protection provided was compromised and that they will review the information to determine if additional training or guidance is necessary.
However, the potential security risks associated with fitness apps like Strava raise concerns about the need for better regulations on how tech companies can use consumer data. Ibrahim Baggili, a computer scientist and professor of cybersecurity at Louisiana State University, has conducted research exposing how bad actors could exploit fitness app data to track potential victims, creating risks for stalking, robbery, and other crimes.
Identifying the presidential bodyguards by name on Strava could also lead to the discovery of other personal information, such as their home addresses, family members, and social media posts, which could be used for malicious purposes. This highlights the importance of data privacy and the need for individuals, especially those in sensitive positions, to be cautious about the information they share online.

Breitbart,"Exclusive -- John Ondrasik, 'Five for Fighting,' Launches Song, Yellow Ribbon Campaign for Israeli Hostages","Grammy-nominated musician John Ondrasik, also known as “Five for Fighting,” released a new song on Tuesday, “Song for the Hostages,” and launched a yellow ribbon campaign to renew awareness about the 101 Israelis still in captivity.
Ondrasik is not Jewish, but was deeply affected by the October 7 terror attacks, and has been one of the foremost voices in the arts for taking action to ensure the release of the hostages, at least half of whom may still be alive.
He recorded a song, “OK (We Are Not OK),” as a tribute to the victims, and his latest song focuses on the hostages.
The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year:
Why are you doing this?” Mr. Ondrasik says people always want to know. He isn’t Jewish. He doesn’t have relatives in Israel. He’s from Southern California and his heritage is Slovak. But, he says, “I’m human.” In Tel Aviv he told the crowd, “One doesn’t have to be Jewish to support Israel in their fight—sorry, our fight—for freedom, democracy, life, civilization, against those who want to tear it down.”
He has traveled to Israel to perform in Tel Aviv’s hostage square; he has collaborated with Jewish reggae star Matisyahu — who has been the target of antisemitic boycotts — and Israeli world music legend Iran Raichel.
But the point, Ondrasik stressed Tuesday in an interview with Breitbart News, is to bring the hostages home — and, until they are freed, to “flood” the families of the hostages with compassion, so that they know they are not forgotten.
“It always comes back to: what would Andrew [Breitbart] do?” Ondrasik said. He said that he is focused on “proactive measures that we can take to fight the good fight,” especially in the arts.
While the fate of the hostages depends on the whims of a terrorist organization, or the fortunes of Israel’s military and diplomatic efforts, there is much that the arts can do to raise awareness worldwide, and to pressure governments to press for the hostages’ freedom.
Ondrasik’s poetic style has always had an instant emotional resonance, from one of his earliest hits, “100 Years,” to “OK (We Are Not OK),” which was shared widely despite having no formal support from the music industry.
After performing in Israel, Ondrasik began working on the yellow ribbon campaign with the families of hostages, including American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who was found murdered by Hamas in southern Gaza in August.
While he could not save Hersh, he says, “as a human being, I felt an obligation to write something for [the hostages] — not just to express my heartbreak for them, but not to let the world forget their plight.” On Tuesday, he published an op-ed in the Washington Post, announcing his song and the yellow ribbon campaign, and urging Americans to say the hostages’ names, and to keep them foremost in mind. (There are still four American citizens being held hostage.)
In November, he is traveling to Cornell University in Ithaca, New York — a hotbed of anti-Israel radicalism — to perform alongside actress Patricia Heaton, who has also been outspoken, as a Christian, about the Israeli hostages.
“You go to the belly of the beast,” Ondrasik told Breitbart News. “You try to save the kids who’ve been indoctrinated.
“You let them know there’s a counter-narrative, and you try to give them some education they may not have received, but you also try to stand up to the bullies.”
He hopes, someday soon, to perform at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), his alma mater, where some of the most violent anti-Israel protests took place earlier this year.
For now, he is asking fans to post their own yellow-ribbon submissions for the “#LetOurHostageGo” campaign.

Breitbart,"Harris: Down Payment Assistance Won't Raise Prices Because It Increases Demand, Which Will Impact Supply","On Tuesday’s broadcast of New York’s Power 105.1’s “The Breakfast Club,” 2024 Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris argued that her proposed down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers won’t “have an unintended effect, because that increases the demand for home ownership, which is going to have an impact, also, on supply.” And talked about parts of her plan to boost housing supply.
Harris said, “$25,000 down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers, let me tell you why that’s not going to have an unintended effect, because that increases the demand for home ownership, which is going to have an impact, also, on supply. What we are — part of my plan — I’ve been in public service my entire career, but I know the limitations of government. So, part of my plan for affordable housing is to work with homebuilders and developers to give them tax credits to create incentives for them to build more homes. But I’m going to tell you another part of my perspective on this, I also know that, in particular, for high rent, a lot of it has to do with corporations that are buying up all this housing and then eliminating competition and jacking up rent. And part of my plan is to also go after them.”

Breitbart,Biden Puts Spin on ‘Garbage’ Comments About Trump Voters,"President Joe Biden late Tuesday evening sent out a social media post attempting to spin comments he made calling former President Donald Trump’s supporters “garbage” as just being about the comedian Trump’s campaign had on stage at Madison Square Garden on Sunday.
“Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage—which is the only word I can think of to describe it. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation,” the president said.
President Joe Biden overshadowed Vice President Kamala Harris’s closing argument just one week before the election by trashing American voters and calling Trump supporters “garbage.” She delivered her closing argument in front of the White House on Tuesday night, but soon-to-be former President Joe Biden said the following in an interview just before her speech: “Donald Trump has no character. He doesn’t give a damn about the Latino community … just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage? … The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.”
The president was referring to statements made by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe during former President Donald Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden in which he referred to the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, home to American citizens, as a “floating island of garbage.”
The president and the White House spin of his comments on Tuesday have not resonated, with even Democrats and CNN saying his statement was directed at Trump voters.
Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) said that he disagrees with the president’s statement and that he does not hold his view.
“I’m giving you my fresh reaction to it. I would never insult the good people of Pennsylvania or any Americans even if they chose to support a candidate that I didn’t support,” said Shapiro.",29/10/2024
Breitbart,Hawkins: Self-Defense the 'Central Component' of the Second Amendment,"The Second Amendment references a militia, “the security of a free State,” and two specific rights–the right to possess arms and the right to carry them–and all of this is bound together by a general, overarching right to self-defense.
To put it simply, the Second Amendment is multi-faceted.
It is multi-faceted in the following ways: It makes clear the importance of the people being able to come together in militia, noting that such a militia must be “well regulated.” In other words, that militia must be well ordered. It warns that “the security of a free state” rests on the reality and performance of such a militia and then points specifically to the people’s right to “keep” arms and to “bear” arms, that is, the right to possess arms and to carry them.
Despite the numerous and different aspects of the Second Amendment, it remains simple to understand because all the aspects of it are held together by a central component, and that component is self-defense.
In the majority opinion for McDonald v. Chicago (2010), United States Supreme Court justice Samuel Alito wrote, “Self-defense is a basic right, recognized by many legal systems from ancient times to the present day, and in Heller, we held that individual self-defense is ‘the central component’ of the Second Amendment right.”
I like to present it this way when speaking to groups and organizations around the country: “Self-defense is the hinge on which the door of the Second Amendment swings.”
What does this mean for the American people? It means that while the Second Amendment protects guns, it protects other tools that can be used for self-defense as well. The “central component” of the Second Amendment is not a 9mm pistol or a .357 Magnum revolver, but the right to defend one’s own life and liberty with whatever tools are in common use for such defense in each period of America’s existence.
For example, the Massachusetts Supreme Court recently struck down that state’s ban on switchblades and issued an opinion which said, in part, “While both Heller and Bruen involved handguns, Second Amendment protections subsume more than just firearms.”
Your life is your most valuable possession, and the Founding Fathers put the Second Amendment in place to protect your right to defend that life. The vast majority of Americans believe a firearm is the best way to protect their lives, and the Second Amendment has them covered. A number of other Americans believe a knife or other tool is the best means for protecting their lives, and the Second Amendment has them covered as well.

Breitbart,Poll: One in Five Concerned that the Election Will Not Be Fair,"One in five Americans have concerns that the presidential election will not be fair, the latest weekly survey from the Economist/YouGov revealed.
The survey asked respondents, “How much confidence do you have that the 2024 presidential election will be held fairly?”
Across the board, just 29 percent said they gave a “great deal” of confidence it will be fair, followed by 18 percent who said they have “quite a bit” of confidence.
Nearly a quarter, 24 percent, said they have a “moderate” amount of confidence, while 22 percent either have a “little” confidence or none at all. Of those, nine percent said they have “none at all.” Another six percent remain unsure.
Democrats are far more confident that the election will be fair than Republicans, as 55 percent have a “great deal” of confidence, compared to just nine percent of Republicans and 22 percent of independents who said the same.
Another 23 percent of Democrats have “quite a bit” of confidence, while 36 percent of Republicans said they had a “moderate” amount of confidence, followed by 25 percent who have “only a little” confidence and 12 percent who said they have no confidence at all.
The survey was taken October 19-22, 2024, among 1,615 adult American citizens.
The revamped Republican National Committee (RNC) anticipated these concerns earlier this year and launched a massive election integrity program, which now boasts over 200,000 volunteers to “protect the vote.”
These poll watchers will also work with the guidance of lawyers via State Republican War Rooms. As the RNC announced, there is an “Election Integrity Hotline” in every battleground state.
Per the RNC’s press release:
The State Republican War Room is the command center where lawyers will field all incoming questions and issues reported by poll watchers and voters statewide. Lawyers will guide poll watchers through the appropriate election code and provide clarity on how various issues should be answered, resolved, or escalated. This system will be operational from the first day of early voting through election day – and afterward if necessary.
Under the leadership of Chairman Whatley and Co-Chair Trump, the RNC is executing an unprecedented legal strategy, fighting in courtrooms across the country. We will deliver a pro-active litigation effort every time election officials are breaking the law as well as intervene to defend commonsense election law safeguards under Democrat attack.
The RNC team of lawyers is already aggressively engaging in legal battles around the country. So far this cycle, the RNC has engaged in 82 election integrity lawsuits in 25 states.
“We are also sending a loud and clear message out there to anyone who thinks about cheating in an election. If you cheat in an election, we will find you, we will track you down and we will prosecute you to the full extent of the law,” RNC co-chair Lara Trump said over the summer.

Breitbart,Report: NY Democrat Rep. Grace Meng Had Meetings with CCP Officials,"An investigation is shedding light on Rep. Grace Meng (D-NY) and her reported meetings with Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials.
In a report published Tuesday, the Daily Caller said Meng has had several meetings with “CCP officials and intel personnel alongside a civic association she was listed as belonging to for years, a Daily Caller News Foundation investigation discovered.”
The news comes after Gov. Kathy Hochul’s former aide, Linda Sun, who is an alleged Chinese spy, was reported to have toured the White House in May, according to Breitbart News.
Sun was under federal investigation at the time, according to the New York Post. Her White House visit was purportedly facilitated by Sun’s former boss, identified as Meng:
The Daily Caller article continued:
The six-term congresswoman has publicly toasted CCP intel chiefs, awarded congressional commendations to Communist Party bosses and received numerous gifts during more than a dozen events welcoming Chinese government delegations to New York City since 2008, according to a DCNF review of hundreds of Chinese government, media and civic association reports.
The report said Meng went to the events with leaders of the Chinese civic group she joined in 2008 as its deputy chairwoman. The group was called the Henan Association of Eastern America (HAEA).
“After being elected to Congress in 2012, Meng continued to meet with Chinese officials and maintained an ‘honorary’ role in HAEA, raising concerns among China experts over her connections to CCP intelligence operations and an accused Chinese agent,” the article reads.
Her image was featured on the HAEA’s home page for quite some time until the site was deleted in September “following DCNF reports on her years-long involvement in the organization,” the report noted.
Meng has since denied she ever had an official position with the group, claiming she merely had an “honorary title” during her time with the organization.
In July, Meng stood behind President Joe Biden (D) when people were calling for him to step out of the presidential race after his disastrous debate performance, according to Breitbart News.
“Let’s focus on the work ahead and get ready to beat Trump and MAGA extremists in November by reelecting President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris,” she said.
Harris later replaced Biden in the race for the White House. It is interesting to note that her running mate, radical leftist Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), reportedly had a “secret fling” with the daughter of a CCP official when he was in China, per Breitbart News.",29/10/2024

Breitbart,"Bar Complaint Filed Against '65 Project' for Lawfare, Intimidating Potential Trump Lawyers","The America First Legal foundation filed a Bar complaint in Utah on Monday against Michael Teter, director of The 65 Project, a left-wing “lawfare” group that has been threatening potential lawyers for Donald Trump with sanctions.
As Breitbart News has reported, the 65 Project is a “dark money” organization that bullied Trump’s lawyers in 2020 and which is “now warning potential Trump attorneys that they could be disbarred for working for him.” The 65 Project is running ads on social media telling attorneys they could lose their “law license[s]” by working for Trump.
Breitbart News noted:
As Breitbart News reported in 2022, Project 65 was launched with help from David Brock, the Hillary Clinton ally behind such groups as Media Matters. It does not disclose its donors, but has “ties to Democratic Party heavyweights,” Axios reported.
As Breitbart News later reported, Project 65’s “ongoing efforts to prosecute, disbar, and smear attorneys who served as election lawyers for President Donald Trump’s 2020 campaign could leave Republicans short of legal talent for the election fight in November 2024.” Some 100 attorneys have reportedly been targeted.
Now, Project 65 is threatening attorneys who simply might be considering working for Trump, suggesting in the ad that merely representing him could “endanger” their “standing with the bar.”
The America First complaint seizes on evidence that then-Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY), a member of the January 6 Committee, communicated with anti-Trump witness Cassidy Hutchinson without her attorney, Stefan Passantino, present. Media outlets reported — falsely — at the time that Passantino had coached Hutchinson to lie to the panel. Passantino is suing MSNBC analyst Andrew Weissman for defamation for repeating that claim nearly a year later.
The 65 Project filed a bar complaint against Passantino in early 2023, signed by Teter, who filed “nearly 100 ethics complaints against lawyers aligned with President Trump, signing them all himself,” America First Legal notes.
But Teter had no personal knowledge of the accusations against Passantino, “which have now been proven false by the work of the Committee on House Administration Subcommittee on Oversight,” America First Legal adds.
In a statement, the foundation goes on to allege that Teter and the 65 Project are violating fundamental constitutional rights to legal representation by seeking to intimidate future attorneys for Trump (original emphasis):
Last month, The 65 Project began running advertisements online and in legal journals in swing states with the message: “Don’t lose your law license because of Trump.” These ads appear to seek to intimidate lawyers who might be inclined to represent President Trump in the future from doing so.
Mr. Teter’s numerous misconduct complaints appear to be based on a simple premise: attorneys should not represent President Trump or anyone associated with him, and President Trump and his associates are not entitled to legal representation or zealous advocacy.
Mr. Passantino and the other attorneys attacked by Mr. Teter and other, similarly motivated groups, sought to represent their clients in the face of widespread condemnation both inside and outside of the legal profession. They embody the highest ideal of the legal profession: that, in our system, everyone is entitled to legal representation.
Mr. Teter’s boilerplate complaints appear to exhibit a fundamental lack of professionalism toward his fellow lawyers and an extreme disdain for President Trump and his associates. His underlying message is clear: Some people are not worthy of representation, and those who dare to represent them will be punished.
It appears that Mr. Teter sought misconduct sanctions against Mr. Passantino, and many others, for an improper purpose. He appears to have abused the grievance process to treat these attorneys uniformly, as a class, with the intention of creating a “culture of deterrence” and impacting an immeasurable number of attorneys who might represent President Trump in the future.
The America First Legal foundation has also filed a Bar complaint against Cheney for her role in the controversy.

Breitbart,"WH Adds Apostrophe to Biden's 'Garbage' Remark, Says He Meant Trump 'Supporter's'","The White House released a transcript of President Joe Biden’s remarks in which he called Trump supporters “garbage,” but added an apostrophe to “supporters” and an em-dash to make it seem like he did not mean all Trump supporters but just one.
The transcript read:
And just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a ‘floating island of garbage.’ Well, let me tell you something. I don’t — I — I don’t know the Puerto Rican that — that I know — or a Puerto Rico, where I’m fr- — in my home state of Delaware, they’re good, decent, honorable people. The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter’s — his — his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American. It’s totally contrary to everything we’ve done, everything we’ve been.
Biden’s account then posted a statement on X to reinforce the claim he meant one Trump supporter, presumably comic Tony Hincliffe, who performed at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally.
The Biden account posted:
Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage — which is the only word I can think of to describe it. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation.
Hincliffe — a comic who has a history of making edgy jokes — joked at the rally: “I don’t know if you guys know this, but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it’s called Puerto Rico.”
Since that rally, which saw a line-up of speakers that included a diverse lineup of speakers, including Elon Musk, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and former Democrat Tulsi Gabbard, Democrats have tried to use Hincliffe’s joke to claim that Trump is racist towards Latinos.
Now, Democrats have found themselves trying to defend Biden’s comments instead.

Breitbart,The Price of Garbage Is Up 18.5% Under Biden-Harris,"The prices Americans pay for garbage collection have jumped 18.5 percent since Joe Biden and Kamala Harris entered the White House, according to data from the U.S. Department of Labor.

The Harris campaign was scrambling on Wednesday after Biden called Trump’s supporters “garbage” in an interview. Biden has said he only meant to refer to some of Trump’s supporters.
“The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters,” Biden said.

Breitbart,Video: Robert De Niro Calls Trump ‘A Piece of Sh*t’ at Harris Pennsylvania Rally,"Days before President Joe Biden called the tens of millions of Americans who support former President Donald Trump “garbage,” Hollywood actor Robert De Niro called Trump “a piece of shit” while speaking at a rally in Pennsylvania for Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign.
“It makes me so fucking angry that we’re here talking about a piece of shit like Donald Trump,” De Niro said, eliciting cheers from the audience.
Watch Below:
As Breitbart News reported, De Niro joined fellow actor Leonardo Di Caprio, along with several other celebrity elites, in an attempt to boost Harris in the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania on Saturday.
Notably, the Raging Bull star’s “piece of shit” remark came just before President Joe Biden attacked millions of Americans by calling Trump supporters “garbage.”
“Donald Trump has no character. He doesn’t give a damn about the Latino community — just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage?” Biden said, adding, “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.”
Actor James Woods shared the clip of Biden trashing millions of Americans to social media, telling the public, “Let’s send this worthless fool back to his basement, send his cackling border czar back to San Francisco, and reclaim America from these vermin.”
Watch Below:
The president was referring to statements made by roast comedian Tony Hinchcliffe during Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden in which he referred to the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico as a floating island of garbage during a stand-up bit.
Biden, who is not a roast comedian, faced heavy backlash from both Democrats and Republicans for his remarks. The soon-to-be former president then issued a follow-up statement to social media in an attempt to spin the narrative as just being about Hinchcliffe.
“Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage — which is the only word I can think of to describe it,” Biden said. “His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation.”
“Does anyone actually believe Joe Biden wrote this at 11 o’clock last night? Does it even remotely sound like him? We heard him he was very clear… Surprisingly clear for Joe Biden,” Donald Trump Jr. reacted.
“The hate of the Harris Biden administration is shining through & no intern is going to cover it up!” he added.

Breitbart,Kamala Harris Vows to Unite 'All Americans’ After Calling Trump a 'Fascist',"Vice President Kamala Harris claimed on Tuesday during her campaign’s partisan closing pitch in Washington, DC, that she would be a “president for all Americans.”
Harris’s claim appears disingenuous after she told CNN last week that former President Donald Trump is a “fascist” and a threat to democracy.
Trump, who received tens of millions of votes in 2020 and 2016, represents a large portion of the electorate.
Nevertheless, Harris told supporters on the National Mall that she pledged to “seek common ground” and that she is “not looking to score political points.”
She also promised to “listen” to people “who disagree” with her, “unlike Donald Trump,” she said, who claimed he wants to “put them in jail.”
“This is not a candidate for president who is thinking about how to make your life better. This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power,” she continued.
“I pledge to be a president for all Americans — to always put country above party and above self,” she added. “We have to stop pointing fingers and start locking arms. It is time to turn the page on the drama and the conflict, the fear and division. It is time for a new generation of leadership in America.”
Moments before Harris spoke, on WISN 12 NEWS in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, she refused to walk back inflammatory statements by Gov. Tim Walz (D). Her running mate equated Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden to a 1939 Nazi rally at the New York City arena:
Trump believes the Democrat rhetoric puts his life in harm’s way. “She’s going out and only criticizing, talking about Hitler and Nazi because her record is horrible,” Trump said Tuesday at Mar a Lago.
“Perhaps more than anything else, it’s a campaign of hate, a campaign of absolute hate,” he said. “After two assassination attempts in just over three months, her lies and her slanders are very shameful and really inexcusable.”

Political commentator Eddie Glaude said, “Trump is an echo of something old.”
Burns said, “Yes, very, very old. There is the answer: This is where we do it. History is the answer. Right? There is precedent for this. We know there’s precedent. I love these speeches of Lincoln that go one way, Old Testament, really tough, at the second inaugural, ‘If it takes 500 years of the blood drawn by the lash then drawn by the sword’ and suddenly he pivots to, ‘with malice toward none.’ But think about his address to Congress in 1862, what we call the State of the Union. He says, ‘Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history. The fiery trials through which we pass will light us down in honor or dishonor to the latest generation.’ It means this is now.”
He continued, “Put it on the line right now. Are you for this democracy? Are you for this first-time experiment in all of human history that said we will trust people to govern themselves? That we will be virtuous? Is that guy virtuous in any way?”
Burns added, “He ends the whole thing as Attorney General Holder said, ‘We are the last best hope of earth.’ So if we are the last best hope of Earth, we have a responsibility next Tuesday to do the right thing and say, we reject this. We are for things. We are not against things. We are for things. We hold some truths to be self-evident. We are in the job of perfecting this union and that’s the thing that will put her over.”

Breitbart,Puerto Rico Senator to Endorse Trump at Pennsylvania Rally,"Zoraida Buxo, one of Puerto Rico’s nonpartisan shadow senators, will officially endorse former President Donald Trump at his rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday.
NBC News’s Dasha Burns was the first to report that Buxo will speak at the rally, which will be “heavy on Puerto Rican speakers,” and journalist Jack Posobiec reported that Buxo will announce her support for Trump.
Buxo, who was elected in 2021 to the delegation that advocates for statehood, posted a statement from Trump on Monday, saying he is “firmly committed to the process where Puerto Ricans might resolve their status according to Constitutional and Congressional protocols.”
“As president I will do my part to insure that Congress follows the Constitution,” he added. “The will of the Puerto Rican people in any status referendum should be considered as Congress follows through on any desired change in status for Puerto Rico, including statehood.
Buxo said Trump is the candidate Puerto Rico “needs.”
“Don’t have the slightest doubt, [Donald Trump] is the firm leader that PR needs to take us out of territorial limbo and do justice,” she wrote in a post on X.
“In 2016, support for respecting the will of the electorate and providing a constitutionally valid process was expressed. TODAY IT IS REAFFIRMED,” Buxo added.
As the Associated Press noted, 53 percent of Puerto Ricans voted in favor of statehood in the 2020 referendum.
Her support for Trump and forthcoming appearance at his rally Tuesday, which is slated for 7:00 p.m. Eastern, comes as Democrats desperately try to make hay out of roast-style comedian Tony Hinchcliffe’s disparaging joke about Puerto Rico during Trump’s historic rally at Madison Square Garden.
The joke, which was dubbed Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage,” fell flat with MAGA supporters in the arena, and the Trump campaign distanced itself from Hinchcliffe’s remarks.
In an interview published Tuesday, Trump told ABC News Senior Congressional Reporter Rachel Scott he does not know Hinchcliffe.
“I don’t know him, someone put him up there. I don’t know who he is,” Trump said, adding he had not seen the rally performance.
Democrats are seizing on the joke as Hispanic voters seem to be laughing off the media’s effort to manufacture outrage, as Breitbart News reported. Hispanic-dense Miami-Dade continued to trend red following the rally after the GOP took the advantage in the combined mail-in and early voting numbers last week.",29/10/2024

It’s what i started doing when I was chosen back in the sixth grade to write a weekly column about my activities in my elementary school for my hometown paper in New Rochelle, New York. Those are the roots to me growing into an NBC news correspondent. That’s why when we launched this program in 2008 now the longest running daytime program on MSNBC we called it “Andrea Mitchell Reports.” Our hour has been driven by my reporting on politics and foreign policy, as well as reporting of the best correspondence in the field.

Breitbart,Populist French Leader Jordan Bardella Praises Trump's 'Patriotism',"The president of France’s populist National Rally party expressed his support for former President Donald Trump, praising the Republican candidate for his devotion to “patriotism” and his commitment to putting his country’s people first.
Jordan Bardella, the 29-year-old political rockstar who serves as Marine Le Pen’s deputy and the president of her National Rally party, joined the growing number of European politicians backing Donald Trump.
In comments reported by CNews, the anti-mass migration French MEP said: “Donald Trump defends the interests of Americans.”
“What is clear is that Donald Trump defends the interests of Americans and defends a form of American pride. I like this patriotism,” Bardella continued.
“I like these political leaders who also put the interests of their own people and the interests of their country and their nation, perhaps before those of others.”
Bardella, who led his party to a strong victory in the European Parliament elections earlier this year and who currently stands as a leading contender to become Prime Minister of France in 2027, is not alone among prominent politicians across the pond in expressing support for the Republican presidential hopeful.
Although the establishment media on both sides of the Atlantic have often sought to portray Trump as having alienated European allies, a growing cadre of prominent figures have begun to support his candidacy.
In July, Geert Wilders, the Dutch populist leader and the main power player behind the coalition government in The Netherlands, endorsed the former president’s bid to return to the White House.
“I trust the 45th President will become the 47th President. No one deserves it more than President Trump,” Wilders said.
This year, Trump also secured the endorsement of former British Prime Minister Liz Truss, who said in April that she was fearful of a “very, very serious conflict” breaking out and that “under Donald Trump when he was president of the United States, the world was safer.”
The endorsement from the former UK leader echoed sentiments long expressed by Trump’s chief ally in Britain, Brexit leader Nigel Farage, who said this summer that it is “absolutely vital” for the Western world and peace in Europe that the former president returns to power.
Perhaps the loudest voice in Europe calling for Trump’s return has been Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, whose country shares a border with Ukraine.
Orbán, one of the EU’s chief advocates for striking a peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow, said earlier this year that he believes only Trump is “strong enough” to end the war in Europe.
“My personal conviction remains that if, in February 2022, the American president had been called Donald Trump, there would be no more war in Europe. Today, I don’t see anyone other than him, neither in Europe nor in America, who is a leader strong enough to stop the war,” the Hungarian leader declared.",29/10/2024
Breitbart,White House Clarified Biden's 'Garbage' Smear on Trump Supporters Without Speaking to Biden,"President Joe Biden’s aides defended his smear of Donald Trump’s supporters Tuesday night by clarifying his words despite not speaking to the president after his unscripted comments, a report suggests.
White House aides insisted Biden’s comment that “the only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters” does not reference Trump’s supporters but comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who made a joke during a Trump rally that the Harris campaign has latched onto.
The White House released a transcript of Biden’s remarks in a flimsy effort to suggest Biden referenced Hinchcliffe.
Axios‘s Alex Thompson reports a White House spokesperson refused to answer on the record when asked if aides had spoken to Biden before issuing the statement.
“Asked if they had spoken to the president to ask him what he meant before sending the transcript, the Biden spokesperson requested to go off the record,” Thompson wrote. “Axios declined and the White House did not respond further.”
Even before Thompson’s revelation, the White House’s characterization of Biden’s wording clearly contradicted his statement. But by refusing to confirm they had spoken with Biden after his gaffe, the already tenuous official White House clarification of Biden’s comments is further undermined.
It is unknown how Biden’s aides could have divined his intent — in unwritten, off-the-cuff remarks — without having spoken to him. And the White House’s bungled response simply adds fuel to the fire.
Vice President Kamala Harris has not commented on the escalating scandal, which has overshadowed her Tuesday night rally — intended to be her final appeal to voters — and threatens to derail her campaign.
Biden’s remarks are already being compared to Hillary Clinton’s “basket of deplorable” comment about Trump’s supporters in 2016. Trump went on to win that election.

Breitbart,Supreme Court: Youngkin Can Remove Noncitizens from Virginia Voter Rolls,"WASHINGTON, DC – Federal law allows Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) to stop noncitizen voting by removing noncitizens from Virginia voter rolls, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered on Wednesday in a massive win for President Donald Trump, Republicans, and election integrity supporters.
Youngkin removed 6,303 noncitizens from the voter rolls in Virginia between January 2022 when he took office and July 2024, pursuant to a state law in place since 2006. Then in August, Youngkin issued an executive order (EO) directing election officials to continue this program in advance of November’s election.
Under Youngkin’s EO, if a person getting a driver’s license checked a box on the license application saying that the person is not a U.S. citizen, but somehow that person eventually ended up on the voter rolls anyway – almost certainly by later registering to vote – election officials would send that person a letter informing them that it is illegal for noncitizens to vote, and that if the person did not show proof of citizenship to election officials within 14 days of receiving the letter, their names will be removed from Virginia’s voter rolls.
In addition to the initial 6,300, another 1,600 persons have been removed from voter lists in the Old Dominion pursuant to Youngkin’s EO.
The Biden-Harris Department of Justice (DOJ) sued Youngkin, claiming that the 90-day “quiet period” in the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA, or “Motor Voter”) does not allow these removals for three months prior to Election Day. DOJ argued that perhaps all of these noncitizens had since become U.S. citizens or had checked the wrong box when they told the government they were not citizens.
Youngkin and Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares (R) fought back, explaining that while NVRA does not allow “systematic” removals during the 90-day window before an election, these 1,600 were instead individualized removals on a case-by-case basis because these individuals voters had individually declared they were not citizens.
The case went to a liberal federal trial judge in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, who ruled in favor of Biden and Harris and ordered those noncitizens restored to the voter rolls by Election Day. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit – one of the most liberal appellate courts in the nation – affirmed that judgment, though acknowledging that part of the trial judge’s order was unworkable.
Youngkin applied to the U.S. Supreme Court to issue a stay that would block the lower court’s order, directed to Chief Justice John Roberts as the justice who supervises the Fourth Circuit. President Trump supported Youngkin’s fight, and the Republican National Committee (RNC) filed a brief supporting Youngkin. Roberts received legal briefs from both sides and circulated them to his colleagues Tuesday night.
RELATED — Trump: Non-Citizens Being on Virginia Voter Rolls Is “Election Interference”
C-SPANOn Wednesday morning, the Supreme Court issued the stay by a 6-3 vote, upholding Youngkin’s EO and keeping the noncitizens off the voter rolls in Virginia. This stay will remain in place while the Fourth Circuit goes through the full appeals process in the months ahead, after which the losing side can ask the Supreme Court to hear the case and issue a formal opinion on the legal argument.
Liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Kentanji Brown Jackson voted to deny the stay.
“This is a spectacular victory for election integrity and the rule of law,” Ambassador Ken Blackwell, who is chairman of the Center for Election Integrity at the America First Policy Institute, told Breitbart News in an exclusive reaction to the ruling. “Americans overwhelmingly support the federal law that forbids noncitizens from voting in federal elections, and I applaud both the Supreme Court for upholding the law here and Governor Youngkin for cleaning up Virginia’s voter rolls.”
The case is Beals v. Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights, and the application for a stay is 24A407 in the Supreme Court of the United States.

What Is a Gold IRA?
A gold IRA, or individual retirement account, is a type of self-directed IRA that allows investors to own physical gold, silver, platinum and palladium instead of the more traditional assets like stocks and bonds. This investment option offers individuals the opportunity to diversify their retirement portfolio with tangible precious metals, which can serve as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty.
What’s the difference between a gold IRA and a traditional IRA?
A gold IRA differs from a traditional IRA primarily in the types of assets it holds. While a traditional IRA typically includes investments in stocks, bonds and mutual funds, a gold IRA focuses on physical precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
The management and storage of assets within a gold IRA require adherence to specific IRS rules and regulations, including the use of an approved custodian for asset storage. Like other types of IRAs, gold IRAs aim to provide tax advantages for retirement savings, but a gold IRA’s inclusion of precious metals offers a distinct approach to risk management and wealth preservation.
How Does a Gold IRA Work?
Establishing a gold IRA involves a few critical steps to ensure compliance with IRS regulations and to protect the investment. First, an investor must choose a trusted custodian who specializes in handling self-directed IRAs, as they are required by law to administer these accounts. The custodian manages the account paperwork and facilitates the purchase and storage of the precious metals.
After selecting a custodian, the investor needs to open the gold IRA account and fund it. This funding can be done through a rollover from an existing IRA or another qualified retirement plan, or through direct contributions, adhering to the IRS contribution limits. Once the gold IRA is funded, the investor works with their custodian and metal dealers to purchase the desired precious metals. It’s essential to ensure that the chosen metals meet the IRS’s requirements for purity and type. Common options include specific gold bullion bars or coins that adhere to these standards.
After the purchase, the metals are stored securely, typically in an IRS-approved depository that offers advanced protection against physical theft or damage. The custodian oversees these assets, maintaining their integrity and compliance. Throughout the investment period, the value of these metals may fluctuate with market trends, but they provide a form of diversification that can help protect against inflation and economic uncertainties, aligning with long-term retirement goals.
Pros and Cons of Gold IRAs
Pros
- Ability to hedge against inflation: Gold has historically been considered a strong hedge against inflation. Unlike paper currency, its value tends to remain stable or even appreciate over time, especially during periods of economic uncertainty. This stability can help preserve your purchasing power over the long term, making gold a reliable component of a diversified retirement portfolio.
- Portfolio diversification: Including gold in your IRA helps to diversify your investment portfolio. Diversification is a crucial strategy for reducing risk because it spreads investments across different asset classes. Gold often exhibits low or negative correlations with traditional classes like stocks and bonds, meaning it can help mitigate losses during market downturns.
- Tangible asset: Unlike most financial assets, gold is a physical commodity, offering you peace of mind with tangible ownership. This can be especially appealing during times of political or financial instability when the reliability of digital or paper assets might come into question.
- Potential for appreciation: Over the past decades, the price of gold has witnessed substantial growth, and while past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, many see gold as an asset that could increase in value over time as demand expands and resources become more scarce.
- Safe haven asset: Gold is often referred to as a “safe haven” asset due to its ability to retain value during economic crises. Investors tend to flock to gold during times of market volatility, financial instability or geopolitical uncertainty, driving up its price and maintaining its demand.
Cons
- Higher fees and expenses: Gold IRAs typically have higher fees compared to traditional IRAs or other investment accounts. These fees can include account setup fees, storage fees and custodian management fees. Over time, these costs can erode the returns on your investment, making it less cost-effective, especially if you do not hold the gold for a significant duration.
- No income potential: Unlike stocks or bonds that may offer dividends or interest, gold does not provide any income. This lack of income generation means the investment relies solely on price appreciation for returns. Consequently, during periods when gold prices are stagnant or decreasing, investments may not yield the same level of income or growth as other investment vehicles.
- Complex management: Investing in a gold IRA involves dealing with additional regulations and requirements set by the IRS. This includes choosing an approved custodian and selecting a trustworthy depository to hold the physical asset. Increased complexity can demand more time, effort and knowledge on the part of the investor.
- Market risks and volatility: While gold is often seen as a stable asset, it is not immune to market fluctuations. The gold market can experience periods of significant volatility that may lead to short-term fluctuations, which could be concerning for those seeking stable returns.
- Liquidity constraints: Selling physical gold from a gold IRA can be more challenging compared to more liquid assets like stocks or mutual funds. There may be restrictions on when and how you can liquidate your holdings, potentially resulting in delays or additional costs.
Who Gold IRAs Are Right For
Gold IRAs can be an excellent investment option for individuals looking to diversify their retirement portfolio and safeguard their wealth against economic uncertainties and inflation. This investment vehicle appeals to a range of investors with specific financial goals and risk tolerances. Investors fitting these profiles may find that adding a gold IRA to their retirement strategy aligns well with their financial objectives and mitigates risks associated with other investment types.
These are some individuals who might find gold IRAs particularly beneficial:
- Risk-averse investors: Individuals concerned about market volatility and seeking a more stable, diversified portfolio may benefit from the security gold IRAs offer. Gold’s reputation as a safe haven can provide peace of mind during economic downturns.
- Inflation-wary savers: Those looking to protect their retirement savings from inflation will find gold IRAs attractive due to gold’s historical ability to maintain or increase its value over time, even as currency values diminish.
- Long-term investors: Investors with a long-term horizon who are willing to hold onto their assets for extended periods can take advantage of gold’s potential for appreciation. They might benefit from its value increase as demand grows and resources become scarce.
- Tangible asset enthusiasts: Those who prefer owning a physical asset rather than digital or paper investments may appreciate the tangible nature of gold. This aspect is particularly appealing in times of political or financial instability.
- Sophisticated investors: Individuals who understand and are willing to navigate the complexities and regulations involved in managing a gold IRA can leverage the tax advantages of this retirement account while enjoying a diversified asset base.
How to Choose a Gold IRA
Selecting the right gold IRA is crucial for optimizing your investment strategy and achieving your financial goals. With various providers and options available, it’s important to carefully evaluate and compare each choice to ensure you make an informed decision. Below are the key steps to take when comparing and choosing a gold IRA, along with explanations for each step:
- Research and select the best gold IRA companies. Begin by researching different custodians who specialize in gold IRAs. Look for a company with a solid reputation, transparent fees and strong customer reviews. A reputable custodian will securely manage your investments and provide expert guidance.
- Evaluate available fee structures. Compare the fee structures of various custodians, including account setup fees, annual maintenance fees and storage fees. Understanding the total cost of ownership will help you choose a gold IRA that aligns with your budget and financial strategy.
- Assess storage options. Ensure the custodian offers secure storage options for your physical gold. Consider whether each option provides segregated or commingled storage and the security measures in place to protect your assets.
- Understand IRS regulations and compliance. Familiarize yourself with IRS rules regarding gold IRAs to ensure compliance. Choose a custodian who fully adheres to these regulations and offers guidance to simplify account setup and management.
- Review customer support and educational resources. Quality customer support and access to educational resources are critical when managing a gold IRA. Select a custodian that provides responsive customer service and offers resources to help you make informed investment decisions.
- Consider the range of investment options. Investigate the variety of gold products and other precious metals available for investment. A diverse range of options will allow you to tailor your portfolio to meet specific goals and risk tolerance.
- Examine historical performance and market insights. As with other investments, past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, but understanding historical trends and insights can aid in your decision. Choose a custodian who offers market insights and analysis to help guide your investment decisions.
How to Open a Gold IRA
To successfully open a gold IRA, it’s essential to follow a series of steps to ensure a smooth process and compliance with all regulatory requirements.
- Choose a qualified custodian. Before opening a gold IRA, select a custodian approved by the IRS to manage precious metal investments. Look for a custodian with a strong reputation, experience in gold IRAs and excellent customer service.
- Complete the application process. Fill out the necessary application forms provided by your chosen custodian. This step typically involves submitting your personal information, financial details and account preferences to establish your account.
- Fund your IRA. Transfer funds into your new gold IRA by rolling over an existing retirement account, such as a 401(k) or traditional IRA, or by making a direct contribution. Ensure the transaction complies with IRS guidelines to avoid penalties or tax implications.
- Select your precious metals. Work with your custodian to choose the specific gold products or other precious metals you’d like to include in your portfolio. Consider factors such as purity, type and current market performance to align your investments with your goals.
- Arrange for secure storage. Once you select your metals, coordinate with the custodian to arrange for secure storage. Choose between segregated or commingled storage options at an approved depository to ensure your assets are protected and meet IRS requirements.
- Monitor and manage your investments. Regularly review and manage your gold IRA holdings with the support of your custodian’s resources. Stay informed about market trends and assess how your assets align with your long-term financial goals, making adjustments as necessary.
Gold IRA Alternatives
In addition to gold IRAs, there are several other investment strategies that individuals can consider to diversify their retirement portfolios and hedge against market volatility. Each option provides unique benefits and may better suit different financial goals and risk appetites.
- Traditional IRAs: Investing in a traditional IRA allows individuals to benefit from tax-deferred growth on earnings. Contributions may be tax-deductible, and distributions during retirement are taxed at the retiree’s current income tax rate.
- Roth IRAs: Unlike traditional IRAs, Roth IRA contributions are not tax-deductible. However, these accounts grow tax-free and allow withdrawals during retirement to be tax-free if certain conditions are met. Because contributions are after-tax, Roth IRAs are often a good choice for individuals expecting higher tax rates in retirement.
- Real estate investments: Direct investment in real estate properties can provide income through rental yields and potential appreciation. Real estate investments also add tangible assets to your portfolio, offering a buffer against inflation and market downturns.
- Stocks and bonds: These conventional investment options remain popular for their liquidity and potential for long-term growth. Stocks provide ownership stakes in companies, while bonds offer fixed-income returns, which can stabilize a more volatile portfolio.
- Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS): TIPS are government bonds designed to protect investors from inflation. The principal value of TIPS increases with inflation, ensuring your investment maintains its purchasing power over time.
- Cryptocurrencies: For those seeking cutting-edge alternative investments, cryptocurrencies may offer a high-risk, high-reward option. However, these digital assets are volatile.
Gold IRA FAQ
Is a gold IRA a good investment in 2024?
A gold IRA can be a strategic investment in 2024, offering portfolio diversification and a hedge against economic instability. Its value tends to rise during market downturns. However, consider market conditions, fees and your financial goals before investing. Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice for your specific circumstances.
Are gold-backed IRAs a good idea?
Gold-backed IRAs can be a good idea for diversifying your retirement portfolio and protecting against inflation. However, they’re not suitable for everyone. Consider factors like investment goals, risk tolerance and fees before proceeding. Consult a financial advisor to ensure a gold-backed IRA aligns with your overall strategy and long-term financial objectives.
Do you pay taxes on a gold IRA?
Taxes apply to a gold IRA similarly to traditional IRAs. Contributions are typically tax-deductible, and withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income during retirement. However, early withdrawals before 59 1/2 may incur penalties and taxes. Rollover transactions are tax-free if IRS guidelines are followed. Consult a tax professional for personalized advice.
Are gold IRA companies trustworthy?
Gold IRA companies can be trustworthy but always perform due diligence to choose a reputable company. Look for firms with strong reputations, transparent fee structures and excellent customer service. Check for accreditation with regulatory bodies like the Better Business Bureau and read customer reviews. Consulting financial advisors can also help you choose a reputable company for your investments.
Is a gold IRA the best investment for a senior citizen?
A gold IRA is typically not the best investment for a senior citizen because there are age-related requirements that make IRAs less beneficial for seniors. In addition, the short investment horizon of seniors often means older investors won’t benefit from the tax advantages available with IRAs. Senior citizens who are interested in buying gold can explore doing so outside a gold IRA.
Where is the physical gold stored in a gold IRA?
Physical gold in a gold IRA is stored at an approved depository, ensuring it meets IRS requirements for security and compliance. Investors can typically choose between segregated storage, where their assets are stored separately, or commingled storage, where they’re stored with others’, depending on personal preference and the custodian’s available options.
Can I withdraw the physical gold from a gold IRA?
You can withdraw physical gold from a gold IRA, but it involves a distribution process. Upon withdrawal, the gold is subject to taxes and potential penalties if you’re under 59 1/2. There’s also a mandatory withholding period. Consult with your custodian to understand the procedure and implications before proceeding with the withdrawal.

Breitbart,Israel: Hezbollah Down to 20% of Rocket Capacity,"Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant said Tuesday that the once-feared, Iran-backed Hezbollah terror organization has been reduced to 20% of its rocket capacity — a reflection of Israel’s military success in the ongoing Lebanon war.
The Times of Israel reported:
“I estimate the remaining capacity of the missiles and rockets to be in the order of 20%, and also it is not organized in the way that it used to be organized, in a way that [Hezbollah] could fire [large] volleys,” he says during a visit to the IDF Northern Command base in Safed.
Gallant added that Iran understood Hezbollah was no longer a deterrent to Israel.
Israel has been at war on the ground in Lebanon for four weeks, following the Israeli security cabinet’s decision to make the return of more than 60,000 residents to their homes in northern Israel a key goal of the ongoing war.
The Israeli civilians, Jewish and Arab, were evacuated last October when Hezbollah began firing rockets, drones, and anti-tank missiles at Israeli border communities, in a show of solidarity with the Hamas terror attack of October 1.
Hezbollah was thought to have a stockpile of well over 100,000 rockets, enabling it to continue firing at the rate of several dozen per day for many years.
Israel initially restrained its response, then began to fight back in earnest in mid-September, with the “pager” attack that disabled or killed most of Hezbollah’s senior commanders, and followed by targeted strikes on Hezbollah leaders, weapons caches, and headquarters. Ground troops have followed, attacking Hezbollah bases and tunnels in southern Lebanon and removing their rockets and other weapons — many of which were located near, or within, civilian towns.
At 20% capacity, Hezbollah is still a formidable force; the war is expected to continue for at least several weeks, though Israeli media channels are discussing the possibility that it could be wrapped up by the end of the year in the form of some kind of diplomatic agreement brokered by the United States.

Breitbart,Harris Narrowly Wins Nickelodeon’s Non-Scientific Poll 52% to Trump's 48%,"Vice President Kamala Harris narrowly won Nickelodeon’s non-scientific “Kids Pick the President” poll at 52 percent to former President Donald Trump’s 48 percent.
While the mock presidential election has accurately predicted the winner — except for 2004 and 2016 — the kids favored their 2004 and 2016 losing candidates at a significantly higher percentage than they favored Harris for the 2024 election.
In 2004, kids favored Democrat John Kerry at 57 percent, to former President George W. Bush at 43 precent. In 2016, former First Lady Hillary Clinton pulled in 53 percent of the vote compared with Trump who raked in 36 percent.
This year, Trump was favored at a remarkably higher percentage than he was in 2016. The 45th president was pulled in 48 percent of the vote, with Harris narrowly taking the lead at 52 percent.
The 2024 Nickelodeon’s kids poll also has Harris winning with the lowest percentage difference since poll results for the 2008 election, which saw former President Barack Obama winning with 51 percent compared with former Senator John McCain’s 49 percent.
Nickelodeon has also emphasized that its “Kids Pick the President” poll — which has been conducted for every election starting in 1988 — is “an informal non-scientific poll, meant for entertainment purposes only,” according to a report by TheWrap.
This year, over 32,000 kids cast their virtual vote in Nickelodeon’s poll, which was open from October 3 to 23.

Breitbart,Actress Justine Bateman: Gavin Newsom ‘Is the Worst Governor We’ve Ever Had in California’,"Family Ties star Justine Bateman has called out California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) as its revealed the state’s job openings have experienced a fall of 30 percent as the unemployment rate stands at the second-worst in the country.
Taking to social media site X – formerly known as Twitter – the actress simply stated to her 139,000+ followers:
Newsom is the worst Governor we’ve ever had in Calif.
This is not the first time the Family Ties alum, 58, has got political.
Back in 2020 she joined a number of people who believed Newsom should be recalled.
In images obtained by the Daily Mail, Bateman could be seen at a “Recall Gavin 2020” campaign trailer signing a petition in agreeance with the movement to remove the politician from office.
“OK, how do we get rid of this guy? Where do I sign?” she reportedly asked at the trailer before taking a “to go” packet so that she can collect signatures to assist with the campaign.
“Thank you so much for being here,” the actress told the volunteers, the outlet reports. “Let’s do this!”
More recently she called out Newsom’s attempts to justify the state’s parlous financial disposition, also on social media.
Newsom was speaking as he unveiled a new tax credit program for film and TV in the hopes of bringing production back to Hollywood, as Breitbart News reported. She said:

He hailed the proposed plan as an investment in the film industry’s future at a time when it is needed more than ever.
“California is the entertainment capital of the world, rooted in decades of creativity, innovation, and unparalleled talent,” said Newsom in a statement. “Expanding this program will help keep production here at home, generate thousands of good-paying jobs, and strengthen the vital link between our communities and the state’s iconic film and TV industry.”
A recent study from FilmLA showed that film and TV production “dropped by 5% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same timeframe of 2023,” per KTLA.
The Hollywood Reporter recently dubbed Los Angeles a “production graveyard”, warning: “Every category of filming for scripted content trails historical norms.”",30/10/2024
Breitbart,Republicans React to Biden Trashing Trump Supporters as 'Garbage',"Republicans responded to President Joe Biden’s comments saying the supporters of former President Donald Trump are “garbage.”
Biden’s comments, which were made prior to Vice President Kamala Harris delivering her closing statement from the Ellipse in Washington, DC, were in reference to comedian Tony Hinchcliffe making a joke that Puerto Rico was “a floating island of garbage” during Trump’s Sunday rally at Madison Square Garden.
NBC reported Gabe Gutierrez wrote in a post on X that Biden stated: “Donald Trump has no character. He doesn’t give a damn about the Latino community … Just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage? … The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.”
Many Republicans took to social media to respond to Biden’s comments, with some questioning if the media would “cover” Biden’s remarks “with the same vigor” as they had with Hinchcliffe’s remarks.
“Joe Biden just called half of Americans ‘garbage’ for supporting Donald Trump,” Rep. Mike Waltz (R-FL) wrote in a post on X. “America: this is what Kamala Harris, Biden and the radical left thinks about you. It’s high time that Americans rise up and take out the trash that is the radical leftist poison in our country and VOTE now to make our voices heard!”
“The president calls half the country garbage,” Dan Hauser, the chief strategist for Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT) wrote in a post on X. “I wonder if the media will cover this with the same vigor as they did the comedian?”
Ohio Republican Senate candidate Bernie Moreno issued a statement that it was always known that politicians like Biden, Harris, and Moreno’s opponent, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), “hated American citizens.”
“We always knew career politicians like Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Sherrod Brown hated American citizens,” Moreno said in his statement. “It’s obvious from their policies of open borders, high prices, and massive government overreach. Now, they are just saying the quiet part out loud.”
The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) also issued a statement that Biden’s remarks were comparable to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s “deplorables” comment made in 2016.
“This is Joe Biden’s ‘deplorables’ moment,” Jack Pandol, the Communications director for the NRCC said in a statement. “The truth is Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, and House Democrats look down their nose at anyone who wants affordability, safe streets, and a secure border. Every House Democrat enabled Joe Biden’s assault on the American Dream, and they must condemn the President’s disgusting and divisive comments immediately.”
“First they called Trump supporters deplorable, then Nazis, now garbage,” Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN) wrote in a post. “This is what Democrats think of you. Vote Trump!”
“The sitting president of the United States just called half of America ‘garbage,'” Republican Pennsylvania Senate candidate Dave McCormick wrote. “This is exactly the kind of rhetoric that leads to hate and violence in our country, and to come from, Bob Casey’s ‘close friend’ and the current Commander-in-Chief is totally unacceptable.”",29/10/2024
Breitbart,Trump: Kamala Harris Is Running a Campaign of 'Absolute Hate',"Former President Donald Trump said Vice President Kamala Harris is running a “campaign of absolute hate” and her divisive rhetoric toward him is “shameful and really inexcusable” after facing two assassination attempts in recent months.
Trump was highly critical of Harris, who called him “fascist” this week, during a press conference at his luxurious Mar-a-Lago resort on Tuesday morning.
“She’s running on a campaign of demoralization and really a campaign of destruction,” Trump said. “But really, perhaps more than anything else, it’s a campaign of hate, a campaign of absolute hate.”
He then zoned in on the divisive rhetoric Harris has used in her closing argument.
“After two assassination attempts in just over three months, her lies and her slanders are very shameful and really inexcusable,” he said.
Trump was nearly killed on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania, when Thomas Matthew Crooks shot him in the ear, narrowly missing Trump’s skull during one of his trademark rallies.

C-SPANIn September, Trump faced a second assassination attempt while golfing at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, at the hands of accused would-be assassin Ryan Routh, as Breitbart News reported:
A Secret Service agent, who was clearing a hole ahead of where former President Donald Trump was, spotted a “rifle barrel sticking out of the fence and immediately engaged that individual,” [Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric] Bradshaw said.
A witness told law enforcement that the suspect, later identified as Routh, was seen running out of bushes into a black Nissan and fleeing the area, per Bradshaw. The witness captured an image of the plate tags, and, through plate readers, authorities found Routh and took him into custody in Martin County. The witness later identified Routh as the man who fled the bushes.
Authorities recovered an “AK-47-style rifle with a scope, two backpacks which were hung on the fence that had ceramic tile in them, and a Go-Pro” from the bushes where Routh was allegedly staking out the president.
Harris’s “fascist” rhetoric has also drawn condemnation from House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY).
“Vice President Harris may want the American people to entrust her with the sacred duty of executive authority. But first, she must abandon the base and irresponsible rhetoric that endangers both American lives and institutions,” they wrote in a joint letter, as Fox News noted.",29/10/2024
Breitbart,Harris: Trump's Trans Inmates Ads Have 'Misinformation' and Only 'Relate to Two People' and He Has the Same Policies,"On Tuesday’s broadcast of New York’s Power 105.1’s “The Breakfast Club,” 2024 Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris stated that the ads run by her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump about her views on taxpayer-funded sex change surgeries for inmates “relate to two people,” and he’s hitting her with “a bunch of disinformation and misinformation on this. And he’s living in a glass house, because the policies he’s speaking about in terms of those surgeries were also his policies.”
Co-host Charlamagne Tha God asked, “[T]he reason I’m stressing that I’m voting for you on November 5 is because Trump has been running these ads with myself and Envy in them, these anti-trans ads, without our permission. How do we combat that?”
Co-host DJ Envy then asked, “Can we?”
Harris responded, “Well, yes. Look, truth is always going to prevail over the misinformation and the lies. But it takes work, right? And so, having this conversation right now so all your listeners know. But there is a lot of misinformation and disinformation, because they don’t actually want to talk about the truth, because their truth is a failing truth. And so, yeah, we’ve got to keep reminding folks of the reality, which is I am blessed and honored to have your support and the support of so many communities and individuals who are — their names are known and some names your listeners may not know, but they are leaders in their community.”
Envy then followed up, “I wanted to ask about those trans ads. In the ads, he’s saying that Kamala Harris wants to spend taxpayers’ money for sex changes in jails. He’s spent millions and millions of dollars on — like Charlamagne said, having him and myself in that. How do you answer that, for people that don’t know, and what is the real news when it comes to that?”
Harris answered, “Well, first of all, to your point, he has spent tens of millions of dollars trying to hit me with a bunch of disinformation and misinformation on this. And he’s living in a glass house, because the policies he’s speaking about in terms of those surgeries were also his policies. And the reality of it is that, also, those ads relate to two people, versus the fact that he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which would impact 45 million people, he wants to get rid of our $35-a-month cap on insulin, … he wants to take away health care through Medicare, and he wants to distract from the fact that he actually — not only does he have a plan on this, versus no plan on anything else, but his plan is to get rid of healthcare coverage for the most needy.”

Breitbart,Report: Harris Staff ‘Privately’ Debates Breaking with Biden over ‘Garbage’ Smear,"Staff working for Kamala Harris’s campaign are debating whether to break from Joe Biden following his “garbage” smear of the many millions of Americans who support former President Donald Trump, according to the New York Times.
The newspaper reported:
After Mr. Biden’s remark, Harris campaign officials privately gauged whether his comments would require her to disagree with him publicly or support his explanation that the comments were taken out of context, according to people familiar with the internal reaction. They asked for anonymity to discuss private deliberations.
The visceral smear and political gaffe came as Biden was trying to portray Trump as hostile to Latinos. The report from the Associated Press (AP) said:
Ahead of Harris’ [campaign] remarks, Biden is reacted [sic] to a comic calling Puerto Rico garbage at a Trump rally last weekend by saying, “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.”
The uproar over the garbage smear comes after many Harris allies have described Trump’s supporters as fascists and Nazis.
The Washington Post did not mention the potential split with the Harris campaign but noted:
Democrats were not fully united in defending Biden late Tuesday night.
Asked about Biden’s comments on CNN, Josh Shapiro — the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, a critical swing state for Harris — did not dispute that Biden had disparaged Trump supporters.
“I had not heard that until now … so I’m kind of giving you my fresh reaction to it,” Shapiro said. “I would never insult the good people of Pennsylvania or any Americans even if they chose to support a candidate that I didn’t support.”

Breitbart,UK Defence Ministry Civilians Now Outnumber Royal Navy and Air Force,"There are nearly as many civil servants in Britain’s defence department as soldiers, and more office staff than the whole navy and air force combined, figures obtained by a former defence minister have revealed.
The number of civilians working in the UK government’s Ministry of Defence — part of what some decry as the permanent ‘deep state’ in Westminster — has increased six per cent this decade, rising to 63,702 in April of this year from 2020. At the same time, the British Army has continued its long drawdown, hitting 72,510 in April, and is predicted to dip below 70,000 next year.
The other military arms are considerably smaller. The Royal Navy, remarkably for an island nation which depends so much on the sea for its prosperity, including the Royal Marines had a trained strength this year of just 28,840. The Royal Air Force stood at 28,420, meaning combined those two forces number just 57,260, thousands fewer than the backroom Civil Servants administering the military in Whitehall.
British newspaper of record The Times cites remarks by former defence minister Lord Lee of Trafford, the Junior Minister for Defence Procurement from 1983 to 1986 under Margaret Thatcher, who later defected from the Tories to the Liberal Democrats, who uncovered the figures. He said reducing the number of civilian employees in the armed forces to free up resources for more troops should be considered to recover the military from its “pretty deplorable state”.
Lord Lee particularly referred to the differential in public sector productivity, which has essentially flatlined in the UK this century compared to private sector growth. He said: “We have ended up in a situation where there are 63,000 civil servants employed when the army itself is only 72,000 strong. I can’t think of a large private sector firm that hasn’t, through efficiencies and modern telecommunication, reduced their headcount and yet in the MoD, it has actually increased.
“The whole thing is extraordinarily lopsided and surely it’s time to take a really hard look at these [figures].”
The dramatic illustration in the growth of Civil Servants administering the military while the military itself continues to dwindle comes amid growing concerns amid political figures that the British armed forces may not actually be in a fit state to fight a war they believe may be coming. The UK’s new Defence Minister John Healey said last week it was his view that while the UK — like many Western nations — was capable of engaging in military operations, it was not capable of fighting an actual war against a neer-peer adversary, such as seen in Ukraine these past years.
As reported, Healey responded to remarks by the head of the British Army that the UK armed forces needs to “double then triple our fighting power” quickly saying the UK had to be more able to deter threats. Yet he slipped into the apparently long-standing Ministry orthodoxy of insisting that it is possible to do more with less by investing in new technology. Yet as stated by a House of Lords report earlier this year, the true lesson of the Ukraine conflict is any advantages in drones and other innovations is short lived as a capable opponent and quickly adapt. Instead, mass of fighting men remains critical.
That House of Lords report stated:
The size and capability of the UK Armed Forces is predicated on a now apparently out-dated idea that any unexpected conflicts would be resolved in weeks, which has very much not been the case with the Ukraine War. The Lords’ report notes it has been the case a shrinking manpower has been explained away by increasing technical sophistication making up the capability, but argues this position too has been proven as wrong-footed.
The report stated: “…the UK has a well-trained and well-equipped force, but that it is too small and inadequately set up for large, prolonged conflicts like the one in Ukraine… the use of advanced technology has at times been used to justify smaller troop numbers. The war in Ukraine, however, has shown that in a conflict between two technologically capable states, technology is not a magic bullet that can swiftly end a war.”",30/10/2024
Breitbart,The Hill: Biden 'Appears' to Call Trump Supporters ‘Garbage’,"Despite President Joe Biden’s attack on Donald Trump’s supporters being captured on video, the Hill reports that Biden only “appeared” to compare them to “garbage.”
Biden’s off-the-cuff dropping of the veil received swift spin from White House aides — who later refused to confirm they had even spoken with Biden after his gaffe.
Despite Biden’s clear wording, the Hill reports:
“The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters,” Biden appears to say in the clip.
The outlet used the word “appears” or “appeared” throughout the story, including in the headline, to reference his attack on Trump supporters.
Biden’s diatribe against Trump and his voters referenced a joke made by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe during Trump’s massive Sunday rally at Madison Square Garden.
Harris’s campaign has latched onto Hinchcliffe’s joke in the waning days of the campaign, with the establishment media focusing on the remarks at the expense of other campaign developments — including Trump’s increasingly positive polling outlook in swing states.
The Hill alone has published double digit stories on Hinchcliffe since Sunday night.
Sen. JD Vance (R-OH), Trump’s running mate, called out media outlets for carrying water for Harris by focusing so overwhelmingly on the joke.
“Will the networks that obsessively covered a joke from a comedian at a Trump rally cover the fact that the Kamala Harris campaign is insulting half of the country?” he tweeted. “Will they even report honestly on this disgusting behavior from our present leadership?”
Vance’s tweet referenced reporting from Politico, which instead of reporting Biden’s statement in full, chopped up his words to completely change his meaning.
Politico‘s characterization of Biden’s statement was that he “said ‘the only garbage’ was the ‘hatred’ of Trump supporters who said such things about American citizens.”
Their false characterization of Biden’s statements only quoted four of his words – and could not even string four together.
Vance called media coverups of Biden’s comments a “scandal.”
Pundits quickly compared Biden’s statement to Hillary Clinton’s “basket of deplorable” comment about Trump’s supporters in 2016. Trump would go on to win that election.

Breitbart,Nolte: JD Vance to Sit Down with Joe Rogan After Kamala Chickens Out,"JD Vance will sit down for an in-depth interview on the Joe Rogan Experience on Wednesday. This comes after we learned Kamala Harris has so far chickened out of appearing.
Last week, former President Trump appeared on Joe Rogan’s blockbuster podcast for a three-hour, nothing-off-limits interview that has already racked up tens of millions of views. It was a fascinating conversation that allowed Trump to display qualities the corporate media try to hide and distort. Because Rogan wasn’t playing gotcha and was only interested in getting an idea of how Trump’s mind works on a whole host of issues, Rogan’s audience — that dwarfs the fake media — discovered that Trump is not only willing to discuss every topic thrown at him but has a granular knowledge of the issues.
The podcast was a total win for both Rogan and Trump.
Rogan extended the same invitation to sitting Vice President Kamala Harris: come to Austin and let’s have a chat.
Instead of accepting the invitation, Kamala said no unless Rogan was willing to travel to her and hold the conversation to just one hour.
Rogan wisely refused, but the invite still stands.
“[F]or the record the Harris campaign has not passed on doing the podcast. They offered a date for Tuesday, but I would have had to travel to her and they only wanted to do an hour,” Rogan explained on X. “I strongly feel the best way to do it is in the studio in Austin. My sincere wish is to just have a nice conversation and get to know her as a human being. I really hope we can make it happen.”
Of course, Team Kamala wants Rogan on her territory. Of course, they want a one-hour time limit. This allows her to show up late and leave early if things go awry. This is what the Kamala campaign did to Bret Baier with that disastrous Fox News interview.
So, to once again prove how they are running circles around Kamala, the Trump campaign announced that Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, will sit down for a no-holds-barred interview with Joe Rogan on Wednesday that will be released later in the week:
Vice presidential nominee U.S. Sen. JD Vance will travel to Austin, Texas, on Wednesday to be interviewed on Joe Rogan’s podcast, according to ABC News.
Former President Donald Trump went on “The Joe Rogan Experience” last week, which immediately resulted in hundreds of thousands of new YouTube followers and tens of thousands of new social media followers for Rogan.
This is all upside for Team Trump. Not only will Vance do a great job, but it calls more attention to Kamala thickening out and further marginalizes the corporate media. For example…
Vance appeared on CNN over the weekend for about 20 minutes with Russia Collusion Hoaxster Jake Tapper. The interview was useless. Tapper, who was so angry and frustrated he practically lost control of his bowels, kept screaming Fascist! at a relaxed and calm JD Vance who calmly sat back and wrist-flicked Tapper’s hysterical lies away as though they were gnats. Nothing about policy. Nothing about the future of the country. The corporate media have become useless to anyone who cares about issues and vision.
Rogan and much of New Media don’t do this. Instead of childish gotcha questions, they ask public figures probing questions. Tapper was only interested in making Vance look bad. That serves no one but the narcissistic Tapper who was playing to his elite tribe. New Media merely wants to take a measure of the man (or the woman). That’s what most people want as opposed to a gotcha-shout-fest. And that’s why the corporate media is feeling its irrelevance.
