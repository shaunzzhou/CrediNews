The Daily Caller,‘Why Would Any Christian Vote For Her?’: Pro-Life Orgs React To Harris’ ‘Anti-Religious Freedom’ Abortion Stance,"Pro-life organizations are speaking out against Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris after she stated she did not believe in religious exemptions for abortion.
Vice President Harris made the statement in an interview with NBC News Tuesday evening when asked directly if she would agree to any concessions on abortion such as religious exemptions. Christian and pro-life organizations are rallying against the candidate in response to her “pro-abortion” and “anti-religious freedom” stance.
“I don’t think we should be making concessions when we’re talking about a fundamental freedom to make decisions about your own body,” Harris said to Hallie Jackson Tuesday.

“Kamala Harris admits she would deny religious exemptions for abortions — forcing Christians to kill unborn children and seemingly doubling down on weaponizing the government to jail pro-lifers who pray outside abortion facilities,” CatholicVote said in an X post Tuesday. “Why would any Christian vote for her?”

Harris has been accused by pro-life Christians of weaponizing the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act by using the Department of Justice (DOJ) to jail pro-lifers for praying outside of abortion clinics.
“Kamala Harris promises ‘freedom’ but then pledges to federally steamroll Americans into taking part in abortions against their will,” Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America posted to X. “Docs must perform them, taxpayers must pay for them, for any reason, in all 50 states, no exceptions.”

Harris has frequently dodged the question of whether she would support any limits on abortion, telling CBS News in a 2023 “Face the Nation” interview that “the women of America should be trusted to make decisions about their life and their body based on what they know to be in their best interest. It’s that simple.” (RELATED: Tim Walz Turned His State Into A Destination For Late-Term Abortions)
“So she’s not only pro-abortion, she is anti-religious freedom,” Ralph Reed, chairman of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, said on X. “Duly noted.”

Harris plans to highlight the abortion issue during a campaign stop in Texas Friday, according to Politico.
CatholicVote has previously sounded the alarm on Harris’ radical abortion stance, warning Catholics that her blatantly “anti-Catholic” agenda presents “clear and present danger” to Christians.
The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

The Daily Caller,MSNBC Guest Claims Kamala Harris Running ‘One Of The Most Perfectly Executed Campaigns’ In American History,"Former Republican strategist Stuart Stevens claimed Wednesday that Vice President Kamala Harris is running an outstanding campaign against former President Donald Trump.
Trump trails Harris by 0.6% in the RealClearPolling average of polls from Oct. 8 – 22, with the gap increasing to 0.8% when Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein, independent candidate Cornel West and Libertarian candidate Chase Oliver are included in surveys. Stevens cited the campaign’s use of Hollywood actors like “West Wing” star Bradley Whitford and “Good Wife” star Christine Baranski.

“It’s huge because there’s a special connection there. You know, when you see these performers and they come to their hometowns or they come to some place, you know, like where they grew up, they can bond on that,” Stevens said. “What it’s really saying is, you know, you and I are not that different. I’m famous, but we share the same values. Let’s work together on this. I think it’s really smart.”
“And I have to say, I think when this thing is over and done with and Harris has won, which I think she’s going to do rather comfortably, I think we’re going to look back on this as one of the most perfectly executed campaigns in modern history,” Stevens continued.
Trump leads Harris by 0.6% in polls of Pennsylvania voters from Sept. 28 to Oct. 19, according to the RealClearPolling average. Harris leads Trump by 0.3% when Stein, West and Oliver are included as options in the surveys.
Trump also leads Harris by 0.6% in polls of Michigan voters from Sept. 21 to Oct. 9, according to the RealClearPolling average. Harris has a lead of 0.5% when West, Stein and Oliver are included as options in the surveys. (Watch The Daily Caller Documentary “Cleaning Up Kamala”)
In head-to-head matchups, Trump also holds slight leads in Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, according to RealClearPolling.

The Daily Caller,"Nearly 1 Million Illegal Migrants Benefiting From ‘Quiet Amnesty’ Under Biden Admin, House Report Reveals","Nearly 1 million illegal migrants in the United States have benefited from “quiet amnesty” by the Biden-Harris immigration court system, according to a report released Thursday.
Over 700,000 illegal migrants have had their cases administratively closed, terminated or dismissed, allowing them to remain in the country “indefinitely” without being subject to immigration consequences, according to a report released by the House Judiciary Committee, led by Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan. The findings, which the committee dubbed as “quiet amnesty,” come amid record levels of illegal immigration into the country under the current administration.(RELATED: Migration Crisis Fueled Rise In Tuberculosis Cases, Study Finds)
“For almost four years, Americans have watched as President Joe Biden and border czar Vice President Kamala Harris have abandoned the southwest border and welcomed nearly 8 million illegal aliens into the United States,” the report stated.
“Through administrative maneuvering at both the Justice Department and [the Department of Homeland Security], the Biden-Harris Administration has already ensured that nearly 1 million illegal aliens can remain in the United States without the possibility of deportation—and that trend shows no sign of stopping,” the report went on.
When a non-citizen enters the U.S. unlawfully, they can be placed into removal proceedings and eventually go before one of the roughly 700 immigration judges across the country.
Due to the unprecedented border crisis and wave of foreign nationals applying for asylum, the immigration court system has faced a massive backlog, the report detailed. The backlog grew from 1.2 million cases at the end of the Trump administration to nearly 3.5 million cases by the end of the third quarter of fiscal year 2024 — marking a 175% increase.
The Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) additionally reported nearly 109,100 cases as “not adjudicated” in fiscal year 2023, meaning that the cases were completed but not adjudicated on the merits of the claims, according to the House report. There were 109,568 asylum cases not adjudicated in just the first nine months of fiscal year 2024, already surpassing the total previous fiscal year. (RELATED: ‘I Love Kamala’: Migrants Fear Trump Victory As Caravan Heads To US)
For comparison, there were just 12,960 total asylum cases reported as “not adjudicated” from fiscal years 2017 to 2020 — combined, according to the House report.
The Biden-Harris administration additionally failed to file the required documentation to begin immigration court removal proceedings for around 200,00 cases, resulting in the “overwhelming majority” of those non-citizens being able to remain in the country indefinitely, the report found.
“Instead of actually adjudicating illegal aliens’ cases based on the merits of aliens’ claims for relief — such as whether an alien has a valid and successful asylum claim — immigration judges under the Biden-Harris Administration have been tasked with rubberstamping case dismissals, case closures, and case terminations, all of which allow illegal aliens to remain in the United States without immigration consequences,” the report stated.
“This sort of quiet amnesty has become a staple of the Biden-Harris Administration’s immigration courts,” the report continued.
The Department of Justice, which oversees EOIR, declined to comment for this story.

The Daily Caller,"‘You’re Not A Kamala Person, I Know You’: Trump Makes His Case To Joe Rogan On Why He’s A Better Candidate Than Harris","Former President Donald Trump made his case to major podcaster Joe Rogan and his listeners why he is the superior 2024 presidential nominee Friday in a highly-anticipated episode of “The Joe Rogan Experience.”
As the two filmed their three-hour unscripted discussion in Austin, Trump spoke about launching the U.S. Space Force during his first term before he highlighted billionaire Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Starlink endeavors. Trump noted Musk proudly endorsed him and urged Rogan — who he said is “not a Kamala person” — to do the same.
“He gave me the nicest endorsement too. Tough. He said, ‘The country’s gonna fail.’ You should do the same thing, Joe, because you cannot be voting for Kamala,” Trump said as Rogan broke out into laughter.
“Kamala! You’re not a Kamala person,” he told Rogan. “I know you. I’ve watched you! I know him better than he — you know what? Without speaking to you, I think I know you maybe almost as well as your wife.”

Trump claimed to Rogan he watched the podcaster for years before expounding on Musk’s Starlink, his own economic leadership and the tax cuts during his first term as president.
The GOP nominee was then pressed on Harris’s comparing him to Adolf Hitler, prompting Trump to blast his opponent and the Democratic Party for their escalatory rhetoric. He also suggested Harris should take a cognitive test. (RELATED: ‘You Said A Lot Of Wild Sh*t’: Joe Rogan Explains Trump’s Unique Path To The Presidency)

“Once they shot you, I was like, ‘He’s got to come in here. It’s all about timing,” Rogan remarked, sitting across from Trump 11 days before Election Day.
“The timing is good,” Trump responded.
“The timing is perfect,” the podcaster added.
Trump said Harris would be “laying on the floor comatose” if she did Rogan’s show, but the podcaster suggested the vice president may appear before Election Day.
“Could you imagine Kamala doing this show?” Trump asked.
“I could imagine her doing this show,” Rogan interjected, telling Trump he will continue to try to book Harris and would talk to her like a “human being.”

Harris backed out of an interview with Rogan on Thursday due to a scheduling conflict, Harris campaign spokesperson Ian Sams told MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes.
The Democratic nominee visited Texas on Friday, the same day as Trump. Harris held a rally with pop icon Beyoncé — who had previously been rumored to be appearing at the 2024 Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Chicago.
Following the interview with Rogan which garnered 11 million YouTube views in 13 hours, Trump spoke at a Friday night rally in Michigan. He blasted Harris for putting on a star-studded show at the same time Israel was launching a strike on Iran in retaliation for its Oct. 1 missile attack.

The Daily Caller,CNN Panelist Says Biden Should ‘Embrace’ Calling Trump Supporters ‘Garbage’,"CNN senior political analyst Mark Preston said Wednesday President Joe Biden should own up to calling former President Donald Trump’s supporters “garbage.”
Biden made the comments Tuesday during a virtual campaign event in response to a joke stand-up comedian Tony Hinchcliffe told during Trump’s Sunday rally at Madison Square Garden. Preston said that doubling down on the comments would make Democrats look “strong.” (RELATED: ‘It’s Helpful If You’ll Answer The Question’: Harris Faulkner Chides Dem Guest For Spinning When Asked About Kamala Harris Comparing Trump To Hitler)
WATCH:
“I’m of the mindset that if you say it, you might as well just embrace it, and I do think that that’s a problem for Democrats,” Preston said as “CNN This Morning” host Kasie Hunt was seeking comments from political strategists on the panel.
“It’s shocking, you know, that I would say that. No, but realistically, like I do think if he said, listen, yeah, I do mean all those racist supporters of Donald Trump, yeah, I do think that they’re terrible. I think that people would look at the Democratic Party a little bit different,” Preston added. “I do think that the Democratic Party in general doesn’t look like they are strong enough and they will always back off of things. And I think that when Joe Biden backs off of saying what he really believes, I don’t think that’s a good look.”
Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, have escalated attacks on Trump, with Harris devoting a major speech Tuesday to attacking the former president as a “petty tyrant” days after calling Trump a “fascist” during a CNN town hall. Walz compared Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden to a 1939 rally at the venue held by a group sympathetic to Nazi Germany.
The Harris campaign has actively distanced itself from Biden on the campaign trail.
Harris trails Trump by 0.4% in the RealClear Polling average of polls from Oct. 11 to 29, with Trump’s lead dropping to 0.1% when Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein, independent candidate Cornel West and Libertarian candidate Chase Oliver are included in surveys.

The Daily Caller,EXCLUSIVE: Tim Walz Welcomed Chinese Communist Party Officials Into His Nebraska Classroom,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, welcomed Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials into his Nebraska classroom while working as a teacher in the 1990s, a Daily Caller News Foundation investigation found.
In February 1996, a delegation of three “educators” from southeast China visited Walz’s Alliance High School social studies class “to study the education system,” according to an unearthed Alliance Times-Herald article. However, the delegation included CCP officials who at the time worked for an institute serving a Chinese influence and intelligence agency, according to a DCNF review of Chinese government records.
Walz’s longstanding relationship with China has come under increased scrutiny following Vice President Kamala Harris’ August selection of the two-term governor as her running mate. Media reports have since revealed Walz not only misrepresented key details about his China travels, but also appointed a member of a political faction loyal to the CCP to Minnesota’s executive branch.
Neither Walz’s office nor the Harris-Walz campaign responded to multiple requests for comment. (RELATED: Tim Walz Appointed Member Of Political Party ‘Loyal’ To Chinese Communists To State Board)
Republican lawmakers have been demanding answers from federal authorities about the governor’s ties to the communist nation.
Kentucky Rep. James Comer, House Committee on Oversight and Accountability chairman, sent a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray in August requesting information on “any Chinese entity or individual with whom Mr. Walz may have engaged or partnered.”
“Governor Tim Walz’s documented relationships with Chinese Communist Party affiliated entities and officials bears hallmarks of a CCP infiltration and influence campaign,” Comer told the DCNF.
“FBI briefers recently informed the Oversight Committee that the Bureau’s Foreign Influence Task Force investigates CCP subnational influence operations and activity that is similar to how China has engaged with Governor Walz,” Comer said. “The American people deserve to fully understand how deep Governor Walz’s relationship with the CCP goes and the Oversight Committee will continue to press for answers.”
‘Engagement With The CCP’
During a weeks-long tour of U.S. schools, the three members of the Chinese delegation stopped at the rural Nebraska high school where Walz taught social studies, and where he and his wife had been running a program taking students to China.
“Four years ago we had some Alliance High students in China. We’ve had some each year (since),” the designated interpreter, Ning Ziheng, stated during the 1996 visit, Alliance Times-Herald reported.
Identified as being affiliated with Macao Political Institute, Ning Ziheng served as interpreter for Ye Guoqiang and Yi Hongtao, both of whom were members of the Guangzhou Institute of Physical Education, according to the local paper. Located in Guangdong province, the Guangzhou Institute of Physical Education is the “only sports university of higher education in South China,” its archived website states.
While the DCNF found no evidence that Ning Ziheng is a CCP member, the other two had been members of China’s ruling party for decades, according to a DCNF review of Chinese government and academic records.
An archived version of Yi Hongtao’s profile on the Guangzhou Institute of Physical Education website states he joined the CCP in 1976. At the time of the 1996 visit, Yi Hongtao served as the director of the Foreign Affairs Office at Guangzhou Institute of Physical Education and later as a member of the institute’s CCP committee, according to Chinese government records.
A 2021 social media post from the Guangzhou Institute of Physical Education announced that the other delegation member, Ye Guoqiang, had been a CCP member for 56 years — indicating he joined decades before the 1996 Nebraska visit.
Chinese government reports from Guangdong province state Ye Guoqiang served as deputy party secretary in Guangzhou Institute of Physical Education’s CCP committee. Between 1992 and 1997, the institute’s CCP committee published reports authored by Ye Guoqiang, indicating he served as deputy party secretary at the time of the 1996 Nebraska visit.
“Our main purpose is to learn something about education in the states,” said Ning Ziheng of the 1996 trip, according to Alliance Times-Herald. “We will compare it to China and see how we can improve our own education system.”
Alliance High School’s superintendent, Bill Gannon, invited the Chinese delegation to visit the school, Alliance Times-Herald reported. Gannon could not be reached for comment.
“The current school board and administration did not work with Mr. Walz,” Troy Unzicker, superintendent of Alliance Public Schools, told the DCNF by email. “I personally do not know Mr. Walz, so I would be of no help. I am not aware of anyone in the school system that was involved with this.”
During their two days in Alliance, the delegation reportedly first stopped by the Central Elementary School English class of Walz’s wife, Gwen, before visiting Walz’s social studies class. Alliance Times-Herald reported that after visiting Walz’s classroom, the Chinese delegation was slated to watch Alliance High School’s basketball team practice and also had plans to visit local ranches.
“It is interesting to see so much open space. It [America] impresses us a lot,” Ning Ziheng said, according to Alliance Times-Herald. “We think this area is more agricultural. We like this kind of environment.”
Before visiting Nebraska, the delegation toured an unspecified Los Angeles high school, according to Alliance Times-Herald. During a third leg of the trip, the delegation reportedly aimed to visit the University of Northern Iowa.
Ye Guoqiang and Yi Hongtao could not be reached for comment.
‘Grooming, Wooing, And Romancing’
The Guangzhou Institute of Physical Education where the three members of the delegation worked — or had worked previously — is listed as a member unit of a Chinese influence and intelligence service, Chinese government records reveal.
The Guangdong provincial branch of the Chinese People’s Association For Friendship With Foreign Countries (CPAFFC) has repeatedly listed the Guangzhou Institute of Physical Education as a “group member,” including at the time of the 1996 Chinese delegation visit to Nebraska during CPAFFC’s 6th and 7th congresses, which lasted between 1995 and 2005.
Federal authorities characterize CPAFFC as an “affiliate” or “subordinate” of a Chinese influence and intelligence service called the United Front Work Department (UFWD). In 2020, the State Department warned that CPAFFC is a “Beijing-based organization tasked with co-opting subnational governments” that has “sought to directly and malignly influence state and local leaders to promote the PRC’s global agenda.”
Over the years, CPAFFC has held numerous sports events for visiting foreign groups at Guangzhou Institute of Physical Education, and, as recently as 2023, reselected the institute as a member unit.
At the time of the Chinese delegation’s 1996 Nebraska visit, the dean of Guangzhou Institute of Physical Education was a CCP official named Chen Shuhua, who then also served as a Guangdong CPAFFC director, Chinese government records show.
Walz had met Chen Shuhua in China at least once before the Chinese delegation’s 1996 visit, and the DCNF discovered that several trips Walz led to China also visited the institute.
A 1995 Alliance High School yearbook pictures Walz, Chen Shuhua and Ning Ziheng together during the school’s second trip to China sharing “a toast of health and prosperity.” The yearbook photo’s caption identifies Chen Shuhua as “President of Guangzhou Institute of Physical Education” and Ning Ziheng as an “Associate Professor of Sports Psychology and main host for the China Trip.”
Walz and his wife met Ning Ziheng as early as 1992, according to a May 26, 1993 Alliance Times-Herald article concerning a then-upcoming trip to China led by Walz.
“The two have been in contact with Mr. Ning Ziheng in regard to this program since August of 1992,” Alliance Times-Herald reported.
“The group is headed for China, with a special invitation from the Chinese government,” the Star-Herald reported on July 25, 1993. “Walz got the idea while working as a teacher in China three years ago. A friend helped contact the authorities, and funding came through the government this April.”
During this 1993 trip, Walz also apparently took his students to Guangzhou Institute of Sports Education and met with Ning Ziheng, according to a review of local Nebraska newspapers.
“Most of the group’s time will be spent at Guangzhou University, where the students will play sports and take classes in Chinese culture,” the Star-Herald reported.
On Aug. 19. 1993, the Alliance Times-Herald reported students had visited “the University of Guangzhou,” with “Mr. Ning” serving as the trip’s tour guide.
“My favorite thing about the trip was the people!” one trip participant told the paper. “Everybody really liked our guide, Mr. Ning. He was the kind of person who nobody could walk away from without being his friend.”
Walz “knew some Chinese officials who agreed to help set up the tour,” Omaha World-Herald reported in August 1993, with the Star-Herald later reporting that the trip had been “arranged by a friend of Walz in China’s foreign affairs department.”
The Omaha World-Herald reported Walz led his 1993 trip participants to Guangzhou’s Shamian Island.
The tiny, roughly 75-acre island is home to the headquarters of Guangdong CPAFFC, according to its archived website. Today, the Guangdong Foreign Affairs Office shares a website with Guangdong CPAFFC.
The Alliance Times-Herald reported that in 1993 Walz’s group visited the White Swan Hotel, which is located less than 1,000 feet from Guangdong CPAFFC’s headquarters on Shamian Island.
“The White Swan Hotel, a five star hotel, was an interesting place to visit,” one trip participant said, according to Alliance Times-Herald.
In 1994, Walz again helped lead a trip to China and took students to play sports at the “Guangzhou Institute,” the Chadron Record reported.
Walz also continued to bring students to China to meet with Ning Ziheng after he and his wife moved to Minnesota in 1996 to begin teaching at Mankato West High School, the DCNF found.
One undated photo posted by the “Mankato West High School Alumni For Walz” Facebook group shows Ning Ziheng and Walz with students in front of the Ruins of St. Paul’s in Macao, China.
Ning Ziheng also apparently visited Walz in Minnesota on April 4, 1998, according to a photo included in a May 2021 social media post by Chinese-language news outlet Today Macao. The photo appears to show Ning Ziheng beside Walz at Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, playing miniature golf.
“Began golfing under a friend’s guidance,” the photo’s caption reads.
Ning Ziheng has since become a semi-professional golfer and has starred in short films about teaching golf to his sons, produced by the propaganda departments of the General Administration of Sport of China, All-China Sports Federation and the Chinese Olympic Committee.
An undated photo included in an April 2021 Today Macao social media post taken at an unspecified location pictures Walz with Ning Ziheng’s two sons.
Ning Ziheng now serves as a professor of Health Sciences and Sports at Macao Polytechnic University where Walz disclosed previously working as a fellow.
Ning did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
“The Communist Party’s United Front Work Department has been grooming, wooing, and romancing Tim Walz for four decades,” China expert and author Gordon Chang told the DCNF. “We cannot allow our enemy to take over the core of our government.”
‘An End In Itself’
Walz’s relationship with CCP officials may cause him to overlook inappropriate ties between other U.S. lawmakers and CCP officials, says Steve Yates, senior research fellow for China and National Security Policy at the Heritage Foundation.
“For decades many American leaders — whether from academia, business or government — argued that engagement with the CCP was a necessary means to the desirable end of reaching the Chinese people and achieving a better and safer future together,” Yates told the DCNF. “An elegant and tempting ideal.”
In the last three months, the House Oversight Committee has sent multiple letters to federal authorities concerning Walz’s close relationship with China and its political mechanisms. An August 2024 letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray requests information pertaining to matters such as “any warnings or advice the FBI may have given to Governor Walz about U.S. political figures being targeted by or recruited for CCP influence operations.”
More recently, Comer sent a subpoena to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, alleging that whistleblower disclosures notified “the Committee of serious concern among Department of Homeland Security (DHS) personnel regarding a longstanding connection between the CCP and Minnesota Governor Timothy James Walz.”
Walz was recently also forced to admit he’s made several false statements concerning his China travels, following a bombshell September 2024 report from Minnesota Public Radio.
Walz previously stated he’d traveled to China “about 30 times,” however, when pressed, a Walz spokesman told Minnesota Public Radio that the actual number of trips was “closer to 15.”
Minnesota Public Radio’s report also revealed that Walz was not in Hong Kong in May 1989 as the Tiananmen Square protests were intensifying as previously claimed. Rather, Walz was still in Nebraska at that time and didn’t travel to China until August 1989 to begin teaching at the No. 1 Middle School in Guangdong province’s city of Foshan, located directly southwest of Guangzhou.
Walz called himself a “knucklehead” and admitted he “misspoke” when a moderator asked him about the discrepancy during the CBS vice presidential debate.

Walz has also attended several events organized by members of a CCP intel-tied nonprofit in recent years, and, while serving as governor, appointed a member of a political faction loyal to the CCP to a state board on Asian-American affairs, the DCNF reported.
“Over such a long period of time, responsible leaders would ask, who did you end up engaging and empowering and to what actual end?” Yates said. “Walz cannot afford to ask these questions, because for him, engagement with the CCP was an end in itself. He cannot point to where his counterparts are today and say they are making China or the U.S. a better or safer place courtesy of his decades of friendly engagement with the CCP.”

The Daily Caller,"Kamala’s Last-Ditch Pitch To Black Men Is A Dream For Scammers, Fraudsters","Vice President Kamala Harris’s plan to offer $20,000 in forgivable loans to minority entrepreneurs is a golden opportunity for scammers and fraudsters, experts told the Daily Caller.
Harris announced the plan in early October as part of her “Opportunity Agenda for Black Men.” It promises to “ensure that Black men can build wealth and achieve economic success” by providing one million loans, fully forgivable and worth up to $20,000 each, to black entrepreneurs “and others who have historically faced barriers to starting a new business or growing an existing business.”
The loans would be in partnership with the Small Business Administration (SBA), which also oversaw the administration of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), a COVID-era program meant to give small businesses resources “to maintain their payroll, hire back employees who may have been laid off, and cover applicable overhead.”
That program, however, was the target of a sprawling fraud scheme which was “the single largest transfer of money to criminal groups in our history,” Haywood Talcove, the CEO of LexisNexis Risk Solutions Government, told the Daily Caller.
The rate of fraud under COVID-era payment plans like PPP was “conservatively 20 percent” and “probably closer to 35 percent,” Talcove told the Caller. Given the efforts of large transnational criminal organizations, Talcove said, it could be as high as 50 percent. If Harris’s plan saw similar rates of fraud, it would cost the taxpayer billions of dollars. (Stream ‘CLEANING UP KAMALA’ Now)
Of the potentially hundreds of billions of dollars Talcove estimates people stole through COVID programs, the government has only recovered $13 billion, he told the Caller.
In fact, PPP fraud, and exploitation of the similar COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL), has been so rampant that the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee (PRAC) extended the statute of limitation on the crime from five years to 10 in 2023.
In addition to the fraud perpetrated by transnational groups, who Talcove says come from countries like China, Russia, Nigeria and Romania, Americans appeared to exploit COVID relief extensively as well.
The government fully forgave PPP loans that went alleged businesses such as “Free Money LLC,” an apparently New York-based company who had $15,000 in PPP loans forgiven in 2021, according to Pro Publica.

Other eyebrow-raising corporations to receive forgiveness included “Money Makes Money Inc.” and “Nig Corp.”

In 2023, the PRAC also found 69,323 potentially ineligible social security numbers who had received PPP loans, according to a report.
Harris’s new plan appears just as likely to fall victim to exploitation.
“Anytime you have a government-sponsored subsidy that is going to a massive amount of people, the probability for improper payments and fraud is 100 percent,” Talcove said.
“History has shown us that when big sums of money are quickly rolled out with inadequate oversight, we open the door to fraud and abuse,” Republican Texas Rep. Michael Cloud told the Daily Caller.
Criminals are already talking about how they’re going to exploit the program on platforms like Telegram, Talcove said.
Twitter users have also been quick to point out how easily they believe it will be to defraud the government.
“I think Kamala Harris just announced we can run the PPP loan scam again if she get in office,” one user wrote.

“$20,000 isn’t even enough money to launch a food truck, but it is just the right amount to buy a used car or nice vacation while being too small to justify any serious investigation into its misuse,” another said.

The federal government has taken almost no responsibility for the fraud.

“The Biden-Harris Administration allowed fraud to run rampant in federal unemployment programs and is now moving fast to make the pandemic unemployment programs permanent,” Comer wrote in a report.
Despite the committee’s recommendations, which include prioritizing antiquated IT systems and verifying claimants’ proof of work, there is still a lack of federal accountability for the programs, Cloud told the Caller.
“A forgivable loan theoretically comes with conditions that must be met, such as job creation or measurable contributions to the economy, to be forgiven. In practice, though, many of these programs end up functioning like handouts because they lack the rigorous oversight needed to ensure real accountability,” Cloud said.
Talcove concurred. (RELATED: ‘Rigged’: Death Of The American Voter | WATCH NOW)
“When there’s an emergency, like there was with COVID, [the government says] we’ll go get the money later. We’ll stop the criminals later, right? But the fact of the matter is, pay and chase, it doesn’t work.”
“No one ever talks about the victim,” Talcove, who told the Caller his mother was a victim of stolen identity, said. “These are not victimless crimes. There’s somebody that needed the benefit, whose identity was purchased on the dark web for pennies that couldn’t get what they deserved.”
In addition to being vulnerable to fraud, Harris’ race-based plan is also “unconstitutional,” Rep. Cloud said.
“[It’s] a ridiculous thing to propose when our country is currently incredibly divided and all Americans are struggling to afford essentials under her administration,” he said.",2024-10-29
The Daily Caller,Harris Completes Pivot To Failed ‘Democracy’ Message With Speech At J6 Site,"WASHINGTON, D.C. – Vice President Kamala Harris used her closing argument, one week out from the election, to complete a messaging pivot at the Ellipse, where Trump once addressed his supporters hours before the Jan. 6 Capitol Riot.
Harris, surrounded by her usual “freedom” signage, told tens of thousands of her supporters that Trump was “obsessed with revenge,” is a “petty tyrant” and would seek to use the military against his enemies if elected to the White House on Nov. 5. The vice president, adding that the former president was “out for unchecked power” and had an enemies list, further drew on the location of her speech within the first few minutes of her closing argument to try to prove Trump is such.
Harris’ closing arguments displayed a larger campaign message in the final weeks of the election, one that has shifted from one of “joy” to that of calling Trump a fascist, “unhinged,” “unstable” and unfit to lead.
“Look, we know who Donald Trump is. He is the person who stood at this very spot nearly four years ago and sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol to overturn the will of the people in a free and fair election,” Harris said.
“Donald Trump has told us his priorities for a second term. He has an enemies list of people he intends to prosecute. He says one of his highest priorities is to set free the violent extremists who assaulted those law enforcement officers on January 6th,” the continued.
Harris’ final message is one that closely mirrors President Joe Biden’s campaign messaging of pinning Trump down as a “threat to democracy,” which often touched on the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot to illustrate their point.
The Daily Caller spoke to several rally goers at Harris rally, some of who echoed the vice president’s message that “democracy” was on the line in the 2024 election and feared a dangerous Trump if he was elected.
“I think it’s our democracy [that is at stake,]” Jason Vaughn, a nurse practitioner from the south visiting D.C. for the rally and work, told the Caller, “I believe Trump is a fascist.”
“I think he has figured out that he has all this power, and the Supreme Court has told him he can do whatever he wants, and I think he is going to run with that if he is around. It’s do or die,” Marcus Reed, a government employee who lives in D.C., told the Caller.
While her supporters worried about the potential of Trump with unchecked power, the vice president told them in her speech that he could weaponize the military against them.
“Donald Trump intends to use the United States military against American citizens who simply disagree with him. People he calls — quote — ‘the enemy from within.’ This is not a candidate for President who is thinking about how to make your life better,” she said.
“This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power,” Harris continued.
Biden’s messaging reportedly made top Democrats anxious as it wasn’t landing with voters, but still the campaign continued with it. At one point, Biden met with historians to help frame his speeches around “the ongoing threats to democracy and democratic institutions both here in America and around the world, as well as the opportunities we face as a nation,” the White House previously said.
It’s something Biden has continued to parrot despite dropping out of the race. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Wednesday that the president thinks Trump is a fascist.
“You have heard from this president over and over again about the threats to democracy,” Jean-Pierre said. “And the president has spoken about that. You have heard from the former president himself that he is going to be a dictator on day one. This is him, not us. This is him.”
About an hour before, Harris had unexpectedly given remarks from her residence in response to a report from The New York Times and The Atlantic. Both outlets conducted interviews with former Trump chief of staff John Kelly, who said the former president “met the definition of a fascist” and admired figures like former Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler.
The Atlantic article citing Kelly’s comments additionally alleged that Trump disparaged a deceased veteran and her family. The Trump campaign alongside former officials, the deceased veteran’s family and their lawyer have all gone on the record to deny the story.
Harris has repeatedly spoken about Kelly’s comments anyways.
“It is clear from John Kelly’s words that Donald Trump is someone who, I quote, ‘certainly falls into the general definition of fascist.’ Who vowed to be a dictator on day one and vowed to use the military as his personal militia to carry out his personal and political vendettas,” the vice president said.
“Donald Trump is increasingly unhinged and unstable, and in a second term, people like John Kelly would not be there to be the guard rails against his propensities and his actions,” she continued.
Kamala Harris, who calls Trump a fascist, and Joe Biden, who calls Trump’s supporters garbage, have something to say about the divisiveness of Trump’s rhetoric.
— David Sacks (@DavidSacks) October 30, 2024
A few hours after her remarks and Jean-Pierre’s comments, the vice president said she believed Trump was a fascist.
“You quoted General Milly calling Trump a fascist. You yourself have not used that word to describe him. Let me ask you tonight, do you think Donald Trump is a fascist?” CNN host Anderson Cooper asked Harris.
“Yes, I do,” Harris said without hesitation. “And I also believe that the people who know him best on this subject should be trusted.”
But since Harris has pivoted to the message that seemingly played into Biden’s demise, her own party has started to fret about the vice president’s election chances.
“It doesn’t play well in communities that are struggling to make ends meet, and that’s the problem. They’re talking to the wrong people,” Sherry Gay-Dagnogo, a former state representative and Detroit school board member who is backing Harris, told Politico. “We can’t keep campaigning on modes of fear.”
I made a promise to the people of our country: I will fight for you, regardless of who you vote for, and be a president for all Americans. Here is my closing argument. https://t.co/rOqLcTB0TR
— Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) October 29, 2024
During her speech, the vice president drew parallels between the 2024 election to the American revolution, as in both situations, she argued power needed to be wrestled from a “petty tyrant.”
“Just like I always have. Nearly 250 years ago, America was born when we wrested freedom from a petty tyrant,” she said. “Across the generations, Americans have: Preserved that freedom. Expanded it. And in so doing, proved to the world that a government of, by and for the people is strong and can endure. And those who came before us — the patriots at Normandy and Selma. Seneca Falls and Stonewall. On farmlands and factory floors.”
“They did not struggle, sacrifice and lay down their lives, only to see us cede our fundamental freedoms, only to see us submit to the will of another petty tyrant,” Harris continued.
Taylor, a Maryland woman in case management supporting Harris at her D.C. rally, expressed fear at the thought of Trump being president. The Caller omitted Taylor’s last name for the sake of anonymity to allow her to discuss her views freely.
“It’s scary to think that Donald Trump will be back in office, and Project 2025, he is saying he isn’t using it but it was written, so that’s scary,” Taylor told the Caller.
Other Harris supporters at the Ellipse thought that the very rights they hold today could disappear if Trump reaches the White House again.
“Everyone’s freedoms,” a Maryland woman in the travel industry, given anonymity to speak freely, told the Caller. “Even the right to vote.”",2024-10-30
The Daily Caller,UK Socialist Leader Insists He’s Still Good Friends With Trump After Party Staffers Plan Trip To Help Harris,"United Kingdom (U.K.) Prime Minister Keir Starmer — a self-admitted socialist — is insisting he’s very good friends with former President Donald Trump, even as Trump’s campaign has recently filed a complaint against Starmer’s party for sending staffers to campaign for Kamala Harris.
There were reports last week that a high-level Labour Party staffer was organizing a trip to fly approximately 100 party staffers into the U.S. to campaign on behalf of Harris’ campaign, raising concerns about potential foreign election interference. Trump’s campaign filed a legal complaint against the Labour Party following the reports, but Starmer brushed aside concerns that the move was illegal and assured reporters on Wednesday that he was still “good friends” with Trump, according to multiple reports. (RELATED: ‘Unacceptable’: County Fires Election Worker After Republican Spots Ballot Security Lapse In Realtime)
Starmer is now the prime minister of the U.K. after the Labour Party won the country’s elections in July, ousting the Conservative Party and former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak from power. Starmer will have to work with either Trump or Harris on maintaining U.S.-U.K. relations depending on which candidate wins in the November presidential elections.
“I spent time in New York with President Trump, had dinner with him and my purpose in doing that was to make sure that between the two of us, we established a good relationship, which we did,” Starmer told reporters. “We had a good, constructive discussion and, of course, as prime minister of the United Kingdom I will work with whoever the American people return as their president.”
Starmer also told reporters that Labour had sent staffers to volunteer in previous U.S. elections, according to reports.
“They’re doing it in their spare time, they’re doing it as volunteers, they’re staying I think with other volunteers over there. That’s what they’ve done in previous elections, that’s what they’re doing in this election and that’s really straightforward,” Starmer said.
The Labour Party said it isn’t funding the trip and that staffers choosing to go campaign on behalf of Harris have to go on their own dime, according to Politico EU.
The rules and regulations surrounding how foreign nationals can participate in the U.S. election process are strict. Besides the obvious law prohibiting foreign nationals from voting in a U.S. election, they also cannot donate to a political campaign, according to the Federal Election Commission (FEC). Foreign nationals can volunteer for a campaign, but they cannot be a part of the decision-making process as to how the campaign should operate.
The Labour Party insists its staffer trip to the U.S. is in compliance with these laws, according to Politico EU. But the Trump campaign feels there are aspects to the trip that may be crossing the line.
“Those searching for foreign interference in our elections need to look no further than [the] LinkedIn post,” the Trump campaign wrote in a legal complaint to the FEC.
The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Daily Caller,‘I’ve Heard It All Before’: Scott Jennings Lists Republicans Who Democrats Compared To Hitler In The Past,"Republican strategist Scott Jennings said Wednesday night that he’s “heard” comparisons of prominent Republicans to German dictator Adolf Hitler going back to the George W. Bush administration during a panel on CNN.
Vice President Kamala Harris used a Wednesday press conference to highlight claims from an article in The Atlantic that former President Donald Trump expressed a desire for generals like those who served under Hitler. Jennings told Jamal Simmons, a former aide to Harris, that he was “calloused” to Hitler comparisons. (RELATED: ‘You Don’t Need To Interrupt’: Sparks Fly Between Scott Jennings And WaPo Columnist Over Trump, IVF)
“Now, I’m calloused on this Hitler business because I lived through the Bush years and I used to peer out my window onto Pennsylvania Avenue and I saw everybody marching around in their brown uniforms, signs up, ‘Bush is Hitler, Bush is Hitler,’” Jennings said. “And then they did it to John McCain. They did it to Mitt Romney. They’ve done it to Donald Trump. Even did it to Paul Ryan, I recall at one point. So I’ve heard it all before.”
WATCH:
Prior to listing Republicans who Democrats had compared to the Nazi leader, Jennings noted that vulnerable Democratic Senators were touting their ability to work with Trump.
“It probably will shock Kamala Harris and the rest of her campaign staff to learn that there are incumbent Democrat U.S. senators in this country right now running television ads touting all their work with this modern-day Hitler,” Jennings said, later adding, “I mean, if he were really Hitler, if he were really a threat to democracy, not a single Democrat in this country would be running ads touting their work with Donald Trump.”
Jennings then said that anti-Israel protests on college campuses where demonstrators made statements like “resistance is justified” and chanted “from the river to the sea, Palestine will be free,” a slogan that has connotations of wiping out Israel, made antisemitism appear to be coming from left-wing sources. (Watch The Daily Caller Documentary “Poisoned Ivies”)
“I think the reason Democrats are freaking out about it right now is because what they have learned is that it‘s not Republicans who are the Hitlers or the Nazis, it‘s actually emanating from within their own party,” Jennings said. “If you want to find Hitler-ish, Nazi-esque antisemitic tendencies, look on the left, not on the right.”
When Simmons claimed Jennings was trying to dodge the point about Trump, Jennings cut him off.
“She literally spoke in front of the Naval Observatory today, ‘Trump is Hitler,’” Jennings said in reference to Harris.

The Daily Caller,CNN’s Harry Enten Says ‘Movement’ Toward Trump ‘Among A Key Bloc’ In Crucial States ‘Gives Democrats Some Agita’,"CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten said Wednesday that he thinks former President Donald Trump’s gains with independents in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are making Democrats uneasy.
Trump currently holds narrow leads over Vice President Kamala Harris in all three states, according to RealClearPolling averages. Enten, on “CNN News Central,” noted Trump is now slightly leading among independents in these battleground states, a shift from 2020 when he trailed President Joe Biden with this demographic. (RELATED: Former Clinton Pollster Says Harris’ ‘Inauthenticity’ Is ‘The Larger Problem She Faces’ In Election)
WATCH:
“What do we know about independents, right? Center of the electorate. You go last time around Joe Biden won these voters by 11 points. You look at September of 2024, a month ago, Kamala Harris was up five points among independents. You look now though, look at this. She’s only up by two points among a key bloc, center of the electorate, down nine points from where Biden was at the end of the 2020 campaign,” Enten told host John Berman. “Of course, this is a national picture … What is going on in those key battleground states, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, the Great Lakes, that blue wall, right?”
“Joe Biden, last time around, won ’em by five points over Donald Trump. Look at where we are today. This is the type of movement Donald Trump likes to see in the center of the electorate, up by a point. Now, of course, that’s well within any margin of error, right? But again, it‘s the movement. It’s the trend, Mr. Berman, that we’re looking at,” he added. “And when you flip a group from going plus five Biden to now plus one Trump. That’s the type of movement Donald Trump loves to see, and it’s the type of movement that I think gives Democrats some agita.”
Enten also asserted presidential candidates who win with independent voters typically secure an election victory, though not always.
“Why are we seeing this movement in the electorate, perhaps away from the Democrats towards Donald Trump? And this is true overall, this is true among independents as well. View as too liberal, right? Are you out of the mainstream, perhaps? 38% said that of Joe Biden back in 2020, now that number is up to 48% for Kamala Harris versus the 40% or so who see Trump as too conservative,” he added. “The bottom line is Harris may be a little bit too out of the mainstream, at least compared to Donald Trump when we’re talking ideologically speaking.”
Harris supported many left-wing policies during her 2020 presidential bid, but reversed some of her stances since launching her 2024 campaign in July. Her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, also has a far-left record on issues such as immigration and transgender policy.
Trump also currently leads Harris in the other four top swing states, according to the RealClearPolling averages. Journalist Mark Halperin asserted Tuesday that Trump will be president-elect on Nov. 5 if the present early voting trajectory persists.
“Make no mistake, if these numbers hold up in the states where we can understand even partially what the data is like, we’ll know that Donald Trump’s going to be president on Election Day,” he said.

The Daily Caller,Blue State To Offer Free Birth Control Using Multimillion Dollar Taxpayer Fund,"Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer launched a new program in her state Wednesday offering free birth control to all residents.
The “Take Control of your Birth Control” program will provide Michiganders with condoms, over-the-counter oral contraceptives and emergency contraception starting in November until supplies run out, according to a press release. The program is being administered by Michigan’s Department of Health and Human Services, which was awarded $5.6 million in taxpayer funds to expand family planning services, according to the state’s budget.
“Everyone, no matter how much money they make, deserves to make their own decisions about their own reproductive health and future,” Whitmer said in the press release. “With our family planning initiative, ‘Take Control of Your Birth Control,’ we are building on our work to protect reproductive freedom for all Michiganders. By expanding access to essential family planning tools, we are underscoring our commitment to ensuring Michiganders, along with their families and trusted health care providers, can make their own decisions about their own bodies and lives.”
The Biden-Harris administration on Monday called for private insurance companies to cover the cost of over-the-counter birth control through the Affordable Care Act, which Whitmer praised on X in an announcement for the new Michigan program. (‘Buy Votes’: Michigan Republicans Blast State Dems For Trying To Keep Residents On Dole As Election Looms)

The governor has been a vocal pro-abortion advocate, suggesting she supports the practice through all nine months and even sued prosecutors in her state in 2022 in an attempt to enshrine abortion into the state constitution. The state passed a constitutional amendment that November legalizing abortion through 24 weeks of pregnancy and making it illegal to penalize doctors that perform the procedure.

The Daily Caller,Feds Fund ‘Environmental Justice’ Literacy And ‘LGBTQ+’ Health In Chicago Public Schools As Students Fall Behind,"Roughly 40% of public school students in Chicago are chronically absent, commonly defined as missing at least 10% of days in a given school year, and the vast majority of the students actually showing up to class lack proficiency in math and reading. Amid these conditions, CPS asked federal agencies for funds to increase students’ “literacy for environmental justice” and to improve “mental health equity” for racial minority and “LGBTQ+” pupils, according to government spending records.
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) awarded over $400,000 to CPS in August after the district requested funds to help improve the health of its “LGBTQ+” and newcomer students, according to government spending records. The six-figure grant will help address the issues that arise from higher rates of risky sexual behavior, drug usage and worse mental health statuses among LGBT students. (Stream The Daily Caller’s documentary ‘Cleaning Up Kamala’ HERE)
Even as the proportion of chronically absent students remains high, and as test scores remain low, CPS boasts a graduation rate of 83%. The Illinois Policy Institute, a right-of-center think tank, has accused CPS of “promoting students who haven’t mastered critical skills” and argued that doing so “is unfair to those students and sets them up for frustration later in life.”
Another grant appeal CPS made to HHS cites the disproportionately poor health outcomes of black and “Latinx” students to request resources to fund “training for [a] mental health equity” program that “links mental health awareness with a foundational understanding of bias-based harm,” records show. The grant, worth nearly a half million dollars and awarded to the district in August, will train school administrators to improve their proficiency in “recognizing, preventing, responding to and transforming incidents of bias and discrimination.”
As of 2023, over 80% of CPS students between third and eighth grade failed to meet grade-level standards for math with roughly three-quarters failing to meet the standards for reading, according to the Illinois Policy Institute. While students struggle with basic literacy in Chicago, the school board has appealed to the federal government to foster “literacy for environmental justice” among students, according to federal records.
The Department of Commerce (DOC) approved a $75,000 grant proposal from CPS to prepare students for “success in civic life” by teaching them to investigate and understand “scientific solutions which build resilience to extreme weather and climate change,” according to federal spending records.
As CPS requested financial assistance to fund environmental and racial justice, the district faced a half-billion-dollar deficit coming into this school year, The Washington Post reported. The financial shortfall was the product of CPS’ refusal to make spending cuts as the district’s $2.8 billion in COVID-19 relief funding dries up. Even as the district faces an uncertain financial future, the local teachers’ union is pushing for more hiring and increased pay.
“This is what it looks like when you burn a district down,” Georgetown University education professor Marguerite Roza told The Post. “It is a level of dysfunction that feels beyond destabilizing, enough to make people lose confidence in the system.”
Amid the failure to resolve the budgetary tension with the mayor, every member of Chicago’s school board resigned in October.
CPS, DOC and HHS did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s requests for comment.

The Daily Caller,‘He’s Not Helping’: Ex-CNN Analyst Says Biden’s Call To ‘Lock’ Trump ‘Up’ Is ‘Absolutely Bad For Kamala Harris’,"Former CNN political analyst Chris Cillizza said Wednesday that President Joe Biden’s comment about having to “lock [former President Donald Trump] up” is damaging to Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign.
Biden made the “lock him up” remark Tuesday at New Hampshire’s Democratic National Committee office, referencing the tight race between Trump and Harris and claiming the former president believes he is immune from “physically eliminating” threats. Cillizza, on his YouTube channel, said while he does not believe Biden is deliberately undermining Harris, his comment will likely give Trump a boost in his efforts to defeat her. (RELATED: Former Clinton Pollster Says Harris’ ‘Inauthenticity’ Is ‘The Larger Problem She Faces’ In Election)
WATCH:
“Now, Biden, probably realizing what a dumb thing he had just said, added, ‘Politically lock him up. Lock him out, that’s what we have to do.’ Yeah, that’s the ticket,” Cillizza said. “Uh, come on, man, like we, ‘Politically lock him up,’ what the hell does that mean? When the president of the United States says, ‘We gotta lock him up’ about the former president of the United States, who has premised almost his entire political life on the idea that the Democrats and the ‘deep state’ are trying to lock him up, I mean, it’s really not good.”
“If the Trump campaign is smart, this will be in a Trump campaign ad. It affirms for the Republican base everything that Donald Trump is saying — that secretly the Democrats, from Joe Biden on down, including Kamala Harris, are just out to get him, right? He has said this for years,” he added. “And when the president of the United States says, ‘We gotta lock him up,’ and then says, ‘Politically lock him up,’ yeah, it’s just not good. Look, do I think this ends the race? No, of course not. Do I think Trump would be smart to put it in an ad? Yes, as I said, I do.”
Four criminal indictments were brought against Trump in 2023 involving alleged election interference and mishandling of classified documents. Trump repeatedly characterized the Manhattan case against him as “election interference,” referring to it as a “Biden witch hunt” and the “Biden Case.”
WATCH:
“I do not think Joe Biden is running a secret conspiracy to make Kamala Harris lose, but I do think that when you say things like ‘We gotta lock him up,’ ‘gotta lock him up’ about Donald Trump two weeks before an election, it affirms everything Donald Trump has been arguing,” Cillizza said later. “It makes the Republican base even more rabid to turn out, right? As if they weren’t rabid enough — they’re pretty rabid to turn out. They’re going to be even more rabid, so he’s not helping.”
“I get it, but like, he needs to not really do anything like this again. Like, it is absolutely bad for Kamala Harris, and I bet when her campaign read the ‘We gotta lock him up’ thing, they were like, ‘Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe,'” he added.
Biden presently has no intentions of appearing alongside his vice president on the campaign trail before Nov. 5, three White House officials and three Harris campaign officials recently told NBC News.

“Rising is shorter than usual today because I chose not to continue sitting at a desk with someone who falsely accused me of ‘Nazi writings’ because they were losing an argument,” Duke, who previously worked as the Daily Caller’s White House Correspondent, tweeted Tuesday.

The pair were discussing a controversy surrounding former CNN contributor Ryan Gidursky’s dismissal from the network when Konst said “you’ve made Nazi comments in the past, I’m not gonna bring that up.”
Duke defended herself. “I haven’t made Nazi comments,” she retorted. (RELATED: New Daily Caller Doc Exposes The Left-Wing Hate Crime Hoaxers Ruining America)
“After the segment was over my cohost started screaming and insisting I had done Nazi writings while working for the Daily Caller. We got into it once before off air but nothing like this. It was incredibly toxic,” Duke told the Daily Caller.
“I left because I won’t sit at a desk with someone who would seriously accuse me of Nazism. Oddly enough, I took my rosary with me to the studio and set it next to my computer this morning because I had a feeling something bad was going to happen. I think it’s the only way I was able to stay relatively calm throughout the ordeal,” she concluded.
The spat stemmed from their Gidursky discourse after he jokingly told pro-Palestinian commentator Medhi Hasan’s he hopes his “beeper doesn’t go off” during a Monday episode of CNN‘s “News Night With Abby Phillip.”
The joke was likely a reference to the mass-pager explosions that Israel allegedly orchestrated against members of the terrorist organization Hezbollah based in Lebanon. Girdusky made the comment after Hasan quipped “if you don’t want to be called Nazis, stop … saying things.”

The Daily Caller,EXCLUSIVE: Jim Jordan Demands File On Afghan National Charged With Attempting Terror Attack On Election Day,"House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan sent letters Tuesday to the State Department and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) demanding information about the Afghan man with reported ties to ISIS who allegedly planned an Election Day terrorist attack in the U.S.
The Daily Caller first obtained copies of the letters to Secretary of State Antony Blinken and DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. In the letters, Jordan demands the following:
- Case history documents and information, including, but not limited to, the alien’s immigration history, immigration benefits applications, the alien file (A-file) or consular file (including all consular notes), and immigration detention status and history.
- Documents sufficient to show the time, date, and place of any and all of the alien’s entries into the United States.
- Documents sufficient to show the alien’s processing by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials, including whether CBP officials were alerted to derogatory information about the alien and what questions were asked of the alien during the screening process.
- A briefing regarding the immigration issues, including processes and procedures, concerning this case.
The Department of Justice (DOJ) announced earlier in October that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) arrested 27-year-old Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, who was living in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. He was charged him with conspiring and attempting to support ISIS with violent acts scheduled for the upcoming U.S. elections in November.

“Aliens who intend to commit terrorist activities exploit vulnerabilities in our nation’s immigration system to the detriment of those in the United States. The Biden-Harris Administration’s border and immigration policies only increase the likelihood that such aliens will successfully enter and remain in the U.S. Pursuant to the Rules of the House of Representatives, the Committee on the Judiciary is authorized to conduct oversight of federal immigration policy and procedures,” Jordan wrote in the letter.

The Daily Caller,Florida Sues Biden-Harris DOJ For Allegedly Blocking Trump Assassination Attempt Investigation,"Florida sued the Biden-Harris administration’s Department of Justice (DOJ) Wednesday for allegedly blocking the state’s investigation into the second Trump assassination attempt.
Federal officials almost immediately began “taking steps to halt the state’s investigation” into Ryan Wesley Routh, who was indicted for attempting to assassinate former President Donald Trump at his Florida golf course in September, the lawsuit states.
“Every day that Florida is prevented from investigating, the State’s case becomes harder to prove at trial,” the lawsuit states. “By contrast, the federal government suffers no injury from Florida investigating state law crimes, as the State has no intention of interfering with or obstructing the federal investigation.” (RELATED: Trump Assassination Attempt Suspect Seeks Judge’s Recusal From Case)
Republican Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed an executive order two days after the Sept. 15 attempt directing Florida law enforcement agencies to investigate and ensure violations of state law were referred for prosecution.
Attorney General Ashley Moody wrote a letter Sept. 23 to FBI Director Christopher Wray indicating it would be a “mistake” to frustrate Florida’s investigation.
In a Sept. 30 response, U.S. Attorney Lapointe said the state cannot conduct investigative activities until the federal prosecution is complete, according to the lawsuit. Federal officials indicated that activities like interviewing potential witnesses are illegal under federal law, the lawsuit states.
Routh was initially charged with two gun offenses. The DOJ later charged him with attempted assassination on Sept. 24.
The statute Routh was charged under states that local authority will be suspended once federal jurisdiction is asserted.
The DOJ declined to comment on the lawsuit.

The Daily Caller,Joe Scarborough Calls On Harris To Disavow Past Support Of Taxpayer-Funded Sex Changes For Prisoners,"MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough on Thursday urged Vice President Kamala Harris to renounce her previous support for taxpayer-funded sex changes for prison inmates.
Harris has previously indicated she supports tax-payer funded sex changes for transgender prison inmates and illegal immigrants. Scarborough, during a conversation with comedian Bill Maher on “Morning Joe,” said it should be “very easy” for Harris to reverse her position, which she espoused during her 2020 presidential campaign. (RELATED: Kamala Harris Co-Sponsored Bill That Would Force Schools To Let Male Athletes Compete In Girls’ Sports)
WATCH:
“Kamala’s big, I think, challenge here to win over the undecided voters is to convince them that she’s not part of what they suspect she might be, sort of a stealth version of the worst excesses of the left,” Maher said. “I said there’s a coalition of [former President Donald] Trump voters, people who really like him, they certainly are those, and then there’s people who don’t necessarily like him that much, but they still think he’s less crazy than stuff that strikes them as aggressively anti-common sense that takes place on the left, and that’s why they keep running that ad about sex changes in prison.”
Maher and Scarborough both noted they frequently see a Trump campaign advertisement alleging Harris backs these operations for prisoners and illegal immigrants during football games.
“By the way, it’s very easy to say: ‘Yeah, I said that in 2019. I was in a competitive’ — now she did say — I think she said this was the law under Trump too,” Scarborough said. “He didn’t change it, but it’s very easy to say, ‘I don’t believe that anymore.’ And on that issue, she should.”
When Fox News host Bret Baier recently inquired about her current stance on the operations for illegal immigrants, Harris stated, “I’ll follow a law,” asserting that it’s “a law that Donald Trump actually followed.”
Radio host Charlamagne Tha God in September said the Trump campaign ad “was effective,” particularly because of how it aired during football games, adding that he doesn’t want his taxes funding sex changes for these individuals.
CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten said Wednesday that he thinks a reason Harris is losing ground with independent voters is because they perceive her as “too liberal.” She currently lags behind Trump in all of the seven top battleground states, according to the RealClearPolling averages.

The Daily Caller,"‘You Don’t Need To Interrupt’: Sparks Fly Between Scott Jennings And WaPo Columnist Over Trump, IVF","Republican strategist Scott Jennings clashed with Washington Post columnist Catherine Rampell Monday night over former President Donald Trump’s support of in-vitro fertilization (IVF).
Trump vowed to make IVF free if elected during an August campaign event in Michigan. Rampell expressed skepticism about Trump’s position while on a panel during “CNN News Night.” (RELATED: ‘I’ll Have To Speak Up’: Scott Jennings, David Axelrod Get Into Verbal Brawl Over State Abortion Law)
“Donald Trump’s not running for state representative in any particular state. He is running for president, and he’s made his position on this very clear,” Jennings said. “He’s got a very moderate, center-right, long-standing Republican position that goes back to Reagan. He’s pro-life, he believes in some moderate limits on weeks. He believes in the three exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother. He has been a champion, a champion for IVF.”
WATCH:
“He has not. I’m sorry, I need to interrupt —” Rampell said before Jennings interjected. “He absolutely has. You don’t need to interrupt because you‘re wrong. He has been a champion in the party for speaking for IVF.”
Trump called for IVF to be protected after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled on Feb. 16 that frozen embryos resulting from successful IVF procedures would be viewed as unborn children during a case involving three families suing a medical facility that destroyed the embryos. The Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal by the medical facility on Oct. 7.
“People watching, I wrote about this like two weeks ago, you can look at —” Rampell said, as Jennings interrupted, saying, “I listen to what he says all the time. He has —”
“I look at his record. I look at his record,” Rampell responded as someone else tried to cut in, later adding, “Look at his actual record. For example, his recent statement saying, ‘Oh, we‘re going to make insurers cover IVF,’ you know that he led the initiative to repeal ObamaCare, which got rid of all essential health benefits, all requirements for insurers to cover any sort of health care. That would include IVF.”
Rampell cited legislation proposed by Democrats to protect IVF, which Jennings dismissed as a “sham vote.”
Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina also introduced legislation to protect access to IVF and other fertility treatments shortly after the Alabama Supreme Court’s ruling.

The Daily Caller,‘It’s Horrible’: Undecided Pennsylvania Voter Panel Unanimously Opposes Harris Calling Trump ‘Fascist’,"A focus group of eight undecided Pennsylvania voters on Thursday unanimously expressed disapproval of Vice President Kamala Harris referring to former President Donald Trump “as a fascist.”
Harris said during a CNN town hall Wednesday that she thinks Trump is “a fascist” in light of former White House chief of staff John Kelly telling The New York Times and The Atlantic that the former president exhibited “fascist” tendencies and allegedly praised Adolf Hitler. Three of the voters, featured on journalist Mark Halperin’s 2WAY platform, commented that Harris’ remarks were off-putting or unlikely to help her win the November election, while none of the eight raised their hands when Halperin asked if the vice president should be campaigning on this issue. (RELATED: Biden Campaigns On Trump Being A Threat To Democracy, But Voters May Not Be Buying It: POLL)
WATCH:
“In the last few days, the vice president has started to talk about Donald Trump as a fascist, as someone who’s spoken approvingly of Hitler. Raise your hand if you’ve heard about those comments,” Halperin directed, with all eight confirming they had. “Okay. What do folks think, is that something that’s persuasive to you, is that something that you’ll factor into your vote?”
“To me, it’s horrible that she’s saying that about him. If he was saying that about her, everybody would be up in arms,” a voter named Linda Wright answered. “I just don’t think that’s right.”
Halperin asked for more voter input, specifying that Harris was espousing the rhetoric “based on accounts of people who’ve worked with President Trump.”
“She obviously thinks it’s going to help her. I don’t think it does it all,” a voter named Josh Cantor asserted. “I don’t know why, if it was Kelly who heard the president say that, I’m not saying he did or he didn’t, I don’t think he’d lie — I think you said that, Mark, on an episode — but I think that he had a responsibility to resign the day that was said if that’s true. I don’t think that’s the case.”
“I think part of the reason why I’m being pushed towards Trump so strongly is that I find that the Democrats and the left just keep going straight to Hitler all of the time with everything,” a voter named Karsten Chu said. “And if it’s not the left pushing Hitler, it’s the right pushing Stalin so it’s like we’re fighting World War II every single day for every single election so it’s so exhausting. I think it just detracts from — it pushes me away from their position and it, you know, it’s so hyperbolic that it makes it impossible to have good discussions and I think it ruins the discourse.”
Halperin then asked voters to raise their hands if they believe “it’s valuable” or “important” for Harris to be promoting the allegations against Trump, with not a single participant raising their hand.
The Trump campaign has denied the allegations against him, including Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung telling the NYT that Kelly’s alleged White House recollections are “debunked stories” and asserting the former White House chief of staff had “beclowned” himself.
Harris now slightly trails Trump in each of the seven top battleground states, according to the RealClear Polling averages. Trump is only leading the vice president by .6% in Pennsylvania.

The Daily Caller,‘Serious Problem For Blacks’: Kamala Harris’ Dad Once Warned Against Mass Immigration,"Vice President Kamala Harris’ father, Donald Harris, once co-authored a treatise in which he argued mass immigration was dangerous for the United States, particularly for black Americans.
The 1988 book titled “Black Economic Progress: An Agenda for the 1990s” described immigration as “a particularly serious problem for blacks” due to there being fewer jobs available for working-class Americans, according to the New York Post. Donald Harris was reportedly a Marxist economist and currently has a strained relationship with his daughter, the sitting vice president, following his divorce from her mother and a difficult custody battle.
“Trends in international trade have moved against U.S. workers,” the treatise reads, according to the Post. “U.S. immigration laws have been modified in ways that increase the influx of low-skilled workers, who compete with native-born youths and low-skilled adult workers for low-skilled jobs.”
“This shift has been a particularly serious problem for blacks, who constitute a high proportion of the low-skilled adult workers,” the book continues, according to the Post.
Kamala Harris assumed the unofficial role of “border czar” under the Biden-Harris administration during which there were roughly 8.5 million migrant encounters along the U.S.-Mexico border. The vice president proclaimed in August her new-found support for the building of a wall along the southern border after repeatedly criticizing former President Donald Trump for his stance on immigration and previously referring to his plan for a wall as “un-American.”
An October House Judiciary Committee report revealed that nearly one million illegal migrants currently reside in the U.S. without consequences or fear of deportation under “quiet amnesty” due to their immigration cases being closed, terminated or dismissed.

The Daily Caller,‘You Can’t Say You Weren’t Warned’: CNN’s Harry Enten Breaks Down ‘Signs’ Pointing To Trump Victory,"CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten on Wednesday outlined factors that point to former President Donald Trump defeating Vice President Kamala Harris in November.
Trump and Harris are currently locked in a tight race as the former president holds a narrow lead over the vice president in six of the top seven battleground states, according to the RealClearPolling averages. Enten, on “CNN News Central,” said that voter dissatisfaction with the country’s trajectory, President Joe Biden’s unpopularity and high Republican registration numbers are indicators favoring a Trump victory. (RELATED: Prominent Election Expert Suggests Pollsters ‘Have No Idea’ If They’re Accurately Measuring Trump Support)
WATCH:
“Just 28% of Americans, voters think the country is going in the right direction, is on the right track. And I want to put that into a historical perspective for you. Okay, what’s the average percentage of the public that thinks that the country is on the right track when the incumbent party loses? It’s 25%,” Enten said. “That 25% looks an awful bit like that 28% up there. It doesn’t look anything, anything like this 42% [average when the incumbent party won] doesn’t look anything like this 28%.”
“So the bottom line is very few Americans think the country is on the right track at this particular point. It tracks much more with when the incumbent party loses than with [when] it wins. In fact, I went back through history, there isn’t a single time in which 28% of the American public thinks the country is going on the right track in which the incumbent party actually won,” he added. They always lose when just 28% of the country believes that the country is on the right track.”
Enten also noted that Biden’s low approval rating could historically signal a loss for Harris based on previous presidents with net negative approval ratings not being followed by successors from their own party.
“Now, we don’t know if Kamala Harris is going to succeed Joe Biden, but we know back in 2008, George W. Bush’s approval rating was down in the 20’s. Did a Republican succeed George W. Bush? No. How ’bout in 1968? Lyndon Baines Johnson, his net approval rating was negative. Did a Democrat succeed Lyndon Baines Johnson? No,” the data reporter said. “How ’bout in ’52 Harry S. Truman, his approval rating was in the 20’s, if not the upper teens.”
“Did a Democrat succeed Harry S. Truman in ’52? My memory, no … Dwight Eisenhower, a Republican, succeeded Harry S. Truman,” he continued. “So the bottom line is for Kamala Harris to win, she’d have to break history, be a Democrat to succeed Joe Biden when Biden’s approval rating is way underwater at this point.”
Moreover, Enten said Republicans have been gaining ground against Democrats in party registration in the battleground states, particularly noting Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.
“So Republicans are putting more Republicans in the electorate, the Democratic number versus the Republican number has shrunk. And so the bottom line is if Republicans win, come next week, Donald Trump wins comes next week, the signs all along will have been obvious,” he said. “We would look at the right direction being very low, Joe Biden’s approval rating being very low and Republicans really registering numbers. You can’t say you weren’t warned.”

The Daily Caller,‘Going Down?’: Top Democrats Reportedly Anxious About Harris’ Election Chances,"Top Democrats are worried about Vice President Kamala Harris’ chances Nov. 5 while most polls have the presidential race locked in a dead heat, according to Axios.
Less than two weeks to go, top Democrats are already discussing who is to blame for a loss to former President Donald Trump: the vice president or President Joe Biden for failing to drop out of the race earlier, Axios reported based on conversations with officials inside her campaign and top Biden administration officials. Democrats expressed concern to Axios that in her shortened campaign the vice president hasn’t defined herself enough and has cast too many different arguments against Trump.
“She is who she is,” one longtime Democratic strategist told the outlet. “Let’s hope it’s enough.”
“Going down?” a top Democratic official sent in a text to Axios.
The Harris campaign is worried about the vice president’s chances in the states that make up the “blue wall,” especially in Michigan, where the Muslim community is prominent, three sources with knowledge of the campaign’s strategy told NBC News. (RELATED: ‘We’re Desperate’: Socialists, Muslims Band Together To Deny Harris The White House)
As top Democrats worry the vice president hasn’t done a good job making the case for why she should be president, many were impressed with a line she used during a CNN town hall Wednesday, Axios reported.
“Just imagine the Oval Office in three months … It’s either Donald Trump in there stewing — stewing! — over his enemies list, or me, working for you, checking off my to-do list,” Harris said.
“Better late than never,” a top Democrat told Axios, with another adding, “it’s good. We’re not dead yet.”
During that same town hall, the vice president said she believed Trump was a fascist, citing comments his former chief of staff John Kelly made to The New York Times and the Atlantic. Earlier that day, Harris gave impromptu remarks on the articles in which Kelly claimed that Trump would rule like a fascist, said Hitler “did some good things” and wanted generals like the Nazi dictator.
The Trump campaign has denied both stories.
The Atlantic story also alleged that Trump disparaged a deceased veteran and her family. Former officials, the Trump campaign, the veteran’s family and their lawyer all went on the record to deny the story.
“All of this is further evidence for the American people of who Donald Trump really is,” Harris said about the stories. “This is a window into who Donald Trump really is, from the people who know him best. From the people who worked with him side by side, in the Oval Office and in the Situation Room.
“It is clear from John Kelly’s words that Donald Trump is someone who, I quote, ‘certainly falls into the general definition of fascist.’ Who vowed to be a dictator on day one and vowed to use the military as his personal militia to carry out his personal and political vendettas,” she continued.
In the final weeks of the campaign, Harris’ message has shifted to criticizing Trump and the threat he poses to the nation. Biden’s campaign message was similar and centered around calling Trump a threat to democracy. Before the president ended his bid for the White House, senior Democrats alongside some of Biden’s aides were doubting the “threat to democracy” slogan, Axios reported.
Harris is poised to make her closing argument for new leadership Tuesday at the spot Trump spoke at before the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, according to NBC News.",2024-10-25
The Daily Caller,Tucker At Trump Rally: ‘They Went Out Of Their Way To Humiliate You And Spit On You And The Graves Of Your Ancestors’,"Political commentator Tucker Carlson warmed up the crowd Wednesday at a rally for former President Donald Trump in Duluth, Georgia, warning Democrats that “dad” is coming home.
Carlson delivered an impassioned rebuke of the Democratic Party, telling Trump supporters in the room that they are the American majority rather than a hated minority.
He ripped Democrats who support tearing down statues and allowing illegal migrants to pour into the U.S., declaring that the majority of America will tolerate this no more.
“They went out of their way to humiliate and spit on you and the graves of your ancestors,” a fiery Carlson said in his speech.
Carlson said Trump, who he likened to a father coming home from work, would give the Biden-Harris administration a “spanking” if he wins the 2024 election.
“If you allow your hormone-addled 15-year-old daughter to, like, slam the door of her bedroom and give you the finger, you’re gonna get more of it. And those kids are gonna end up in rehab!” Carlson explained. “It’s not good for you and it’s not good for them.”
“There has to be a point at which dad comes home,” he stated as the crowd erupted in a standing ovation. “Yeah, that’s right! Dad comes home. And he’s pissed!”
Carlson said while “dad” is actually not pissed and still loves his children, “dad” is greatly disappointed in his children and must let them know.
“And when dad gets home, you know what he says? ‘You’ve been a bad girl. You’ve been a bad little girl and you’re getting a vigorous spanking,'” Carlson said.
CNN’s Brian Stelter reported that the crowd shouted, “Daddy’s home” and “daddy Don,” as Trump took the stage.
After Tucker Carlson likened Trump to “daddy” tonight, and said a reelected Trump would need to give the media and Democrats a “spanking,” the rally crowd “went wild,” @alaynatreene reports.

“To allow millions of people, mostly young men with no skills and no English, into our country illegally and then fly them around at our expense and give them phones and put them on welfare programs that American citizen can get. It is the most insulting-” Carson said, causing the audience to boo the Biden-Harris administration’s role in the border crisis.

The Daily Caller,"Overregulation In Childcare Tied To Families Having Less Kids, Report Says","Families in states with highly regulated childcare systems are more likely than in less strict states to have fewer kids than they desire in connection with the increased cost of childcare, an October report found.
Strict regulations on childcare, such as increased educational requirements, more training hours for employees and limited child-to-staff ratios, are meant to improve the service and appeal more to parents but often increase costs, likely factoring into parents’ decisions to have more kids or not, according to a report by West Virginia University’s Knee Regulatory Research Center.
“Childcare challenges facing U.S. families are making news headlines as a ‘classic’ example of market failure,” the report reads. “With wages that are too low relative to prices, it is easy to assume that the childcare market simply cannot clear. This prompts calls for greater intervention in the form of subsidies. However, a subsidy approach misses the key role that the regulatory environment of the childcare market plays in raising costs. Though well-intended, the regulatory framework cripples progress towards affordability, availability, flexibility, and quality for American families seeking childcare solutions.”
The average fertility gap in the U.S. — the difference between desired family size and actual family size — is 0.8 kids but is lower by between 0.025 and 0.029 in states with less restrictive childcare regulations, the study found. The study predicted that if Massachusetts, the state with the highest regulations, such as requiring more staff per student and more education for employees, adopted the same policies as Louisiana, the state with the lowest regulations, the total fertility rate in the state would increase by 14%.
“Childcare workers and parents bear the weight of licensing regulations and administrative costs,” Anna Claire Flowers, co-author of the report and PhD fellow with the Mercatus Center, said in a statement. “High-quality care is the goal, but some measures have been shown to boost prices much more than quality. Regulation on childcare affects entrepreneurial decisions in the industry and influences parents’ labor market decisions. While not the only major player, childcare regulation is one piece of the policy puzzle that can make it more or less difficult for families to find compatibility between work responsibilities and raising children.”
States like those in New England generally have stricter regulations and higher-than-average fertility gaps, the report found. States like Texas, Nevada and Arizona had some of the least strict childcare regulations and fared better than the national average for fertility gap rates. (RELATED: Kamala Harris Voted Against Trump-Era Bill That Expanded Child Tax Credits She Champions)
Childcare costs rose nationally by 32% from 2019 to 2023, outpacing the 20% rise in overall prices within that same time frame.

The Daily Caller,Wall Street Billionaires Starting To Bet On Trump Win,"Hedge fund managers are preparing for a potential Trump win in November, loading up their portfolios with stocks that would benefit from a Trump victory, The Wall Street Journal (WSJ) reported Wednesday.
The outlet identified sectors like the private prison industry and cryptocurrency as ones that would stand to benefit from a Trump win, and highlighted large rises in the stock prices for corporations within those industries as proof.
Investors like Third Point’s Dan Loeb cited Trump’s proposed tariffs as reasons to be optimistic about a Trump presidency’s impact on the stock market.
The tariffs “will increase domestic manufacturing, infrastructure spending, and prices of certain materials and commodities,” Loeb wrote in a letter to investors, the WSJ reported. “We also believe that a reduction in regulation generally and especially in the activist antitrust stance of the Biden-Harris administration will unleash productivity and a wave of corporate activity.”
Trump’s odds on betting markets have been steadily growing since the start of October. At the month’s start, election forecaster and betting hub Polymarket had Trump at a 49 percent likelihood of winning with Kamala Harris at 50 percent. By Wednesday Trump had surged to a 62 percent likelihood versus Harris’ 38 percent.
That shift in odds, WSJ reports, has made the election more of a priority for investors. (RELATED: Trump Leading Harris in Key Swing State Two Weeks Before Election Day, Poll Finds)
The Trump trajectory may have led to recent declines in the Chinese yuan and Mexican peso, Barclays’ global head of foreign-exchange and emerging-markets macro strategy Themos Fiotakis told the WSJ.
The U.S. Dollar, meanwhile, has risen sharply in concurrence with Trump’s betting odds, according to the Journal’s Dollar Index.

The Daily Caller,Left-Wing Dark Money And Unions Team Up To Enshrine Abortion In Florida’s Constitution,"As election day approaches and polls narrow, out-of-state groups are pouring tens of millions into Florida to enshrine abortion as a right in the state’s constitution.
Massive Democratic-aligned dark money networks, the Soros family, D.C.-based liberal advocacy groups and public-sector unions have rallied behind Floridians Protecting Freedom (FPF), spending millions to support the group’s effort to repeal Florida’s prohibition on abortion after fetal heartbeats are typically detected, campaign finance records show. FPF is the primary group supporting an initiative on November’s ballot to amend the state’s constitution by creating a constitutional right to terminate one’s pregnancy.
To be added to the state’s constitution, the amendment would need to attract 60% support on election day. A poll in June found that 69% of voters supported that amendment, though an October poll recently found that just 60% of voters reported supporting the abortion initiative, according to the Tallahassee Democrat. (Stream The Daily Caller’s Documentary ‘Cleaning Up Kamala’ HERE)
“Now, just barely reaching the 60% it needs to pass, it looks like the fate of abortion in Florida will come down to turnout on Election Day,” University of North Florida political science professor Michael Binder told the Tallahassee Democrat.
While FPF brands itself as “grassroots,” it has been relying on deep-pocketed out-of-state liberal organizations to shore up pro-abortion turnout ahead of election day. All told, out-of-state groups have spent well over $40 million boosting the pro-abortion amendment, dwarfing outside spending from pro-life organizations opposing it.
Sixteen Thirty Fund, for example, donated $304,300 worth of research services to FPF in July, according to campaign finance records. Arabella Advisors, a shadowy D.C.-based consulting firm, manages Sixteen Thirty Fund as part of a multi-billion dollar dark money nonprofit network. Sixteen Thirty Fund and the rest of the nonprofits under Arabella Advisors’ umbrella have spent hundreds of millions of dollars over the years pouring money into Democratic political committees, funding climate lawsuits, bankrolling left-of-center activist groups and paying for voter mobilization efforts targeted at left-leaning demographics.
In addition to conducting research for FPF, Sixteen Thirty Fund also donated $1 million to the pro-abortion campaign on May 31, records show. New Venture Fund and Hopewell Fund, two other nonprofits managed by Arabella Advisors, collectively donated about $11.8 million to FPF between Oct. 7 and Oct. 8.
The Tides Foundation, another large liberal grantmaker that has been accused of dealing in dark money, donated about $3.5 million to FPF between December 2023 and September, according to state records. Tides, which is based in San Francisco, directs its funds towards mobilizing pro-Democratic voters and pro-abortion activism, among other left-of-center initiatives.
Liberal dark money groups have supported similar abortion ballot measures in Ohio and Michigan. Many Democratic strategists see November’s abortion referendums as an opportunity to sway voters to their side in the presidential election.
“Dark money” typically refers to organizations that involve themselves in political campaigns without disclosing donors’ identities. None of the nonprofits in Arabella’s network nor the Tides Foundation publicize the identities of donors, despite the organizations being involved in electoral politics.
“Florida regularly rejects the dark money D.C. establishment, and unsurprisingly, these groups are spending tens of millions in an attempt to turn Florida into California and buy influence,” a spokesperson for the campaign opposing the abortion amendment told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “But no amount of money will convince Floridians that non-doctors should be able to perform abortions up until the moment of birth, that a child can undergo an abortion without parental consent, or that taxpayers should pay for abortions, which Amendment 4 would allow.”
Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has said that Amendment Four would legalize abortion “until the moment of birth.” The text of the amendment prohibits the state’s legislature from restricting abortion before fetal viability, which is generally considered to occur around 24 weeks and would give healthcare providers the right to perform an abortion at any point in a pregnancy if they believe doing so would “protect the patient’s health.”
At 23 weeks, an unborn child is about a foot tall and has arms and legs, according to the United Kingdom’s National Health Service.
Working hand-in-hand with Democratic dark money operations, public unions have been using dues collected from taxpayer-funded salaries to fight for a constitutional abortion guarantee in Florida, according to campaign finance records. Various branches of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), which represents public-sector workers, have pumped considerable funds into FPF from outside of Florida.
Chapters of the SEIU in New York, Connecticut, D.C., California and Washington state collectively gave over $1 million to FPF, records show. The SEIU represents both public and private sector employees.
Federal law prohibits unions from contributing membership dues directly to political campaigns, according to the Department of Labor. They can, however, contribute revenue from membership dues to political committees like FPF. Under current Supreme Court precedent, public employees cannot be compelled to join a union and pay dues as a condition of employment.
Though it is cashing massive checks from out-of-state unions and dark money behemoths, FPF is adamant that it is running a “grassroots” operation.
“We will work every day to build on the already unprecedented grassroots support this campaign has received from allied organizations, volunteers, and funders to educate voters and strengthen public support ahead of the election,” an April press release from the group reads. The term “grassroots” appears multiple times on the organization’s website, with FPF touting purported organic local support for its efforts.
The New York-based Soros family, one of the largest funders of liberal campaigns across the country, pumped $5.5 million into FPF’s self-described grassroots campaign between September 2023 and September 2024, records show. Planned Parenthood Action Fund and Reproductive Justice for All, two of the largest pro-abortion groups in the country, both of which are headquartered outside of Florida, have donated $2.5 million to FPF. Other D.C.-based activist groups have donated over $16 million to FPF this election cycle.
Florida Freedom Fund, a PAC founded by DeSantis to fight the abortion initiative, by contrast, has only raised a couple hundred thousand dollars from out of state organizations, campaign finance records show. Florida Voters Against Extremism, another group opposing the amendment, has also raised just a few hundred thousand from out-of-state groups, much of which came from Catholic organizations.
FPF did not respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

The Daily Caller,‘Unacceptable’: County Fires Election Worker After Republican Spots Ballot Security Lapse In Realtime,"Hennepin County, Minnesota, fired an election worker who left several boxes of mail-in ballots unattended after a local GOP group exposed the alleged negligence, according to a statement from county officials released Friday.
Minnesota Senate District 50 Republicans — the Republican Party’s official political unit for portions of Minnesota cities Edina and Bloomington — snapped a photo outside of Edina City Hall Friday showing a courier vehicle’s “rear door ajar with ballot transfer cases inside.” A review of parking lot surveillance footage found the ballots were not tampered with, and a comparison of the votes with the statewide voter registration system for absentee ballots found a perfect match. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: RNC Recruited Hundreds Of Thousands Of Volunteers, Thousands Of Lawyers To Ensure Election Integrity)
“Hennepin County acknowledges that this lapse in protocol occurred, should not have happened, and is unacceptable,” the county’s statement reads. “Corrective actions have been taken by the county and its courier to prevent any recurrence. The county has confirmed the driver has been terminated.”

Mail-in voting began in early September, with over 17 million Americans having already voted as of Monday. Critics of mail-in voting have raised concern regarding ballot delivery, with the National Association of State Election Directors and other officials writing a letter to the U.S. Postal Service Postmaster in September flagging potential challenges such as processing delays, lost or delayed election mail and insufficient training.
“Election security is of utmost importance, and leaving ballots unattended is simply unacceptable,” Hennepin County Auditor Daniel Rogan said in the county’s statement regarding Friday’s incident. “Hennepin County is reinforcing its transfer protocols with county staff and vendors. An incident like this underscores the value of strong chain-of-custody processes, so that risk can be addressed and integrity can be verified.”
Hennepin County and the Minnesota Senate District 50 Republicans did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The Daily Caller,ROOKE: Harris Campaign’s 11th Hour Looks Like A Nightmare,"With just eight days left in the presidential election, there are clear signs that Vice President Kamala Harris is on unsteady ground.
Democrats started whispering to their friends in the corporate press about their election-day fears that Harris could lose to former President Donald Trump.
“A growing number of top Democrats tell us privately they feel Vice President Harris will lose — even though polls show a coin-toss finish 11 days from now,” Axios reported. “Democrats admit they tend to be hand-wringing, bed-wetting, doomsdayers. But what’s striking is how our private conversations with Democrats inside and outside her campaign reveal broad concern that little she does, says — or tries — seems to move the needle.”

It’s never a good sign when Democrats (even anonymously) tell the media their candidate is going to lose and that nothing she does “seems to move the needle.” The polling shows that while the election is still close and could go either way, Trump has a shot to win not only the Electoral College vote but also the popular vote. (ROOKE: These Are The Early Results That Will Tell Us The Winner On Election Night)
The RealClear polling average has Trump up just 0.2% in the national poll, the first time he’s led since Harris first entered the race. Emerson, NY Times/Sienna and CNN all have polls showing that Harris and Trump are tied for the popular vote. Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal and Forbes polls both show that Trump wins the popular vote by two points.

A Republican presidential candidate hasn’t won the popular vote since former President George W. Bush in 2004. Trump’s support was on full display Sunday in Manhattan when voters turned out in droves, occupying block after block in dark blue New York City wearing MAGA hats and other Trump gear to hear him speak.
The media did their usual dog and pony show, attempting to connect Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally to the Nazi Party rally held there in 1930. Outside of Harris’ staunch supporters, regular voters see this rhetoric for what it is — Democrat propaganda. It’s hard to make people believe the lie that “Trump is a Nazi” when there are supporters from every race and religion in the crowd.

Jeff Bezos, the billionaire owner of Amazon and The Washington Post, blocked his outlet’s editorial team from endorsing Harris for president. Robert Kagan, a member of the opinions section who resigned in protest, told CNN Friday, “This is obviously an effort by Jeff Bezos to curry favor with Donald Trump in the anticipation of his possible victory.”
The New York Post reported this morning that Bezos attended a call with reporters upset over his decision to stay out of the race, giving them a “mandate to add more conservative voices to its opinion section.”

The Daily Caller,Soros-Funded Group Backs Maricopa DA Candidate Who Helped Murder Accomplice Evade Child Sexual Abuse Charges,"The Democrat running for Maricopa County District Attorney previously defended a man indicted of sexually assaulting a mentally disabled child by suggesting that the 12-year-old girl made the story up for attention — and has managed to snag an endorsement from Soros-backed advocacy group.
In 2009, Tamika Wooten became Jacob Payne’s criminal defense attorney after he was accused of repeatedly sexually assaulting a child, court records show. Before Wooten represented him, Payne pled guilty to kidnapping in 2004 after he admitted to restraining a 19-year-old girl as an accomplice murdered her, receiving five years in prison for his crime. Wooten, while representing Payne in 2009, said that “children with learning disabilities fabricate stories to get attention” to discredit the young girl who accused the freshly-released convict of assaulting her.
Wooten, who is running a platform of putting fewer criminals in jail by prioritizing “alternatives to incarceration,” secured the endorsement of Our Vote Our Voice Arizona on Sept. 20. The Soros family’s Open Society Action Fund in 2023 gave just over $1 million to the group, a significant sum for an organization that has had an average annual revenue of roughly $2.5 million since 2020, according to tax documents. (Stream The Daily Caller’s Documentary ‘Lawless’ HERE)
The girl who accused Payne of sexual assault claimed that he had repeatedly groped her and forced her to engage in sex acts, according to court filings. Hospital staff found blood on her underwear after one such assault — she had not been menstruating at the time, per police testimony.
Three of the girl’s siblings told the officer who arrested Payne that they had witnessed their sister come out of the room Payne was in while buttoning up her pants, according to court filings. The girl’s older brother called their mother and told her that his sister had been molested. When confronted by the girl’s mother over the phone, Payne hung up and attempted to flee the apartment.
Wooten, who moved to stop prosecutors from referring to Payne as a “predator” or “pedophile,” argued that the girl’s family members may have “coached” her into accusing him of assault because of their “dislike” for the man, court documents show. Wooten also said that the young girl’s inability to remember specific details about the assaults was evidence of her fabricating the story.
The girl had previously made a false sexual assault claim against her father, which led her mother to initially dismiss her allegation against Payne. Her mother took her daughter seriously after her siblings corroborated her claims.
The jury ultimately found Payne not guilty.
Payne was indicted of sexually abusing a child again in 2013, this time being accused of molesting a six-year-old girl, according to court records. Prosecutors ultimately dropped the charges “in the interest of justice” but explicitly noted that their decision was not made because evidence was insufficient. He pled guilty to aggravated assault in 2020 and was then convicted of disseminating nude images he took of a woman without her consent in 2023.
The Soros family has made a broad effort to reform criminal justice in the United States away from incarceration and toward rehabilitation, spending tens of millions on criminal justice nonprofits and on electing left-wing prosecutors. Many large cities where the Soros network worked to install prosecutors aligned with their views saw considerable upticks in crime.
Many of the donors backing Vice President Kamala Harris also supported Soros’ efforts to elect liberal prosecutors.
Wooten, who has promised to fight mandatory sentencing laws, is running to unseat Republican Rachel Mitchell, who has focused on cracking down on organized crime and fentanyl, the Washington Examiner reported.

The Daily Caller,ROOKE: Political Earthquake Set To Rock Harris Campaign. There’s No Time Left To Stop It,"Democrats are waking up to the nightmare that the 2024 election is not trending well for Vice President Kamala Harris.
While there are different avenues for both presidential candidates to win enough Electoral College votes to take the White House, Harris must win the three states that make up the “blue wall:” Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. These states, also known as the “Rust Belt,” flipped to Trump in 2016 but went blue in 2020 with President Joe Biden and are still Harris’ best chance of winning in 2024.
🚨Blue Wall danger: Worry grows among top Dems that Harris is stuck, even sliding a bit, after strong convention & debate

Pennsylvania will likely be crucial to Harris’ victory with its 19 Electoral College votes. Still, Harris’s path in Pennsylvania is not trending as well as it did for Biden, reportedly keeping local Democrats up at night.
“The registration gap between Republicans and Democrats has absolutely collapsed in Pennsylvania over the course of the past few years, and particularly in 2024. And a significant number of those registrations that are changing are Democrat to Republican,” Charlie Gerow, a longtime political operative in Pennsylvania, told Politico. (ROOKE: Trump’s McDonald’s Visit Tears Down Thin Veil Covering Harris Campaign’s Greatest Weakness)
“Early voting is another indication. Democrats have always dwarfed Republicans because Republicans prefer to vote in-person and most of them do. But Republicans have caught on to the fact that if you bank your vote, it’s guaranteed to be cast. And so the Republican request for mail-in ballots is way, way up this year and the Democrats’ numbers simply aren’t as good.” Gerow added.

Philadelphia City Councilmember and chair of “Black Men for Harris Pennsylvania,” Isaiah Thomas, admitted that Gerow was correct. This is problematic for Democrats as they watch Harris’ slim lead in the state collapse.
“I want to be very clear: What Charlie talked about is definitely something that’s extremely alarming and concerning. It’s a pattern that existed long before I became a member of city council,” Thomas told Politico, adding that is why the Harris Campaign has stepped up its ground game in the state.
“I think that there are warning signs around voter participation,” Thomas said.
“The concern is there. Just because I’m confident that we’re going to win doesn’t mean that I go to sleep every night without a high level of anxiety. The anxiety is there. The fear is there,” he added.

Democrats and Harris have reason to be concerned. Not only are Republicans gaining on Democrats in voter registration, but the deadline to register new voters in Pennsylvania ended Monday night.

The Daily Caller,"Steve Bannon Eligible For Home Confinement But Prison Couldn’t Process His Release In Time, Warden Says","Former Trump advisor Steve Bannon is now eligible for home confinement, but the prison was unable to process his request due to his short sentence, the warden wrote Tuesday.
Though Bannon has 10 time credits under the First Step Act that could have allowed his release from the Federal Correctional Institution in Danbury, Connecticut, to home confinement on Oct. 19, his sentence is too short to secure approval, Acting Warden Darek Puzio told Bannon’s attorneys in a letter. Bannon is set to be released when his full sentence is up on Oct. 29.
“The Regional Reentry Management Office overseeing your client’ s release area advised their Residential Reentry Centers, which monitor home confinement placements, that they will not accept placements under 30 days,” Puzio wrote.
Bannon’s attorneys asked the judge Monday to grant Bannon’s request for early release in light of the warden’s admission.
“But for that bureaucratic processing delay, Mr. Bannon presumably would have been released to home confinement two days ago,” his attorneys wrote. “There is no reason for Mr. Bannon to remain in prison despite earning those credits.”
A spokesperson for the Federal Bureau of Prisons told the Daily Caller News Foundation the bureau “does not comment on the conditions of confinement for any incarcerated individual.” (RELATED: Steve Bannon Asks To Be Released From Prison Pending Appeal)
Bannon reported to prison for his four-month sentence July 1 after the Supreme Court declined to postpone the sentence pending his appeal.
He was convicted in 2022 on contempt of Congress charges for ignoring a subpoena from the Jan. 6 committee. A federal appeals court upheld the conviction in May.
Bannon called Vice President Kamala Harris the “Queen of Mass Incarcerations” in a statement to the National Pulse on Friday, saying she is”detested by black and hispanic men who are refusing to turn out and vote for her.”
“She has done nothing to implement President Trump’s heroic First Step Act, in fact welcoming hundreds of thousands of hardened illegal migrant criminals while allowing US citizens eligible for early release to rot in prison,” he said. “No mass deportations, but continual mass incarcerations.”

Fetterman said he encountered a large Trump merchandise shop while participating in an event in Indiana County, which he described as “very, very red.” He noted the dozens of T-shirts and bumper stickers featuring images of the Republican nominee.
“It’s the kind of thing that’s taken on its own life. And it’s like something very special exists there. And that doesn’t mean that I admire it. It’s just — it’s real,” Fetterman said.
Fetterman also said billionaire Elon Musk’s joining forces with Trump moved the needle for a lot of Pennsylvania voters. (RELATED: ‘You’re Not A Kamala Person, I Know You’: Trump Makes His Case To Joe Rogan On Why He’s A Better Candidate Than Harris)

Musk endorsed Trump shortly after the former president was shot in the ear at a July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The SpaceX and Tesla founder who also purchased Twitter first appeared on stage with Trump when he returned to Butler for an Oct. 5 rally.
Musk has since become a vocal campaign surrogate for Trump, holding multiple events in Pennsylvania in October. He also launched the America PAC which targets seven battleground states by encouraging residents to register to vote and to follow through by casting their ballots.

“So when you have a politician who is in an interview or in a conversation and they’re being disciplined, as she says, and getting their message across and telling us what their policies are and, you know, detailing their policies, it’s kind of like, ‘We want to be entertained,’ right? And that’s not what I think we need from our politicians,” he added. “So, to say, do I think she was being authentic? Yeah, I think she was being authentically who she is, which is a very disciplined, seasoned veteran politician.”
Voters have criticized Harris for how she answers questions on the campaign trail, with Couric echoing some of their sentiments in response to Charlamagne.
“I have to beg to differ with you on that point. I think that she takes a really long time to get to her point, and that she does rely on talking points too often. I think she’s gotten much better than she used to, but it’s almost as if she’s afraid to say something that will later come back to haunt her,” the journalist said. “And I find the fact that she just doesn’t really articulate to me her true policy position and that she isn’t really directly answering the questions a lot of times.”
“That’s been my experience and my experience watching her. I just wish she would say, ‘This is our plan,’ or, ‘You’re right, a lot of illegal immigrants have come into this country during the Biden administration, but this is why, and this is what I want to do about it moving forward.’ You know?” she continued. “I don’t find her explanation of policy that compelling compared to, say, someone like [former President] Bill Clinton or [former President] Barack Obama.”
Charlamagne acknowledged he “can understand” Couric’s views on the vice president.
Journalist Mark Halperin said recently that Harris’ “lack of decisiveness” remains her primary weakness.
That, to me, is her Achilles’ heel; that is the thing that bedevils her,” Halperin said. “Because public speaking — she’s not a stupid person — public speaking on tough questions, even if they’re not asked in a tough way, involves on-your-feet, making decisions about what to say. And you don’t want to annoy anybody or anger anybody or commit a political error.”

The Daily Caller,ROOKE: Media Hit On Trump Accidentally Confirms Harris Has Major Election Problem Brewing,"The Atlantic published a report Tuesday on former President Donald Trump that was supposed to make Americans believe he is a racist bigot and literally Adolf Hitler. But hidden inside the obvious hit piece was the truth about a critical demographic Vice President Kamala Harris is clearly worried about.
When a fellow soldier and his girlfriend murdered U.S. Army Private Vanessa Guillén in April 2020, Trump brought her family to the White House to pay respects and promised to help them with the burial.
“I saw what happened to your daughter Vanessa, who was a spectacular person, and respected and loved by everybody, including in the military,” Trump told Guillén’s mother, later adding, “If I can help you out with the funeral, I’ll help — I’ll help you with that,” he said. “I’ll help you out. Financially, I’ll help you.”
JUST IN: The sister of Vanessa Guillén absolutely rips The Atlantic after they released a hit piece on Trump about her sister’s de*th.
Mayra Guillen says she is voting for Trump after unleashing on the outlet for politicizing Vanessa’s de*th.
The Atlantic tried claiming Trump… pic.twitter.com/VEoMa55QO9
— Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) October 22, 2024
Over four years later, The Atlantic is now trying to turn Trump’s generosity into a hit piece by claiming that anonymous sources and one disgruntled ex-staff member informed them that Trump told his staff privately that he wouldn’t pay for Guillén’s funeral bill. The outlet even went as far as claiming that Trump said: “It doesn’t cost 60,000 bucks to bury a f*cking Mexican!” (ROOKE: Trump’s McDonald’s Visit Tears Down Thin Veil Covering Harris Campaign’s Greatest Weakness)
It was the last line that stood out the most. Not only have multiple people in the room and Guillén’s family denied the entire contents of the so-called report, but it seems to point to an issue Harris is having with a particular demographic that has recently shifted from Democrat to Republican — Hispanic voters.
Wow.
I don’t appreciate how you are exploiting my sister’s death for politics- hurtful & disrespectful to the important changes she made for service members. President Donald Trump did nothing but show respect to my family & Vanessa. In fact, I voted for President Trump today. https://t.co/o8cDrKOKBV— Mayra Guillen (@mguilen_) October 22, 2024
Why else would The Atlantic, a leftist rag owned by Harris’ BFF, Laurene Powell Jobs, publish such a thin story based on nameless accusers with the backdrop being that Trump hates Hispanics? They could have accomplished the same goal with just about any storyline during the Trump administration. Still, they chose the death of a Hispanic immigrant solider to drive home their point, which seems to be that Trump apparently hates Hispanics.
There are over 36 million Hispanics in the U.S. with the right to vote, representing nearly 15 percent of eligible voters, according to the Americas Society/Council of the Americas (AS/COA). President Joe Biden carried the majority of Hispanic voters in 2020, despite Trump seeing an increase among their demographic at the ballot box compared to 2016.

In the latest New York Times/Sienna Poll of registered Hispanic voters, Harris is well below the 66% Biden won in 2020. Just 56% of Hispanics told the poll they were voting for Harris, while 37% said they were voting for Trump. Considering that Biden won in 2020 due to a coalition of Hispanic, Black and Asian voters, Harris being so far behind Biden’s numbers is likely worrying her and other Democrats. The last Democrat presidential candidate to fall below 60% was John Kerry. (ROOKE: In Fewer Than 10 Words, Brian Stelter Lays Bare Democrats’ White Liberal Ignorance Problem)

Harris is losing critical demographics, like Hispanics and blue-collar workers, that Democrats have counted on in past elections, with only 13 days until Nov. 5. The desperation is evident with the hit piece attempting to portray Trump as a Hilter-esque bigot who hates Hispanics. The Atlantic’s ties to Democrats and Harris only further confirm the suspicion that they need as many Hispanics as possible to break from Trump’s camp and vote for Harris.

The Daily Caller,"Tens Of Millions In Foreign Funds Could Be Flowing Into 2024 Election To Help Dems, Report Reveals","A Democratic-aligned dark money group that receives significant backing from a foreign billionaire is dumping tens of millions of dollars into influencing ballot initiatives ahead of November’s election, according to a new report.
The Sixteen Thirty Fund received $143 million in backing from the Berger Action Fund, a nonprofit bankrolled by Swiss billionaire Hansjorg Wyss, between 2019 and 2022. This election cycle, the Sixteen Thirty Fund has spent nearly $23 million on ballot initiatives in a number of swing states on issues like abortion, minimum wage policy and election reform, according to a report from watchdog group Americans for Public Trust (APT).
“It’s unconscionable that foreign money is currently influencing our politics through a loophole most mainstream media and politicians are either ignoring or don’t know about,” APT executive director Caitlin Sutherland told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Activists like the ones running Sixteen Thirty Fund are targeting competitive states — not just to usher in left-wing legislative changes via these ballot measures, but also to give a boost to the liberals at the top of the ticket, which folks have openly admitted that’s their goal.”
“Americans for Public Trust — a right-wing group tied to Leonard Leo — published this report because they resent our successful efforts to guarantee freedoms for all Americans, work Leo fundamentally opposes,” a Sixteen Thirty Fund spokesperson told the DCNF. “Sixteen Thirty Fund proudly supports local groups organizing around ballot initiatives that expand fundamental rights like access to abortion, the ballot box and livable wages. Every contribution we receive is used in strict compliance with all guidelines, regulations and laws.”
Some Democratic strategists view ballot abortion referendums, which the Sixteen Thirty Fund has spent considerable funds supporting, as a way to sway people toward their party’s candidates. The Sixteen Thirty Fund has pumped millions into ballot initiative campaigns in Arizona, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada and Ohio, all of which have competitive presidential or senatorial races — both in some cases.
Federal law doesn’t currently prohibit foreign dollars from funding ballot measure campaigns, according to APT. Foreigners, however, are barred from donating directly to candidates and political action committees.
The Sixteen Thirty Fund has spent a total of $115 million on state ballot issues since 2014, with Wyss donating at least $243 million to the group since its inception, per APT’s analysis of campaign finance and nonprofit records.
“State legislatures and the U.S. Congress should act to close this foreign influence loophole,” the report’s conclusion reads. “Foreign nationals are already prohibited from donating to U.S. political candidates, committees and Super PACs, and the same prohibition should apply to state ballot issue campaigns … American policy debates should be for American citizens.”
When reached by the DCNF in February, a spokesperson for the Berger Action Fund would not comment on whether or not Wyss’ money supported political activities but stressed that it “complies with laws and rules governing its activities and prohibits its grants from being used to support or oppose political candidates or parties, or otherwise engage in electoral activities.”
Berger Action Fund did not immediately respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

The Daily Caller,EXCLUSIVE: GOP Lawmakers Urge Biden Admin To Investigate Dem Rep With Deep China Ties,"Republican lawmakers called on the Biden administration to launch an investigation into a Chinese civic association linked to a New York Democratic congresswoman on Wednesday, according to a letter exclusively obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation.
Reps. Jim Banks of Indiana, Carlos Gimenez of Florida, Robert Wittman of Virginia and Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik of New York urged Secretary of State Antony Blinken to designate the New York-based Henan Association Of Eastern America (HAEA) as a “foreign mission,” citing “its recently reported leading role in Chinese Communist Party (CCP)-led influence operations against American officials,” according to the letter. The lawmakers also asked Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate HAEA’s current and former leaders, including New York Democratic Rep. Grace Meng, who was listed as the group’s “deputy chairwoman” before she launched her congressional campaign in 2012.
“A future Democrat Congresswoman opened the door to the CCP with the help of the United Front, the CCP’s overseas influence operations,” Banks, a member of the House Select Committee on the CCP, told the DCNF. “Groups like the Henan Association can’t be allowed to wage political warfare against the U.S. on our soil any longer.” (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Dem Congresswoman Was A Fixture At Events Honoring Chinese Communist Party Officials)
“The State Department must designate the Henan Association as a foreign mission,” the letter reads. “Under the Foreign Missions Act, an organization should be designated by the State Department as a ‘foreign mission’ if the entity is involved in the activities of a foreign government or is ‘substantially owned or effectively controlled’ by a foreign government.”
Federal prosecutors recently indicted Meng’s former congressional campaign director, Linda Sun, and her husband, Chris Hu, for allegedly acting as unregistered agents of China while Sun worked for New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The Wall Street Journal subsequently reported Sun had met the “heads of key groups identifiable in the indictment as being United Front-linked,” naming HAEA and another New York Chinese association.
The so-called “United Front” strategy is a “unique blend of engagement, influence activities, and intelligence operations that the CCP uses to shape its political environment, including to influence other countries’ policy toward the PRC and to gain access to advanced foreign technology,” according to a 2023 report from the House Select Committee on the CCP.
United Front work is conducted “by an extensive and well-documented network of organizations operating in parallel to the People’s Republic of China’s (PRC) foreign ministry and intelligence services that seeks to influence universities, think tanks, civic groups, other prominent individuals and institutions, and public opinion broadly,” that House committee’s report states.
“Sun allegedly used the Henan Association as her intermediary in conducting official business with, and receiving direction from, PRC officials,” the lawmakers stated in their letter. “A Henan leader is named as one of the unindicted co-conspirators in Sun’s agent activities.”
The WSJ previously identified HAEA’s president, Zhang Fuyin, as one of Sun’s two alleged co-conspirators. Meng’s longtime congressional staffer Sydney Li, who is HAEA’s deputy chairman, has also interacted with CCP official and Chinese intelligence personnel, the WSJ reported.
The WSJ reported that during a 2019 China trip, Li hand-delivered a letter from Meng to a CCP intel official alongside Zhang, and the DCNF identified four more instances in which Li gave letters on behalf of Meng to either CCP intel or Propaganda Department personnel.
The lawmakers’ letter also asked the State Department to “review all hometown associations similarly tied to United Front activities for potential designation as foreign missions.”
“Outposts of our Chinese enemy should not be allowed in our country, but if they must be here we must require them to register,” Gordon Chang, China expert and author, told the DCNF.
The letter sent Wednesday also presses the DOJ to “investigate all current and former leaders and associates of the Henan Association for potential FARA violations and prosecute any offenders accordingly.”The Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) “requires certain agents of foreign principals who are engaged in political activities or other activities specified under the statute to make periodic public disclosure of their relationship with the foreign principal, as well as activities, receipts and disbursements in support of those activities,” according to the DOJ.
Between 2008 and 2012, HAEA identified Meng as its “deputy chairwoman,” but began listing her as “honorary chairwoman” in February 2012, the month before she launched her congressional campaign, the DCNF reported. Meng’s photo was prominently displayed at the top of HAEA’s homepage for over a decade beside the organization’s chairman and president until the entire website was deleted on Sept. 26, following DCNF reports on her years-long involvement with the group.
The WSJ recently reported Meng denied ever having held any official position with HAEA, claiming she only held an “honorary title,” despite a 2008 video in which she introduced herself as HAEA’s “deputy chairwoman.”

Meng has participated in more than a dozen events alongside HAEA leaders welcoming various CCP delegations to New York, during which she’s toasted CCP intel personnel, awarded congressional commendations to Communist Party leaders and received several gifts, the DCNF reported, with perhaps the most recent instance occurring in March 2024.
These interactions extend back at least as far as 2008, the DCNF found, and include Meng’s participation in a December 2008 welcome banquet in Queens, New York for the chairman of the All-China Federation Of Returned Overseas Chinese (ACFROC), who Meng referred to as “our chairman” and praised for his “leadership,” footage shows.
The DOJ has characterized ACFROC as an “agency” of a Chinese intelligence service called the United Front Work Department (UFWD).

The DOJ also alleges that ACFROC hired Meng’s former campaign director, Sun, as its “committee member” in September 2019.
Multiple HAEA leaders, including its president, Zhang, as well as the organization’s chairman are ACFROC members, the DCNF discovered.
“The Biden-Harris DOJ must force foreign influence groups to register to FARA, and groups like the Henan Association should be classified as foreign missions of China,” Banks told the DCNF.
Meng and HAEA did not respond to the DCNF’s request for comment.

The Daily Caller,‘She’s Not Ahead’: Mark Halperin Says Dems ‘Scratching Their Heads’ Over Harris ‘Spending The Day In Washington’,"Newsmax political analyst Mark Halperin said Tuesday that Democrats are questioning Vice President Kamala Harris’ decision to stay in Washington, D.C., instead of campaigning in swing states.
Harris will be in Washington, D.C., to conduct interviews with Telemundo and NBC News, which are scheduled to air Tuesday evening, according to Reuters. Halperin, on “Wake Up America,” argued that with Harris trailing former President Donald Trump, the move raises concerns about her campaign strategy. (RELATED: Kamala Harris Used To Think Border Wall Was ‘Un-American.’ Now She Supports It.)
WATCH:
“Look, if she loses, there’ll be a lot of second-guessing of all sorts of decisions they made. And one of them will be what has been a light schedule. If she thinks she’s ahead — her campaign doesn’t think she’s ahead — but if they thought she was ahead, you could say she’s running out the clock, but she’s not ahead,” Halperin said. “And so it’s a choice they’re making. I think a lot of it has to do with the amount of preparation time she wants and requires for the interview she’s doing today, for the town hall she has coming up, but there is head-scratching amongst Democrats, two weeks to go, someone who’s fighting for the presidency, and she’s spending the day in Washington.”
“Again, a lot of Democrats also scratching their heads. You’d think it just, you know, jump on the Amtrak and go up to Philadelphia and do something. But the reality is, as Donald Trump proves when he does, you know, national events outside of the battleground states, that NBC News interview will get coverage everywhere,” he added. “And maybe she feels like that’s going to fill in the news cycle. But, like I said, if she loses, people are going to go over her schedule and wonder why she took so many days in Washington.”
Democrats, including some of Harris’ own staffers, recently raised concerns to Politico that the vice president’s light campaign schedule could damage the campaign in its final stretch. Trump is currently leading Harris in all of the top seven swing states, according to RealClearPolling averages.
Harris told “The View” on Oct. 8 that nothing “comes to mind” when asked how she would govern differently from President Biden, an answer Halperin said damaged her campaign.
“That one answer, I think probably, on balance, net did more harm for her than any good that’s come out of these interviews,” he asserted.

The Daily Caller,EXCLUSIVE: ‘A Planned Terror Attack’: House Republicans Target DHS For Accommodating Lebanese Nationals,"Republican Texas Rep. Brian Babin and a group of House Republicans sent a letter Tuesday to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), slamming them over a recent announcement that Lebanese nationals inside the U.S. will now be eligible for Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and work authorization due to war in the Middle East.
The Daily Caller first obtained a copy of the letter, in which Babin and eleven other House Republicans condemn the Biden-Harris administration for their announcement of new actions to provide an immigration “reprieve” to Lebanese nationals and individuals having no nationality who last resided in Lebanon.
“While Israel is suffering weekly rocket bombardments from terrorists in Lebanon, the Biden-Harris administration has not only foolishly decided to hamstring our ability to deport Lebanese aliens, including those here illegally, but also offer them immigration benefits and work authorization. Just weeks ago, an ISIS terrorist – who this administration failed to properly vet and welcomed into our country with open arms – was caught planning an Election Day attack,” Babin told the Daily Caller.

“In 2020, I was elected at 18 to become one of the youngest delegates to the Democratic National Convention on behalf of my district. And in 2024, I was elected again to return to the DNC as a delegate,” McNeal said. “But this year, I’m casting my ballot for Donald Trump.”

McNeal said she was elected in March and wanted to go to the DNC to seek answers on free speech, the border and the economy. The former DNC delegate explained that she became disillusioned after attending the DNC.
“After reflecting on my time at the DNC, I realized it was no longer the party of free speech and civil liberties that it used to be,” McNeal said.
“In fact, Patrick Henry once said that the liberties of a people never were, nor ever will be secure when the transactions of their rulers may be concealed from them,” she added. (RELATED: ‘You’re Not A Kamala Person, I Know You’: Trump Makes His Case To Joe Rogan For Why He’s The Better Candidate)
President Joe Biden endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris immediately after dropping his reelection bid July 21. Despite prominent Democrats like former President Barack Obama initially suggesting an open primary system be used to determine the party’s replacement candidate, Democratic leaders eventually decided to skip the democratic process and place Harris at the top of their 2024 ticket.
“For the rulers of the Democratic Party elite to install Kamala Harris as the presidential nominee via stripping the vote of 14 million Americans, including their own delegates such as myself, well that was a decision in a transaction that was concealed,” McNeal said.
“And now I’m happy to say that in officially joining the Republican Party as a constitutional conservative,” the former DNC delegate announced.
Before she denounced the Democratic Party, McNeal told GPB in August that it was “empowering” to be among other young delegates at the DNC.

“We all have a common experience coming to the DNC, being really young, having very passionate dreams that we want to see and kind of just being there for each other when it comes to, like, supporting each other’s campaigns or going to caucus events together,” the former DNC delegate said at the time.

The Daily Caller,‘It Doesn’t Affect Me’: Trump Reveals Who Wasn’t ‘Thrilled’ About His Team Up With RFK Jr.,"Former President Donald Trump told podcaster Joe Rogan that pharmaceutical executives were not “thrilled” that he teamed up with former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. during a Friday interview.
Kennedy endorsed Trump and announced the suspension of his campaign on Aug. 23, ten months after launching his independent bid, following his split with Democrats over issues including censorship, the war in Ukraine, illegal immigration, the party’s failure to hold primary debates and primary rules that gave President Joe Biden an advantage. When Rogan asked if anyone had urged Trump not to work with Kennedy, the former president revealed some pushback from pharmaceutical company executives. (RELATED: ‘Why Not?’: Trump Tells Rogan He’ll Use Tariffs To Eliminate Income Tax, Make America ‘Rich’)
WATCH:
“I would say that — and you know, I think in many ways they’ve done a good job and in many ways they’ve done a bad job — but I would say that Big Pharma wasn’t thrilled when they heard that,” Trump said, adding, “I’ve actually always gotten along very well with him [Kennedy], I’ve known him a long time.”
The social media platform Instagram banned Kennedy over his views on vaccines in February 2021, and ABC News edited out a portion of an interview where he discussed the COVID-19 vaccines. Kennedy said Trump would “make America healthy again” during an August interview with Fox News host Shannon Bream.
“He’s a different kind of a guy,” Trump said of Kennedy. “He’s very smart, great guy, and he’s very sincere about this. I mean, he really is. He thinks— we spend a fortune on pesticides, on all this stuff, and then you end up— that chart is a terrible chart, the one previous. It’s such a bad chart when you look at where we are compared to other countries that don’t spend ten cents.”
The chart showed life expectancy compared to health expenditure per capita for a number of countries, including the United States, which fell largely behind other nations despite spending more on health care and services per capita.
“I’ve had some people who aren’t exactly thrilled,” Trump said, regarding Kennedy’s involvement with his campaign. “It doesn’t affect me,” Trump said about the criticism.

The Daily Caller,‘Harassed And Sued’: Turley Slams Biden-Harris Admin After Court Blocks State’s Effort To Clean Voter Rolls,"George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley criticized the Department of Justice Friday after a federal judge ordered Virginia to reinstate hundreds of non-citizens to the voter rolls.
A federal judge ordered Virginia to halt its effort to remove non-citizens Friday, granting an injunction requested by the Justice Department in a suit filed Oct. 12. Turley said the DOJ had previously approved the law’s use in the past under Democratic governors. (RELATED: ‘This Is Ridiculous’: Leo Terrell Rips DOJ For Going After State That Removed Non-Citizens From Voter Roll)
“The Biden Administration argued that some or many of these were citizens who simply had bureaucratic problems or errors when they were at the DMV filling out forms. But the problem is that Virginia is a little different from Alabama,” Turley told “America’s Newsroom” co-hosts Bill Hemmer and Dana Perino. “As Gov. [Glenn] Youngkin pointed out, this was approved by the Department of Justice years ago under then-Gov. [Tim] Kaine, who ironically is on the ballot this election. And they say this has been used within the 90 days before an election, which is that critical so-called quiet period. And so the state is saying look, this is a rather odd timing of the events. Department of Justice green-lights this law, no objection in past years used by Democrats allegedly even during this period and suddenly when we use it, when we remove non-citizens, it becomes a problem.”
WATCH:
“Virginia was saying that these are basically actions that have been taken on the books for years,” Turley said. “When the DMV kicks back information to us saying that someone has identified themselves correctly or incorrectly as a non-citizen, that person then has 15 days to correct that and even if they don’t correct that, they can file provisional ballots so that their vote will count as they continue that effort. But this federal judge is saying no, just put them back on the voting rolls.”
Youngkin criticized the court’s ruling in a statement released Friday, telling Fox News host Harris Faulkner the state would appeal.
“What the governor is saying is look, this is information supplied by the voter. It’s an automatic system. Keep in mind, Virginia doesn’t know who these people are gonna vote for. It’s not like there’s an effort to target one group,” Turley said. “This is an automated system that kicks over and says there is an anomaly here, a conflict, this person has identified themselves as a non-citizen. Many may have done it incorrectly or there might be an error and why they have these belts and suspenders, but part of the problem the states have here is that they feel like they’ve been harassed and sued by the Biden Administration at every turn over voter ID and other laws.” (Watch The Daily Caller Documentary “Rigged”)
“A new poll just came out that showed that over 80% of American citizens support voter ID and citizenship proof for voting. Over 80%,” Turney continued. “I mean, how many issues in today’s politics can you name where there is over 80% of agreement?”

We could spend all day, the three of us, trying to get a Democrat on the phone who was super confident, like, ‘We’re going to win.’ We wouldn’t succeed in terms of political professionals, members of Congress, strategists,” Halperin said.” It would take us one call, random dial any Republican in our rolodex, to find someone who said, ‘Yeah, I’m pretty confident we’re going to win.’ Or more.”
“Okay, that’s an asymmetry. It’s just a reality. Some attribute it to cultural differences between the party and there’s something to that,” he continued. “There’s qualitative and quantitative data everywhere you look that things have moved in Trump’s direction and that it will be difficult for her to win, but not impossible. And that is causing a lot of tension in blue America.”
Halperin then pointed to The New York Times/Siena College’s last national poll of the 2024 election cycle, which the outlet published on Friday and found Trump and Harris tied at 48%. The previous NYT/Siena poll published on Oct. 8 found Harris leading Trump 49% to 46% nationally.
“The conventional wisdom has been, even though it may be false, that if Donald Trump is tied or within a couple points in the national poll, he’s going to win. Now The New York Times says it’s possible that Kamala Harris could win the electoral college and lose the popular vote,” Halperin said. “And we’ve talked about Trump over-performing from last time in the big blue states that could make him a bigger popular vote winner, but still lose the electoral college. Possible.”
The poll also found Trump drawing 42% of Hispanic voters and 11% of black voters. Halperin read from an X post from CNN senior political analyst Ron Brownstein reacting to the poll, which states it “shows Harris basically matching [President Joe] Biden winning 2020” percentages among whites, but “slipping” among minorities, particularly Latinos.
The analyst asserted this data “explains why less diverse Rustbelt states remain the most plausible path for her, as they were for Biden.”
The journalist also read from an X post from pollster and former Bill Clinton adviser Mark Penn, which states, “[The Wall Street Journal] and Forbes polls all show 3 to 4 point movements in the direction of Trump in the last few weeks. This is real movement and momentum going into the close. It is still close but this is a substantial move.”
Halperin also asserted Tuesday that Trump will be elected president on Nov. 5 if the current early voting trajectory “continues.”

The Daily Caller,Democrat PAC Publishes Internal Trump Campaign Emails Leaked By Iranian Hacking Group,"A Democratic Political Action Committee (PAC) published internal Trump campaign emails after an Iranian hacking group reportedly leaked them, Reuters reported on Friday.
The hackers recently started trying to pass off the emails to various media outlets, who were uninterested in publishing the material, according to Reuters. But the hackers finally found one willing individual in recent weeks: Democrat political operative David Wheeler, who posted the emails to the website of his PAC, American Muckrakers. (RELATED: UK Socialist Leader Insists He’s Still Good Friends With Trump After Party Staffers Plan Trip To Help Harris)
When asked why he published the material, Wheeler told Reuters he wanted to “expose how desperate the Trump campaign is to try to win.” He would not discuss how the material originated Some of the emails include correspondence between campaign operatives leading up to the election.

— Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) September 19, 2024
The Department of Justice (DOJ) charged the supposed Iranian hackers — a group known as Mint Sandstorm —in September for working on behalf of the Islamic regime and using fake identities. The DOJ said the group was made up of three operatives who collectively go by the name “Robert.”
“Robert” was also responsible for leaking intel Trump campaign research documents about Vice Presidential candidate J.D. Vance.
Reuters reached out to “Robert” asking about the DOJ’s allegations. In response, “Robert” asked Reuters, “Do you really expect me to answer?!”
Iran has been involved in various election interference schemes, ranging from cyber warfare attacks to assassination attempts against Trump. Iran has a particular disdain for Trump because he authorized the killing of former top Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in 2020.
There have been two near-successful attempts on Trump’s life in recent months, although the individuals involved in those incidents were not tied to Iran.
Iran has denied that it’s involved in any sort of election interference, with the country’s mission to the United Nations (UN) telling Reuters that such claims were “fundamentally unfounded, and wholly inadmissible.”
For its part, the Trump campaign did not ever specifically comment on the leaked Vance research documents but said in early October that Iran’s cyberwarfare operations were “intended to interfere with the 2024 election and sow chaos throughout our democratic process.”
American Muckrakers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Daily Caller,‘Daddy Was A Member Of Hezbollah’: Dem Senator Claps Back At NYT Reporter Over Question On Israel’s War Against Terror,"Democratic Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman clapped back at New York Times (NYT) reporter Lulu Garcia-Navarro over a question on Israel’s war against terror in an interview released Saturday.
Garcia-Navarro poked at Fetterman’s unwavering support for Israel following the deadly Oct. 7, 2023 attack by Islamic terror group Hamas with a slew of questions. The Democratic senator remained consistent when pressed about Israel’s exploding pager attack of mid-September which targeted Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon.
Fetterman told the NYT reporter he “absolutely” does support Israel’s pager attack despite the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh chapters of the Council on American Islamic Relations condemning him in a joint statement issued in late September. (RELATED: Democratic Senator Marvels That Trump Support In Key Battleground State Is ‘Astonishing’)
“They said, ‘When our elected officials start condoning the civilian loss of life, our collective moral compass is irreparably harmed,’” Garcia-Navarro said.
“It was targeted for members of Hezbollah. You know, no one uses beepers in that situation other than they were a member of Hezbollah,” Fetterman countered.
“There was a young child who was killed,” the NYT reporter said.
“Unfortunately, tragically, because daddy was a member of Hezbollah,” Fetterman responded. “He brought that danger and evil into their home. And that’s what tragically resulted in that poor child’s death.”
“That’s what’s so terrible. She paid the price because her father was a terrorist for Hezbollah,” he added.
Garcia-Navarro asked Fetterman earlier if he thinks Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is working to help elect Trump, which the Democratic senator said he does not believe.
“I don’t believe that. I don’t. And if you think that might be, I don’t know why it’s helpful to say that publicly,” Fetterman said. “I have to believe all of those college protesting and a lot of those other things, they would give Hamas opportunity to rejoice a lot of this division. But now there’s not much left of them anymore to celebrate.”",2024-10-27
The Daily Caller,Harris Calls Rare Presser To Peddle Newest Contested John Kelly Attack On Trump,"Vice President Kamala Harris gave an unexpected address from her residence Wednesday to respond to former White House chief of staff John Kelly’s claims about how Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump would govern if reelected.
The New York Times and The Atlantic both published stories Tuesday detailing interviews with Kelly, who claimed that the former president said Hitler “did some good things,” wanted generals like the Nazi dictator had and would rule like a fascist. The Trump campaign denied the content of both stories.
Spokesperson Steven Chueng said the comments were “debunked stories,” adding that the former chief of staff “beclowned” himself. Harris waded into the dispute Wednesday, saying that Kelly’s statements made it clear the former president was “unhinged and unstable.”
“All of this is further evidence for the American people of who Donald Trump really is,” Harris said. “This is a window into who Donald Trump really is, from the people who know him best. From the people who worked with him side by side, in the Oval Office and in the Situation Room.
“It is clear from John Kelly’s words that Donald Trump is someone who, I quote, ‘certainly falls into the general definition of fascist.’ Who vowed to be a dictator on day one and vowed to use the military as his personal militia to carry out his personal and political vendettas,” she continued. (RELATED: CNN Guest Calls Out Selectively Edited Clip Of Trump Straight To Hosts Faces)
The Atlantic’s story containing Kelly’s comments also alleged that the former president disparaged a deceased veteran and her family. In addition to the Trump campaign, former officials, the deceased veteran’s family and their lawyer have all gone on the record to deny the story. (RELATED: The Atlantic’s October Surprise On Trump Implodes After Denials Galore From Everyone Involved)
“After having dealt with hundreds of reporters in my legal career, this is unfortunately the first time I have to go on record and call out Jeffrey Goldberg@the Atlantic: not only did he misrepresent our conversation but he outright LIED in HIS sensational story,” the family’s lawyer, Natalie Khawam, tweeted.

Vice President Harris is a fraud. I was in the White House at a senior level much longer than General Kelly. He is complicit in this fraud and has lied to the American people. His lies, as well as John Bolton’s, are a disservice to Nation at this critical time. So are the VP’s. https://t.co/2b77pMsVVl
— Keith Kellogg (@generalkellogg) October 23, 2024
Jeffrey Goldberg, the Editor-In-Chief of the Atlantic who wrote the Tuesday article, similarly published a story in September 2020 claiming that Trump canceled a 2018 visit to a French cemetery where American troops were buried and had called them “suckers” and “losers.” The credibility of the story, which is based on anonymous sources, has also come under fire. Former national security adviser John Bolton has denied Trump ever said the words, instead stating Trump didn’t make the trip for weather and security reasons.
Harris’ schedule was adjusted just an hour before her unexpected press conference to include that she would be giving remarks at her residence. The vice president spoke for just about three minutes and did not take any questions. Similar to Harris’ message Wednesday, Biden’s campaign message circled around calling Trump a threat to democracy. Before the president dropped out of the presidential race, senior Democrats alongside some of Biden’s aides were doubting the slogan, Axios reported.
Less than two weeks until the election, the vice president is trailing Trump in all seven top battleground states, according to the RealClear Polling averages.
“Donald Trump is increasingly unhinged and unstable, and in a second term, people like John Kelly would not be there to be the guard rails against his propensities and his actions,” Harris said.",2024-10-23
The Daily Caller,REPORT: Washington Resident Says She Received 16 Ballots With Different Names,"A woman from the state of Washington claims she received 16 ballots addressed to her apartment, each of them listing a different name.
Jami Visaya said the first stack of ballots arrived Friday, KING 5, a local NBC affiliate, reported Tuesday. She moved into the Bellevue apartment Oct. 3, she told the outlet.
“There were about nine voter registration ballots that were not mine,” Visaya told the outlet. “They were addressed to other people, and so I thought that was strange, so I ended up returning them to the post office here.” (RELATED: Mail-In Voting Begins As First State Sends Out Ballots Weeks From Election Day)
Visaya said she returned the ballots to a United States Postal Service (USPS) employee.
She also said she discovered seven new ballots in her mailbox a few days later, also addressed to her apartment and to names she didn’t recognize.
“It’s all names of, like, Indian descent and possibly Middle Eastern,” Visaya said.
Washington is a vote-by-mail state and all registered voters receive a ballot, according to the Washington secretary of state.
Many of the ballots were addressed to different surnames, Visaya claimed.
“Management said no one’s lived here for three months,” she told the outlet, referring to her apartment unit. (Stream the Daily Caller’s documentary Rigged HERE)
“Even if someone gets a second ballot (or more), whether under their name or someone else’s, we’ll only ever count one ballot per registered voter with their matching signature,” LeVan Hudson, the chief of staff at the King County Elections Office, told the outlet.

The Daily Caller,‘An Absolute Wimping Out’: Fox News Guest Roasts WaPo Decision To Sit Out Election,"Fox News media analyst Howard Kurtz said Friday that the Washington Post was a “profile in non-courage” when it elected not to endorse in the 2024 presidential election.
The Post’s decision, which it announced Friday, followed a similar move by the Los Angeles Times, which said it would make no endorsement Tuesday. Kurtz noted that the non-endorsements, which were ordered by the owners of the newspapers, resulted in a “backlash.” (RELATED: ‘A Case For Panic’: ‘Morning Joe’ Guest Says Kamala Harris Has ‘Good Reason To Worry’ About Election)
WATCH:
“Look, this is a profile in non-courage, an absolute wimping out. Now Jeff Bezos does have the right to do this, but at the same time, the other 364 days a year, the liberal Washington Post tells us what to think about everything, every issue under the sun, and all of a sudden comes onto the most important question like, ‘Oh, we couldn’t possibly give you our opinion now,’” Kurtz, a former Washington Post employee, told Fox News host Martha MacCallum.
“And so I think Jeff Bezos, by the way, does a lot of business with the federal government through his rocket company, through Amazon, and he may fear that Trump is going to win, and he doesn’t want to exacerbate their already testy relationship,” Kurtz said.
MacCallum noted that not only had the Post and Times stayed neutral, but she also noted the non-endorsement decisions from the Teamsters and the International Association of Fire Fighters earlier in the campaign.
“In both cases, L.A. Times and Washington Post, there were editorials drafted favoring Kamala Harris, and the billionaire owner of the L.A. Times not only killed it, but three top editors have now resigned in protest when people have canceled their subscriptions, so the idea that, oh, we don’t want to be divisive and this is up to our readers to make up their minds, sure most newspaper editorials don’t matter much anymore, but it is interesting that they are pulling back on this, the most important decision of the year, after they’ve lectured us all on every issue,” Kurtz said.
“They’ve been anti-Trump mostly, more recently largely pro-Kamala Harris, and yet both of the owners are saying, I run the place, and you’re not running that Harris endorsement,’” he continued. (Watch The Daily Caller Documentary “Cleaning Up Kamala”)

The Daily Caller,PETERSON: Ignore The Democrat And Media Outrage. Trump Has Done More For Puerto Rico Than Any Other President,"In the autumn of 2020, I was appointed by former President Donald J. Trump to the Financial Oversight and Management Board (FOMB) for Puerto Rico. Congress created this board in 2016 to facilitate the restructuring of the island’s mountain of debt and to institute desperately-needed financial controls and reforms. Despite having accumulated more than a decade of professional experience working in Puerto Rico prior to my appointment, during my three-year term on the Board I learned so much more about this important part of America. Here’s what I can personally attest to: No President has done more for Puerto Rico than President Trump.
Following the devastation of hurricane Maria, which struck the island in 2019, the Trump Administration swung into action. Its response was swift, historic and unrelenting — continuing until literally days before President Trump left the White House in January of 2021. Under his leadership, thousands of federal employees were deployed to the island to assist with recovery efforts, which included the longest sustained air mission of food and water delivery and largest sea bridge operation to that point in FEMA’s history. In the immediate aftermath of the disaster, President Trump authorized billions for Puerto Rico’s rebuilding and recovery. The specifics included:
- $9.6 billion to repair and rebuild Puerto Rico’s electrical grid.
- $2 billion to the Puerto Rico Department of Education for the restoration of school buildings and facilities.
- 100 percent funding of Puerto Rico’s emergency work cost-share for nearly a year after the storm – the third longest ever granted by a president.
- In all, more than $40 billion in aid and assistance from the Trump Administration to the people of Puerto Rico.
Predictably, the national media ignored these facts and has since then shamelessly and falsely portrayed President Trump as ineffective and uncaring about Puerto Rico. In fact, much of the federal aid made available has yet to be utilized due to the Biden Administration’s failure to hold the Financial Oversight Board and Puerto Rico’s current government accountable to operationalizing these funds.
To make matters worse, eight years after Congress afforded the country bankruptcy relief, as it had accumulated debts totaling more than $70 billion, Puerto Rico’s power utility PREPA remains in bankruptcy while spending hundreds of millions on law firms and consultants who are financially incentivized to perpetuate the status quo. The $9.6 billion authorized by President Trump to rebuild PREPA’s grid has been largely unspent, subjecting the more than three million Americans who reside there to frequent blackouts and outages.
Vice President Harris unveiled a plan for Puerto Rico this week. But unfortunately it contains more of the same vapid claims and promises centered around “clean energy,” which the Biden Harris Administration has squandered billions on with little to nothing to show for it. The Harris plan does nothing to address the key obstacles to Puerto Rico’s growth outlook, including ending bankruptcy, which would catalyze outside investment and the construction of a 21st century business-sustaining energy infrastructure for Puerto Rico, not built on green hype but on affordable, reliable American natural gas.
Having served as a Trump-appointed member of Puerto Rico’s Financial Oversight Board for three years, I saw up close what happened, who acted and who did not. I heard local politicians from both parties repeatedly express their gratitude for President Trump and his actions. Let’s be clear: When it mattered, President Trump stepped up with meaningful action. Puerto Rico is a beautiful part of America. Its proud American citizens have served our country in every major conflict of the last century. Our fellow Americans who reside in Puerto Rico deserve a leader who has already proven as President that he has the commitment, resolve and experience to help Puerto Rico grow. That leader is President Donald J. Trump. Let’s elect him to finish the job of making America and Puerto Rico great again.
Justin Peterson served as a member of Puerto Rico’s Financial Oversight Board from 2020-2023.

The Daily Caller,"‘Reeks Of Corruption’: Son Of High-Ranking Dem Raked In Hundreds Of Thousands From Dad’s Campaign, Lobbyists","The son of Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Richard Neal — leader of the House Ways and Means Committee — raked in hundreds of thousands of dollars in consulting fees from his father’s campaign and pressure groups who were actively lobbying his dad on tax policy, according to Politico.
Richard Neal’s son Brendan Neal launched a one-person public affairs firm offering “political advice, lobbying and strategic communications” in 2020, roughly one year after his father became the ranking member on Ways and Means — the sole congressional committee with jurisdiction to introduce federal tax legislation, Politico reported.
Brendan Neal went on to receive a total of $196,340 from his father’s campaign for “strategic consulting services,” $20,000 from Van Heuvelen Strategies, which had interests in at least six different Ways and Means issues, and $252,500 from a client of a lobbyist who was simultaneously working for Blackstone to protect the carried-interest rate, which allows individuals working in the financial industry to pay a lower tax rate. (RELATED: DC Councilman Who Claimed Jews Controlled The Weather Charged With Bribery)
“Lobbyists sending huge amounts of money to the son of a particularly powerful politician, who has a great deal of control over tax policy, just reeks of corruption,” Morris Pearl, chair of Patriotic Millionaires — a coalition of wealthy Americans concerned about income inequality — told Politico. “Almost anyone, including the clients of the lobbyists who are concerned about tax policy, would conclude that these lobbyists are trying to curry favor with Representative Neal for their clients.”
Richard Neal’s office has claimed the congressman was unaware his son was employed by lobbying firms with tax issues being decided by his committee, and that the two do not discuss official business, according to Politico.
“Congressman Neal has been clear – Brendan has never lobbied his office on Ways and Means Committee business,” Neal campaign spokesman Joshua Carp told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “With early voting started, while his political opponents are manufacturing distractions, he remains clear-eyed about what’s really important in the stakes of this election — fighting to lower costs for working families, for a woman’s right to choose and to preserve Social Security. That’s what’s on that ballot and why he’s traveling from Pittsfield to Pittsburgh campaigning for Kamala Harris.”
“I’m proud of my work advocating for causes like LGBT suicide prevention, the opioid crisis, climate change and American industry,” Brendan Neal told the DCNF. “I’ve always followed ethics rules. I don’t lobby my father and we don’t discuss my business.”

The Daily Caller,Scientist Buried Study Of Puberty Blockers For Kids Because She Didn’t Like The Results,"A doctor studying the effects of puberty-blocking drugs on children is reportedly withholding publishing data because the findings may be used by critics who support bans on the procedure.
Doctor Johanna Olson-Kennedy, a leading physician at one of the country’s largest youth gender clinics, led a two-year federally funded study in 2015 that followed 95 children receiving hormone blockers as part of sex-change procedures to monitor changes in mental health, according to The New York Times. Olson-Kennedy reportedly feared that in light of recent attempts to limit the procedure, the results of the study showing no improvement to mental health outcomes may reveal that “we shouldn’t use blockers because it doesn’t impact [the kids],” according to the NYT.
“I do not want our work to be weaponized,” Olson-Kennedy told the NYT. “It has to be exactly on point, clear and concise. And that takes time.”
The doctor argued that the findings of the study were neutral because the kids were “in really good shape when they come in, and they’re in really good shape after two years,” but earlier published findings from the study reveal that at the beginning of the study, roughly one-quarter of children reported symptoms of depression, anxiety and suicidal ideation, while nearly 8% had previously attempted suicide. The study did not show improved trends, Olson-Kennedy told the NYT.
Dr. Olson-Kennedy hypothesized that the study would reveal hormone blockers “decreased symptoms of depression, anxiety, trauma symptoms, self-injury, and suicidality, and increased body esteem and quality of life over time,” in the children, but insisted the results did not show the expected improvements because the kids had “good mental health on average,” according to the NYT.
“They’re not in any concerning ranges, either at the beginning or after two years,” she told the NYT.
Olson-Kennedy is a staunch advocate for sex-change treatment for youth, testifying in favor of the practice in multiple lawsuits. States like Idaho and Texas have banned sex-change operations and hormone blockers for children.
The study cost taxpayers $9.7 million, the NYT reported.
Around 121,882 children ages 6 to 17 were treated for “gender dysphoria” from 2017 to 2021, increasing by 70% from 2020 to 2021, according to Reuters. At least 4,780 minors have been put on puberty blockers within that time frame. (RELATED: Child Sex Change Bans Are Making Real-World Impact In Red States, Study Finds)

The Daily Caller,Former Soros Prosecutor Admits She Used Public Funds To Pay Personal Expenses,"Former Democratic St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kimberly Gardner has admitted to using public funds to cover her personal legal expenses, the Department of Justice announced on Wednesday.
As part of a pretrial diversion agreement, Gardner acknowledged that she ordered her subordinates to withdraw over $5,000 from the St. Louis Circuit Attorney’s Office and then deposited it in her personal bank account to reimburse herself for legal fees associated with a personal ethics lawsuit. The former St. Louis Circuit Attorney, effectively the district attorney for the city, was supported by liberal billionaire George Soros and faced criticism for not prosecuting criminals while in office.
‘The agreement follows a thorough investigation by the U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI, during which investigators interviewed all pertinent witnesses and reviewed all available evidence and financial records,” U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri Sayler Fleming said about the agreement. The funds “were deposited in her personal bank account and used for her personal expenses unrelated to her job duties and the operations of the Circuit Attorney’s Office. Kimberly Gardner was not entitled under the law to that additional compensation,” according to the diversion agreement. (Stream The Daily Caller’s Documentary ‘Cleaning Up Kamala’ HERE)
The illicit legal expense Gardner paid stems from her investigation into Republican Former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens where the Missouri Supreme Court determined she breached ethics rules. Gardner was probing Greitens for alleged sexual misconduct, though she dropped the case after a judge ruled she would have to answer questions under oath from the former governor’s attorney, The Associated Press reported.
Under the agreement, Gardner’s prosecution will be deferred for 18 months provided that she avoids breaking any other laws and reports to a pretrial services officer. She will also be required to pay back the funds she improperly used.
Gardner resigned from her post as St. Louis’ top prosecutor in May 2023 after Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey moved to remove her from office for, among other things, allowing a backlog of “at least 3,000 cases” to stack up without being reviewed. Police data shows that 2020, when Gardner was in office, saw the second-highest number of homicides in St. Louis history.
Bailey accused Gardener of “willful negligence” in a statement to the Daily Caller News Foundation.
While Gardner declined to pursue charges against many criminals, she did launch an investigation into Mark and Patricia McCloskey, St. Louis lawyers who became famous for standing outside their home with firearms to ward off protesters during the 2020 race riots.
“While Ms. Gardner was prepared to vigorously defend any allegations that may have been lodged against her, she and the government agreed to end any dispute and terminate any investigation with the pre-charge diversion agreement,” Ronald Sullivan, the Harvard Law School professor representing Gardner, told the DCNF.

Lake is running against Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego of Arizona to fill the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. Clinton noted that voters felt that Harris “just showed up” after President Joe Biden announced he would not seek reelection. (RELATED: NY Times Poll Shows Harris’ Support Among Key Voter Bloc In ‘Dangerously Low Territory’)
WATCH:
“About 45% of the people think he can do no wrong, and they don’t care if we save our democracy or not. So there is a sliver there that has to make up their mind. And to them, Kamala Harris just showed up,” Clinton said regarding former President Donald Trump. “I mean, she was there as vice president, and what they think of her largely depends on what they think of President Biden. But she is extremely vulnerable, more vulnerable than she deserves to be, through crazy attacks.”
Harris leads Trump by 0.2% in the RealClearPolling average of polls from Oct. 8 to 22, with the gap increasing to 0.6% when Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein, independent candidate Cornel West and Libertarian candidate Chase Oliver are included in surveys.
Clinton also took aim at Lake during the event, who narrowly lost the 2022 gubernatorial race in Arizona.
WATCH:
“You got a person that grew up under sometimes challenging circumstances, who made something of his life running against someone who is physically attractive, but believes that politics is a performance art,” Clinton said. (Watch The Daily Caller Documentary “Rigged”)
Gallego leads Lake by 6.1% in the RealClearPolling average for the Senate race, while Harris trails Trump in Arizona by 1.5% according to RealClearPolling.

The Daily Caller,Black Caller Who Doesn’t ‘Trust’ Dems Clashes With Charlamagne Over ‘Not Voting’ Harris,"Radio host Charlamagne Tha God sparred with a black caller on Thursday about his refusal to vote for Vice President Kamala Harris, despite his disdain for former President Donald Trump.
While 92% of black voters supported the Democratic presidential candidate in 2016, that number has dropped to 78% in 2024, according to a recent New York Times/Siena College Poll. The caller argued on “The Breakfast Club” that Democrats have failed to earn his vote, pledging not to vote for Harris even though he views Trump as “Hitler Jr.” (RELATED: Harris Fails To Explain Flip-Flops, Says She Has No Regrets About Biden In First Interview)
LISTEN:
“I’m not voting for Hitler Jr. and if I had to be honest with you … I don’t trust the Democrats, bruh. As a black man in America, we done been lied to so long. Promises have never been kept,” the caller said. “I’ma just keep it a buck. I’m not voting this year … I don’t trust the Democrats and I damn sure ain’t voting for Hitler Jr. Whatever happens gon’ happen.”
“Well if you not votin’ and Hitler Jr. wins, then you know you gon’ have to blame yourself,” Charlamagne retorted. “You gon’ have to take some of the blame.”
Trump’s former White House chief of staff John Kelly told The New York Times and The Atlantic that the former president had “fascist” tendencies and allegedly praised former Nazi leader Adolf Hitler. The Trump campaign has denied the allegations.
“I think the Democrats should take the blame because they’ve let down the black community so long. Just like you said the other day Charlamagne, they keep comin’ at black men,” the caller said. “They send [former president] Barack Obama, I don’t why the hell every four years they send Barack Obama just to talk to black men and chastise us about voting but like you said, 52% of white women is what got Trump in office.
“So why ain’t nobody never comin’ at white people about voting? Why is it always up to black men? And then when they get in office, the things they promised us, it never comes to fruition,” he added. “I’m fatigued, Charla.”
Obama on Oct. 10 urged black men to back Harris while speaking at a Pittsburgh-area campaign office, asserting he thinks a reason for their reluctance is they “aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president.”
“I’m with you. I understand the fatigue, but you know, not voting is never an option for me ’cause I like to complain, you know what I mean? You really can’t complain if you don’t participate in the process,” Charlamagne said. “I gotta participate in the process.”

The Daily Caller,Harris Does Damage Control After Biden’s ‘Garbage’ Comment Derails Her Closing Argument Speech,"Vice President Kamala Harris was forced to do damage control Wednesday after President Joe Biden called supporters of former President Donald Trump “garbage” while she was giving her campaign’s closing argument speech.
While on a get-out-the-vote call hosted by Voto Latino, the president responded to a joke made by comic Tony Hinchcliffe during a Trump rally in which he equated Puerto Rico to “floating island of garbage.” Biden called Trump a “failed businessman” with “no character” before going on to say the only garbage “floating out there is his supporters.” The vice president responded to Biden calling roughly half the country “garbage,” saying he had clarified the remarks and that she did not believe in criticizing people based on who they vote for.
“Listen, I think that first of all, he clarified his comments. Let me be clear, I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for,” the vice president began.
“You heard my speech last night and continuously throughout my career. I believe that the work that I do is about representing all the people whether they support me or not and as president of the United States I will be a president for all Americans whether you vote for me or not. I have that responsibility and that’s the kind of work I’ve done my entire career and I take it very seriously,” she continued.
The White House attempted to quell outrage over Biden’s comments Tuesday night, posting a written transcript of his comments, modifying “supporters” (as it was understood to many) to “supporter’s,” arguing that the president was addressing Hinchcliffe.
“[Biden] referred to the hateful rhetoric at the Madison Square Garden rally as ‘garbage,'” White House spokesperson Andrew Bates wrote in a tweet alongside the transcript.

But the response only fueled outrage further as pundits and social media users were quick to question the use of the apostrophe.
My write up:
I also asked the WH how they knew Biden only meant “supporter’s” as they have it in this transcript.

The president’s twitter account then put out a statement clarifying what he meant.
“Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage—which is the only word I can think of to describe it,” a post from the president’s twitter account reads. “His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation.”

The firestorm came as Harris was on stage at the Ellipse in the nation’s capital for her closing arguments in her campaign. The vice president attempted to draw on the location of her speech, the last place Trump spoke before the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol Riot, and the danger the former president poses to the country. Her remarks, in many ways, have been overshadowed by Biden’s comments. (RELATED: Harris Completes Pivot To Failed ‘Democracy’ Message With Speech At J6 Site)
A reporter followed up Wednesday, asking Harris if she sympathized with Americans who were offended by the president’s comments.
“I am running for president of the United States, I will be traveling to three states today to do what I have been doing throughout, which is talking with the American people about the fact that, first of all, I get it in terms of the concerns they have about challenges like the price of groceries,” Harris responded. “Second, my highest priority is to address that and to lift them up around their ambitions and aspirations and dreams and why I have a plan to strengthen the economy.”",2024-10-30
The Daily Caller,"Arizona Ballots Marred In Mailbox Fire, Authorities Say","More than a dozen ballots in Arizona were destroyed Thursday after a United States Postal Service (USPS) mailbox was set on fire, according to authorities.
Twenty electoral ballots were damaged by the fire set outside a post office in Phoenix just prior to 1:30 a.m., officials said, according to Fox 10 Phoenix.
Democratic Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego announced later Thursday after 2 p.m. that police had arrested a suspect with the assistance of “federal partners.” The identity of the suspect was not disclosed.
Thanks to swift action by @PhoenixPolice, @PHXFire and federal partners, we have arrested the suspect involved in this incident. https://t.co/DRkqz06All
— Mayor Kate Gallego (@MayorGallego) October 24, 2024
The Phoenix Police Department directed the Daily Caller to a media advisory identifying the suspect as 35-year-old Dieter Klofkorn. He allegedly said he committed the arson because he wanted to be arrested. Klofkorn claimed his actions were not motivated by politics or the 2024 election, according to the advisory.
The flames were put out by firefighters responding to the scene, Fox 10 Phoenix reported. Additional pieces of mail were reportedly also disfigured by the fire.
“The Postal Inspector took possession of the damaged ballots and mail,” Phoenix Fire Department Capt. Rob McDade stated. “The Phoenix Fire Investigations Task Force, which includes Phoenix Police detectives and Phoenix Fire investigators, are working with US Postal Inspectors.”
Investigators acquired surveillance footage from the scene, Phoenix police said. The area where the fire was lit has since been reopened following a temporary blockade, Fox 10 Phoenix reported. (RELATED: Elon Musk To Award One Person $1 Million Every Day Before Election Day)
Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer issued a statement on the incident obtained by the outlet.
“We are waiting for details from law enforcement. We encourage all voters who used that mail box in the last 36 hours to check the status of their ballots at https://BeBallotReady.Vote,” the statement said.
Richer’s statement urged Arizona voters to check their ballots’ status online and said Friday, Oct. 25, is the last day they can request a replacement ballot.
Klofkorn faces a single felony count of Arson of Property, according to the police department’s media advisory. An investigation is ongoing.",2024-10-24
The Daily Caller,Dem-Appointed Election Official Assures Voters Drop Boxes Are One Of ‘The Most Secure’ Ways To Vote,"Democratic Wisconsin Election Commissioner Ann Jacobs claimed Tuesday that drop boxes were among “the most secure” ways to vote, blaming “conspiracy theorists” for causing voters to be skeptical of their reliability.
In-person early voting in the swing state started Tuesday, USA Today reported. MSNBC host Chris Jansing noted during the interview with Jacobs that the number of known drop box locations in the state had declined to 107 from over 500 in the 2020 election, with the Wisconsin election commissioner saying “conspiracy theories” are to blame for the sharp decline. (RELATED: NY Times Poll Shows Harris’ Support Among Key Voter Bloc In ‘Dangerously Low Territory’)
WATCH:
“I tell them that it is the most secure way short of handing your ballot to your clerk’s hands. It goes through,” Jacobs claimed. “We have guidelines for the Wisconsin Elections Commission, for all of the communities in the state on how to make sure they’re safe and secure, how to make sure that the chain of custody between the drop box and the clerk occurs.”
“I always tell people, think about how many people touch a piece of mail, if you put it in your mailbox to go out into the mail stream, it goes to your postal carrier, it goes to a sorting entity,” Jacobs said. “For a lot of the state of Wisconsin, it goes to one of the two major cities, either Minneapolis in Minnesota or to Milwaukee, and then it gets redistributed and redelivered. So drop boxes are just a great, safe way to turn in your absentee ballots, and it’s disappointing that conspiracy theorists have caused that to be limited for some voters.”
Former President Donald Trump leads Vice President Kamala Harris by 0.4% in Wisconsin, according to the RealClear Polling average of polls taken from Sept. 28 to Oct. 20, with six of the last seven polls showing the former president either in the lead or a tie. The vice president leads Trump by 0.6% when Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein, independent candidate Cornel West and Libertarian candidate Chase Oliver are included in surveys of the state.
Trump won Wisconsin in the 2016 election, edging former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by 0.7%, and lost to then-former Vice President Joe Biden by 0.7% in 2020. In both years, the opinion polls understated Trump’s support by at least six percentage points.

The Daily Caller,A Democrat-Aligned Foreign Influence Network Pressured America To Ignore The ‘Ethnic Cleansing’ Of Christians,"Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday accused Vice President Kamala Harris of inaction as Christian Armenians faced ethnic cleansing at the hands of Muslim Azerbaijanis last year — inaction that was spurred by a network of Azerbaijani foreign agents with ties to the Democratic Party.
On Sept. 19, 2023, Azerbaijan invaded the autonomous region of Nagorno-Karabakh, inhabited primarily by Armenian Christians, beginning a swift offensive effort that led to almost all 120,000 inhabitants of the territory fleeing westward for fear of death. Shortly after the Azerbaijani military launched its assault, foreign agents paid by various arms of Azerbaijan’s government began blasting out thousands of emails to lawmakers and key players in the Biden-Harris administration attempting to squash domestic backlash to the attack on Armenian Christians, according to Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) records.
While Azerbaijan currently retains six U.S. firms to do its bidding, BGR Government Affairs and the Friedlander Consulting Group did the heavy lifting running cover for the Caucasian oil state following its invasion of Nagorno-Karabakh, FARA filings show. In the months following the offensive, BGR sent hundreds of emails, arranged meetings and made phone calls advocating for Azerbaijani interests. Friedlander Consulting, meanwhile, sent thousands of emails and organized meetings between key policymakers and members of the Azerbaijani government in the wake of the attack.
Both Mark Tavlarides, the primary BGR lobbyist working for Azerbaijan, and Ezra Friedlander, the head of Friedlander Consulting, have considerable ties to the Democratic Party. (Stream The Daily Caller’s Documentary ‘Lawless’ HERE)
Tavlarides served in the Clinton administration first as a legislative staffer in the Department of Defense and later as director of the White House National Security Council, according to his LinkedIn page. He has also donated nearly $30,000 to primarily Democratic political committees this election cycle, disclosure forms show.
Friedlander, meanwhile, has a history of working in Democratic politics in New York City, according to his company biography, and often reposts pro-Democratic messaging on his X account. Friedlander emphasized that his firm is “fully bipartisan and has reached out and worked with the entire spectrum of ideological and geographical political establishment to a fault.”
“These men, women and children, terrified for their lives, left behind entire worlds: their schools and shops; their fields, flocks, and vineyards; the cemeteries of their ancestors,” Harvard University professor Christina Maranci wrote of the exodus of Armenians spurred by the Azerbaijani offensive. “The United States and the European Union speak loftily of universal human rights, but did nothing for nine months while the people of [Nagorno-Karabakh] were denied food, medicine, fuel, and other vital supplies.”
Friedlander, whose firm receives $41,666 per month to represent the Azerbaijani government, started his public relations campaign for the country just days after it began to push ethnic Armenians out of their homes — setting up a meeting between House Republican Policy Committee Chairman Gary Palmer of Alabama with the Azerbaijani ambassador on Sept. 27, 2023, to discuss “developments in the South Caucasus,” disclosures show. The following day, Friedlander began working to arrange meetings between Azerbaijani embassy staff and various congressional offices, including, among others, those of Republican Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance and Democratic Delaware Sen. Chris Coons, who sits on the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
Vance, in an October 2023 congressional memo, raised concerns over the “the rapid overthrow of the ceasefire agreement in Nagorno-Karabakh by Azerbaijan and the exodus of an ancient Christian community.”
Friedlander’s actions were preceded by Democratic New Jersey then-Sen. Robert Menendez introducing a Senate resolution on September 21, 2023, requesting humanitarian assistance for displaced Armenians, calling for the United States to sanction the Azerbaijani officials who orchestrated the attack and laying out actions to deepen America’s strategic ties with Armenia. The Azerbaijani foreign agent acted quickly, emailing virtually every Senate office eight days later urging them to oppose the resolution eight days after it was introduced, disclosures show.
It is unclear what Friedlander sent to these senators, however, as there are no emails included in his firm’s FARA disclosures that mention the Senate resolutions or that match the date of those communications. Regardless, the resolution never made it out of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, according to legislative records.
The resolution, which was co-sponsored by a bi-partisan coalition of senators, pointed out how Azerbaijan had indiscriminately used rockets and cluster bombs against civilian targets and maintained a blockade that stopped roughly 90% of food from entering Nagorno-Karabakh. In addition to killing Armenian civilians, the invading Azerbaijani forces also destroyed Armenian churches and desecrated cultural heritage sites.
“The notion of Christians being persecuted in the Karabakh region or any other region in Azerbaijan is false,” Friedlander told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “Even the Prime Minister of Armenia publicly stated that literally days after the mass exodus last September. The guilty party was the illegal separatists who encouraged the Armenian population to leave. The world has forgotten that it was the Armenians who illegally occupied Karabakh although it is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan and in fact hundreds of thousands of Azerbaijanis that were forcefully expelled from Armenia and from Karabakh are still listed as international displaced persons by the UN, which issued four resolutions calling on Armenia to leave Karabakh.”
In one communication to policymakers, Friedlander stressed that Christians in Azerbaijan are allowed to celebrate Christmas in Azerbaijan. Freedom House, however, gave Azerbaijan a religious freedom score of zero in 2023, pointing out that faith groups must register with the government and are subject to surveillance. Members of religious communities that attempt to operate without government approval have been subject to torture and imprisonment.
Tavlarides, the Azerbaijani foreign agent working for BGR, began his work for the country in November 2023, reaching the staff managers of the House and Senate Foreign Affairs Committees to discuss the Armenian Protection Act of 2023, legislation that would bar Azerbaijan from receiving U.S. security aid for the next two years, disclosures show. The legislation passed the Senate by unanimous consent shortly after but has since stalled in the House amid an aggressive lobbying campaign from Friedlander.
“This bill actively harms the normalization process between Azerbaijan and Armenia,” a mass email Friedlander sent to hundreds of House offices in February reads. Friedlander went on to deny that Azerbaijan engaged in ethnic cleansing and to remind lawmakers of Azerbaijan’s close relationship with Israel.
Tavlarides is a donor to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and Friedlander is a practicing Jew who frequently posts about his support for Israel. Israel and Azerbaijan have a strong strategic relationship, with the latter providing the former with oil in exchange for guns.
In addition to attempting to influence lawmakers on behalf of the Azerbaijani government, Friedlander and Tavlarides also worked to influence the Biden administration’s response to the Nagorno-Karabakh crisis, according to disclosures. The latter sent Assistant Secretary of Defense Rheanne Wrikkala an email in February expressing opposition to Senate Resolution 540, which would have requested that the Secretary of State provide a report investigating if Azerbaijan has engaged in human rights abuses and assessing if security assistance to the Caucasian nation should continue.
Tavlarides’ letter stressed Azerbaijan’s support of Ukraine and Israel, the country’s history of cooperation with the United States and the importance of America maintaining commitment to its allies, without mentioning the humanitarian abuses in Nagorno-Karabakh, disclosures show. He sent similar communications to a number of House offices. Tavlarides also reached the State Department on behalf of the Azerbaijani government in January, asking it to oppose amendments to the Fiscal Year 2025 National Defense Authorization Act that would restrict military assistance to the country, probe its relationships with Iran and Russia and call on it to release all prisoners of war and captured civilians.
Tavlarides also attempted to arrange a meeting between the Helsinki Commission, a U.S. agency that handles some European diplomatic affairs, and the Embassy of Azerbaijan, records show.
Friedlander, meanwhile, contacted the State Department in early 2024 and the Department of Veterans Affairs in 2023 to provide them with information about Azerbaijani cultural events, according to disclosures.
Tavlarides and Friedlander often extended offers to connect government officials with Azerbaijani diplomats at the end of their emails. Tavlarides did not respond to a request for comment.
Even as Azerbaijan escaped sanction for its invasion of Nagorno-Karabakh thus far, it has continued to expand its influence network in D.C., FARA filings show.
As the House considers legislation to strip Azerbaijan of American military aid, the country’s embassy hired Skyline Capitol to represent it in June, agreeing to pay the firm $50,000 per month for its services. Skyline Capitol is led by the recently-retired Republican former Utah Rep. Chris Stewart, who sat on the House Foreign Affairs and the Intelligence Committees. Stewart’s firm specializes in defense and foreign affairs lobbying.
After leaving Congress, lobbyists tend to leverage the connections they made while on the hill to deliver better representation to their clients which, in this case, happens to be a nation experts have accused of ethnic cleansing.
“Foreign governments don’t deserve a veto over U.S. human rights policy — a core American value,” Armenian National Committee of America executive director Aram Hamparian told the DCNF. “Azerbaijan, in particular, should not be allowed to enforce a gag-rule against American condemnation of its ethnic cleansing of at-risk Armenian Christians.”
Azerbaijan is allegedly asking lobbyists not to represent it without registering under FARA, which would mean that the American public would not be privy to what agents of the foreign nation were saying to officials, Politico reported Thursday night. Two lobbyists, speaking anonymously, said they had declined to work with the country because they believed it was prompting them to violate federal law.
A representative from the Azerbaijani Embassy stressed that the country’s “work with the companies is within the respective U.S. legislation.” They also accused Armenia of ethnic cleansing and argued that Azerbaijan has a tradition of multiculturalism and religious tolerance.
The Department of Defense, White House and BGR did not respond to the DCNF’s requests for comment. The State Department declined to comment.

The Daily Caller,‘The Dang Thing Would Explode’: Sen. John Kennedy Suggests Kamala Harris Could Break A Polygraph By Walking Near It,"Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana sarcastically remarked during a Saturday night appearance on Fox News that Vice President Kamala Harris could cause a polygraph machine to blow up by simply walking near it.
Harris has escalated attacks on former President Donald Trump, most recently labeling him a “fascist” during a CNN town hall on Wednesday. While speaking to Fox News’ Brian Kilmeade, Kennedy said that Harris is falling behind Trump because Americans are “uncertain” about what she would do if elected to the presidency. (RELATED: ‘You’ve Lied To Us’: Chris Sununu Blasts Kamala Harris For ‘Absolutely Condescending’ Campaign)
WATCH:
“It’s worth examining why Vice President Harris is now behind,” Kennedy told Kilmeade. “I think she’s behind because of all her gauzy rhetoric. People are uncertain about her. They don’t know if she has the right stuff to be president. They’re worried that she doesn’t, they’re worried that she was that kid in grade school who ate paste, they just don’t know. She hasn’t — she won’t be pinned down, I think in some cases she’s lying. People are worried that if she walked by a polygraph machine, the dang thing would explode.”
“People want to know what their president is going to do,” Kennedy continued. “Now, I’ll tell you the other thing that’s changed in this race other than the vice president behind. Vice President Harris has adopted a new strategy. Joy is out. She’s adopted the Hillary Clinton deplorable strategy of 2016, which is if you vote for President Trump, you are a bad person.”
A July poll by YouGov for The Times showed that 54% of respondents believed that President Joe Biden’s health issues were covered up, with 68% of those respondents saying they felt Harris had “a lot” to do with concealing the truth about Biden’s health. Trump accused Harris of lying about working at McDonald’s as a teenager, and her campaign has yet to provide evidence suggesting that she did. (Watch The Daily Caller Documentary “Cleaning Up Kamala”)
Harris has also reportedly backed away from left-wing positions she held during her campaign for the 2020 Democratic Party nomination for president, primarily through statements by campaign aides to reporters.
Trump leads Harris by 0.1% in the RealClearPolling average of polls from Oct. 11 to 26, and maintains that margin when Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein, independent candidate Cornel West and Libertarian candidate Chase Oliver are included in surveys.

The Daily Caller,‘Could’ve Killed Someone’: Conservatives Blast Dem Candidate For Gun Photo-Op That Injured Reporter With Shrapnel,"Conservatives and gun advocates criticized Democratic Missouri Senate candidate Lucas Kunce on Tuesday and Wednesday for a gun range photo-op that resulted in a reporter being injured by shrapnel.
Kunce, who is aiming to take Republican Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley’s seat in November, was at a gun range Tuesday with former Republican Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger when a TV reporter was wounded with shrapnel. In response, critics slammed Kunce and the photo-op, pointing out violations of gun safety, like shooting steel at too close of a range.

“There are at least two canisters of explosive Tannerite powder on the table, down range from where guns are being fired,” Davis said on X. “That could’ve potentially killed or seriously injured someone if someone shot it or if someone was stupid enough to be shooting close enough to steel for a ricochet to hit it.”
There appeared to be bottles of explosive compound Tannerite, which is commonly used on gun ranges but is kept at safe distances, on the table close to active gunfire, according to Kunce’s post on X. The manufacturer of the compound stresses that it should be stored safely when not in use and that misuse could result in “serious injury or death.”
Typically, Tannerite targets are placed downrange at a minimum of 100 yards, according to the manufacturer guidelines.
Kinzinger was also photographed using what looked to be a high-powered scope on short-range targets, according to Kunce’s post on X.

“Democrats Lucas Kunce & Adam Kinzinger apparently accidentally shot a reporter at an event today,” Hawley spokesperson Abigail Jackson said on X. “Are these guys trying to make Tim Walz look competent with a gun?”
Kunce, a former United States Marine, has supported gun control expansion in the past, including raising the age limit to buy a gun to 21, expanding red flag laws and expanding background checks, according to a 2022 interview with NPR. In comparison, Hawley has been a staunch advocate for gun rights in the Senate, receiving an “A” rating from the National Rifle Association.

The Daily Caller,Trump Slated For Joe Rogan Podcast Appearance,"Former President Donald Trump is scheduled to appear on popular podcast host Joe Rogan’s “The Joe Rogan Experience” on Friday, a source familiar with the former president’s schedule confirmed to the Daily Caller News Foundation.
Rogan will interview Trump at his studio in Austin, Texas, Politico first reported on Tuesday, citing an individual granted anonymity to discuss the situation. The podcast host has never had Trump on his show and previously said in 2022 that he wasn’t “interested in helping him” by offering him a platform.

Spotify previously broadcast Rogan’s podcast exclusively, but episodes are now released on YouTube as well, based on his February $250 million Spotify deal, The Wall Street Journal reported. He has over 17 million YouTube subscribers and over 14 million followers on Spotify.
Vice President Kamala Harris is also discussing an appearance on “The Joe Rogan Experience” to target male voters, Reuters reported on Oct. 15. There was no appearance officially scheduled at the time, two sources familiar with the situation told the outlet.
Rogan also said in 2023 that he would vote for Trump over President Joe Biden.
Trump has a 51% to 40% advantage among male voters, while Harris holds a 53% to 38% advantage among women voters, according to a recent New York Times/Siena College poll. The former president currently leads Harris in all seven top swing states, according to the RealClearPolling averages.
Journalist Mark Halperin asserted Tuesday that Trump will secure victory on Nov. 5 if the current early voting trajectory holds.

The Daily Caller,Democrats Fight To Make Elections Less Trustworthy,"Democrats are fighting to make elections less secure in multiple key states just days before the Nov. 5 election.
Election legislation has already been a focal point of the 2024 campaign, especially as the Republican National Committee (RNC) beefs up its election integrity department, but the battles are set to continue beyond Nov. 5. In the weeks leading up to the election, Democrats have signed legislation prohibiting voter identification while Biden-Harris’s Department of Justice has sued Alabama and Virginia for attempting to take illegal immigrants off their voter rolls.
“What’s so bizarre about that lawsuit, the two lawsuits that DOJ has filed … that is the exact opposite of what DOJ should be doing, it is a criminal violation of federal – in fact, it’s a felony for an alien to register to vote,” Hans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow focusing on election integrity at the Heritage Foundation, told the Daily Caller. (RELATED: Watch The Daily Caller’s Documentary ‘Rigged’)
“And so what the DOJ ought to be doing is going to Virginia and saying, ‘can you please give me the files of each of these voters so we can investigate and potentially prosecute them?’ And no, instead, they’re saying, ‘no, you have to keep on the voter rolls aliens who are breaking federal law,'” von Spakovsky continued.
In August, Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed an executive order to make the state more frequently remove noncitizens from the voter rolls. The DOJ then moved to sue the state on Oct. 12, alleging that the Virginia State Board of Elections had violated the federal National Voter Registration Act (NVRA), which states that voter rolls may not be cleaned up 90 days before an election. Biden’s DOJ further claimed that the executive order, signed 90 days out from Nov. 5, produced a “systemic removal” which can apparently cause voters to be confused and affect eligible voters.

Similarly, Alabama was sued by the Biden-Harris DOJ after Secretary of State Wes Allen identified 3,251 registered voters that had been issued noncitizen identification numbers by the Department of Homeland Security and sought to remove them from the rolls. The DOJ alleged that, like in Virginia, it was too close to election day.
“The right to vote is one of the most sacred rights in our democracy,” Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division said in a statement. “As Election Day approaches, it is critical that Alabama redress voter confusion resulting from its list maintenance mailings sent in violation of federal law.”
In Virginia’s case, Biden-appointed U.S. District Court Judge Patricia Giles issued an order blocking Virginia’s efforts to remove the estimated 1,600 individuals that the state believes have “self-identified” as noncitizens. On Sunday, the Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares said he would be filing an emergency appeal to the Supreme Court in response.
A Trump-appointed judge sided with the DOJ in Alabama and ordered the state restore the voters who they had taken off the voter rolls as a result of Allen’s order.
In Texas, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott previously announced that his administration had purged more than 6,500 noncitizens from state voter rolls. The cleaning of the voter rolls is a result of a 2021 bill Abbott signed into law which instated numerous election security measures like uniform statewide voting hours, banned drive-through voting and gave more power to poll watchers.
“I was surprised they haven’t sued Texas yet. Texas also announced that he did take 6,500 aliens off the voter roll. I’m expecting Texas will get sued by DOJ also,” von Spakovsky told the Caller.

Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law on Sept. 29 that prohibits local governments from requiring identification to vote. The legislation was brought forward by Democratic state Sen. Dave Min after a ballot measure was presented in Huntington Beach that would require identification at the polls, according to Politico.
“Forbidding, actually forbidding it. The state has no ID requirement, and yet, when one town said, ‘Well, we really want to do this,’ they pass a law preventing that from happening. In general, every time states have tried to clean up their voter lists to take off people who have died and moved away, Democrats sue them so they want inaccurate voter lists,” von Spakovsky told the Caller.

About a week out from the election, political experts have started to discuss what the aftermath of a Trump victory could look like. From protests, to lawfare, to security concerns, the Daily Caller spoke to a variety of experts who predicted a dangerous and extreme response from Democrats if Trump wins. (RELATED: What Happens If Trump Wins?)
Von Spakovsky told the Caller he expects Democrats to claim voter suppression through lawsuits following a Trump victory. Mike Davis, a Trump-aligned lawyer and founder of the Article III Project, explained that even if Democrats prepare to sue, the state of election integrity is not close to what it was in 2024.
“President Trump learned his lesson from 2020 … He has hired a very good legal team led by David Warrington on his campaign, along with a very good legal team led by RNC Chairman Michael Whatley,” Davis told the Caller.
“That was the mistake in 2020: they didn’t get injunctions … They’re doing it this time,” Davis added, explaining that the RNC legal team has been far more proactive in the 2024 election cycle.",2024-10-28
The Daily Caller,‘Something Has To Be Done’: Trump Pledges Compensation Fund For Victims Of Migrant Crime,"Former President Donald Trump unveiled a new proposal on Tuesday, pledging to establish a “compensation fund” for victims of migrant crime in the United States.
Speaking to the public during a press conference at Mar-a-Largo, Trump highlighted the growing threat of Tren de Aragua and other international crime syndicates being imported into the U.S. through mass illegal immigration. The Republican candidate pledged to dismantle these migrant gangs and use their seized assets to create a compensation fund for the victims of their crimes. (RELATED: NYPD Refused Detainer Request And Released Illegal Migrant Charged With Attempted Murder, ICE Says)
“Today, I’m announcing that for the first time, under my administration, we will be seizing the assets of the criminal gangs and drug cartels, and we will use those assets to create a compensation fund to provide restitution for the victims of migrant crime,” Trump said. “And the government will help in the restitution.”
“But something has to be done, and we’re going to get it done,” he continued.

The campaign pledge came as the presidential election reaches its final days, and border security has remained a top issue for voters.
There were roughly 8.5 million migrant encounters along the U.S.-Mexico border during the four fiscal years of the Biden-Harris White House, according to the latest data from Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The number of illegal border crossings in fiscal year 2024 were the second worst in U.S. history — only surpassed by fiscal year 2023.
The wave of illegal immigration has been followed by growing reports of criminal activity by Tren de Aragua, an international gang that originated in Venezuela. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) suspects that roughly 600 individuals in the U.S. could have potential ties to the Venezuelan gang, but experts predict that number is likely much higher.
The murders of Jocelyn Nungaray, Rachel Morin and Laken Riley are high-profile examples of numerous victims, allegedly at the hands of illegal migrants, in recent times. Their cases have not only kept border security on the forefront of public debate, but have spawned new laws or legislative proposals across the country.
Trump, who has long championed immigration enforcement, has continued to make the issue a hallmark of his campaign.
[Vice President Kamala Harris’] borders are the worst in the history of the world,” Trump said at his Tuesday press conference. “There’s never been a border in the world like this.”
“It’s at a level that we’ve never seen before,” he continued. “If you look at Venezuela, their crime is way, way down, and you go to Caracas and you wouldn’t recognize it … because they are taking all their criminals — they’re all coming — they’ve taken their drug dealers and put them into the United States.”

The Daily Caller,Frank Luntz Says Harris ‘Going To Fail’ If All She Does Is Bash Trump,"Pollster Frank Luntz said on Tuesday that Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign is doomed if she focuses solely on attacking former President Donald Trump.
As her campaign nears its end, Harris has shifted her messaging from promoting joyfulness to attempting to portray Trump as a danger to the United States, The New York Times reported. Luntz, on “CNN News Central,” argued that Harris needs to provide voters with compelling reasons to support her instead of relying solely on criticism of the former president. (RELATED: Harris Campaign Backpedals From Economic Agenda For Black Men Days After Releasing It)
WATCH:
“I’ve said that Trump would do better if he says less, not more, that he would be more successful if he did not use these outbursts that he’s been doing over the last few weeks. And Harris would do much better if she talked with some detail about exactly what she will do. Not what she wants, not her objectives, but how she’s going to get there,” Luntz said. “Trump basically has reached the ceiling of his votes and that’s enough for him to win.”
“Harris has a higher ceiling. I agree with her campaign in that assertion, but she’s not going to get there until she gives voters what they need to know to have faith, trust and confidence in her,” the pollster added. “It’s a good strategy that she’s doing, but I assure you, if she’s just beating up on Donald Trump, she’s going to fail.”
Luntz added what Trump and Harris “say and how they say it the last 48 hours” of the campaign “that will determine” the ultimate vote tally.
Trump currently holds leads over Harris in all seven top battleground states, according to the RealClear Polling averages. Journalist Mark Halperin said Tuesday that Trump will be elected on Nov. 5 if the current early voting trajectory holds.
“Make no mistake, if these numbers hold up in the states where we can understand even partially what the data is like, we’ll know that Donald Trump’s going to be president on Election Day,” he said.

The Daily Caller,‘It’s Not True’: CNN Fact-Checker Scolds Walz For Latest Whopper On Trump’s Jobs Record,"CNN fact-checker Daniel Dale asserted Tuesday that Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota falsely claimed that former President Donald Trump set a record for lost manufacturing jobs.
Walz claimed that Trump set a record for the most manufacturing job losses during his administration in a Monday appearance on “The View,” where he also took aim at Republican Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, alleging that Vance and Trump were “venture capitalists” who helped ship jobs overseas. Dale contested Walz’s point and pointed out that job losses under Trump were due to the COVID-19 pandemic. (RELATED: Self-Proclaimed Firearm Enthusiast Tim Walz Struggles To Load $2100 Shotgun During Hunting Trip)
“If you’re going to say something is simply factual, it should be factual. This is not. It’s not true that the Trump presidency lost more manufacturing jobs than any other presidency,” Dale told “CNN News Central” host Kate Bolduan. “Under George W. Bush, there were about 4.5 million manufacturing jobs lost. Under Trump, it was about 178,000. But there are also more manufacturing jobs lost than under Trump: under Eisenhower, under Ford, under Reagan. So Trump does not have the record.”
WATCH:
“I think it’s also worth pointing out for context that these Trump job losses in manufacturing overwhelmingly occurred because of the COVID pandemic,” Dale continued. “Pre-pandemic, under Trump, there was a gain of about 414,000 manufacturing jobs. Again, he ended a negative 178,000, but that was largely because we had a pandemic-related crash.”
Walz has made numerous claims that haven’t borne scrutiny since Vice President Kamala Harris announced him as her running mate on Aug. 6. He has also come under fire after claiming he was in Hong Kong during the June 1989 massacre or protesters in Tiananmen Square during the Oct. 1 vice presidential debate against Republican Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio.
Vance accused Walz of “stolen valor” in an Aug. 7 campaign event, citing comments about gun control Walz made in a video posted on X by the Harris-Walz campaign. Walz also faced questions about the timing of his 2005 retirement in regards to the war in Iraq from the Minnesota National Guard that arose after a 2018 Facebook post by retired Army Command Sergeant Major Thomas Behrends resurfaced.

The Daily Caller,Supreme Court Allows Virginia To Remove Noncitizens From Voter Rolls,"The Supreme Court allowed Virginia on Wednesday to remove individuals identified as noncitizens from the voter rolls.
The justices paused a lower court order preventing officials from removing around 1,600 individuals who the state said “self-identified” as noncitizens.
Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Ketanji Brown Jackson and Elena Kagan would not have granted Virginia’s request, according to the order.

U.S. District Court Judge Patricia Giles, a Biden appointee, ruled Friday that Virginia must stop its efforts to remove noncitizen voters within 90 days of the election and restore registered voters removed under the program. When an appeals court upheld the decision on Sunday, the state quickly filed an emergency application with the Supreme Court. (RELATED: Election Litigation Could Shape The Race In Battleground States. We Won’t Know Until The Votes Are Cast.)
“The injunction, which prohibits the application of a law that has been on the books since the Justice Department precleared it in 2006, will also irreparably injure Virginia’s sovereignty, confuse her voters, overload her election machinery and administrators, and likely lead noncitizens to think they are permitted to vote, a criminal offence that will cancel the franchise of eligible voters,” the state argued in the emergency application filed Sunday.
We are pleased by the Supreme Court’s order today. This is a victory for commonsense and election fairness. I am grateful for the work of Attorney General @JasonMiyaresVA on this critical fight to protect the fundamental rights of U.S. citizens. Clean voter rolls are one…
— Glenn Youngkin (@GlennYoungkin) October 30, 2024
Republican Virginia Gov. Genn Youngkin wrote on X that the order is “a victory for commonsense and election fairness.”
“Clean voter rolls are one important part of a comprehensive approach we are taking to ensure the fairness of our elections,” he wrote.
The Department of Justice (DOJ) initially sued Virginia on Oct. 12, alleging the state violated the National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) by making changes to the voter rolls within 90 days of the election when the “risk of disfranchising eligible voters is greatest.” Youngkin signed an executive order in August requiring election officials to expedite the removal of ineligible noncitizen voters from the voter rolls.

The Daily Caller,Harris Touts Latest Celebrity Endorsement As Polls Indicate High Prices Remain Americans’ Top Priority,"Democratic presidential nominee and sitting Vice President Kamala Harris championed her latest celebrity endorsement Friday at a Texas campaign event centered mainly around abortion, despite voters’ insistence that the economy is their greatest concern as November approaches.
Singer Beyonce formally endorsed Harris at the rally where the two slammed the state’s 6-week abortion ban, according to Fox News. Harris has made abortion access a major component of her campaign, even though many of the latest polls show Americans care most about rising costs.
“I’m not here as a celebrity, I’m not here as a politician, I’m here as a mother,” Beyonce told the crowd of 30,000, according to Fox. “A mother who cares deeply about the world my children and all of our children live in. A world where we have the freedom to control our bodies.”
The economy remains the single most important issue for voters this election, far outweighing abortion, immigration and the environment, according to an October Gallup poll. Prices have risen more than 20% under the Biden-Harris administration, with inflation reaching a high of 9% year-over-year in June 2022 before slowly ticking back down.
Harris bashed former president and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump at the rally for appointing three conservative justices to the Supreme Court who later helped to strike down the landmark Roe v. Wade court case, returning the authority to create abortion laws to the states, Fox News reported.
“Texas, what we’re experiencing here is a health care crisis, and Donald Trump is the architect of it,” Harris said, according to Fox News.
Celebrity endorsements generally do little to affect Americans’ voting habits, according to a poll conducted in May by USA TODAY and Suffolk University. (RELATED: ‘Why Would Any Christian Vote For Her?’: Pro-Life Orgs React To Harris’ ‘Anti-Religious Freedom’ Abortion Stance)
Beyonce joins a growing list of celebrity endorsements the Democratic candidate has received, including from former president and first lady Barack and Michelle Obama and Taylor Swift.

The Daily Caller,"NYC Mayor Eric Adams Undermines Harris’s ‘Fascist’ Accusation Against Trump, Makes Call To ‘Dial Down The Temperature’","New York City Mayor Eric Adams differed Saturday with Vice President Kamala Harris’s Wednesday labeling of former President Donald Trump as a fascist.
Adams — together with Deputy Mayor Chauncey Parker, New York City Police Department (NYPD) interim commissioner Tom Donlon and other NYPD leadership — was speaking at a security briefing ahead of former President Trump’s Sunday rally at Madison Square Garden.
Adams, when asked by Politico political reporter Emily Ngo if he believed Trump was fascist, said, “My answer is ‘no.’ I know what Hitler has done, and I know what a fascist regime looks like.”
Adams also claimed some political leaders in New York City had “hurled” the terms “fascist” and “Hitler” at him.
“I think — as I’ve called over and over again — that the level of conversation — I think we could all dial down the temperature,” he continued.
“There’s no agency in the world better prepared to ensure the safety of this event than the NYPD,” Parker added.
In response to critics who demanded Trump not hold the rally, Adams said, “I strongly disagree. This is America, this is New York and I think it’s important that we allow individuals to exercise their right to get their message clear to New Yorkers. And our job as a city and as a police department is to make sure that you do that in a peaceful way.”
“I think that we must be extremely cautious of— the heat we turn up today, pre-election, is going to have to be the heat we’re going to have to govern in,” Adams added.
During a Wednesday presidential town hall event, Harris, when asked by CNN’s Anderson Cooper whether she thought Trump was a fascist, said, “Yes, I do. Yes, I do. And I also believe that the people who know him best on this subject should be trusted.”
Harris was referencing Trump’s former chief of staff, John Kelly, and the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, retired General Mark Milley. (RELATED: Kamala Harris Calls Trump ‘Fascist’ In CNN Town Hall)
Kelley called Trump a fascist during recent interviews with The New York Times. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung fired back, saying Kelly had “beclowned” himself. Trump also responded, labeling Milley a “lowlife,” “a total degenerate” and a “bad general,” CBS News reported.
Thirteen former Trump administration officials have openly backed Kelly’s claim, according to Politico.
Milley called Trump “the most dangerous person to this country” and “a fascist to the core,” according to an upcoming book by Washington Post associate editor Bob Woodward. Milley also feared being court-martialed should Trump become president again, the Guardian reported.
Trump had confirmed in early October that his campaign rented the iconic Madison Square Garden for the major rally. The arena previously hosted a number of key political events in U.S. history, including the 1976, 1980 and 1992 Democratic National Conventions as well as the 2004 Republican National Convention, according to The Associated Press. In 1892, former President Grover Cleveland accepted the Democratic nomination for president during a speech at the venue. Cleveland was ultimately elected as the first president to serve nonconsecutive terms, a distinction Trump hopes to emulate.
Trump and Adams both attended the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in New York City on Oct. 17 to benefit charity. As part of the annual event’s lighthearted proceedings, Trump made several jokes about the absent Harris as well as prominent Democrats seated nearby on the dias, including Adams and indictment over bribery charges.
“You’re peanuts compared to what they’ve done to me.”

The Daily Caller,‘There Wasn’t One’: Dana Bash Says Kamala Harris Failed To ‘Close The Deal’ On Policy During Town Hall,"CNN host Dana Bash conceded Wednesday night that Vice President Kamala Harris was not able to “close the deal” with voters on policy during a town hall hosted by the network.
Harris took part in the town hall moderated by CNN host Anderson Cooper, during which she called former President Donald Trump a fascist, but also delivered “word salad” answers. Bash said that Harris did not outline any legislative priorities for a potential administration. (RELATED: ‘She Did Very Poorly’: Geraldo Rivera Hammers Harris Over Response To Border Questions)
WATCH:
“I’ll just tell you what I’m hearing from people who I have been talking to, and that is that if her goal was to close the deal, they’re not sure she did that. And, you know, some people have asked, is she being held to a different standard? Maybe,” Bash said. “But that’s maybe the world that she’s living in.”
“And on the question of who she is, people are understanding that a little bit more. But what she will do, the question about her legislative priorities, name one, there wasn’t one,” Bash told CNN host Jake Tapper. “You know, some more of her personality and her sort of character questions about your weaknesses or what mistakes did you make, not necessarily the answers there. Having said that, any time that she can be in front of an audience and interacting with voters is a win as far as her campaign goes, and they are very happy about that.”
Harris initially rarely did interviews and had not taken questions at a press conference since replacing President Joe Biden after he announced he would not seek reelection July 21. She did a media blitz earlier in October, which included an Oct. 16 interview with Fox News host Bret Baier, who pressed the vice president on the border and Biden’s declining health.
Prior to the interview with Baier, Harris did interviews or appearances with “60 Minutes,” shock jock Howard Stern, the co-hosts of “The View,” the “Call Her Daddy” podcast and CBS late-night host Stephen Colbert. (Watch The Daily Caller Documentary “Cleaning Up Kamala”)
A Wall Street Journal poll shows Trump leading Harris by two points, 47% to 45%, with the vice president’s favorability at only 45% compared to a 53% unfavorable rating two weeks before the Nov. 5 election.
Trump trails Harris by 0.2% in the RealClearPolling average of polls from Oct. 8 to 22, with the gap increasing to 0.6% when Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein, independent candidate Cornel West and Libertarian candidate Chase Oliver are included in surveys.

The Harris campaign has repeatedly responded to Biden’s requests to campaign with “we’ll get back to you,” three people familiar with the dynamic told Axios. Another person familiar with the situation compared it to “a slow-moving break-up.”
The Harris campaign’s “Day Ahead” email blast for Saturday excluded Biden’s solo campaign stops in Pittsburgh, according to Axios.
Biden’s unpopularity is the main deterrent to a joint appearance from the president and Harris, the outlet reported. Biden currently sits at a 39% approval rating, according to FiveThirtyEight’s average.
Axios reported that Harris’s campaign considers Biden to be a “political liability.” However, the vice president’s team reportedly refuses to be direct with Biden to avoid bruising his ego or hurting his feelings. (RELATED: Biden Will Not Appear With Kamala Harris Before Election Day: REPORT)
Many Biden staffers believe the president can help Harris, citing the decades-old Democratic politician’s coalitions in white, working-class communities. Biden has spent much time in the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania, where Republican nominee Donald Trump leads Harris by 0.6%, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average.
Harris said her prospective presidency would not be a “continuation” of the Biden-Harris administration in her Oct. 16 interview with Fox News anchor Bret Baier.

The Daily Caller,"‘Why Not?’: Trump Tells Rogan He’ll Use Tariffs To Eliminate Income Tax, Make America ‘Rich’","Former President Donald Trump said he would seek to use tariffs to potentially eliminate the income tax in a lengthy interview with podcaster Joe Rogan released Friday night.
Trump, who enacted tariffs on steel and aluminum in 2018 during his presidency, sat with the podcaster in a nearly three-hour long episode of The Joe Rogan Experience. Rogan asked Trump if he was “serious” about using tariffs to offset the elimination of income taxes. (RELATED: ‘He Saved The Steel Industry’: Steelworkers In Key Swing State Explain Why They Endorsed Trump)
WATCH:
“To me, the most beautiful word — and I’ve said this the past couple of weeks, in the dictionary today — is the word tariff,” Trump told Rogan. “It’s more beautiful than love, it’s more beautiful than any — it’s the most beautiful word. This country can become rich with the use, the proper use, of tariffs.”
Trump said he would impose a 200% tariff on John Deere’s tractors if it closed an American factory and moved production to Mexico in September.
“Did you just float out the idea of getting rid of income taxes and replacing it with tariffs?” Rogan asked. “Were you serious about that?”
“Why not?” Trump responded. “Our country was the richest, relatively, in the 1880s and 1890s, a president who was assassinated named McKinley, he was the tariff king. He spoke beautifully of tariffs. His language was really beautiful: We will not allow the enemy to come in and take our jobs and take our factories and take our workers and take our families unless they pay a big price and the big price is tariffs.” (Watch The Daily Caller Documentary “Cleaning Up Kamala”)
Vice President Kamala Harris has claimed in ads and in speeches that Trump’s plan to impose tariffs would act as a “national sales tax” and insisted that it would cost American families $4,000 a year in higher prices, the Wall Street Journal reported.

The Daily Caller,ROOKE: Epstein World Goes All In For Kamala Harris,"Vice President Kamala Harris has some pretty interesting bedfellows — all reportedly connected to Jeffrey Epstein — backing her presidential campaign.
Billionaire Elon Musk sat down Oct. 7 with Daily Caller co-founder Tucker Carlson to discuss his views on the 2024 election. During the interview, Carlson asked Musk whether he thought former President Donald Trump would release the infamous Epstein List, which reportedly contains the names of famous politicians, celebrities and wealthy elites who visited Epstein’s island and participated in the illicit activities available there.
“I think part of why Kamala’s getting so much support is that if Trump wins, that Epstein client list is going to become public,” Musk said. “And some of those billionaires behind Kamala are terrified of that outcome.”

Musk said he thinks the possibility of this list being made public makes billionaires like Bill Gates and Reid Hoffman very nervous.
“[Hoffman] is terrified of a Trump victory,” Musk added. “I think he’s certainly ideologically not aligned with Trump anyway, but I think he is concerned about the Epstein situation.”

Trump’s lawyers exposed that Hoffman helped pay for the lawsuit by E. Jean Carroll, the New York magazine writer who sued Trump for rape and defamation. Hoffman’s spokesman admitted that the billionaire donated through a nonprofit to support a different public interest lawsuit being handled by Kaplan Hecker & Fink. Still, the spokesman added that it was unrelated to the firm taking up Carroll’s case against Trump. Trump’s lawyers, however, said the revelation of the grant raises “significant questions” about the allegations and their credibility.

The Wall Street Journal reported in May 2023 that LinkedIn co-founder Hoffman stayed on Epstein’s infamous private Caribbean island, Little St. James, and was scheduled to stay at Epstein’s Manhattan townhouse in 2014. “Mr. Hoffman said he met with Epstein to raise funds for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and that he regrets interacting with Epstein after his conviction,” the outlet reported.

Hoffman and his wife, Michelle Yee, have donated millions to support Harris. They gave $10 million this election to the Future Forward PAC, which supports Harris’ campaign, and $6 million to the Republican Accountability PAC, an anti-Trump PAC.
Calendar dates showed Gates met with Epstein and Hyatt hotel heir Thomas Pritzker (Democratic Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s cousin) in 2014 at the Park Hyatt Hotel near Central Park in New York. Gates claims he regrets meeting Epstein and that he was there to talk to him about potential philanthropy projects. However, his ex-wife, Melinda Gates, told Gayle King on CBS This Morning that his work with Epstein was “abhorrent” and was part of what led to their divorce. She said her now ex-husband had several meetings with Epstein.
“I did not like that he had meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, no. I made that clear to him,” Melinda Gates said, adding that she met with Epstein “exactly one time” to see what kind of man Epstein was.
“I regretted it the second I walked in the door. He was abhorrent. He was evil personified. My heart breaks for these women,” Melinda Gates told CBS.

Jobs made three donations to Harris’ campaign worth nearly $1 million in 2023, and Fortune Magazine dubbed her one of Harris’ “biggest bankrollers.”
Deceased billionaire James Simons, a hedge fund manager Epstein once praised as his “sole role model” in philanthropy, donated over $9 million to committees supporting Harris, with $6.6 million going to Future Forward before his death.
Harris has enough issues on her plate as it is. She’s struggling with black men and Hispanics and is trailing Trump in all swing states, according to the RCP average. Republicans are also breaking early voting records, and Democrats are panicking over Harris’ campaign strategy, as they should.

The Daily Caller,"Not To Be Outdone By An Insult Comic, Biden Calls American Voters ‘Garbage’","President Joe Biden referred to former President Donald Trump’s supporters as “garbage” Tuesday in a Zoom call with the organization Voto Latino following comments made at a Trump rally by a comedian.
The comments from the president were in response to those made by comic Tony Hinchcliffe on Sunday while speaking at a Trump rally in Madison Square Garden, where the comedian referred to Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage.” Biden attempted to clarify the comments in an X post Tuesday night after receiving backlash, claiming he was referring to the “rhetoric” put out by the comic and not Trump supporters.
“Donald Trump has no character. He doesn’t give a damn about the Latino community. He’s failed a businessman. He only cares about the billionaire friends he had and accumulated wealth for those at the top,” Biden said in the video.
“And just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a ‘floating island of garbage.’ Well, let me tell you something … I don’t know the Puerto Rican that I know — or a Puerto Rico, where I’m — in my home state of Delaware, they’re good, decent, honorable people. The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American. It’s totally contrary to everything we’ve done, everything we’ve been.”
Here’s the video: pic.twitter.com/7hNp3su8k2
— Gabe Gutierrez (@gabegutierrez) October 30, 2024
Biden addressed the backlash by condemning the rhetoric against Puerto Rico at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally as hateful. He clarified that he believed the alleged divisive language toward Latinos contradicts American values.
“Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage — which is the only word I can think of to describe it. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation,” Biden wrote on X.
In a statement reported by journalist Gabe Gutierrez, the White House further emphasized that Biden was referring to the comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who backs Trump and made disparaging remarks about Puerto Rico. (RELATED: Anti-Trump Journalist Claims Dem ‘Outrage’ Over Trump MSG Rally ‘Misses’ Point, Predicts Most ‘Diverse’ GOP Base Ever)
“There’s a lot going on. I don’t know if you know this, but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it’s called Puerto Rico,” Hinchcliffe said at the rally.
The White House initially released a transcript that showed Biden saying “supporters’,” with a plural possessive apostrophe. Later on, they updated the transcript to read “supporter’s,” implying that Biden wasn’t referring to millions of Americans, but only Hinchcliffe himself. Many on social media, however, weren’t buying it and accused the White House of incorrectly using an apostrophe.

Former Daily Caller reporter and now-CNN host Kaitlan Collins on her show Tuesday night doubted the idea that Biden meant “supporter’s” with an apostrophe.
“The White House is trying to say that what President Biden was saying — they’re putting an apostrophe there in ‘supporters,’ saying it’s the singular, I guess referring to the comedian,” Collins said. “I mean, it’s hard to really look at that when you can listen to it for yourself …”
Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro apparently criticized the attack as well on Collins’ show. “I would never insult the good people of Pennsylvania or any Americans even if they chose to support a candidate that I didn’t support.”

The Daily Caller,Virginia Asks Supreme Court To Let It Remove Noncitizens From Voter Rolls,"Virginia asked the Supreme Court Monday to block a lower court order to return over a thousand alleged noncitizens to the voter rolls.
Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares vowed to file the emergency appeal Sunday after an appeals court upheld a ruling preventing officials from removing roughly 1,600 individuals who the state says “self-identified” as noncitizens.
“The injunction, which prohibits the application of a law that has been on the books since the Justice Department precleared it in 2006, will also irreparably injure Virginia’s sovereignty, confuse her voters, overload her election machinery and administrators, and likely lead noncitizens to think they are permitted to vote, a criminal offence that will cancel the franchise of eligible voters,” the state argued in its petition.
U.S. District Court Judge Patricia Giles, a Biden appointee, issued an order Friday blocking Virginia’s efforts to remove noncitizen voters within 90 days of the election. (RELATED: Biden-Appointed Judge Blocks Virginia Effort To Remove Non-Citizens From Voter Rolls)
The Department of Justice (DOJ) sued Virginia Oct. 12 over Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s executive order to more frequently remove noncitizens.

“The Department of Justice pulled this shameful, politically motivated stunt 25 days before Election Day, challenging a Virginia process signed into law 18 years ago by a Democrat governor and approved by the Department of Justice in 2006,” Miyares said in a statement Friday.
“More concerning is the open practice by the Biden-Harris administration to weaponize the legal system against the enemies of so-called progress,” Miyares said. “That is the definition of lawfare. To openly choose weaponization over good process and lawfare over integrity isn’t democracy: it’s bullying, pure and simple, and I always stand up to bullies.”

The Daily Caller,Bomb Threat Forces Swing State County GOP Headquarters To Close,"The Republican committee headquarters in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, was forced to close its doors on Saturday after staff received a bomb threat by phone, according to a press release.
Pennsylvania’s GOP stated that an “angry” caller made a “profanity-laced bomb threat” to the Montgomery County office around 11:07 a.m. The state GOP noted that this incident isn’t isolated, as the party has experienced an increase in violent threats since September.
“Nothing will stop us from working to elect those who will put our country back on track,” Republican Party of Pennsylvania Chairman Lawrence Tabas wrote.
“And there should be unanimous agreement that political violence has no place in our elections, especially after an innocent Butler County husband and father lost his life to political violence,” Tabas added. “We emphatically urge Pennsylvanians to voice their opinions by voting, not violence and intimidation.”
In early September, an Erie County GOP staffer allegedly received death threats from a state resident, who threatened to kill the worker if they did not respond. (RELATED: ‘It’s Horrible’: Undecided Pennsylvania Voter Panel Unanimously Opposes Harris Calling Trump ‘Fascist’)
“I will KILL YOU IF YOU DON’T ANSWER ME!” “GONNA F***ING FIND YOU AND SKIN YOU ALIVE AND USE YOUR SKIN FOR F***ING TOILET PAPER, YOU F***ING KKK**T!” the test message stated, according to the press release.
Later, on Oct. 10, protestors “forcibly entered” the Delaware County Republican headquarters, reportedly threatening to “kill staff” and refusing to allow them to leave the building, according to the press release. During the incident, two female volunteers told authorities they felt threatened by the four protestors, the Mainline Times & Suburban reported.
“This type of harassment — a descent into threats or intimidation — ought to have no no place in our community,” Republican Party officials told the outlet at the time. “We condemn it in the strongest possible terms, and call on our friends across the aisle to do the same.”
By Oct. 17, an unspecified number of GOP-affiliated individuals received an anonymous letter warning that if former President Donald Trump wins this November, their “property” and family “may be impacted,” the press release reported.
“Should your candidate win…we know where you live, you are in the data base. In the dead of a cold winters night, this year, or next and beyond, there is no knowing what may happen. Your property, your family may be impacted…” the letter stated. “You tread on me at your peril, motherf****r. We look forward to visiting in the future.”
The state’s GOP noted local police departments, Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s Election Integrity Task Force and the FBI have been made aware of the threats.
Shapiro’s office and the FBI did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

The Daily Caller,‘Shut The Hell Up’: Charlamagne Melts Down Over Caller Saying Trump Isn’t ‘Nazi’,"Radio host Charlamagne Tha God on Thursday appeared to lose his temper at a Virginia caller named Mike who asserted former President Donald Trump’s record proves he is not a bigot.
Trump’s former White House chief of staff, John Kelly, told The New York Times and The Atlantic that the former president exhibited “fascist” tendencies and allegedly praised Adolf Hitler, which the Trump campaign has denied. Mike, on “The Breakfast Club,” said Trump’s history of publicly associating with prominent black figures indicates he’s not “racist,” but Charlamagne sharply disagreed, challenging Mike’s logic and trying to dismantle his argument. (RELATED: Harris Fails To Explain Flip-Flops, Says She Has No Regrets About Biden In First Interview)
LISTEN:
“No disrespect to nobody, man. I know everybody in that radio station more than likely gon’ vote Democrat, but it’s just kind of funny, the rhetoric about Trump being a racist,” Mike said. “I mean, I do my Googles, man and I see this man having pictures with all kinds of famous black people that you guys are fans of, especially I see him standing next to Rosa Parks. I mean, for crying out loud people, how can this man be a Nazi, a Hitler? That shit is crazy. No disrespect.”
“So that’s all it takes? So if you take a picture with a gay person, does that make you gay?” Charlamagne asked, to which Mike answered, “Nah.”
The radio host then told the caller to “shut the hell up” and asked, “What are you talking about?”
“No Nazi, no Hitler will ever take a picture with black people, man, will never do any kind of favors to black people,” Mike responded.
“That’s not true,” Charlamagne retorted. “Slave masters used to sleep with slaves. And what? Slave masters would have babies with slaves. And what?”
Mike responded that we’re beyond “slavery times.”
“So let me ask you a question, serious question … You think you don’t encounter no racist white people everyday, you think just because they interact with you and they engage with you, you think that they’re not racist?” Charlamagne asked, with Mike answering, “No.”
The show then hung up on the caller, with Charlamagne saying, “I can’t listen to that.”
Trump currently holds narrow leads over Vice President Kamala Harris in all of the seven top swing states, according to RealClearPolling averages. The caller before Mike on “The Breakfast Club” described Trump as “Hitler Jr.” but told Charlamagne he still wouldn’t be voting for Harris due to his distrust of Democrats.
“I don’t trust the Democrats, bruh. As a black man in America, we done been lied to so long. Promises have never been kept,” he said. “I’ma just keep it a buck. I’m not voting this year … I don’t trust the Democrats, and I damn sure ain’t voting for Hitler Jr. Whatever happens gon’ happen.”
“Well, if you not votin’ and Hitler Jr. wins, then you know you gon’ have to blame yourself,” Charlamagne retorted. “You gon’ have to take some of the blame.”

The Daily Caller,‘Completely Fabricated Persona’: Woman Doug Emhoff Allegedly Slapped Breaks Silence,"An ex-girlfriend who Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff allegedly slapped in a fit of jealousy broke her silence on the matter Thursday.
Emhoff’s ex-girlfriend, who asked the Daily Mail to use the alias “Jane,” confirmed allegations from three friends that Vice President Kamala Harris’ now-husband “slapped [her] so hard [she] spun around” during a celebrity event in 2012.
“What’s frightening for a woman that’s been on the other end of it, is watching this completely fabricated persona being portrayed,” Jane said.

— Daily Mail Online (@MailOnline) October 24, 2024
Jane told the outlet she and Emhoff, whom she started dating in March 2012, took a “fairytale” trip to the amfAR gala dinner south of France on May 24, 2009. A long taxi line outside the Hotel du Cap around 3 a.m. prompted Jane to try to pay a valet $100 to let her and Emhoff skip the line — but she alleged a drunken Emhoff reacted violently when he incorrectly assumed she was flirting with another man.
“As I’m talking to him, Doug got out of the line, comes up, turns me around by my right shoulder. I’m completely caught off guard. I’m not bracing,.I’m in four inch heels, wearing a full-length gown, and it’s between 2-3 a.m.,” Jane said.
“He slaps me so hard I spin around, and I’m in utter shock,” she alleged. “There had been no fight, no argument. It had been a completely fantastic event. I am so furious. The only thing I could think to do was slap him back. I slapped him on one side, and on the other cheek with the other hand.”
“In that moment, his mask had dropped and I saw his dark side,” Emhoff’s ex-girlfriend alleged, later adding that Emhoff said they were “even” the day after.
Jane said Emhoff confided in her in April 2012 that the nanny he had an extramarital affair with and impregnated before his 2009 divorce filing, Najen Naylor, accused him of causing her to miscarry their baby. She said Emhoff’s admission made her rethink their relationship, according to the outlet. (RELATED: From #MeToo To #NotYou: Where Are All The Feminist Celebrities On Emhoff?)

“All I did was ask him one question, and he told me the whole story,” Jane told the Daily Mail. “Without skipping a beat, and staring straight ahead at the road, he tells me he had an affair with his daughter’s teacher and that subsequently she claimed that she was pregnant. He’s telling me this very casually like it’s no big deal.”
Jane told the outlet Emhoff admitted to yelling at Naylor but did not say whether he struck her, according to the outlet. She said Emhoff told her in a matter-of-fact manner that he “got really angry” at his then-pregnant mistress, who threatened a lawsuit over accusations that he caused her miscarriage.
Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) records obtained by the Daily Mail show that police were called to the house where Naylor lived at 8:14 p.m. on June, 28, 2009. The call was deemed a priority level three, a “life threatening emergency, lights and sirens on.”
Emhoff Condemns Toxic Masculinity In 2023
Emhoff’s accuser told the outlet she was initially hesitant on speaking out publicly and has been telling the same story years before the vice president’s husband became famous.
“He’s being held out to be the antithesis of who he actually is. And that is utterly shocking,” she added.

None of the female celebrities supporting Harris have spoken out against Emhoff’s alleged misconduct — a stark departure from 2016’s #MeToo movement.

At least, that’s what it seems like.
Republicans woke up Wednesday morning thinking, “Hey, that Joe Biden character ain’t half bad!”
On Tuesday night, while Harris was set to give her closing arguments for the 2024 election, she was upstaged by Biden, who simultaneously held a virtual meeting with the organization Voto Latino. During the call, Biden called Trump voters “garbage,” sparking a wildfire of backlash. It wasn’t only conservatives who were angry; Democrat Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro also denounced the rhetoric live on CNN. While the White House has attempted to clean up Biden’s statements with claims of a missing apostrophe, the damage has been done.

Biden apparently wants to be a bigger part of Harris’ campaign, but her team is blowing him off, according to Axios. “Harris’ campaign keeps responding: ‘We’ll get back to you,'” three people familiar with the situation told the outlet.
Biden didn’t take the Harris shove-off lying down. He decided to do his own thing, like schedule the get-out-the-vote event he attended Saturday in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
The move to create his own campaign schedule might explain how he ended up calling Trump supporters “garbage” while Harris was giving her closing address in his backyard. This isn’t the first time Biden stole the limelight from the Harris campaign, however.

It just so happened that when Biden walked into the room, Harris was set to speak at an event in Michigan, promoting the end of the longshoreman strike to Michigan union workers. What would have been a slam dunk for the Harris campaign became a nothing burger. Hardly anyone in America knew she was there or connected her with ending the strike.
“We were about to actually go live with Vice President Kamala Harris, who is speaking right now in Detroit, Michigan. And apparently, she is talking about this port strike ending,” CNN host Boris Sanchez lamented on air. “She’s trying to appeal to union workers, and yet you have the President of the United States come out, clearly overshadowing her answering significant questions.

Commentary Magazine editor and New York Post columnist John Podhoretz mused that it’s almost like Biden might be mad at her for taking his spot in the presidential race.
“What is going on between Biden and Harris? He has a press conference at the same moment she’s on The View. Her campaign is complaining about DeSantis and he’s praising DeSantis,” Podhoretz said. “Why, it’s almost like she staged a coup against him and he is working against her from the sidelines!”

But don’t worry.

‘We are in close touch with the campaign to determine when, where and how the president can be helpful,” Bates told Axios.

The Daily Caller,New Poll Spells Major Trouble For Harris With Unlikely Demographic,"Former President Donald Trump is maintaining a small lead over Vice President Kamala Harris among an unlikely demographic as her campaign reportedly worries about her chances in key swing states, according to a new Arab News/YouGov poll obtained by Semafor.
In a new Arab News/YouGov poll, 45% of Arab American voters said they are more likely to vote for Trump, compared to 43% who said they will likely vote for Harris. More Arab Americans, 39%, think Trump will “successfully resolve the Israel-Palestine conflict,” compared to Harris who has 33% of the community’s support on this question, the poll shows. Two weeks before the election, the Harris campaign is worried about the vice president’s chances in the “blue wall,” such as Michigan, where the Muslim community is prominent, three sources with knowledge of the campaign’s strategy told NBC News. (Stream Daily Caller’s latest documentary ‘Cleaning Up Kamala’ HERE)
“There has been a thought that maybe Michigan or Wisconsin will fall off,” a senior Harris campaign official told NBC News, emphasizing that there are real concerns over her path to victory if Michigan goes for Trump while Wisconsin and Pennsylvania stay blue.
Of likely Arab American voters, 4% of respondents said they would cast their vote for third-party candidate Jill Stein and 6% said they were still undecided, according to the poll. Arab News/YouGov surveyed 500 Arab Americans nationally between Sept. 26 and Oct. 1 2024 and the poll has a margin of error of 5.93%.

Muslim Americans in Michigan are making an effort to flip the state for Trump in protest of the Biden-Harris administration’s Middle East policy. One activist organization, Drive for 75, has calculated that if 75% of its community can turn out to the polls then the vice president has a 99.9% chance of losing, Rex Nazarko, who is heading up the effort, previously told the Daily Caller. (RELATED: ‘We’re Desperate’: Socialists, Muslims Band Together To Deny Harris The White House)
“What was a guarantee for [a Harris loss] to happen? We tried with different percentages and different turnouts, and with the 75% number, again, accounting only for the Muslim community, not other communities, not other allies, not other progressives. It essentially guaranteed a 99.9% likelihood of the vice president losing the election in Michigan, if 75% of [the community turned out],” Nazarko told the Caller, explaining that they ran numerous mathematical simulations to inform their strategy.
“We ran that simulation 10,000 times, and almost every time that was the case. So that’s how we got the Drive for 75 call to action and idea,” he explained.
As a part of the effort to flip the state, Muslim activist organizations are pushing their community to vote for Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein, or even Trump, they told the Daily Caller. Abandon Harris, one of those groups trying to spoil Harris’ election chances, threw its support behind Stein, who also has the backing of some socialist groups in the U.S. due to her anti-capitalist economic positioning.
“We need to be clear about what our goals are, we are not in a position to win the White House. But we do have a real opportunity to win something historic. We could deny Kamala Harris the state of Michigan,” Kshama Sawant, a former Seattle City Council Member and self-described socialist, said to cheers at a recent rally for Stein.
A Harris campaign spokesperson denied NBC News’ report that there were concerns over their ability to win Michigan.
“We absolutely are competing to win Michigan,” Harris campaign spokeswoman Lauren Hitt told NBC News, pointing to the vice president’s recent stops in the state. “We think we will win Michigan.”
The vice president has recently campaigned across key swing states including Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin alongside former Republican Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney.
Alongside Cheney, her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney previously endorsed Harris, though the endorsement might not have the positive effect the campaign is hoping to have, one Michigander told the Caller.
“Here’s the new thing going around, people are saying that, ‘hello, she’s been endorsed by Dick Cheney.’ That tells you everything you need to know about this woman: that her intentions are war,” Vice chair of the 12th Congressional District Republican Committee Stephanie Butler, who is married to a Muslim, told the Caller.

Trump took to TruthSocial Monday to give a message to Arab and Muslim American voters ahead of the election on Harris’ Middle East policy.
“Arab Voters are very upset that Comrade Kamala Harris, the Worst Vice President in the History of the United States and a Low IQ individual, is campaigning with ‘dumb as a rock’ War Hawk, Liz Cheney, who, like her father, the man that pushed Bush to ridiculously go to War in the Middle East, also wants to go to War with every Muslim Country known to mankind,” Trump wrote.
“If Kamala gets four more years, the Middle East will spend the next four decades going up in flames, and your kids will be going off to war, maybe even a Third World War, something that will never happen with President Donald J. Trump in charge. For our country’s sake, and for your kids, Vote Trump for PEACE!” the former president wrote.",2024-10-22
The Daily Caller,DOJ Sends Musk’s PAC Warning Over $1 Million Voter Lottery,"The Justice Department(DOJ) reportedly notified Elon Musk’s America PAC that its $1 million sweepstakes for registered voters in key swing states might contravene federal regulations, according to The Wall Street Journal.
These payments might breach laws against compensating people to register or vote in elections involving federal candidates, according to the DOJ’s letter, WSJ reported. Musk’s political action committee has been actively promoting the chance to win $1 million for registered voters in Pennsylvania and six other pivotal states who pledge their support for free speech and gun rights by signing a petition.
The America Pac declined to comment but a spokesperson earlier claimed their cash awards were entirely legal, suggesting that the outcry from media only aids their cause. “The PAC is confident in the legality of this initiative and the predictable media meltdown is only helping America PAC’s efforts to support President Trump,” a representative said earlier this week, WSJ stated.

Three voters from Pennsylvania and one in North Carolina have secured million-dollar rewards, with daily drawings set to continue through Election Day, targeting both new and existing registrants, WSJ reported. Musk stated that the million-dollar rewards from his PAC come without conditions, except for the expectation that winners advocate for his petition.
The sweepstakes aims to boost voter registrations in battleground areas as he fervently supports former President Donald Trump’s re-election bid. Musk announced at a Pennsylvania rally for Trump’s campaign Saturday evening that he will give $1 million daily to one individual.

UCLA law professor Rick Hasen previously raised a question about whether a constitutional amendment is necessary to curb the campaign influence of ultra-wealthy individuals like Musk. Hasen pointed out on MSNBC that under current law, efforts to curb election spending by the ultra-rich have been deemed unconstitutional, affirming the legality of Musk’s activities with his super PAC and other ventures.
The Justice Department and America PAC did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

The Daily Caller,"Colorado Secretary Of State Website Posts ‘Partial Passwords’ To Voting Systems, Assures Public ‘No Security Breach’","Democratic Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold admitted Tuesday that “partial passwords” to state voting systems were posted on her office’s website for months before being taken down and appeared to downplay election integrity concerns.
A file available for download was posted on the Secretary of State website, the Colorado Republican Party said, citing an affidavit. This file allegedly contained a list BIOS passwords for more than 700 voting components in 63 out of Colorado’s 64 counties. An unidentified official quietly removed the file on Oct. 24, the party claimed.
Griswold denied the allegations of the Colorado GOP in a Tuesday interview with 9News, saying that the leaked passwords were only “partial passwords.”
“This is not a security threat,” Griswold said. When asked how many counties were impacted, Griswold would not answer.
“At this point, Kyle, we have staff in the field looking at the situation, but we will disclose when we are out of the field,” Griswold said. “To be clear, we do not see this as a full security threat to the state.”
Griswold did admit that the passwords were published on her office’s website and “were up for several months” before being taken down. She also claimed some of the passwords were not “active.” The secretary maintained that an investigation was underway with federal assistance. (RELATED: Pro-Palestine Messages Reportedly Found On Devices At Ballot Box Fires)
Colorado GOP Chairman Dave Williams sent a letter to Griswold’s office on Oct. 29 demanding immediate action. He also contradicted Griswold’s characterization that the leaks were not a security threat.
“As you are well aware, a BIOS password could allow a knowledgeable user to not only gain total control over any system accessed either physically or remotely, including the ability to manipulate those systems and results, but it would allow that user to remove any trace that she was ever there (overwriting even fundamental system logs necessary during a subsequent audit to show whether illicit access or activity had ever occurred),” Williams wrote.
He also requested verification that the passwords in question had been replaced.
Heidi Ganahl, former Republican gubernatorial candidate in Colorado, pointed out that Griswold’s office has previously classified the leakage of BIOS passwords as a “serious breach.”
If Mesa in 2021 was a “serious breach,” NOT during an election, what is 600+ DURING an election? (1/3)@JenaGriswold said “The public disclosure of the BIOS passwords for one or more components of Mesa County’s voting system alone constitutes a serious breach… pic.twitter.com/SdyUyY82mm
— Heidi Ganahl (@heidiganahl) October 29, 2024
“The public disclosure of BIOS passwords for one or more components of Mesa County’s voting system alone constitutes a serious breach of voting system security protocols, as well as a violation of Election Rule 20.6.1,” Griswold’s office said in a 2021 press release.
Tina Peters, a former election clerk from Mesa County, was sentenced to prison earlier this month for allowing unauthorized access to voting equipment, according to The Associated Press (AP). In that case, Griswold touted the case as representing Colorado’s approach to election security.
“Colorado’s elections are the nation’s gold standard. I am proud of how we have responded to the first insider elections breach in the nation and look forward to another secure and successful election in November,” Griswold said in a statement following the sentencing.

The Daily Caller,NEW WSJ POLL: TRUMP TAKES LEAD NATIONALLY,"Former President Donald Trump has taken a narrow lead over Vice President Kamala Harris with less than two weeks until election day, according to a Wall Street Journal poll published Thursday.
Trump has pulled out in front with a 47-45 lead, a change from the Journal’s polling in August, which had Kamala ahead by two percentage points. The two percentage points are within the poll’s margin of error.
Harris’s favorability and job performance numbers have dropped since August while Trump’s job performance numbers has risen. In August, half of voters viewed her favorably. Now, as of late October, 45 percent view her favorably compared to 53 who view her unfavorably, according to the poll.
Harris is also seeing her worst job performance ratings as vice president since WSJ started asking voters about her performance. Fifty-four percent of voters disapprove of her performance compared to 42 percent who approve.
Exclusive: Trump has taken a narrow lead against Harris in the final weeks of the presidential race https://t.co/fUBlHlSvDb
— The Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) October 24, 2024
Ad blitzes and “the performance of the candidates” have contributed to the shift, the outlet reported.
“Voters are finally getting to know her,” Republican pollster David Lee, who ran the poll with Democrat Michael Bocian, told the WSJ. (RELATED: Wall Street Billionaires Are Starting To Bet On A Trump Win)
“The definitional period is coming to an end, and more people are unhappy with what they have learned about her than what they know about President Trump,” Lee said.
Issues that voters appear to trust Trump over Harris on include the economy and immigration. Voters approve of Trump over Harris on the economy by 12 points compared to 8 in August, according to the poll. On immigration, they trust him by 15 points, a leap from the 7-point lead he had over Harris in August.
The Journal’s poll results match other recent polls. While Real Clear Politics’ (RCP) national polling average still has Harris ahead by a hair – 0.2 percent – the four most recent polls all have Trump ahead by at least a two percent margin.
CNBC and Forbes/HarrisX, which polled likely voters as opposed to the registered voters that CNBC and WSJ polled, both have Trump ahead by two percent nationally.
Rasmussen’s Wednesday poll has Trump up by three percent.
While RCP’s average has Trump slightly behind nationally, he’s ahead in every key battleground. Overall in the swing states he’s up 0.9 percent. In Georgia he’s ahead by 2.2 points. In Wisconsin and Michigan he’s edging Harris by 0.2 percent.
Trump is also dominating in the betting markets. He has a 59 percent chance of winning versus Harris’ 40.1 percent chance, according to the RCP betting average.
Polymarket, the world’s largest prediction market, has Trump’s odds at 61.1 percent.
The shift is a far cry from early August, when Harris jumped out to a significant lead over Trump by most indicators. Harris’ current 0.2 percent lead in the RCP average is her lowest leading margin since she jumped ahead of Trump on Aug. 5.",2024-10-24
The Daily Caller,Scott Jennings Doesn’t Buy It When CNN Panelist Spins Biden Calling Trump Supporters ‘Garbage’,"Republican strategist Scott Jennings called out film executive Franklin Leonard Tuesday night after Leonard attempted to explain President Joe Biden’s comments characterizing supporters of former President Donald Trump as “garbage.”
Biden labeled the former president’s supporters during a virtual campaign event Tuesday in response to a joke stand-up comedian Tony Hinchcliffe told during Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden Sunday. Leonard cited Biden’s history of stuttering and claimed it was “very obvious” that Biden wasn’t stereotyping all of Trump’s supporters during an episode of “CNN NewsNight,” prompting Jennings to respond. (RELATED: ‘It’s Helpful If You’ll Answer The Question’: Harris Faulkner Chides Dem Guest For Spinning When Asked About Kamala Harris Comparing Trump To Hitler)
WATCH:
“Let me just accept the most charitable framing of this, which you just gave me,” Jennings responded. “Why is he sitting in front of a laptop at the exact same moment Kamala Harris is out on his backyard trying to give the closing argument to her campaign? What in the world is he doing?”
“I don’t accept your framing of it, personally, because I actually do believe he, Harris, the Democratic Party and most of their campaign do believe that half the country is garbage,” Jennings continued.
Biden’s comments came as Vice President Kamala Harris has escalated attacks on Trump in the closing weeks of the presidential campaign, devoting a major speech Tuesday to attacking the former president as a threat to democracy and portraying him as “unstable” days after she labeled the former president a “fascist” during an Oct. 23 town hall on CNN.
“Well, let me tell you something … I don’t know the Puerto Rican that I know — or a Puerto Rico, where I’m — in my home state of Delaware, they’re good, decent, honorable people,” Biden said. “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.”
CNN banned conservative commentator Ryan Girdusky after he jokingly referenced an Israeli operation that targeted the radical Islamic terrorist group Hezbollah after former MSNBC host Mehdi Hasan defended describing Trump supporters as Nazis during a fiery exchange.
“They’ve also said people who go to Trump rallies are Nazis and so it’s pretty apparent the disdain with which they hold half of the country in,” Jennings concluded.

The Daily Caller,"‘Trump Is The Only Candidate’: Hundreds Of Former Nat Sec Officials Endorse Trump, Say Harris Dismantled Border","More than 200 retired Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials signed onto an open letter endorsing former President Donald Trump, arguing he’s the only candidate who will enforce border security.
The Biden-Harris administration enacted policies that “systematically dismantled” a border enforcement apparatus that prevented crime at the U.S.-Mexico border and across the country, according to numerous retired Border Patrol, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other DHS officials who have spent a career in the field. Signatories to the letter included retired Border Patrol chief Rodney Scott and former ICE chief Tom Homan, among many others. (RELATED: ‘Something Has To Be Done’: Trump Pledges Compensation Fund For Victims Of Migrant Crime)
These border enforcement professionals laid out their case as to why they believe the border crisis got so incredibly bad during the current administration, and how things were different in the previous administration.
“President Trump respected the experience of career border security professionals and listened to our advice,” the letter stated. “When border security experts explained to President Trump how illegal immigration empowers the cartels to control who and what enters our home, he listened and acted.”
“The Trump administration supported policies and programs that reduced illegal immigration, instilled integrity into our legal immigration system and ensured that the U.S. government was doing all we could to control who and what entered our homeland. The borders of the U.S. were never more secure than they were during the Trump administration,” the letter continues.
Upon entering office, the Biden-Harris administration undertook 296 executive actions on immigration, with 89 of those orders specifically reversing or beginning the process of undoing Trump’s immigration policies. The administration went on to undo a number of major Trump initiatives concerning border security, such as ending border wall construction and shutting down the Remain in Mexico program.
What followed was a historic flow of illegal immigration through the U.S.-Mexico border. The number of illegal border crossings in fiscal year 2024 were the second worst in U.S. history — only surpassed by fiscal year 2023, according to data tracked by Customs and Border Protection (CBP).
Scott, who led Border Patrol from February 2020 to August 2021, previously told the Daily Caller News Foundation that the Biden administration tightly cracked down on him and his colleagues from speaking out about the border crisis.
Since taking over the re-election mantle from President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris has attempted to rebrand herself as more of a border hawk, with her campaign boasting ads that feature the border wall and a pledge to hire more Border Patrol agents if she wins in November.
Trump’s support from border security professionals isn’t limited to those who have since retired from service. Earlier in October, the Border Patrol union formally endorsed the Republican candidate, with the president of the National Border Patrol Council saying that a victory for Harris would mean “every city, every community in this great country, is going to go to hell.”
The letter brought forward by the retired border professionals echoed similar sentiments.
[U]nder VP Harris’ watch, idealist political appointees with zero border security experience were empowered to implement disastrous and deadly border security policy for the United States,” the letter states. “The devastating results have handed complete control of our border to the cartels, provided them with astronomical record profits, ballooned legal immigration backlogs, and have left millions of illegal aliens in the country.”
“Assuming you care about border security as much as we do, the choice is clear. President Trump is the only candidate that we can trust to secure our nation’s borders,” the letter concluded.
Neither the Trump campaign nor the Harris campaign immediately responded to a request for comment from the DCNF.

The Daily Caller,New York Voter Delivers Two-Word Response When MSNBC Asks If ‘Threat To Democracy’ Attack On Trump Resonates,"A voter in New York needed only two words Monday when an MSNBC reporter asked if Vice President Kamala Harris’ attacks on former President Donald Trump as a “threat to democracy” resonated with him.
Harris and her running mate, Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, have escalated attacks on former President Donald Trump, with Harris labeling him a “fascist” during a CNN town hall and Walz comparing Trump’s Sunday rally at Madison Square Garden to a 1939 rally at the iconic venue held by the Nazi-sympathetic German American Bund. The voter took a few seconds to think before answering the unidentified MSNBC reporter’s question. (RELATED: ‘It’s Helpful If You’ll Answer The Question’: Harris Faulkner Chides Dem Guest For Spinning When Asked About Kamala Harris Comparing Trump To Hitler)
“How does that message resonate with you?” the reporter asked.
WATCH:
“It doesn’t,” the voter responded.
Harris trails Trump by 0.1% in the RealClearPolling average of polls from Oct. 11 to 26, with the former president maintaining that lead when Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein, independent candidate Cornel West and Libertarian candidate Chase Oliver are included in surveys.
“Why not?” the MSNBC reporter asked.
“Because it feels political to me, it feels like a line that is being used,” the voter explained.
Inflation, the cost of living and the economy were viewed as either a top issue or “very important” by over 80% of respondents to a CNBC poll conducted Oct. 15-19 that showed Trump leading Harris by 2%.
Republicans in the past have criticized Democrats over their portrayal of Trump as a “threat” to democracy, citing previous assassination attempts during the 2024 campaign.
A Secret Service agent thwarted a suspected assassination attempt on Trump in September by firing shots at Ryan Wesley Routh, who was allegedly lurking near Trump International Golf Club. The former president was shot in the right ear while giving a speech at a July 13 campaign rally in Pennsylvania, where a rally attendee was killed and two others wounded.

The Daily Caller,‘We Had A Bad Experience’: Chinese Officials Losing Sleep Over Thought Of Dealing With Second Trump Term,"Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials quietly believe that a second Donald Trump presidency would be more dangerous to them than a Kamala Harris administration, The Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday.
The Biden-Harris administration’s relationship with Beijing has been marred with tensions in recent years over diplomatic, economic and national security disputes. But Chinese officials would seemingly still rather have Harris win in November over Trump because they worry that the former president will open up another trade war against China, officials told the WSJ. (RELATED: Biden Gets Ready To Exit Political Stage As Global Fires Rage — November’s Victor Will Have To Put Them Out)
“Chinese officials and scholars, in private conversations over many months, are largely exceptionally wary of a Trump victory,” Richard McGregor, China expert at the Lowy Institute in Sydney, told the WSJ.
Those worries are largely kept quiet. Publicly, Chinese officials maintain a stance of neutrality toward the U.S. elections. Chinese President Xi Jinping wrote in a letter last week that China had always handled relations with the U.S. with “mutual respect” and said that Beijing “is willing to work with the United States as partners and friends.”
“The presidential elections are the United States’ own affairs,” a spokesman from the Chinese Embassy in the U.S. told the Daily Caller News Foundation. “We hope that whoever gets elected will be committed to growing sound and stable China-U.S. ties.”
Beijing wants whoever the next president is to take a predictable stance toward relations and dial back the U.S.’ tough-on-China stance. Privately, officials felt that standard was better reflected in President Joe Biden over Trump and thought his reelection would be better for China, according to the WSJ.
After Biden dropped out of the race in July, Beijing felt the same about Harris, officials told the WSJ.
“Under Trump, we had a bad experience,” senior CCP diplomat Liu Jianchao bemoaned during a closed-door session with U.S. think tanks earlier in the year.
The concerns of a second Trump term among Chinese officials stem from fears he will launch a second trade war against China, as he did in his first term, according to the WSJ.
Trump issued a sweeping set of tariffs against China during his first term — adding a tax to imports coming in from the country — in a bid to encourage domestic U.S. investment and compel China to buy more American goods.
Xi and those and his orbit became exhausted in trying to maneuver the trade war and Trump’s demands, according to the WSJ. Trump has weighed the idea in his second term to issue a 60% tariff against incoming Chinese goods, which economists at UBS have predicted could mark a 2.5% blow to China’s GDP growth over a year-long period.
Trump has also recently weighed the idea of using the threat of tariffs to deter China from invading Taiwan, even musing that he would completely halt trade relations if the island is taken by force, which has been received extremely poorly in Beijing.
“I would say: If you go into Taiwan, I’m sorry to do this, I’m going to tax you”—meaning impose tariffs—“at 150% to 200%,” Trump told the WSJ in an interview on Thursday.
The Trump and Harris campaigns did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Daily Caller,Kari Lake Receives Good News In Her Bid To Add GOP Seat To Senate: POLL,"A Tuesday Data Orbital poll showed Arizona Senate Republican candidate Kari Lake pulling ahead of Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, breaking with recent data showing Lake trailing by a significant margin.
The Data Orbital survey, which consisted of responses from 550 likely voters and had a margin of error of 4.26%, found Lake receiving 45.2% support while Gallego received 44.5%, potentially representing a huge shift in the swing state race that has seen the Democratic candidate maintain a steady lead. However, the poll result could also be an outlier, with a Tuesday CNN survey of 781 likely voters finding Lake trailing by roughly 8%, and RealClear Polling (RCP) showing Gallego leading by 4% on average. (RELATED: Ted Cruz Pulls In Front Of Dem Challenger In Competitive Senate Race: POLL)
Lake has consistently underperformed former President Donald Trump, with Trump leading Vice President Kamala Harris by an average of 2.5% in the Grand Canyon State, according to RCP. The Democrats have spent $88.2 million on advertising for the Senate race since Labor Day, compared to just $29.7 million for Republicans, Politico reported on Oct. 18.

— Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) October 6, 2023
Lake’s platform emphasizes border security, fresh water access, energy independence and reducing inflation, among a variety of other policy initiatives.
Immigration has been a hot-button issue in the Arizona senate rate, with Gallego adopting a more centrist stance on the matter since his campaign began. In August 2023, the Democratic congressman voiced support for Title 42, a Trump-era public health order that expelled certain migrants, marking a major shift from 2015 when he introduced legislation that would eliminate the term “illegal alien” from federal law.
The Democratic congressman has tried to distance himself from the Biden-Harris administration on the immigration issue, remarking in August that the White House hasn’t done enough in support of border security.
“I think there’s a lot of Democrats that don’t understand you can be for border security and for immigration reform,” Gallego told Axios.
Another key issue in the Arizona senate race has been abortion, particularly after the Arizona Supreme Court on April 9 permitted an 1864 law to be enforced that effectively banned abortion except when the life of the mother is in danger. When Gallego stated that Lake was “incredibly thrilled” to ban abortion, Lake responded by noting the Democratic congressman had left his wife when she was nine months pregnant.
A report released by the Washington Free Beacon on Oct. 17 found that Gallego not only filed for divorce from his wife when she was “likely to give birth any day,” but also wanted her to pay his attorney’s fees.
The Gallego and Lake campaigns did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The Daily Caller,Pro-Palestine Messages Reportedly Found On Devices At Ballot Box Fires,"Devices recovered at two ballot box fires in the Pacific Northwest reportedly both contained pro-Palestinian messaging, according to The New York Times.
The words “Free Gaza,” were emblazoned on the devices that presumably caused the fires Monday in Portland, Oregon, and Vancouver, Washington, an anonymous source within the Portland Police Department (PPD) told The New York Times. The Portland Police Department (PPD) confirmed that the incidents are connected, but have yet to determine the motive. (RELATED: Dem Gov’s Nonprofit Pours Million Into Abortion Ballot Initiatives Across Multiple States)
“There was enough evidence collected at all three scenes that lead us to believe that all three incidents are connected, and we cannot get into more detail,” Mike Benner, spokesman for the Portland Police Bureau, said on Monday according to The New York Times.
There was a third device that did not explode at another ballot box in Vancouver, according to The New York Times. All three devices were sent to the terrorist explosive device analytical center in Huntsville, Alabama, another PPD source told The New York Times.
After the October 7th attacks by Hamas against Israel, protests erupted in the United States demanding a ceasefire in the region and humanitarian support for people in Gaza. Some of the protests resulted in violence.

In Portland, most of the ballots were undamaged due to the on-board fire suppression system, according to The New York Times. In Vancouver, hundreds of ballots were destroyed in the blaze.
While Washington and Oregon are not considered competitive states in the presidential election, Portland is electing a new mayor and a congressional race between Democrat Marie Perez and Republican Joe Kent in southwest Washington is extremely competitive, according to FiveThirtyEight polling averages.
Last election, Perez beat Kent by only 3,000 votes, according to The New York Times in August.
People who brought their ballot to the box were asked to request replacements, according to The New York Times. Clark County, which contains Vancouver in its boundaries, will place observers at 22 ballot boxes for 24 hours a day for protection.
Benner told the Daily Caller News Foundation that the device in Portland was recovered for forensic analysis and will be “examined for any unique writings or markings.”

The Daily Caller,‘You’ve Lied To Us’: Chris Sununu Blasts Kamala Harris For ‘Absolutely Condescending’ Campaign,"Republican Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire accused Vice President Kamala Harris of lying to the American people for three and a half years about the economy as part of an “absolutely condescending” campaign Tuesday.
The Biden-Harris administration has been heavily criticized for sky-high inflation that has led prices to rise by over 20%, with the consumer price index (CPI) reaching a recent high of 9% in June 2022. Sununu said to host Kate Bolduan on “CNN News Central” that Harris’ “condescending” campaign was pushing voters to former President Donald Trump. (RELATED: ‘She Should’ve Been There’: CNN Guest Says Kamala Harris ‘Blew It’ By Skipping Al Smith Dinner)
“People are tired of wokeism. They’re tired of being told that Biden and ‘Bidenomics’ work,” Sununu said. “They’re tired of these lies out of Washington that in these ads and all this talk that basically says, hey, your lived experience isn’t real, don’t worry, you haven’t trouble paying the bills? No, no, we told you ‘Bidenomics’ worked for you.”
WATCH:
“It’s absolutely condescending for the Harris campaign to keep pushing that kind of message. And that’s exactly why you’re seeing those independents that you guys were just talking about. That’s why you’re seeing that swing,” Sununu continued. “It’s not, but just you’re too liberal, it’s that you‘ve lied to us for three-and-a-half years, you’ve gaslighted us telling us that our lived experiences aren’t real.”
Biden’s approval rating on the economy was only 39.8% in the RealClearPolling average, while only 36% gave him good marks on inflation and only 34.8% approved of his handling of immigration, all of which have been issues emphasized by former President Donald Trump in the campaign.
“So again, with all due respect to those two, they clearly have some personality issues with the former president. Don’t blame them for that,” Sununu said regarding former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. “A lot of people do, get in line, take a ticket on that one. But at the end of the day, I think this is where the election is going to go in the next two weeks.”
Trump trails Harris by 1.1% in the RealClearPolling average of polls from Oct. 8 to 22, with the gap decreasing to 1.0% when Green Party candidate Dr. Jill Stein, independent candidate Cornel West and Libertarian candidate Chase Oliver are included in surveys.

The Daily Caller,Army Releases Heavily Redacted Report On Arlington Cemetery Altercation,"The Department of Defense (DOD) and Army released a report Friday disclosing the details of an altercation that occurred during former President Donald Trump’s August visit to Arlington National Cemetery.
Trump honored the 13 American service members killed during President Joe Biden’s August 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal on the three-year anniversary of the incident at a ceremony that later became controversial when reports surfaced that a physical altercation had occurred between a campaign official and an Arlington National Cemetery staffer over photo restrictions. The agency released the report in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request from American Oversight but details a multitude of exemptions to the request including laws protecting inter- and intra-agency communications and records pertaining to an ongoing investigation, leaving the report heavily redacted.
The report labeled the event a “simple assault” and said an action occurred with “both of [redacted] hands while attempting to move past” but that no medical attention was necessary following the incident. The documents contain a sworn affidavit taken at the time of the altercation but is entirely redacted, including the name of who gave the statement.
The individual involved chose not to press charges following the incident, the report says.
The incident occurred after a cemetery staff member attempted to enforce a rule prohibiting political activity and “was abruptly pushed aside” by a Trump campaign official, according to NPR.
“Participants in the August 26th ceremony and the subsequent Section 60 visit were made aware of federal laws, Army regulations and DoD policies, which clearly prohibit political activities on cemetery grounds,” the Army said in a statement after the incident, according to NPR. “An ANC employee who attempted to ensure adherence to these rules was abruptly pushed aside. Consistent with the decorum expected at ANC, this employee acted with professionalism and avoided further disruption. The incident was reported to the JBM-HH police department, but the employee subsequently decided not to press charges. Therefore, the Army considers this matter closed.”
Vice President Kamala Harris criticized Trump over the event, stating that the former president did not honor service members — a claim which several Gold Star families quickly rebuked by placing blame instead on Harris for her apparent lack of acknowledgment of the incident that killed the soldiers. The families requested Trump attend the event and take photos with them, Trump stated in a Truth Social post, and the families later confirmed to the Daily Caller.

The Daily Caller,"Gun Range Organizer Says Reporter Got Shot Because He And Kunce ‘Didn’t Listen’ To Safety Advice, Messages Show","The man who set up the gun range for Democratic Missouri Senate candidate Lucas Kunce’s event, where a bullet ricocheted off a target and struck a reporter, appeared to claim that Kunce and the reporter ignored safety advice, according to messages in a private Facebook group reviewed by the Daily Caller.
Chad Everett Downs, the man who claims to have set up the gun range and who has told reporters he lives across the street from the range, commented on a story about the incident in a Facebook group. He said he was there and that Kunce and the reporter did not listen when they were told where they should stand while shooting. Downs, who may not be allowed to own a firearm due to felony charges, then said that it was perfectly normal to get hit with fragments while shooting steel.
Missouri court records show that Downs was charged with 17 counts of felony perjury in August and has been issued a criminal summons and waived his preliminary hearing, according to the Kansas City Star. “His ex-wife in a court filing earlier this month alleged the man owns or has access to guns in violation of his bond conditions,” the outlet states.
After a user asked if Downs was the person in a picture with Cunce and a KSHB reporter, Downs replied by saying, “Yeah. Those dudes were told where to stand. They didn’t listen.” Downs said when you shoot steel, “you always get frag. I’ve been hit probably 250 times.”
He then started arguing with another member of the Facebook group, saying: “so behind the firing line is bad?? Yeah your training sounds pretty intense. You’re basically a Navy Seal.” (RELATED: ‘Could’ve Killed Someone’: Conservatives Blast Dem Candidate For Gun Photo-Op That Injured Reporter With Shrapnel)
“I just gave them a place to shoot. Told them what I thought, then they did what they wanted to,” Downs said. “Do you know someone who’s been killed by a small fragment??” (RELATED: Stray Bullet Strikes TV Reporter At Democratic Senate Campaign Event)
“[Y]our range your responsibility. That is the lamest cop out l’ve ever seen in my life,” one of the Facebook users replied to him.

DAILY CALLER OBTAINED — Co… by Henry Rodgers
Kunce’s campaign has said, “Safety is important to us, which is why the range was set up and run by a NRA Training Counselor.” Downs’ Facebook account says he is a “NRA training counselor.”
The Daily Caller contacted Downs to try to interview him about the incident and his comments, to which he said he would give an interview “for $5,000 if you want to know what really happened.”
Downs also told the Caller: “I made a video of the range with exact distances and where everyone was standing.” He would not share the video with the Caller, however.",2024-10-28
The Daily Caller,California Dems In Tight House Races Back Tough-On-Crime Ballot Measure That Newsom Opposes,"California Democrats in tight House races are backing a crime ballot measure despite Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom strongly opposing the initiative, according to the Los Angeles Times Thursday.
Although Newsom fiercely opposes Proposition 36, which increases penalties for retail and drug crimes, many Democrats in tight House races have thrown their support behind the measure, according to the L.A. Times. Proposition 36 is popular with the majority of Californians, with 73% of voters supporting the measure, according to a Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC) poll conducted Oct. 7 to Oct. 15.
Newsom said the measure would cause “mass incarceration” and that it was an “insult,” according to the San Francisco Chronicle. However, he also said that he does not have the “bandwidth” to actively campaign against the measure, according to the Sacramento Bee Sept. 20.
“I would think that a Republican opponent would love it if a Democratic candidate opposed Prop. 36 because it would make it very easy for them to paint them as soft on crime,” Jared Sichel, political strategist for Republican, conservative and independent candidates in Orange County told the Los Angeles Times. “If you are a Democrat that is opposed to Prop. 36, that will hurt you in November.” (RELATED: California Keeps Driving Up Gas Prices With ‘Layers And Layers’ Of Green Rules And Regs)
Democratic House candidates who support Proposition 36 include Adam Gray in the 13th Congressional district, Will Rollins in the 41st district, Derek Tran in the 46th district, Rudy Salas in the 22nd district and Joe Kerr in the 40th district, according to the L.A. Times. Most of the races take place in districts with a “healthy mix of Republicans and Democrats,” Sichel told the L.A. Times.
For example, the 13th district race between Gray and Republican Scott Baugh is within 3 points, according to a WPA Intelligence poll published Oct. 20. The race for the 22nd district between Salas and Republican incumbent David Valadao is currently tied, according to a September Emerson College poll.
Proposition 36 comes in the wake of discontent with the results of the 2014 Proposition 47, which downgraded the penalties for drug possession and theft under $950 from felonies to misdemeanors. The incarceration rate fell 8% the two years after Proposition 47 passed, according to a September PPIC study.
Crime has been a persistent issue in the state, with overall crime up 1.7% in 2023 and up 15.4% since 2019, according to the PPIC. Out of all property crimes reported in 2023, 63% were larceny theft, 15% were burglaries and 22% were auto thefts.
The homeless population in California grew from 118,552 in 2013 to 181,399 in 2023. The number of camps in San Francisco reached its highest point since 2020 of 523 sites recorded in September 2023.
Proposition 36 would largely roll back Proposition 47’s reforms, upgrading drug possession and theft under $950 to felonies. It would also increase jail time for repeat retail theft, and make the possession of fentanyl a felony.
“I fear I can’t do everything. I’ve got, trying to get Kamala Harris elected President of the United States, trying to get through these 900 bills,” Newsom said in a Sept. 19 press conference according to the Bee. “I just pray, I really do, that people take a good look at Proposition 36.”
Newsom’s office did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

The Daily Caller,From #MeToo To #NotYou: Where Are All The Feminist Celebrities On Emhoff?,"None of the female celebrities who have endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris have voiced concerns about her husband, Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff, who allegedly has a history of misconduct against women.
Emhoff admitted in August to cheating on his first wife in 2009 with his daughter’s nanny, whom he allegedly impregnated, according to the Daily Mail. Once back on the dating scene, Emhoff, the “Dad-in-Chief,” allegedly slapped his then-girlfriend in a booze-fueled fit of jealous rage in 2012, three friends familiar with the alleged situation told the outlet.
Celebrities like Ariana Grande, Julia Roberts and Billie Eilish have made no mention of the allegations, yet have expressed their support of Harris. Oprah Winfrey also ignored the alleged situation, but has hosted a pro-Harris town hall alongside Jennifer Lopez and Meryl Streep.

Megastar Taylor Swift also endorsed the vice president via Instagram in September, citing abortion rights as one of her top issues. Swift has not used the platform to promote Harris since her original endorsement, nor has she ever acknowledged Emhoff’s alleged behavior.
Other female celebrities, such as Olivia Rodrigo and Jennifer Lawrence, have also pledged their support for Harris, whom they hope will “restore reproductive rights.” They too have been silent in the wake of the allegations surfacing.
Some female celebrities, including “The Office” star Mindy Kaling and Grammy-winning singer Pink, appeared at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) to promote the vice president’s campaign in August. Neither of the celebrities have mentioned the allegations against the Second Gentleman. (RELATED: Harris Campaign Holds Rally In Swing State, Invites Pop Star With Ties To Diddy)
Emhoff, who several left-leaning media outlets characterized as a paragon of a new masculinity, was accused of “asshole behavior” and being “very flirty” at Venable LLP, a law firm he previously managed. Former colleagues of Emhoff who worked there alleged he was also routinely “inappropriate” and “misogynistic” during his tenure, the Daily Mail separately reported.
Many of these celebrities offered their labor or intellectual property in service of the Harris campaign — Beyoncé granted Harris the rights to her song, “Freedom,” for campaign advertisements; Anne Hathaway sang at a campaign fundraiser on Broadway; “Seinfeld” star Julia Louis Dreyfus promised to be “extra involved” in the Harris campaign — but none of them have made any mention of Emhoff’s alleged misdeeds.
Rapper Cardi B, an outspoken critic of President Joe Biden, said Harris should have been the nominee all along. Larger-than-life performer Lizzo joined Harris for a campaign event in Detroit. However, neither of the female musicians appear to have publicly voiced any concerns about the allegations against the Second Gentleman.
Among Harris’s high-profile supporters are former First Lady Michelle Obama, Jessica Alba, “Friends” star Jennifer Aniston, Jennifer Garner, Glenn Close, “Scandal” star Kerry Washington, Megan Thee Stallion, pop icon Cher and Barbra Streisand, none of whom have come out against Emhoff.",2024-10-23
The Daily Caller,"Trump Leading Harris in Key Swing State Two Weeks Before Election Day, Poll Finds","Former President Donald Trump is leading Vice President Kamala Harris in Georgia as election day draws closer, according to a Tuesday poll from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC).
Trump is leading at 47% while Harris is at 43%, which is outside of the poll’s margin of error of 3.1 percentage points, according to the AJC. Of likely voters that were polled, 8% said that they are still undecided.
Georgia is considered a key battleground state in the 2024 presidential election. The swing state began its first week of voting on Oct. 15 and set an early voting record as 196,000 residents cast their ballots, according to WALB.
There are more than seven million active voters in the state, according to WALB.
A Georgia judge decided on Oct. 15 to block a rule about the state hand-counting ballots on election day amid concerns that it could slow down announcing election results.
While Trump is leading across battleground states, the presidential race is still tight. The Republican candidate has a 1.2 point lead, pulling 48.4% support across seven top battleground states compared to Harris trailing behind at 47.2%, according to polling averages from RealClear Polling.
Harris is ahead of Trump nationwide, with a lead of 0.8 points at 49.3% compared to Trump’s 48.5%, according to national polling averages from RealClear Polling. (RELATED: Dem Senator Claims Major Swing State Faces ‘Voter Suppression,’ Despite Being Confronted On ‘High Turnout’)
Trump has made significant strides among black voters. The Democrats have been attempting to shore up support for Harris from black voters amid concerns of weak enthusiasm from the key voting bloc.
“The most recent polling shows what Team Trump already knew, Georgians from Catoosa to Camden County are tired of the cost-of-living skyrocketing and drugs flowing across the open border into our communities,” Morgan Ackley, Georgia Communications Director for the Trump campaign said in a statement shared with the Daily Caller News Foundation. “President Trump is winning or tied in every battleground, including Georgia, because his message is resonating with voters across the country. This November Georgia will say no to Kamala Harris and yes to Donald Trump and his America First policies.”

The Daily Caller,Biden Official Says Quiet Part Out Loud: ‘No One Is Listening To Him’,"A Biden official admitted Tuesday to Axios that “no one is listening” to the 81-year-old president after he appeared to claim former President Donald Trump needs to be locked up.
While on a trip to New Hampshire to talk about lowering the cost of prescription drugs, President Joe Biden said “we gotta lock him up” after discussing what he expected Trump to do during a second term. Moments later, the president appeared to clean his comments up by adding, “politically, lock him up.” One of the president’s officials responded to the remarks in a statement to Axios, admitting that the president has lost his star power and the comments will soon be forgotten.

“For better or worse, no one is listening to him anymore and his words have little power and less reach. It’s a blip. Gone in any meaningful way by mid-day tomorrow if it makes it that long,” a Biden official said, according to Axios national correspondent Alex Thompson.

The president’s comments come after the vice president’s team seemingly sidelined the 81-year-old from the campaign trail, three Harris campaign officials and three White House officials told NBC News. Biden last appeared on the campaign trail with Harris on Sept. 2 for a joint rally. The vice president has struggled to separate herself from the president and articulate how she would lead differently.
After telling The View he thought he could still beat Trump, the president also dodged the perfect opportunity to defend his vice president after she got in a back and forth with Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis over hurricane recovery efforts.
“Mr. President, does Gov. DeSantis need to take Vice President Harris’s calls?” RealClearPolitics White House correspondent Phil Wegmann asked.
“All I can tell you is I’ve talked to Gov. DeSantis. He’s been very gracious. He’s thanked me for all we’ve done. He knows what we are doing, and I think that’s important,” the president answered before leaving the room.",2024-10-23
The Daily Caller,EXCLUSIVE: Alyssa Farah Encouraged Cassidy Hutchinson To Leak To Reporters Amid Investigation,"Former Trump administration official Alyssa Farah Griffin suggested to star Jan. 6 investigation witness Cassidy Hutchinson that she leak to the media while the investigation was ongoing, texts obtained exclusively by the Daily Caller reveal.
Farah, a former Pentagon press secretary during the Trump administration, twice suggested to Hutchinson during active legal proceedings that she should give information to reporters. The pair also discussed ways to circumvent Hutchinson’s lawyer, Stefan Passantino, to communicate with former Republican Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney and the Jan. 6 committee, as first reported by Just The News.
“The alternative would be to just say fuck it and give it all to a reporter. Lol,” Farah texted Hutchinson after the latter asked if Cheney was still interested in working with her.
Shortly thereafter, in texts exclusively obtained by the Caller, Farah suggested that Hutchinson could coordinate with the committee to strategically leak some information to the press after testifying: “Btw, another idea.you could sit down and share it with the committee but then have the committee shares the big stuff you give them with press before your transcripts come out so it looks like it came from someone else.”
In later discussions, Hutchinson mentions that she is concerned with how to “reconfigure” her “reputation” within the media.
Passantino told the Caller he had no suspicions about such activity at the time and confirmed that he had never seen these specific messages between Hutchinson and Farah. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: House Republicans Call Out Cassidy Hutchinson’s J6 Testimony, Threaten Subpoena If She Does Not Produce Documents)
“This is the first I am seeing of some of these texts, but everything here is consistent with what I have been saying publicly and alleging in the various lawsuits I have filed over the past 18 months. I am surprised and pleased to see the facts coming to light,” Passantino told the Caller. (RELATED: iPhone Screenshot Undermines Cassidy Hutchison’s Claim That She Never Dated Matt Gaetz)
Hutchinson began the conversation by asking about a previous discussion the two apparently had, and if Farah had “touched base” with anyone about it.
“Hey! Yes. So I reached out to Liz. She agreed to keep our convo totally confidential. She said she admires you, and could tell that you wanted to the right thing from your testimony. Her one concern was so long ad you have counsel, she can’t really ethically talk to you without him. But what she suggests is a follow up with you, with your lawyer thats he and Dan George can lead. Probably can do without other members and Tim Does that help at all? I can tell she really wants to work with you and is just tryin to figure out the right way to do it,” Farah responded.
“I mean, do you think this is actually of interest to her at this point or is it moot Like have they moved beyond it,” Hutchinson replied.
“Oh it’s very much of interest. She basically just wants to structure it in a way you are comfortable and wants to make sure it’s clear, if you speak to them again, it’s them asking, not you, so you don’t get in trouble with trump world,” Farah said. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: House Republicans Demand Comms Between Cassidy Hutchinson, Fani Willis’ Office For J6 Investigation)
Hutchinson then described having trouble getting in touch with her attorney, before they discuss the prospect of leaking information to a reporter.
“My patience is razor thin,” Hutchinson said.
“Do you think your lawyer would drop you? I feel like you could represent yourself,” Farah asked.
“I never signed anything I asked several and he said it wasn’t necessary,that they had it taken care of So from a legal pov I’m not sure? But I’d assume??” Hutchinson responded.
“I just looked. I texted him Sunday morning to talk, he said he’d call that afternoon or Monday morning. That’s the last I heard from him despite following up every day since,” Hutchinson continued. “Am I overthinking this??”
“I’m sorry I’m not trying to be a nuisance,” she added.
Farah said she wanted Hutchinson to “be free” of the situation and proposed that she could potentially get immunity before sharing information with Cheney and the committee.
Hutchinson then asked if she may be asked to testify live.
“She was very clear they’d want to talk to you behind closed doors at least one more time before they’d put you up publicly,” Farah replied.
Hutchinson then asked if the committee would ask her to come back for more questioning, and claimed that Passantino would tell her to “go F myself” if she volunteered to do so.
“Ok that’s a good question. She was thinking she’d just ask you back for additional questions. But you probably don’t want them to go through Stefan? She is open to doing this anyway that’s like ethical/ legal,” Farah responded.
Farah went on to propose that her own lawyer may be willing to take on Hutchinson’s representation pro bono.
Days later, Hutchinson asked Farah to call her “asap” after she spoke to Passantino.
“dg called him Friday and asked about me coming in. Stephan gave me the weekend ‘to think on it’ He just said we will comply but he’s going to push back,” Hutchinson told Farah. “dg” seemingly refers to Dan George, a lawyer for the committee.
“Hmm ok. That was definitely at Liz’s direction. How do you feel about just doing it with Stefan but answering more questions? You can handle yourself and he’s just there as a figurehead,” Farah responded.
“And basically give ultimatum of a) we’ll come back but we need assurance she won’t be called in live (which I don’t think they’ll give) OR b) if you won’t give us an assurance, re-issue a subpoena,” Hutchinson said.
“He’s not against me complying. He’s actually sort of willing to do it be he thinks it builds my credibility as a witness. But he wants just enough from the committee to balance out the public backlash from the lawsuit and to frame me as super compliant/respectful of congressional subpoenas,” she continued.
“He’s going to call dan George this afternoon. Can you tip off Liz or Dan? And see their thoughts?,” Hutchinson asked Farah.
“I’m personally fine w just Liz and dan but I have a feeling he’ll want it structurally the same as my other Depos. But I haven’t gotten that far w him,” Hutchinson said.
“Does that make sense,” she asked.
“Yeah that all makes sense. I actually agree with Stefan’s approach and think it’s accomplished everyone’s goals. I am happy to tip liz off. And for what it’s worth I don’t think you are close to front in line to testify live But it might be worth asking for the commitment,” Farah responded.
“My guess is Stefan cares about protecting trump. You’re issues were more with meadows and folks around him. And you were simply being honest,” she added.
“Exactly. He doesn’t want me to stonewall the committee now, over this. I think he wants to balance the perception in Trump world if I just go back voluntarily vs. under subpoena,” Hutchinson said.
“But he’s probably going to be a bit less friendly to DG when he talks to him. He prob won’t outright tell him to re-subpoena me, so it may be helpful for DG to throw in (if they’d do that) ‘well if you don’t voluntarily come in, we’re likely reissue a subpoena’,” she added.
Hutchinson said their agreed-upon approach could help to “reconfigure” her “reputation” in the press. She then asked Farah to pass information to Cheney that her and her former lawyer do not plan to fight a subpoena, but that Passantino wants the committee to think they will.
“He talked to DG. Convo was consistent w/ what we discussed. SP told him we’ll need a subpoena to comply, but will ‘need to decide whether we’re going to fight it.’ (We’re def not going to fight it, but he wants the committee to think we will). Ir case you want to pass to LC or DG,” Hutchinson said.
Weeks later, Hutchinson texted Farah she felt like she could “drink myself into a coma.”
“Like I could drink myself into a coma,” Hutchinson responded. Farah said she thought the committee would make her testify live.
“Really?,” Hutchinson asked.
Hutchinson made headlines after testifying before the Jan. 6 committee. She claimed former President Donald Trump lunged for the steering wheel to reroute his car to the Capitol where protesters were gathering on Jan. 6. Sources close to the Secret Service have denied her claims. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Cassidy Hutchinson Begged Senior Trump Officials For ‘Financial Assistance’ After Being Subpoenaed By J6 Committee)
