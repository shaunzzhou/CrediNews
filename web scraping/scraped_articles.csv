Breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/the-media/2024/09/26/kamala-harris-taking-no-questions-bolts-from-podium-after-remarks-with-volodymyr-zelensky/,Kamala Harris Bolts from Podium After Remarks with Volodymyr Zelensky,"Vice President Kamala Harris avoided answering press questions again after delivering remarks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the White House on Thursday.
Harris has held zero press conferences since she joined the presidential race in July. She only conducted five television interviews, for which she faced a backlash for avoiding questions and failing to provide solutions to ongoing problems under the Biden-Harris administration.
Thursday was not an exception. Taking no questions, Harris bolted from the podium and directed Zelensky out of the room.
Harris’s attempts to weave and dodge suggest her record is a political liability. Harris faces a conundrum: She cannot campaign on policies to fix crime, inflation, and border security without undermining the Biden-Harris administration’s policies, but she must tout the administration’s policies to validate her record and candidacy.
President Joe Biden stated Wednesday that he delegated “everything” as commander in chief to Harris, including foreign policy and domestic policy.
During her Thursday remarks with Zelensky, Harris pledged to continue to help Ukraine fight Russia, which has repeatedly claimed any expansion of NATO into Ukraine is a redline. While former President Donald Trump promised to end the war if reelected, the Biden-Harris administration vowed to bring Ukraine into NATO.
“For God’s sake, this man cannot remain in power,” President Joe Biden said of Russian President Vladimir Putinin in off-the-cuff remarks during a speech in 2022.
Harris told reporters at the White House that “the United States supports Ukraine, not out of charity, but because it is in our strategic interest … My support to the people of Ukraine is unwavering.”
“I’ve been proud to stand with Ukraine – I will continue to stand with Ukraine, and I will work to ensure Ukraine prevails in this war, to be safe, secure and prosperous,” Harris continued. “The United States must continue to fulfill our long-standing role of global leadership— we must stand with our allies and our partners, we must defend our democratic values and stand up to aggressors, and we must stand for international order, rules, and norms.”

An estimated 300 people are affected by the layoffs that started Tuesday and are continuing at least through Thursday, according to a Deadline report. The employees affected are all in the U.S., with multiple divisions impacted, including legal, human resources, finance, and communications, according to a separate report from The Wrap.
The layoffs represent the latest round of cutting at Disney, which has been trying to right its financial ship amid continued cord-cutting as well as pessimistic consumer sentiment tied to record inflation under the Biden-Harris administration.
Last year, Disney eliminated a whopping 7000 jobs worldwide, with CEO Bob Iger promising an additional $2 billion in additional cost savings.
Disney recently swung the ax across multiple TV properties, including ABC News — which recently aired the rigged presidential debate — and Fauci documentary channel Nat Geo. ABC News’ evening show suffered a ratings drop following the debate as viewers made their sentiment known about how the network stacked the deck against former President Donald Trump.
This week, a company spokesperson attributed the most recent round of cuts to a company effort to make “corporate-level functions” operate more efficiently.
“We continually evaluate ways to invest in our businesses and more effectively manage our resources and costs to fuel the state-of-the-art creativity and innovation that consumers value and expect from Disney,” the spokesperson said, in the statement sent to multiple outlets.
“As part of this ongoing optimization work, we have been reviewing the cost structure for our corporate-level functions and have determined there are ways for them to operate more efficiently.”
Disney has also been dealing with the ongoing consumer backlash to its embrace of woke identity politics, especially the promotion of transgenderism in its entertainment aimed at children.

The Gateway Pundit,https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2024/09/kid-absolutely-bodies-kamala-harris-cnn-video/,Kid Absolutely Bodies Kamala Harris on CNN (VIDEO) | The Gateway Pundit | by Cristina Laila,"Fake News CNN interviewed 10-year-olds about the 2024 election and one child did not hold back when asked about Kamala Harris.
CNN spoke to 80 elementary school students in Arizona, Texas and New Jersey.
Excerpt from CNN:
The findings are the result of more than 40 hours of interviews commissioned by CNN’s “Anderson Cooper 360” to talk politics with 80 elementary schoolers in Arizona, a 2024 battleground state; New Jersey, a blue state; and Texas, a red state.
With their parents’ OK, researchers got the kids’ unfiltered thoughts about the presidential candidates and the election.
For this project, Asheley Landrum, an associate professor, child development expert and media psychologist at Arizona State University, worked with Stanford University political science professor Shanto Iyengar, who has already studied polarization in American teens. Landrum asked the elementary schoolers a series of questions, using photographs and visual prompts, to understand how the children feel about the political system.
The questions about the presidential candidates included prompts asking which one would keep them safer, which is more honest and which is more likely to do bad things.
The interviews were first conducted in the spring, when President Joe Biden was running for reelection and the kids were in fourth grade. Most of the same children took part in follow-up interviews in the fall in New Jersey and Texas, after Vice President Kamala Harris had stepped in to be the Democratic nominee and the kids had started fifth grade.
“What’s the first word that pops into your head when you hear the name Kamala Harris?” CNN asked a 10-year-old boy.
“Liar!” the child said without hesitating.

The Epoch Times,https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/new-york-city-mayor-adams-faces-pressure-after-federal-indictment-5730900?ea_src=frontpage&ea_cnt=a&ea_med=top-news-9-top-stories-0-title-0,New York City Mayor Adams Faces Pressure After Federal Indictment,"A federal indictment against New York City Mayor Eric Adams has fueled fierce debate about whether he can or should remain in office.
The 57-page criminal indictment, unsealed Thursday, lays out charges of soliciting and accepting illegal campaign contributions, attempting to cover up the bribes, and repeatedly misusing his political power on behalf of foreign donors.
Adams maintains that the effort to prosecute him has political motives, and the mayor has dug in his heels for what may be a protracted legal defense.
“This is not surprising to us at all,” the mayor said. “I ask that New Yorkers wait to hear our defense before making any judgments.”
He said his attorneys will handle the case so that he can get on with his job as mayor.
“I will continue to do the job for 8.3 million New Yorkers that I was elected to do,” he said.
Some observers, however, say that Adams’s public image is damaged beyond repair and it is inevitable that he will be forced to resign, paving the way for City Council member and public advocate Jumaane Williams—who has often feuded with the mayor on public policy issues—to take over as interim mayor at least through to next year’s election.
Even before the indictment was unsealed, prominent New York Democrat, Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, called on the mayor to resign “for the good of the city.”
Political Turmoil
The mayor has been grappling with increasing political turmoil as high-ranking members of his administration, including his chief legal adviser and his police commissioner, resigned their posts. Prominent figures in New York politics had called for him to step aside at the time.Unidentified “wealthy businesspeople” and a high-ranking official of the Turkish government, the indictment charges, began to lavish Adams with money and benefits, including international travel fare. Prosecutors allege the pattern intensified in the late 2010s as Adams grew serious about running for mayor of New York City.
By 2018, when Adams had publicly revealed his mayoral ambitions, the bribes were in full swing, the indictment states.
Unnamed foreign nationals allegedly stepped up their campaign to woo Adams in 2021 when his election as mayor appeared a virtual fait accompli.
The indictment alleges that Adams accepted “straw” campaign contributions, meaning donations from foreign nationals that went through stateside donors who could legally give money to his campaign and who claimed they were contributing their own funds.
“Wealthy individuals evaded laws designed to limit their power over elected officials by restricting the amount any one person can donate to a candidate,” the indictment states.
“And businesses circumvented New York City’s ban on corporate contributions by funneling their donations through multiple employees, frustrating a law that seeks to reduce corporate power in politics.”
In addition, the mayoral candidate allegedly enriched himself and stole public funds by applying for money from the New York City Campaign Finance Board matching funds program and falsely claiming the donations the program was to match complied with campaign finance laws, the indictment states.
Through this ruse, Adams’s 2021 campaign illegally took in an additional $10 million, according to prosecutors.
The indictment further details lavish favors that the defendant allegedly received from an unnamed high-ranking Turkish diplomat, including free or discounted travel on Turkey’s international airline to foreign cities, free stays at luxury Istanbul hotels, free dinners at fancy restaurants, and free entertainment.
Adams disclosed none of this in filings he had to make as a New York City employee, the indictment states.
Once elected, Adams allegedly used his power as mayor to rush through the opening of a 36-story Turkish consular skyscraper without a fire inspection required by law, the indictment states.
Can Adams Stay in Office?
When looking to Adams’s future in office, there can be no denying the seriousness of what the indictment alleges and the steep criminal penalties that may ensue, said Michael Alcazar, a professor in the Department of Law, Political Science, and Criminal Justice Administration at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan.“The unsealed indictment against Mayor Adams includes serious allegations of bribery, wire fraud, and accepting illegal campaign contributions from foreign nationals,” Alcazar told The Epoch Times.
“The merit of these allegations will be addressed in the courtroom. Nevertheless, the seriousness of the accusations and the detailed indictment could seriously affect his ability to remain in office as mayor,” Alcazar said.
“Additionally, public and political pressure may influence whether he chooses to resign, or is forced to step down.”
Timing of Indictment
While the seriousness of the charges against the mayor is not in dispute, the timing of the indictment, a mere 39 days before Election Day, is difficult to overlook, according to Harvey Kushner, chair of the criminal justice department at Brookville University on Long Island.As for what to expect from this point on, Kushner sees a number of possibilities. He has little doubt that Adams will continue to vigorously deny the charges.
Yet, in the current climate, whether Adams can remain in office is another question.
Kushner said that New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, who has said little publicly about the matter, may exercise her legal power to remove the mayor from office for 30 days.
“Hochul can, in a situation like this one, remove the mayor and pursue her own inquiry as to whether these charges are accurate,” Kushner said.
All these issues are microcosms of a larger power struggle between progressives and moderates in New York City’s government.
Mayor Adams’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

Cerebral palsy risks were reduced by 29 percent, the authors found.
Magnesium sulfate, which has the same chemical composition as Epsom salts, retails at less than $20 in the United States for intravenous infusions.
Babies born preterm are at a higher risk of developing cerebral palsy, an incurable motor disability that affects movements, postures, and in some cases, cognition and behavior.
Magnesium Sulfate for Neuroprotection
Researchers of the review did not explain why magnesium sulfate reduced cerebral palsy risks.Magnesium sulfate is often used to suppress premature labor and delay preterm birth.
Preterm birth, defined as delivery before 37 weeks, puts newborns at risk for cerebral palsy, which can occur from brain injuries during or shortly after birth. If a child’s brain is deprived of oxygen during the delivery, it can lead to irreversible damage and lifelong disabilities.
Researchers of the review analyzed six clinical trials involving nearly 6,000 women and more than 6,700 babies born prematurely.
The authors found that while magnesium sulfate effectively reduces brain injuries, it did not significantly decrease deaths in the short term. The treatment did not increase the risk of serious complications for mothers, such as cardiac arrest, but some women experienced side effects that led to stopping the treatment.
- High blood pressure
- Rapid heartbeat
- Nausea and vomiting
- Dizziness
Challenges in Global Treatment
Despite more than a decade of evidence and recommendations from the World Health Organization since 2015, not all mothers globally receive magnesium sulfate infusions.“We need further research to explore other questions to help optimize implementation,” Emily Shepherd, the review’s lead author, stated in the Cochrane press statement. “For example, is it better to deliver the drug as soon as women present to hospital in preterm labour, or as close to the birth as possible? Are the benefits the same regardless of how early the babies are born?”"
Natural News,https://www.naturalnews.com/2024-09-20-urgent-alert-uv-laser-directed-energy-attack-alert-details.html,"URGENT ALERT: UV laser directed energy attack alert – details on invisible, silent weaponry used to attack Trump and his supporters – NaturalNews.com","TECHNICAL DETAILS - PLEASE FORWARD TO ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT
UV lasers in the wavelengths of 280nm - 315nm are considered ""UV-B"" and are extremely dangerous to the human eye, as the optics of the eye add significant ""gain"" to incoming photons, in orders of magnitude. When UV lasers are deployed as weapons at indoor events, the subjects' pupils are dilated due to lower indoor lighting (compared to outdoor lighting, during which pupils are constricted), allowing orders of magnitude amplification of incoming light, even if invisible.
High intensity UV light causes permanent retinal damage / scarring / blindness. The malicious deployment of handheld UV lasers in an indoor environment would be UNDETECTABLE during the attack, and it could cause permanent blindness via extreme retinal damage. Importantly, UV lasers in this wavelength range are NOT visible on night vision optics or camera optics which can pick up IR illumination such as 980nm.
Handheld lasers have their own on board optics. Beam spread is described in milliradians (mils). A tighter beam hits fewer intended targets, but with higher energy density. A wider beam spread causes the energy emissions to be spread out and therefore less dense. But all lasers emit coherent light, so the beam maintains its shape over extremely long distances. With sufficient power, a handheld UV laser device deployed with malicious intent and sufficient power could cause blindness from 500 yards or even farther, if exposure is maintained over several tens of seconds.
WATCH FOR THE FOLLOWING IN THE CROWDS:
A malicious person deploying a UV laser would have a very difficult time accurately aiming it due to the beam being invisible. Therefore, all security personnel and LEOs should look for members of crowds who are holding up linear-looking devices and attempting to aim down the primary linear axis of such devices, for example if a person appears to be carrying a large cylindrical flashlight, and appears to be trying to ""aim"" down the primary axis of that flashlight, they may actually be aiming an invisible UV laser at an intended target. Similarly, UV lasers could be attached alongside media-looking camera equipment, so that a person who appears to be holding up a camera to film an event could actually be deploying a UV laser with malicious intent.
DETECTION EQUIPMENT:
Night vision optics cannot detect UV lasers. Very sensitive, high resolution thermal cameras *may* pick up elevated surface skin temperatures as UV rays strike the faces, chests, eyes, etc., of intended victims, and this temperature rise would appear in the shape of a very large circle, perhaps 15' in diameter, entirely depending on the milliradians of the laser optics and the distance of the assailant (think of a narrow spotlight, and the farther away the assailant, the larger the spotlight becomes due to distance, but the weaker it gets also).
To find malicious actors deploying such devices - FORWARD THIS TO RELEVANT FEDERAL LEOs - US Secret Service should be checking for suspicious purchases of extremely high-powered laser diodes (in the Watts range, not just milliwatts) from China or other sources, in the 250nm - 315nm wavelength range.
Understand that 254nm is widely considered ""germicidal,"" which means there are many purchases of such UV laser diodes by hospitals and medical applications, especially in the post-COVID world, so it may be extremely difficult to separate a malicious purchase of UV laser devices from legitimate medical purchases. I am available to brief law enforcement or Trump's security team on further technical details, as I am a published laboratory scientist and I researched UV-based laser ablation applications for ICP-MS elemental analysis of geological samples (part of a meteor impact project we were looking at).
NOTE: Protective glasses can be readily purchased to block specific wavelengths of light, including UV wavelengths. In fact, most popular sunglasses block most UV. Thus, there are readily available protective mechanisms which may be strongly recommended to be worn by Trump or people attending his rallies. I strongly encourage everyone to take necessary precautions. Actually wearing sunblock will also, of course, block UV damage on the skin, but the eyes are the most important organ to protect in this context. Thus, wearing shades even at an INDOOR event now makes very good tactical sense. More details later if I get them.

Natural News,https://www.naturalnews.com/2024-09-01-christian-churches-israel-mass-killing-palestinian-civilians-satan.html,"Christian churches that advocate for Israel’s mass killing of Palestinian civilians are serving SATAN, not Christ – NaturalNews.com","Colossians 3:15 says: Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were called to peace. And be thankful.
Today, we see numerous churches with all variety of pastors -- some wildly animated and fast-talking -- claiming that since the Zionists claim their Old Testament God gave them the monopoly right to murder human beings and take their land, therefore Christ must have also endorsed such a practice in New Testament times. This bizarre reasoning is enough, they say, to justify Christians today applauding the mass genocide of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank, where quite a few Christians, Catholics, Mormons and Jews still struggle to survive, by the way (they're not all Muslims).
Were Christ alive today, he would loudly condemn the blasphemous invocation of his name to justify mass murder and genocide.
How do we know it's genocide? Because Israel's Zionist leaders tell us so in their own words, repeatedly calling for mass exterminations and displacement of the Palestinian people. This evidence was entered into the International Court of Justice proceedings initiated by South Africa and endorsed by many other nations, including Colombia. There are a multitude of videos circulating online that show Israel's current leaders openly advocating genocide and the mass extermination of Palestinians. This is not debated except by those who are ignorant. The genocide of Palestinians is so self-evident and grotesque that many Jews themselves are speaking out against it, including Norman Finkelstein found in this video.
To carry out its genocide against Palestine, Israel has systematically bombed hospitals, mosques, universities, refugee camps, residential buildings, marketplaces, escape routes and infrastructure facilities. It has executed Gazan doctors using military snipers, bulldozed Palestinian civilians alive, launched precision missile strikes at food aid workers, deliberately bombed ambulances, blocked escape routes and even bombed routes that it designed as ""safe routes"" for Palestinians. Israel's clear goal is to either exterminate or displace the 2+ million Palestinians in Gaza so that Israel can steal their land and take their resources as part of its ""Greater Israel"" mission that Israel's leaders claim God gave them the monopoly right to pursue.
You don't have to be a Bible scholar to realize that the mass extermination of Palestinian women, children, hospital patients, elderly, doctors, university professors and ambulance drivers as a heinous crime against humanity. You do, however, have to have a brain and a heart. Both of these organs appear to be lacking across many Christian pastors, ministers and church leaders today, some of whom are too busy diddling 12-year-old children or sodomizing the choir boys to bother teaching the word of Christ. Because denial of Christ's teaching is, of course, a gateway to sin and self-destruction.
Matthew 5:9 - Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.
When pastors and church leaders openly support Israel's mass genocide, they are admitting to you that they reject the teachings of Christ. To justify their genocide, they usually claim something like, ""Israel has the right of self-defense."" And then you point out that Israel is slaughtering tens of thousands of children, women, elderly people, hospital workers, ambulance drivers and all sorts of people who took no part in the Oct 7 Hamas attack, these so-called Christian pastors will say things like, ""Well those children might grow up to become terrorists one day, and that's a threat to Israel.""
This is similar to Vietnam War-era war crimes when some soldiers would torch entire villages, screaming, ""Kill 'em all and let God sort 'em out!""
Israelis, of course, arrived in 1948 and began slaughtering Palestinians on site -- the ""Nakba"" -- stealing their land and homes, displacing an estimated 750,000 Palestinians within a few years, and over time corralling them into smaller and smaller parcels of land which eventually became a large open-air prison camp known as ""Gaza"" (with additional areas of the West Bank). Today, Gazans live as prisoners, almost wholly controlled by a vindictive Israel that determines their access to food, water, medicine, electricity, transportation, internet services and more. Modern-day Israel exists on the land which was violently and systematically stolen from the indigenous Palestinian people, whom could be compared to Native Americans in North America.
Yet Zionists claim that thousands of years ago, God promised them that land, therefore they claim to have the right in 2024 to mass murder anyone they want, and to consider all those who oppose them to be ""terrorists."" They often cite Genesis chapter 15, in which God makes a covenant with Abraham, saying, ""To your descendants I have given this land."" The Book of Genesis is typically dated somewhere around 5,000 years ago, by the way. Yet modern-day Israel attacked Palestine in 1948 -- apparently after a nearly 4,900 year time gap -- and now claims God gave them permission to kill everyone else.
The problem with this claim is that Palestinians are descendants of Abraham, too. The religion of Islam is an Abrahamic religion, and virtually all the indigenous people of Palestine are therefore Abrahamic. By murdering them, Zionists are murdering the very descendants of Abraham that God promised would inherit the land.
In essence, today's Zionist-run Israel is betraying the word of God and literally murdering children of God. This means Israel's actions stand in contradiction to God, which is why present-day Israel is often called a ""Satanic death cult.""
Psalm 34:14 - Turn from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it.
Israel also likes to play disingenuous word games to try to mislead the world about its genocide. When Israel bombs women and children to death, it declares them to be ""terrorists,"" not civilians. That's how Israel claims to have so much success killing ""terrorists"" while Netanyahu ridiculously claims to have killed almost no civilians.
When Israel initiates new bombing campaigns to slaughter yet more Palestinians, it falsely claims such actions are ""self-defense."" But they deliberately misuse the term to justify expanding genocide. If you live next to a family that has a psychopathic young man who comes to your home and tries to shoot you, then shooting him first is self-defense. That is your right if he has broken into your home and is threatening your life in an imminent fashion. But if you then march over to your neighbor's home and burn it down, roasting alive the women and children in that home, that's not self-defense. That's murder. And that's exactly what Israel is doing, but with 2000-lb. bombs.
This is covered in more detail by author Daniel Kovalik, author of ""The Case for Palestine,"" whom I interviewed a few weeks ago:
Here's more about Israel's deliberate demonic deception through its desire to use words to mislead:
The use of words to deceive... the mass slaughter of women and children... the attempted extermination of indigenous people... the mass theft of land and property... these are not actions of Christ but of demons.
Those who condone such actions are agents of Satan, and those church leaders who use their churches to espouse such mad violence and despicable, anti-Christ behavior are, themselves, anti-Christ agents who have rejected the teachings of Christ and the New Testament.
Christ taught forgiveness, coexistence, love, compassion, generosity, humility, morality and kindness. Yet these so-called ""Christian"" churches pushing Israel's genocide are rooted in violence, hatred, theft, destruction, suffering, anger, death and vengeance. They are steeped in spiritual circles of the demonic while pretending to be teachers of Christ.
Christ himself warned us about ""false prophets."" And now those false prophets have announced themselves for the whole world to see: They're the ones advocating Zionist genocide in Gaza. If you follow them, you follow them to Hell.

Fox News,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-heads-southern-border-looking-flip-script-immigration-criticisms,Harris heads to southern border looking to flip script on immigration criticisms,"Vice President Harris stops in battleground Arizona on Friday to hold a campaign event along the U.S. southern border with Mexico as the Democrat presidential nominee works to turn the issue of immigration and border security from a liability into a strength.
Harris has faced frequent attacks from her Republican opponent, former President Trump, and his allies who argue she's weak on border security, an issue that many Republicans see as the vice president's political Achilles' heel. Harris has faced intense criticism over the surge of migrants across the nation's southern border during the first three years of President Biden's administration.
The Trump campaign, on the eve of Harris' first border visit as a presidential nominee, called it a ""political ploy.""
And the former president, speaking with reporters in New York City, claimed that ""anything she says tomorrow, you know, is a fraud because she was the worst in history at protecting our country. So she’ll try and make herself look a little bit better. But it’s not possible.""
But Harris, with a stop in Douglas, Arizona, aims to show that she's better prepared than Trump to tackle the combustible issue of immigration and what Republicans have spotlighted as the crisis at the southern border.
HARRIS LEANS IN ON BORDER SECURITY AND TRUMP RELISHES THE FIGHT
The vice president is expected to speak about how she is pushing what she describes as the toughest bipartisan border security plan in a generation, a measure that includes new border agents and technologies to stop fentanyl trafficking.
And she's expected to reiterate her argument that Trump ""has been talking a big game about securing our border, but he does not walk the walk.""

She has repeatedly pointed to a border security bill with some bipartisan support that had been making its way through Congress this year before Republicans turned against the measure after prompting from Trump.
Harris has said that the former president ""tanked the bipartisan deal because he thought it would help him win an election"" and has pledged that ""as the president, I will bring back the border security bill that Donald Trump killed.""
Since replacing Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket more than two months ago, Harris has described herself as a former ""border state prosecutor"" who took on international gangs and criminal organizations behind illegal drug, gun and human trafficking across the border.
The description comes as Harris and her campaign have also spotlighted a tougher stance on border security while still pushing for a pathway to citizenship for some migrants.
""We need a comprehensive plan,"" Harris said Wednesday in an interview with MSNBC. ""That includes what we need to do to fortify not only our border but deal with the fact that we also need to create pathways for people to earn citizenship.""
Along with the border stop, the Harris campaign is launching a new ad that will play in Arizona and other battleground states that spotlights her past border efforts and plans.
""She put cartel members and drug traffickers behind bars, and she will secure our border,"" the narrator in the commercial says.
Biden tasked Harris in 2021 with leading the diplomatic outreach to tackle the ""root causes"" of migration in Central American countries. It led to her being dubbed the ""border czar"" both by the media and some Republicans, although the White House has rejected that description. And the vice president has been pilloried over her role as ""Biden's border czar"" by Trump and his allies.

Trump, as he runs to win back his old job in the White House, is calling for a major crackdown at the U.S.-Mexico border and has suggested using police and the military to carry out mass deportations of undocumented migrants.
Speaking at a campaign event in North Carolina on Wednesday, Trump said Harris was traveling to the southern border for ""political reasons.""
""When Kamala speaks about the border, her credibility is less than zero,"" Trump said. ""I hope you’re going to remember that on Friday. When she tells you about the border, ask her just one simple question: ‘Why didn’t you do it four years ago?’""
On Thursday, on the eve of the Harris visit, Trump asked, ""why would she go to the border now, playing right into the hand of her opponent?""
""She keeps talking about how she supposedly wants to fix the border. We would merely ask: ‘Why didn’t she do it four years ago?’"" the former president said in New York City.
Trump has repeatedly charged that the policies of the Biden-Harris administration have allowed millions of people to enter the U.S. illegally.
In June, after the collapse of the bipartisan border security bill, Biden announced rules that bar migrants from being granted asylum when U.S. officials say the U.S.-Mexico border is overwhelmed. Following the implementation of the new rules through executive orders, arrests for illegal border crossings have plummeted.
Polls indicate that immigration and abortion are two of the top issues on the minds of American voters, following the economy and inflation.
And public opinion surveys, including those from Fox News, indicate that by double digits Americans believe Trump would do a better job than Harris handling the issue.
Trump last visited the border during a stop last month in Arizona, which is one of the seven crucial battleground states that will likely determine the winner of the presidential election.

The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/27/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-ceasefire-hopes-fade-netanyahu,Lebanon ceasefire hopes fade as Netanyahu issues contradictory statements,"Optimism that a three-week ceasefire could be reached between Hezbollah and Israel appeared to recede as Benjamin Netanyahu issued a pair of contradictory statements on the proposal within hours of each other, as fresh Israeli strikes on Lebanon in the early hours of Friday killed 25 people.
In the latest statement from Netanyahu’s office, issued overnight on Friday, the Israeli prime minister chided reporting on the issue as he confirmed Israel had been consulted regarding a US-led ceasefire proposal.
“Israel shares the aims of the US-led initiative of enabling people along our northern border to return safely and securely to their homes. Israel appreciates the US efforts in this regard because the US role is indispensable in advancing stability and security in the region,” the statement read.
A previous release earlier on Thursday, however, had said that reporting “about a ceasefire is incorrect. This is an American-French proposal that the prime minister has not even responded to.”
Netanyahu’s twin statements appeared to replicate his response to previous US-led diplomatic initiatives over a Gaza ceasefire, where Israel has suggested it is more open to talks in private before reversing in the face of opposition from his coalition members.
Not for the first time US officials appear to have been wrongfooted by Netanyahu, saying initially they had believed his government was “onboard” with the plan for a 21-day ceasefire when it was announced by the US, France and other allies, saying the proposal had been “coordinated” with Israel.
“We had every reason to believe that in the drafting of it and in the delivery of it, that the Israelis were fully informed and fully aware of every word in it,” John Kirby, the White House national security spokesperson, told reporters on Thursday, adding that the US “wouldn’t have done it if we didn’t believe that it would be received with the seriousness with which it was composed”.
The late-night statement came after Abdallah Bou Habib, Lebanon’s foreign minister, urged all parties to implement the proposal, saying the escalating violence threatened his country’s “very existence”.
Speaking at the UN general assembly in New York, Bou Habib said the US-French ceasefire proposal was an “opportunity to generate momentum, to take steps towards ending this crisis”.
Earlier, the office of Netanyahu – who is addressing the UN general assembly on Friday – said the IDF would “continue fighting with full force” to achieve its war goals. Those war goals include the safe return home of more than 60,000 Israelis forced to abandon their homes in northern Israel by Hezbollah bombing, which began on 8 October last year, the day after the start of the Gaza war.
The International Organization for Migration estimated that more than 200,000 people have been displaced in Lebanon since Hezbollah began firing rockets into northern Israel in October in support of Hamas.
According to officials in Lebanon, 25 people have been killed in Israeli strikes on Lebanon since the early hours of Friday, including a family of nine in the Lebanese border town of Chebaa after a missile destroyed their three-storey building.
On Thursday, Lebanon’s health ministry said nearly 700 people had been killed this week, as Israel dramatically escalated strikes it says are targeting Hezbollah’s military capacities. According to health authorities, a total of 1,540 people have been killed within its borders since 7 October.
The IDF said a strike on a southern suburb of Beirut killed the head of Hezbollah’s drone force, Mohammad Surur. Israel has carried out several strikes in Beirut this week, targeting senior Hezbollah commanders.
The UN refugee agency says “well over 30,000” people have crossed from Lebanon into neighbouring Syria over the past 72 hours in the wake of fighting between Hezbollah and Israeli forces in Lebanon.
Gonzalo Vargas Llosa, the representative for the refugee agency UNHCR in Syria, said roughly half of the people who have fled were children and adolescents. He said about 80% were Syrians returning to their home country and the rest were Lebanese.
“Now these, of course, are people who are fleeing bombs and who are crossing into a country that has been suffering from its own crisis and violence for 13 years now,” he told reporters in Geneva by video from the Lebanon-Syria border. Syria is facing “economic collapse”, he said.
“I think that this just illustrates the kind of extremely difficult choices both Syrians and Lebanese are having to make,” he said.
After the Beirut explosion, dozens of rockets were fired toward the northern Israeli city of Safed, with one hitting a street in a nearby town. In total, 175 projectiles were fired from Lebanon on Thursday, the military said. Most were intercepted or fell in open areas, some sparking wildfires.
The IDF said on Friday it had intercepted a missile fired from Yemen that set off air raid sirens across Israel’s populous central area, including Tel Aviv. Another missile from Yemen landed in central Israel about two weeks ago. The strikes came after Israel’s military chief said on Wednesday the country was preparing for a possible ground operation in Lebanon.
On Thursday, the Israeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee reiterated that the military was preparing for a ground operation while awaiting a decision on whether to go ahead, and that the air force had reduced Hezbollah’s weapons stockpile and was working to prevent the transfer of further arms from Iran.
Hezbollah has yet to respond to the call for a truce, although it and its backer Iran have previously said it would halt its strikes only if there is a ceasefire in Gaza.
Emmanuel Macron – who was a co-backer with Joe Biden of the 21-day ceasefire proposal – said Netanyahu would have to take responsibility for a regional escalation if he did not agree to the truce. “The proposal that was made is a solid proposal,” the French president said, adding that the plan supported by the US and the EU had been prepared with Netanyahu himself.
The domestic political repercussions of a ceasefire for Netanyahu were made clear when his national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, told the prime minister that his party, Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power), would not vote with the coalition if the government agreed a ceasefire with Hezbollah.
“We will not abandon the residents of the north. Every day that this ceasefire is in effect and Israel does not fight in the north, Otzma Yehudit is not committed to the coalition,” Ben-Gvir said at a party meeting.
The leader of the opposition Democrats party, Yair Golan, also argued against committing to a three-week ceasefire, saying Israel should initially agree to a truce of a few days to see how well it was enforced."
The Guardian,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/sep/26/zelenskyy-biden-white-house,Harris decries Trump’s ‘proposals of surrender’ as Zelenskyy visits White House,"Kamala Harris, the US vice-president, has indirectly denounced the Trump campaign’s policy on ending Russia’s war against Ukraine as “proposals of surrender” as the Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelenskyy visited Washington to present his own “victory plan”.
Addressing Zelenskyy at the White House, Harris said that “some in my country” would pressure Ukraine to accept a peace deal in which it surrendered its sovereign territory and neutrality in order to make peace with Vladimir Putin.
“These proposals are the same as those of Putin, and let us be clear, they are not proposals for peace,” she said. “Instead, they are proposals for surrender, which is dangerous and unacceptable.”
While she did not mention Donald Trump or JD Vance by name, those terms for peace closely resemble ones laid out by the Republican vice-presidential nominee in an interview earlier this month.
Zelenskyy had publicly denounced Vance as “too radical” after those remarks, sparking a conflict with Trump allies that has culminated with accusations of election interference and Republican calls for Ukraine to fire its ambassador to Washington.
In an apparent U-turn late on Thursday, Trump told reporters he would meet Zelenskyy at Trump Tower in New York on Friday morning.
At a press conference he rejected Harris’ criticisms and insisted that he only wants to stop the “horror show that’s gone on”.
When asked if Ukraine should give up territory, Trump was non-committal, saying: “Let’s get some peace … We need peace. We need to stop the death and destruction.”
Before announcing the meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump posted on social media a purported message from the Ukrainian president asking to see him. The message, which was not confirmed by Ukrainian officials, said “we have to strive to understand each other.” The decision to publicly disclose what appeared to be private communications was a reminder of the tension that has been brewing between Trump and Zelenskyy.
Harris’s remarks came after Zelenskyy met Joe Biden at the White House for the formal presentation of Zelenskyy’s high-stakes proposal, which he has said can end the war with Russia with additional American aid.
The White House issued a short statement after the meeting, saying that the “two leaders discussed the diplomatic, economic, and military aspects of President Zelenskyy’s plan and tasked their teams to engage in intensive consultations regarding next steps”.
“President Biden is determined to provide Ukraine with the support it needs to win,” the statement said.
Zelenskyy has kept the details of the plan secret, but US officials have said it includes additional American aid to prevent a Ukrainian rout on the battlefield and “provide the [Ukrainian] people with the assurance that their future is part of the west”.
Zelenskyy faces an uphill battle in securing support for the plan, because of caution among senior officials in the Biden administration about providing Russia with a pretext to escalate the conflict further, and the looming November presidential elections that could lead to a re-election of Donald Trump.
Before the meeting, Biden announced more than $8bn in military assistance to Kyiv, calling it a “surge in security assistance for Ukraine and a series of additional actions to help Ukraine win this war”.
The aid includes the provision of a medium-range “glide bomb” munition fired from fighter jets that would allow Ukrainian forces to strike Russian troops and supply lines at safer distances.
The allocation included $5.5bn from the Ukraine security assistance initiative fund by the end of the year, as well as an additional $2.4bn in security assistance via the Department of Defense.
The package includes additional Patriot air defense batteries and missiles, unmanned aerial systems, and measures to strengthen Ukraine’s defense industrial base, Biden said. The US will also expand training for additional F-16 fighter pilots, with an extra 18 pilots to be trained next year.
But Biden was not expected to grant a key Ukrainian request that has been supported by the UK – permission to use arms such as long-range Atacms ballistic missiles to strike targets deeper inside Russia – due to fears of escalating the conflict with Russia.
“There is no announcement that I would expect [on that],” the White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre, told reporters before the meeting.
Zelenskyy said in a social media post: “We will use this assistance in the most effective and transparent way possible to achieve our main common goal: a victorious Ukraine, a just and lasting peace, and transatlantic security.”
Biden also announced that he would convene a high-level meeting of the Ukraine defense contact group to coordinate aid to Ukraine among more than 50 allies as he enters the lame-duck period of his final three months in office.
US media have reported that the Biden administration and European allies have been skeptical of Zelenskyy’s plan to achieve victory, which is understood to need to secure maximal support from the west before potential negotiations with Russia.
“I’m unimpressed. There’s not much new there,” a senior official told the Wall Street Journal.
Zelenskyy had said the plan included decisions that can be taken “solely” by the United States and “is based on decisions that should take place from October through December” – meaning the end of Biden’s term in office.
The meeting came amid rising tensions between Zelenskyy and Trump, who has attacked the Ukrainian leader for “making little nasty aspersions toward your favourite president: me”.
Zelenskyy, in an interview with the New Yorker published this week, said he believed Trump “doesn’t really know how to stop the war” and criticised Vance for describing a vision for peace that included Ukraine ceding territories currently occupied by Russia.
Before the meetings, Zelenskyy met members of Congress on Capitol Hill.
On Wednesday, the House speaker, Mike Johnson, a Republican, accused Zelenskyy of election interference and demanded he fire his ambassador to Washington over a visit to an ammunitions factory in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. Johnson claimed the Ukrainian ambassador had failed to invite any Republicans to the event and called it a “partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats”.
Zelenskyy sought to reduce tensions on Thursday as he thanked the US for the new arms package and praised political leaders’ “strong bipartisan support” in “Ukraine’s just cause of defeating Russian aggression”.
Nonetheless, US and European officials have noted with varying levels of alarm the potential for a Trump administration to sharply reduce US aid to Ukraine in order to force Zelenskyy to accept terms for a ceasefire.
Asked whether the Democrats wanted to “Trump-proof” aid to Ukraine before a potential Trump presidency, a senior state department official said: “I don’t ever talk in those terms” but that the primary goal was to make sure Ukraine “has all the equipment it needs to keep fighting and manpower and other things”.
“At the end of the year, regardless of who wins our election in December, as at the end of this fighting season, Zelenskyy and Putin need to look at the battlefield and say, here’s what we think next year will look like,” the official said.
“And the primary factor there is, do I think the other side has all the equipment it needs to keep fighting and manpower and other things?”"
CNN,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/27/middleeast/israel-pager-attack-hezbollah-lebanon-invs-intl/index.html,"Israel concealed explosives inside batteries of pagers sold to Hezbollah, Lebanese officials say | CNN","Israel carried out part of its device attack targeting Hezbollah by concealing explosives inside the batteries of pagers brought into Lebanon, according to two high-ranking Lebanese security officials, who said the technology was so advanced that it was virtually undetectable.
Lebanese security officials watched a series of controlled explosions of some of the weaponized pagers, as investigations into who manufactured the wireless communication devices and how they made their way into Hezbollah’s pockets continued.
The pagers used in the controlled explosions were switched off at the time of the attack on September 17, which meant they did not receive the message that caused the compromised devices to detonate. The officials had a front-row seat to see just how catastrophic the blasts would have been to those carrying the devices and others around them.
Thousands of explosions struck Hezbollah members last week, targeting their pagers on Tuesday, and then walkie-talkies a day later. In all, the blasts killed at least 37 people, including some children, and injured nearly 3,000, according to Lebanese health authorities, many of them civilian bystanders. The attack blindsided the group, which had opted for analogue technologies after forgoing cell phones to avoid Israeli infiltration.
Israel has not commented directly on the attacks, but CNN has learned that the explosions were the result of a joint operation by Israel’s intelligence service, Mossad, and the Israeli military. Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, tacitly acknowledged his country’s role the day after the pager attack, praising “excellent achievements, together with the Shin Bet, together with Mossad.” Both Lebanon and Hezbollah have blamed Israel for the attacks.
One of the Lebanese security sources told CNN the way in which the explosive material had been hidden inside the pagers’ batteries was so sophisticated that it could not be detected, but did not elaborate further as to what sort of checks the devices had gone through before entering the country.
The second high-ranking security source said that he had examined one of the compromised pagers and witnessed its controlled explosion. He told CNN that the explosive material was “laced” inside the pager’s lithium battery and virtually undetectable. He added that he had never seen anything like it.
An improvised explosive device has five key components: A power source, an initiator, a detonator, an explosive charge and a case to put it all in. Sean Moorhouse, a former British Army officer and explosive ordinance disposal expert, said that only a detonator and explosive charge would have been needed to weaponize the pagers, which already have the other three components.
“It had to be done in such a way to make it invisible,” Moorhouse said, adding that one way to do that could have been modifying the battery itself – implanting an electronic detonator and small explosive charge inside of its metal casing, which would have made it impossible to detect with imaging, for example X-rays.
Other experts who reviewed footage of the blasts also said that explosive devices appeared to have been hidden in the pagers, suggesting a sophisticated supply chain attack involving a state actor.
That tallied with initial assessments by Lebanese authorities. Lebanon’s mission to the United Nations said in a letter sent to the UN Security Council last Friday that a preliminary investigation found that the communications devices were implanted with explosives before arriving in the country, tampered with “in a professional way” by “foreign entities.”
Lebanese authorities determined that the devices were detonated by sending electronic messages to them, according to the letter, which was seen by CNN. Israel was responsible for carrying out the attacks, which detonated thousands of devices simultaneously, Lebanon’s UN mission said.
Mysterious supply chain stretches from Taiwan to Hungary
Multiple photos from the aftermath of last week’s attacks in Lebanon show remnants of the exploded pagers – also known as beepers – that were consistent with a model made by a Taiwanese firm, Gold Apollo, and fragments of walkie-talkies identified as the make of a Japanese firm, ICOM.
Lebanese authorities have said that the devices used in the attacks were Gold Apollo Rugged Pager AR-924 pagers and ICOM IC-V82 walkie-talkies. Both Gold Apollo and ICOM have distanced themselves from the compromised devices.
ICOM said that the IC-V82 model was discontinued a decade ago, and it could not determine whether the devices targeted in Lebanon were counterfeit or shipped from its company. Counterfeit versions are widely available for purchase on e-commerce websites, like Alibaba. Lebanon’s communications ministry said the IC-V82 radios used in the attacks were not supplied by a recognized agent, were not officially licensed and had not been vetted by the security services.
International investigative efforts have largely zeroed in on the Gold Apollo AR-924 pagers – tracing the model’s licensing and manufacturing from Taiwan to apparent shell companies to try to establish how the Israeli operation may have been carried out. The New York Times reported, citing three intelligence officers briefed on the operation, that Israel had set up at least three shell companies to disguise the identities of those making the pagers – Israeli intelligence officers.
The chairman and founder of Taiwan-based Gold Apollo, Hsu Ching-kuang, was questioned by Taiwanese prosecutors last Thursday before being released.
A day earlier, at the nondescript offices of Gold Apollo on the outskirts of the Taiwanese capital, Hsu, speaking to CNN and other media, vehemently denied having made the pagers bearing his company’s brand name, claiming instead that they were manufactured by a Hungarian firm, BAC Consulting.
Hsu told CNN he had entered into a licensing agreement with the Budapest-registered company, signing over “sole responsibility” for the production and sale of the AR-924 model. A person called Teresa was one of his contacts for the deal, he said.
Teresa Wu, a former Gold Apollo employee, was also seen leaving the prosecutors’ office in New Taipei City last Thursday evening, according to reporting by Reuters and local media staked out outside. Prosecutors in Taiwan currently list Hsu and Wu as witnesses, two senior officials in Taiwan told CNN.
A person with knowledge of Gold Apollo told CNN that Wu had left the company a couple of years ago, and that they understood she had started working for BAC Consulting. CNN has reached out to Wu for comment.
Wu set up a company called Apollo Systems Ltd in April of this year, listed under a Taipei address that appears to be a co-working space, according to corporate records. It is not clear if Wu was operating for BAC Consulting in Taipei under her new company name, Apollo Systems Ltd.
Apollo Systems Ltd lists its website address as “www.apollosystemshk.com,” according to a database maintained by Taiwan’s International Trade Administration. The Apollo Systems HK website – which was shut down by its administrator after the attack – said that the business had a manufacturing and sales hub in Taipei City and a logistics office in Hong Kong. When CNN visited the Hong Kong address, there was no sign of the company.
In December 2022 and February 2023, a YouTube channel for Apollo Systems HK uploaded two videos of the Gold Apollo AR-924 pager touting its “high-capacity lithium rechargeable battery” and other features. On its YouTube channel and website, Apollo Systems HK said that it had acquired the “sole distribution rights” to Gold Apollo pager systems. It also listed the AR-924 model as a product available for purchase.
The two senior Taiwanese officials who spoke with CNN said that there was no record of Gold Apollo manufacturing any AR-924 pagers in Taiwan. The officials also confirmed that Gold Apollo only manufactured pagers with AA batteries in Taiwan, not lithium batteries as found in the devices used in the attack and examined by Lebanese officials, according to CNN’s sources.
Customs records in Taiwan, cited by the officials, showed that Gold Apollo shipped more than 20,000 pagers from Taiwan to the United States in the first eight months of 2024. More than 5,000 pagers were shipped to Hong Kong, while more than 3,000 pagers were shipped to Australia.
The Taiwanese officials said they had also checked the order history and the source of raw components for Gold Apollo pagers, adding that pager manufacturing was tightly controlled in Taiwan and that devices undergo regular inspections.
The Taiwanese prosecutors’ office is reviewing documents it obtained from Gold Apollo’s office. In a statement last Thursday, the prosecutors’ office said that there had “been no evidence found so far to suggest any involvements (sic) of Taiwanese nationals in the explosive terror attack.”
Investigations into the supply chain are also ongoing in Europe, where authorities are probing the Hungarian company, BAC Consulting, and another firm linked to Bulgaria and Norway, for any connections to the pager attack targeting Hezbollah.
CNN has attempted to reach BAC Consulting at its registered address, which is located in a residential area of Budapest. Last Wednesday, a receptionist working at the building said that BAC Consulting rented a space at the address but that no representative had ever physically been there.
CNN has also reached out to BAC Consulting’s chief executive, Cristiana Bársony-Arcidiacono, but has yet to receive a response. NBC News reported that Bársony-Arcidiacono had confirmed to the news outlet in a phone call that her company worked with Gold Apollo, but said, “I don’t make the pagers. I am just the intermediate.”
There is no record of Gold Apollo exporting any pagers to Hungary in 2023 or 2024, the two Taiwanese officials said, citing custom records in Taiwan. In 2022, the company exported about 200 pagers to Hungary, they added.
Hungarian intelligence services have interviewed Bársony-Arcidiacono several times as part of their investigation into BAC Consulting but have not found any evidence that the pagers used in the attack were manufactured in the country, the government’s press office said in a statement. “The results have clearly established that the so-called ‘beepers’ were never present on Hungarian soil, and no Hungarian company or expert was involved in their production or modification,” it said.
Bulgarian authorities said they were investigating Norta Global Ltd after Hungarian media reported last week that the Sofia-based company was involved in the sale of the pagers to Hezbollah. Bulgaria’s national security agency DANS said that no pagers used in the attack were “imported, exported or manufactured in Bulgaria,” and that Norta Global Ltd had not carried out terrorist financing, or traded with anyone subject to sanctions. Bulgaria’s caretaker Prime Minister Dimitar Glavchev told reporters last Friday that the company under investigation was “a cash flow, mailbox-type of firm,” and that its director “acted by proxy.”
Norta Global Ltd was founded in April 2022 by Rinson Jose, a Norwegian national, according to Bulgarian business registration documents. CNN has tried to contact Jose on multiple platforms for comment, but he has not yet responded. Norway’s security police have started a preliminary probe into the company’s reported links to the pagers, according to a police attorney at the Norwegian Police Security Service.
Hezbollah digs into devices’ supply chain
Hezbollah’s leader Hassan Nasrallah, in an address last Thursday, said that the militant group had formed multiple internal investigative committees to get to the bottom of what happened, vowing a “reckoning” for those responsible.
“Regarding the explosions, we have reached an almost certain conclusion, but we still need some time to confirm it,” Nasrallah said. “This entire matter is under thorough investigation and review, from the company that sold the devices, to manufacturing, transportation, arrival in Lebanon, and distribution, all the way to the moment of the explosion.”
He added that while the apparent goal of the attack was to kill as many senior Hezbollah officials as possible, much of the leadership had been unaffected because they were carrying older pager models, suggesting that the form of communication has been used by the group for some time.
“The new ones were sent elsewhere,” he said, apparently referring to the batch of pagers a Lebanese security source told CNN was purchased by Hezbollah in recent months.
“These attacks represent a new development in warfare, where communication tools become weapons, simultaneously exploding across marketplaces, on street corners, and in homes as daily life unfolds,” UN human rights chief Volker Türk told the Security Council last Friday. “Authorities have reportedly dismantled unexploded devices in universities, banks, and hospitals.”
He added that simultaneously targeting thousands of people – whether civilians or armed forces – without the knowledge of who is in possession of the targeted devices and their surroundings at the time of the attack, violates international human rights law.
Iran’s delegate to the UN said that Israel had intended to kill at least 5,000 civilians, but some devices were deactivated or not distributed. The delegate said that Israel had again “crossed a red line,” noting that Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon was among those injured.
Senior UN officials warned that the devices attack marked a turning point, calling for de-escalation and a ceasefire in Gaza before a war consumes the whole of the Middle East. Others said that the technology apparently used marked “dangerous new territory” in the world of warfare.

CNN,https://edition.cnn.com/2024/09/26/asia/south-korea-deepfake-bill-passed-intl-hnk/index.html,South Korea to criminalize watching or possessing sexually explicit deepfakes | CNN,"South Korean lawmakers on Thursday passed a bill that criminalizes possessing or watching sexually explicit deepfake images and videos, with penalties set to include prison terms and fines.
There has been an outcry in South Korea over Telegram group chats where sexually explicit and illegal deepfakes were created and widely shared, prompting calls for tougher punishment.
Anyone purchasing, saving or watching such material could face up to three years in jail or be fined up to 30 million won ($22,600), according to the bill.
Currently, making sexually explicit deepfakes with the intention of distributing them is punishable by five years in prison or a fine of 50 million won ($37,900) under the Sexual Violence Prevention and Victims Protection Act.
When the new law takes effect, the maximum sentence for such crimes will also increase to seven years regardless of the intention.
The bill will now need the approval of President Yoon Suk Yeol in order to be enacted.
South Korean police have so far handled more than 800 deepfake sex crime cases this year, the Yonhap news agency reported on Thursday.
That compares with 156 for all of 2021, when data was first collated. Most victims and perpetrators are teenagers, police say.
Earlier this month, police launched an investigation into Telegram that will look at whether the encrypted messaging app has been complicit in the distribution of sexually explicit deepfake content.
Countries around the world are grappling with how to respond to the proliferation of deepfake material.
The US congress is debating several pieces of legislation including one that would allow victims of nonconsensual sexual deepfakes to sue, and one that would criminalize the publication of such imagery and make tech companies remove it.
Earlier this year, social media platform X blocked users from searching for Taylor Swift after fake sexually explicit images of the pop singer proliferated on social media."
BBC News (US Edition),https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7810y11dyjo,Trump says he will meet Zelensky despite campaign criticism,"Trump says he will meet Zelensky despite campaign criticism
Donald Trump has agreed to a last-minute meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky despite repeatedly criticising him on the US campaign trail.
The Republican presidential nominee told a news conference that the Ukrainian leader will visit Trump Tower on Friday, just days after Trump criticised him for refusing to ""make a deal"" with Moscow.
The former US president appears to have changed his mind after earlier reports from his campaign said a meeting between the two was extremely unlikely.
The pair have endured a tumultuous relationship. Trump was impeached in 2019 over accusations that he pressured Zelensky to dig up damaging information on the Biden family.
A rough transcript of the call revealed Trump had urged Zelensky to investigate Biden, as well as Biden's son.
Since Russian launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Trump has frequently repeated Moscow's talking points about the war. During September's presidential debate he sidestepped a question on whether he wanted Ukraine to emerge victorious in the conflict.
Announcing the meeting with the Ukrainian leader, Trump repeated his long-standing claim that he he would be able to ""make a deal"" between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Zelensky ""quite quickly"".
But the former president declined to delve into the specifics of his plan. He also refused to elaborate when asked whether he believes Ukraine should cede territory to Russia as a means of ending the war.
""It's a shame what's happening in Ukraine. So many deaths, so much destruction. It's a horrible thing,"" Trump told reporters in New York on Thursday.
On Thursday night, Trump posted a screenshot of a text message from President Zelensky, passed on by Ukraine's deputy ambassador to the US. In it, the Ukrainian leader requested a meeting with the ex-president and said it was ""important for us to have a personal contact and to understand each other 100%"".
Friday's meeting comes amid tension between Zelensky and the Republican party ahead of November's US presidential election.
Some Republicans were angered by Zelensky's visit to an arms factory in Biden's hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania, with top Democrats, including state Governor Josh Shapiro, earlier this week.
Zelensky's trip to the key swing state was labelled by leading Republicans as a partisan campaign event. In a public letter, House Speaker Mike Johnson said the visit was ""designed to help Democrats"" and claimed it amounted to ""election interference"".
Trump has grown increasingly critical of continued US funding for Ukraine, and in recent days has sharpened his attacks against Zelensky, calling him the ""greatest salesman on Earth"".
In contrast, Zelensky recently told the New Yorker magazine that he believes Trump ""doesn't really know how to stop the war"".
When asked about Zelensky's comments on Thursday, Trump replied: ""I do believe I disagree with him. He doesn't know me.""
On Thursday, Zelensky met US President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris at the White House to discuss his ""victory plan"", which he hopes will pressure Russia into agreeing a diplomatic end to the war.
Hours before, Biden had announced a further $7.9bn (£5.9bn) package of military assistance to Ukraine.
As Zelensky visited the US, drone attacks continued in Ukraine. On Thursday night, three people were killed and 14 others wounded in a Russian drone attack on Izmail, a port city on the River Danube.
Russia has targeted Izmail’s grain export facilities in the past, however prosecutors say two boys aged three and 13, and a girl aged 14, were among those wounded in the latest attack.
Romania’s defence ministry said it was possible that one of the Russian drones involved in the attack had crossed the border into Romania, a Nato member state, for a very short period.

BBC News (US Edition),https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clylgv2dk3yo,Iran's dilemma over restraint or revenge for attacks on Hezbollah,"Iran faces dilemma of restraint or revenge for attacks on ally Hezbollah
Many hardline conservatives in Iran are growing uneasy about its lack of action as Israel targets the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, their country’s closest and most long-standing ally.
When President Masoud Pezeshkian addressed the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, he criticised Israel’s war in Gaza and warned that its attacks on Lebanon could not go unanswered.
But Mr Pezeshkian, who was elected in July, adopted a more conciliatory tone than his hard-line predecessors, avoiding rhetoric about annihilating the Islamic Republic’s arch-enemy.
“We seek peace for all and have no intention of conflict with any country,” he stated.
He also expressed his government's readiness to resume nuclear talks with Western powers, saying: “We are ready to engage with participants of the 2015 nuclear deal.”
Other senior Iranian officials and commanders of the Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) have also appeared to be unusually restrained when expressing their intentions to take revenge on Israel for its actions against their country and its key allies Hamas and Hezbollah.
Iran has armed, funded and trained both armed groups, but Tehran's leaders rely on Hezbollah to be a major deterrent preventing direct attacks on their country by Israel.
Iranian support has been critical to Hezbollah’s transformation into Lebanon’s most powerful armed force and political actor since the IRGC helped found the group in the 1980s.
It is the main supplier of the weapons that Hezbollah can deploy against Israel, particularly advanced missiles and drones, and the US has previously alleged that it also provides as much as $700m in funds annually.
Last week, Mojtaba Amani, Iran’s ambassador to Lebanon, was severely injured when his pager exploded last week at the embassy in Beirut. Thousands more pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah members also blew up in two attacks that killed a total of 39 people.
Iran blamed Israel, but it made no immediate public threats of retaliation.
In contrast, when Israel struck the Iranian consulate in Damascus in April, killing eight high-ranking IRGC Quds Force commanders, Iran swiftly responded by launching hundreds of drones and missiles at Israel.
Iran also vowed to retaliate after blaming Israel for the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in late July, although it has not announced that it has taken any action yet.
A former IRGC commander told the BBC that repeatedly threatening Israel without following through was further damaging the force’s credibility among its supporters inside Iran and its proxies abroad.
On Monday, President Pezeshkian told members of the US media in New York that Israel was seeking to draw Iran into a war.
“Iran is ready to defuse tensions with Israel and lay down arms if Israel does the same,” he insisted.
Some hardline conservatives close to Iran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, criticised the president for talking about defusing tensions with Israel, asserting that he should recognize his position and avoid giving live interviews.
Mr Pezeshkian was due to hold a press conference in New York on Wednesday, but it was cancelled. It was unclear if he was forced to cancel because of his comments.
In Iran, power lies in the hands of Ayatollah Khamenei and the IRGC. They are the ones making the key strategic decisions, not the president.
It is notable that Ayatollah Khamenei also did not mention any plans for retaliation or issue threats toward Israel, which is quite unusual for him, when he addressed veterans on Wednesday.
Barak Ravid, an Israeli journalist at the US news site Axios, reported on Tuesday that two Israeli officials and Western diplomats had indicated that Hezbollah was urging Iran to come to its aid by attacking Israel. The Israeli officials claimed that Iran had told Hezbollah that “the timing isn’t right”, according to Ravid.
Last week, the host of the Iranian internet TV program Maydan, which is known to have ties to the IRGC, cited Iranian intelligence sources as claiming that Israel had also “carried out a special operation last month, killing IRGC members and stealing documents”.
He asserted that the Iranian press had been forbidden from reporting on the incident, which allegedly happened inside in Iran, and that the authorities were attempting to control the narrative.
In response, Tasnim News Agency, which also linked to the IRGC, denied the allegations.
The Islamic Republic finds itself in a precarious situation.
It is concerned that attacking Israel could provoke a US military response, dragging the country into a broader conflict.
With a crippled economy due to US sanctions and ongoing domestic unrest, a potential US strike against the IRGC could further weaken its the regime’s security apparatus, possibly emboldening the Iranian opponents to rise up once more.
However, if Iran refrains from direct intervening in Hezbollah’s conflict with Israel, it risks sending a signal to other allied militias in the region that, in times of crisis, the Islamic Republic may prioritize its own survival and interests over theirs.
This could weaken Iran’s influence and alliances across the region."

With polls showing the presidential election a toss up, the votes that third-party and independent candidates receive in key states could very well decide the White House.
Those vote shares could be small but determinative in an election likely to be decided on the margins.
People linked to the major parties know this, which is why they've spent recent months trying to boost candidates they believe could hurt the opposing major party, while trying to block candidates they think could hurt their own party's prospects.
It's also why Robert F. Kennedy Jr., after ditching his independent presidential bid and endorsing Donald Trump, tried to get off ballots in battleground states.
Despite his efforts, RFK remains on ballots in Michigan and, barring a last-minute legal decision, Wisconsin.
This year’s presidential election is also an example of how it's easier for established third parties to secure a spot on a state’s ballot, compared with independent candidates or minor political parties. Both the Libertarian and Green parties have their candidates on ballots in several swing states.
Along with Democrat Kamala Harris and the Republican Trump, here are the candidates listed on presidential ballots in the seven top battleground states:

NPR,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/26/nx-s1-5111886/pennsylvania-mail-in-ballot-lawsuit-2024-election,Legal questions about Pennsylvania mail-in ballots loom as voting starts,"Legal questions about Pennsylvania mail-in ballots loom as voting starts
As voting begins for Pennsylvania’s general election, legal questions about the ballots of mail-in voters remain unresolved in the swing state that could determine the winner of the presidential race.
From what have become known as “undated ballots” to so-called “naked ballots,” the range of issues before state and federal courts center on what to do when voters return absentee ballots on time but don’t follow all of the rules for getting their votes counted.
State law requires completed mail-in ballots to be sent back in two envelopes — an inner secrecy envelope and an outer envelope. On that return envelope, voters have to add their signatures and the current date.
Election officials do not use that handwritten date to verify that a ballot was received by the legal deadline, but thousands of voters in recent elections have had ballots arrive on time but ultimately tossed for failure to properly date their outer envelopes.
Under state law, voters whose mail-in ballots are rejected can vote with a provisional ballot at a polling place. But in one Pennsylvania county, the Republican Party is trying to block the counting of provisional ballots of voters who returned mail-in ballots that were thrown out for not having secrecy envelopes.
Republican groups contend that the ballots of voters who have not followed the rules should not be counted, while voting rights groups have been arguing that state and federal laws protect eligible Pennsylvanians’ votes from getting disenfranchised because of a mistake.
In recent elections, Democrats have outnumbered Republicans in casting mail-in ballots, a method of voting that was opened to all registered voters in Pennsylvania in 2019 with bipartisan support at the time from the state’s lawmakers.
The state legislature’s bipartisan advisory board on election law has since recommended changing Pennsylvania’s rules. To “eliminate confusion and litigation” about mail-in ballots, the board wrote in a report last year, it called for rewriting state laws to say that not using a secrecy envelope or not having a handwritten date on the outer envelope would not disqualify a ballot.
But partisan gridlock has curtailed efforts to revise voting laws.
In the meantime, state officials have redesigned the envelopes to try to help voters identify the yellow secrecy envelopes and remember the date requirement.
And with less than six weeks until the last day of voting, judges face a tight timeline for trying to resolve these lawsuits so that election offices have clear instructions on what to do with the ballots they receive. Officials are already under pressure from a state law that bans them from processing mail-in ballots until 7 a.m. ET on Election Day, potentially delaying the reporting of results.
Here’s where the major legal questions about Pennsylvania’s mail-in ballots stand:
Should “undated” and misdated ballots be counted?
No, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled this month.
Citing procedural issues, the state’s highest court threw out a lower court ruling that had found not counting mail-in ballots in return envelopes without any handwritten date or with an incorrect one violates Pennsylvania’s constitution, which says that all elections in the state must be free and equal.
But on Wednesday, voting rights groups asked the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to take up the issue through a new lawsuit.
And there are similar legal fights in the federal courts that may affect what ultimately happens to these ballots. A federal judge is weighing an argument that excluding these ballots goes against the U.S. Constitution. Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court has set Friday as the deadline for civil rights groups to formally ask the justices to review whether not counting these ballots violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which says a person's right to vote cannot be denied for ""an error or omission on any record or paper relating to any application, registration, or other act requisite to voting"" that is ""not material"" in determining whether they’re qualified to vote.
Should the provisional ballots of voters who return “naked ballots” be counted?
Yes, the Commonwealth Court ruled this month.
The state court found that election officials in Pennsylvania’s Butler County, just north of Pittsburgh, should count the provisional ballots of two “naked ballot” voters, who cast them for this year’s primary election after officials notified them that their returned mail-in ballots were rejected for lacking secrecy envelopes.
But the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has agreed to take up an appeal by the Republican National Committee and the Republican Party of Pennsylvania. The GOP groups argue that counties contacting voters with defective mail-in ballots and allowing them to cast provisional ballots amounts to what’s known as a “notice and opportunity to cure” procedure, a process that’s separate from provisional voting. Counties in the state can choose to put in place notice-and-cure policies but, according to a 2020 Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling in a different case, state courts are not allowed to order them.
In a separate but related court petition to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, the GOP groups argue that counties across the state have “adopted a patchwork of notice-and-cure policies” and as a result, not uniformly carried out the state’s election rules, in violation of both the state and U.S. constitutions. The state’s high court has not yet announced whether it will take up that petition.
