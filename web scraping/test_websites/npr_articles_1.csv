NPR,I went on the new White House tour. This is what you can now see,"I went on the new White House tour. This is what you can now see
The first time I went on a White House tour six years ago, I couldn’t go into the rooms on display. I had to peek at the historical images and fancy china from the hall.
For decades, that’s been the same experience that thousands of tourists have had when visiting the presidential building. And the tour hadn't had significant changes for years — until now.
First Lady Jill Biden has just unveiled a new tour where the rooms are open for people to walk in, and there are new interactive elements throughout: videos, digital images and touchable replicas.
So, years after my first visit, I went back to see what had changed.
Standing where history was made
The project to overhaul the tour has been two years in the making.
At the unveiling, Jill Biden — who has been a teacher for 40 years — said the new tour will resemble a museum experience; more engaging and educational.
For the visual learners, there is a video of the first lady that welcomes visitors to the tour, and another of President Joe Biden halfway through. There are slideshows with photos of past presidents throughout the rooms and halls, and a scale model of the White House.
That 3D model, showing key renovations the building has undergone over the decades, is one of the first lady’s favorite parts. Different sections of the model light up as text appears explaining what each renovation was, and when it happened.
“You may not know this, but the White House didn’t always have running water or electricity,” she said at the unveiling event. “So, they had to open up the walls to put it in. That’s what you’ll learn on this tour. The rendering tells you that story: who added each piece of the house and when.”
One of the big additions to the tour is an entirely new room: the Diplomatic Reception Room, where former president Franklin D. Roosevelt held his fireside chats, addressing the American public directly through radio during World War II and the Great Depression.
“You can listen and hear his voice and look in this room and imagine to yourself, this is where FDR made those fireside chats, exactly where I'm standing right now,” said Elizabeth Alexander, a deputy assistant to the president and the communications director to the first lady.
Up on the second floor, a video of President Biden welcomes visitors to the East Room. The large hall is decorated with the portraits of George and Martha Washington, but otherwise looks like a large, empty hallway without furniture.
Alexander points to new signage and reader rails added to each part of the tour, explaining their history.
“Now people will know, because of the signage in front of them, that they're standing right where President Johnson signed the 1964 civil rights bill,” she said. “Before then, people were walking through the East Room and not really knowing what had happened right where they were standing at that time.”
Something similar would happen in the Blue Room — one of the parlor rooms. There, back in 1863, President Abraham Lincoln greeted visitors hours before heading to his office to sign the Emancipation Proclamation.
“Previously, people didn't know it. They would walk through the Blue Room and admire the furnishings, admire the beautiful view of the Washington Monument and the Jefferson Monument that you can see. But they may not have realized exactly what has happened in this room across history,” Alexander said.
Lastly, there are tactile items added throughout. In the Green Room, for example, Alexander points to an urn used for tea or coffee that’s almost 240 years old.
“It's roped off because it belonged to John and Abigail Adams. But what you can do is you can feel a replica of it,” she said. “I have two boys that want to touch everything in every museum that we ever go into. And now they're going to be encouraged to do that.”
The Biden administration worked with The White House Historical Association, the National Park Service and the History Channel, which provided the funding.
Alexander said that collaboration helped enhance the tour while preserving history. And, she said, this is an ongoing project.
“The president, no matter who they are, is only a temporary occupant of this house. And it really is the people's house,” she said. “And so this tour, this public tour and its elements, will adapt and change as presidents change, as our country changes.”
What remains the same is the process of booking one of these tours. The White House is directing Americans to book it through their members of Congress.",2024-11-01
NPR,"The Secret Service admits failures in Butler, Pa., Trump shooting","The Secret Service admits failures in Butler, Pa., Trump shooting
The Secret Service acknowledged Friday failures that led to a gunman being able to wound former President Donald Trump at a rally in Butler, Pa., on July 13.
“It’s important that we hold ourselves to account for the failures of July 13 and that we use the lessons learned to make sure that we do not have another failure like this again,” Ronald Rowe, the acting director of the Secret Service, told reporters.
The agency released the initial findings for its internal review about the Butler incident on Friday, just days after it faced additional criticism over a second alleged gunman who was able to make it within several hundred yards of Trump at his West Palm Beach, Fla., golf course on Sept. 15.
Rowe said that one of the failures in Butler was that the Secret Service deferred too much to local law enforcement on securing buildings near the rally and didn’t provide clear guidance. This allowed the shooter to climb onto the roof of a nearby building and shoot at the former president, he said.
“We need to be clear with our state and local partners on what we’re asking of them,” Rowe said.
The agency's review details, for example, that the local tactical team was inside the building, instead of on the roof — from where the shooter ended up getting a clear shot at the president. That local team had no contact with the Secret Service before the day of the rally.
""Multiple law enforcement entities involved in securing the rally questioned the efficacy of that local sniper team’s positioning in the AGR building, yet there was no follow-up discussion about modifying their position,"" the review found. ""There was also no discussion with Secret Service advance personnel about positioning that team atop the AGR roof. Local sniper support were apparently not opposed to that location.""
Rowe cited “complacency” from other agents, flaws in advanced planning, as well as over-reliance on mobile devices.
The review found that communication broke down on multiple levels. Secret Service agents and local law enforcement officials missed communication in planning, in operations — and on the day of the rally itself, used different radio frequencies that ""were not conducive for quickly sharing real-time information.""
Rowe said employees would be held accountable, declined to give details, but reiterated that contrary to media reports, he did not ask for anyone to resign.
""Robust security"" for Trump
Rowe said since he left office, the former president has had “robust security” — more robust than any former president has ever received. That security was increased to a presidential level after the July 13 shooting.
The Secret Service has come under scrutiny since July, when a gunman fired multiple shots at Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, at the Butler rally, striking Trump’s ear, killing one attendee and wounding two others. The gunman was killed.
Then, two months later, a second alleged gunman came close to Trump — though he did not shoot, and did not have the former president in his sights. The suspect was apprehended.
Rowe said that based on information he had about the second incident, ""I’d say that situation was managed according to our training.” That included the young Secret Service agent taking swift action, reporting shots he fired at the gunman, and communicating via radio.
Still, the multiple attempts have prompted Lowe and other Secret Service personnel to ask Congress for more resources, arguing the agency is limited on personnel and equipment. President Biden has also urged Congress to provide more resources.
On Friday, the House unanimously approved a bill that would direct the Secret Service to give the same protection as the current president and vice president — something the agency said is already happening.
Lawmakers also increased the scope of a bipartisan task force that is investigating the first assassination attempt to also investigate the apparent second attempt. The group of bipartisan House members is expected to file its own report in December.",2024-09-20
NPR,Harris urged unity in her closing argument. Biden's 'garbage' line undercut that,"Harris urged unity in her closing argument. Biden's 'garbage' line undercut that
Vice President Harris found herself having to do clean-up on Wednesday — the day after a major address where she pledged to turn the page on an era of division in the country — because of a divisive remark made by President Biden.
Biden had made comments in a video call on Tuesday evening that sounded like he was calling supporters of former President Donald Trump ""garbage.""
Republicans took offense and drew a through line to Hillary Clinton's 2016 comment about the ""basket of deplorables"" supporting Trump.
""How do you like my garbage truck?"" Trump asked reporters traveling with him in Green Bay, Wis., where a trash hauler had been emblazoned with his campaign logo for the occasion.
""This truck is in honor of Kamala and Joe Biden,"" he said.
Still wearing a reflective vest from the photo op at his subsequent rally, Trump said: ""I have to begin by saying, 250 million Americans are not garbage."" He was seemingly describing the number of his supporters, though he received 63 million votes in 2016, when he won, and 74 million in 2020, when he lost.
Earlier in the day, in Rocky Mount, N.C., Trump said Biden's ""garbage"" comments revealed ""what he and Kamala really think of our supporters,"" adding, ""My response to Joe and Kamala is very simple: you can't lead America if you don't love Americans.""
Republicans drew a through line from ""garbage"" to ""deplorables""
Conservatives have long complained that Democrats have used disparaging labels to describe their supporters.
""You know, Barack Obama said that we were bitter clingers. Hillary Clinton said we were deplorables ... And then Joe Biden says that we're garbage. Well, we have news for the Democrat elites. We're none of those things. We are Americans,"" Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., said at Trump's Rocky Mount rally.
Biden's comment has given Trump an opening to move past the controversy unleashed by a disparaging and politically toxic joke about Puerto Rico made by a comedian during Sunday's Madison Square Garden rally.
That joke has roiled the presidential campaign in its waning days as Puerto Ricans are a significant presence in places like Pennsylvania, which both the Trump and Harris campaigns see as a must-win state.
Harris has been trying to appeal to moderate Republicans and independents
Harris — who has been trying to appeal to moderate Republican and independent voters in swing states — had to respond to questions about Biden as she departed for Wednesday stops in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, also had to address the issue during two major television appearances.
""Let me be clear: I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for,"" Harris told reporters.
In Raleigh, she added a new line to her stump speech, pleading with her supporters to ""please be intentional about building coalitions"" in the final days of the race.

What Biden said
In a video call Tuesday with Voto Latino, Biden was making comments about the comic at the Trump rally when he said something that sounded like he was calling Trump supporters “garbage.”

The WH says Biden was talking about the comedian—“supporter’s”
The clip: pic.twitter.com/F7VRcyBFJu
The White House quickly issued a transcript seeking to put Biden’s comment in a broader context, insisting that Biden had said ""supporter's,"" to refer to the comedian's quote and not ""supporters.""
""And just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a 'floating island of garbage.' Well, let me tell you something. I don't -- I -- I don't know the Puerto Rican that -- that I know -- or a Puerto Rico, where I'm fr- -- in my home state of Delaware, they're good, decent, honorable people. The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter's -- his -- his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it's un-American.""
Later, Biden attempted to clean up his remarks on x.com, saying that he was referring to the comedian’s joke at the rally.

Biden, who has a life-long history of gaffes, has kept a low profile since he dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris. Last week at a rare campaign event, he attracted attention when he said of Trump “we got to lock him up,” before quickly adding “politically.”

NPR,Pennsylvania county halts hundreds of potentially fraudulent voter registration forms,"Pennsylvania county halts hundreds of potentially fraudulent voter registration forms
Officials in Lancaster County in the swing state of Pennsylvania say they identified hundreds of potentially fraudulent voter registration applications.
""Suspected fraudulent voter registration forms were dropped off at the Board of Elections Office in two batches at or near the deadline for submission,"" the board said in a statement on Friday. ""There are approximately 2,500 voter registration applications total in these two batches.""
It's unclear how many of the applications in the two batches are alleged to be fraudulent.
In its statement, the board stressed that county elections are secure and that flagging the potential fraud indicates the ""systems worked."" Republican-leaning Lancaster County has more than 360,000 registered voters.
The statement said concerns ""were raised during the staff's normal process to review and enter applications into [a state database] and law enforcement was alerted.""
In a news conference Friday with board members, Lancaster County District Attorney Heather Adams said numerous applications appeared to have the same handwriting and other details, like addresses, appeared incorrect on some applications.
Adams said the investigation is ongoing, and wouldn't comment on who may have dropped off the potentially fraudulent forms.
NPR has previously reported that paid canvassing operations have on occasion included fraudulent signatures that were caught.
Friday's announcement followed what officials in Pennsylvania's Bucks County said Thursday was a fake video circulating on social media of county election workers destroying ballots. And across the country, in Colorado's Mesa County, there was news Thursday of another isolated incident: an investigation into alleged voter fraud concerning about a dozen ballots.",2024-10-25
NPR,GOP lawsuits about an obscure immigration database may set up election challenges,"GOP lawsuits about an obscure immigration database may set up election challenges
As former President Donald Trump and his allies spread baseless conspiracy theories about Democrats bringing in noncitizens to vote illegally, GOP state officials are escalating last-minute demands on the Biden administration to check the citizenship of voters on their state rolls.
In recent days, Florida, Texas and Ohio have each sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security over the issue. They argue a longstanding data sharing program, which the federal government has offered states over the last dozen years for this purpose, is insufficient.
""The Biden-Harris Administration has refused to comply with the law and has failed to supply Texas with the required information necessary to secure the integrity of Texas elections,"" Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement.
But with Election Day around the corner, the states' demands are coming far too late to be considered credible, according to election law experts and voting officials.
Instead, the lawsuits are ""in service of a fraudulent narrative — which is the notion that widespread numbers of noncitizens are intentionally registering and voting — which is patent garbage,"" said Justin Levitt, a constitutional law professor at Loyola Law School who also served as an adviser on voting rights issues for the Biden administration.
Levitt said lawsuits filed right before an election usually request expedited review, but none of these suits did, indicating that the goal may be to publicize the issue rather than get a ruling quickly.
Kim Wyman — a Republican former secretary of state of Washington who also served as senior adviser for election security to DHS' Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency — agreed that the timing of the lawsuits seemed more like ""posturing"" and planning for post-election litigation.
""What I've seen in my experience of elections is that when a group or an organization or a person files a lawsuit related to an election this close to Election Day, they're really kind of putting a placeholder in,"" Wyman said.
Kenneth Parreno, an attorney with the nonprofit Protect Democracy that describes itself as ""defeating the authoritarian threat,"" calls suits like these ""zombies.""
""These are lawsuits that are dead on arrival because they're meritless"" Parreno said, adding that after the election, litigants could potentially ""bring these claims back to life and point to them as a basis for challenging the outcome of the election and trying to stop the lawful transition of power.""
An America First priority
Florida, Texas and Ohio are among several Republican-led states that recently asked the federal government to verify citizens on their voter rolls, though so far they are the only ones to have filed lawsuits.
America First Legal, an organization led by former Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller, sent letters to states over the summer with an ""emergency action plan"" that encouraged them to make such requests and said states could sue if DHS failed to respond. At least a half dozen states then sent letters with data requests to DHS' U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
In a June press release, Miller, who is credited as the architect of Trump's immigration policies, claimed without citing evidence that Biden was ""handing out voter registration forms to migrants"" and there is a ""direct effort to sabotage the 2024 election through potential mass illegal alien voting.""
Finding citizenship data isn't easy
Everyone who registers to vote in federal elections must attest, under penalty of perjury, that they are U.S. citizens. Documented cases of noncitizens voting in federal races are incredibly rare, likely because those who try face the possibility of prison and deportation.
There is no database of all U.S. citizens. Election officials typically use a hodgepodge of different data sources to suss out whether their rolls are accurate and up-to-date.
Since 2012, the federal government has offered states the opportunity to use a federal immigration data system known as Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, as a tool for checking if a potential voter is a naturalized citizen, a noncitizen who has interacted with the federal government or someone who acquired U.S. citizenship after being born abroad.
SAVE does not include records for American citizens born in the U.S. or people who entered the country illegally and have remained off the radar of federal officials. Not all of the data is necessarily up to date. Searches cost $1.50 per query, and agencies can only search for people one at a time.
The system's burdensome quirks have long been a thorn in the side of voting officials, so its use has been fairly limited for elections.
Just 10 states are registered with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to use the SAVE system for voting purposes, and even fewer have systems in place to use it regularly to clean up their voting lists. Four of the 10 states registered in the past few months. Some states that do not have a SAVE agreement for voting purposes check voter citizenship in other ways, such as by cross-checking data with the department of motor vehicles.
Georgia recently began doing regular SAVE searches of registered voters who had indicated in other interactions with the state that they were noncitizens. A recent audit yielded 20 suspected noncitizens on the rolls, out of 8.2 million registered voters (0.00024% of the state's list).
Florida has been using SAVE for elections since 2012 and Texas has been working with USCIS to gain access to it for voter list maintenance, according to court filings. Ohio's agreement began in July, and the state logged more than 20,000 queries.
The argument put forth by America First Legal, and echoed in state letters, however, is that SAVE is not a sufficient resource because it requires states to know an alien identification number or citizenship certificate number to query the system. The states are asking the federal government to offer checks based on first name, last name and date of birth of registered voters using a different system reserved for internal federal government use.
With just weeks before Election Day, states made enormous requests. Texas asked the federal government to check 454,289 voters, and Indiana requested verification for 585,774, even though the states offered no reason to believe those voters may not be citizens.
Such checks would have to be done individually and manually by federal government employees and still would not yield a ""definitive result,"" according to an official at the Department of Homeland Security, who spoke to NPR on background.
The director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Ur Jaddou, responded on Oct. 10 to all states who had made requests, saying that the SAVE program ""is the most secure and efficient way to reliably verify an individual's citizenship or immigration status,"" and said the agency ""currently cannot offer an alternative process to any state.""
Requests that missed the federal deadline
Both Florida and Texas sent their data requests to the federal government during a period in which federal law prohibits systematic purging of voters. Ohio's initial request was filed just before that period began.
During the 90-day ""quiet period"" before an election, states cannot use database matching to systematically remove voters from rolls.
The rule is to ensure that eligible citizens are not removed in error right before an election.
""States did not act in good faith months and months ago when systematic database matching might have been lawful depending on the way that they went about it,"" said Kate Huddleston, an attorney with Campaign Legal Center, which has sued states this election cycle for not observing the quiet period.
""Instead [they] are raising this really at the eleventh hour at a time when it would be unlawful to do exactly what they want to do,"" Huddleston said.
When asked about the timing of Texas' request given the 90-day rule, Alicia Pierce, a spokesperson for the Texas secretary of state, wrote in an email: ""All voter list maintenance is being done in compliance with state and federal law.""
Dan Lusheck, a spokesperson for the Ohio secretary of state, said the state began requesting information in the summer. ""The Department failed to respond to several times, and ultimately waited until mid-October to reject the request. Their inaction determined the timing of the lawsuit.""
Florida's Department of State did not respond to an NPR inquiry about that point.
A senior election official in a state that uses SAVE agreed that the timing of the requests and the lawsuits made clear the states were not serious in their efforts. The election official, who did not have permission to speak on the record about the issue, told NPR that voting administrators across the political spectrum have been frustrated with SAVE for years, but that this sort of ""gamesmanship"" is only meant to score political points, not improve voting lists.
""All these people, even the ones that are bringing the lawsuits, know full well that there aren't more than a handful of noncitizens registered to vote,"" said the official, who has worked for both Republican and Democratic administrations. ""But they can make a lot of political hay by bringing it up now.""
In the days after Florida filed its lawsuit, an analysis by the University of Washington's Center for an Informed Public found the announcement prompted the spread of misleading narratives on social media about noncitizens voting and the federal government's actions.
The voting official added they assumed the states suing are actually hoping to lose their cases, so they have something to point to should the election not go Donald Trump's way.
""The really sad truth is that in the deep, dark recesses of their brains, they're hoping they lose these cases so that they continue to have problems accessing that data and can use it as a political cudgel to make their point,"" the official said.",2024-10-25
NPR,"Harris will spend election night at Howard University, the HBCU that helped shape her","Harris will spend election night at Howard University, the HBCU that helped shape her
Vice President Harris will spend election night at her alma mater, Howard University, the historically Black college in Washington that she has said had a big impact on her identity and her desire to become a lawyer.
The location was confirmed to NPR by a person familiar with her plans, who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of the official announcement.
Howard is where Harris first ran a campaign, as a freshman class representative, and where she pledged her sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha. When Harris launched her presidential campaign in 2019, she made the announcement formally from Howard. She also camped out at Howard for debate prep in August.
“I have so many fond memories as a student at “The Mecca,” Harris wrote, referring to the school’s nickname in a letter she wrote this month to the student newspaper, the Hilltop. “I recognize that Howard shaped me into the person I am today.”
Harris is the first vice president to be an HBCU alum, and would make history as the first president to be a graduate if she wins.
Former President Donald Trump will have a watch party at a convention center in West Palm Beach, Fla., his campaign has said.
The results of the election may not be called on Tuesday night as ballot counting in this close race could take several days, as it did four years ago. It’s unclear where Harris will plan to spend the days following Election Day at Howard.
Her campaign, though, is preparing for several outcomes, including the chance that former President Trump tries to challenge the election results if Harris is the winner.
“We have certainly a lot of resources that are dedicated to that possibility, knowing he’s done it before,” Harris said to WISN-12, a local news station in Milwaukee Tuesday night.
When asked to expand on what she meant, the vice president said, “I mean we got a lot of lawyers.”",2024-10-30
NPR,The election in Georgia is tight. Meet 5 groups of voters who will shape the outcome,"The election in Georgia is tight. Meet 5 groups of voters who will shape the outcome
ATLANTA — Georgia had among the tightest margins of any swing state in 2020. That year, Joe Biden won the Peach State by 11,779 votes, the first Democrat to capture Georgia’s electoral votes since 1992.
Since then, Georgia voters reelected a Republican governor and Democratic U.S. senator in 2022. Polls suggest Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are locked in a tight race and both campaigns have devoted significant resources to winning the state.
Harris is campaigning in Atlanta on Saturday and Trump has a rally scheduled near Macon on Sunday.
While Georgia had been a Republican stronghold since the early 2000s, this Sun Belt state has been growing in population and diversity, especially in the suburbs around Atlanta.
In a state decided recently by such small margins, subtle shifts among any demographic can matter. And of course, no demographic is a monolith — political diversity certainly exists within races, classes and geographies. But here are five groups of voters to watch who will be key in determining who wins Georgia — and possibly the presidency.
Suburban women
Atlanta’s suburbs have been a key driver of the political shifts in Georgia over the last decade. As they have gained population and become more diverse, many suburban communities that have historically been deep red have become more purple.
In Atlanta’s northern suburbs, home to many well-off, highly educated voters, the Trump presidency and the overturning of Roe v. Wade accelerated flight from the Republican Party.
On the town green in Alpharetta, which is decorated with scarecrows for Halloween, friends Emily Lillystone and Shawna Goelz both say they are not thrilled with their choices for president.
Both identify as political independents, support abortion rights and believe Republicans would be better for their family finances. Both voted for Biden in 2020. But this year, they came to different conclusions in the presidential race. Lillystone is voting for Harris; Goelz for Trump, even though she thinks he is “morally awful.”
“I don’t think as a woman I want the government involved in what I’m deciding to do with my body and nor do I want that for my daughters,” says Lillystone.
Georgia law bans most abortions after roughly six weeks. The law took effect after the conservative majority on the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade.
“I completely agree with everything Emily said,” Goelz says. “However, I feel like my safety walking down the street to get a soda is more important than whether or not my daughter can have an abortion.”
FBI data shows violent crime fell nationwide in 2023, including in Atlanta, but many Americans still report feeling unsafe and crime has been a keystone of Republican campaign messaging.
Atlanta’s suburbs helped propel Biden’s win in 2020. During the midterms that followed, they were home to many of the tens of thousands of voters who split their tickets between Democrat Raphael Warnock for U.S. Senate and Republican Brian Kemp for governor.
Young voters
Voters ages 18-29 account for roughly 21% of registered voters in Georgia. The relatively young population is one reason CIRCLE, the Tufts University research center focused on young voters, ranks Georgia among the top states where young voters can play a key role in the election.
However, CIRCLE also found voter registration among 18-29 year-olds in Georgia is down 8% from 2020.
Millennial and Gen Z voters regularly cite housing affordability and student loan relief as top issues driving their vote. For Sydney Craddock, a first-year biology major at Spelman College in Atlanta, she is thinking most about reproductive rights and the chance to elect the first woman to the White House.
“This is probably one of the biggest elections we’ve had so far,” Craddock says. “As an African American woman, to have someone like that in a position of power as president, is crazy to me. Little Black girls, we didn’t see people in those positions that look like us.”
Like other age groups, there is also a gender gap between Harris and Trump among young voters. The most recent Harvard Youth Poll Survey found that young women favor Harris over Trump by 30 points, compared to 10 points for young men. The Trump campaign sees young men as prime targets for outreach.
Jackson Anderson, an 18-year-old trade school student from Newnan, Ga., studying construction management, is voting for the first time this fall and says Trump represents the kind of toughness he wants to see in a president.
“I know he’s a fighter,” Anderson says, waiting in line for a recent Trump rally in Atlanta. “As we saw, July 13th, he got shot and raised his fist in the air, and he said, ‘Fight, fight, fight.’ I know he cares about this country. He doesn’t give up.”
Black men
Black voters make up roughly 30% of registered voters in Georgia — the highest proportion of any swing state. Black women are the most reliable Democratic voting powerhouse, with Black men not far behind, but some polls have suggested softening support for Democrats among Black men.
Eric Alston is a regular at Cascade Skating Rink in Atlanta. On a recent Wednesday night, Alston was lacing up his rollerskates when R&B star Usher showed up for a get out the vote event.
Alston says he wishes he had other choices for president. He says Trump and Harris are neither all good or all bad in his eyes. Earlier in the campaign, he did not totally rule out voting for either of them. At 61, protecting Social Security and ensuring it keeps pace with inflation is a priority for him.
“For our older members of the country that served in the military, worked jobs, kept communities going and raised families, now they’re reaching a point where they’re not going to receive the help they paid into a system to receive,” Alston says.
Despite reservations about both candidates, Alston says he would never skip an election, noting he was born before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
“Oh I’m definitely not going to stay at home,” Alston says. “A no-vote is unfathomable from where I come from. I was born without all my rights. There is no way I would abdicate exercising such an important responsibility as a citizen.”
Even though Alston did have some openness to Trump, he says in the end, he cannot get over how he conducted himself in office.
An October NAACP poll of registered voters found that the likelihood of Black men under 50 voting for Trump decreased to 21%, down from 27% in August.
Shaquille Booker, 28, an Atlanta artist and kickboxer also skating at Cascade, said earlier this month he had not done much research about the election, but he planned to. Undecided between Harris and Trump, Booker says he usually votes, but did not in 2020. Lowering taxes and making it easier to start a small business, he says, would most directly impact his life.
“I care about fair treatment and equal job opportunities,” Booker says.
Asian American/Pacific Islander and Latinos
University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock has a rule of thumb that for Democrats to win Georgia: they have to capture 30% of white voters and Black voters have to comprise 30% of the voters who cast ballots. But Emory University political science professor Andra Gillespie says that rule may need a slight update, as Asian Americans and Latinos become a larger share of the electorate.
Judy Zhu and Wei Kang Ding are voting in their first presidential election, after casting their first ballots in the 2022 midterms once they became U.S. citizens. They have been taking their vote very seriously, watching debates and researching the platforms of the candidates and political parties.
Zhu says they have friends in their community across the political spectrum, from strong Trump or Harris supporters to undecided voters and those who are just plain fed up. For Zhu, the economy, health care and democracy are driving her vote.
“I think I have definitely changed my mind a couple of times before I finally decided who to vote for,” Zhu says. While she did not want to share publicly who she landed on, she did say her and her husband did not vote for the same presidential candidate.
Georgia’s AAPI population grew by 48% between 2012 and 2022, according to the nonprofit Asian Americans Advancing Justice Atlanta. Indian Americans, Korean Americans and Chinese Americans comprise the largest AAPI communities in Georgia.
The AAPI turnout rate has lagged behind white and Black voters, but participation is increasing.
According to AAJA, the AAPI turnout rate increased by 7% between 2018 and 2022 midterm elections.
Reading a comic book at the Peachy Corners Cafe, which serves bubble tea and Vietnamese coffee, Tha Vin says this election felt so important, he gathered his whole family to go to the polls together.
As a former refugee who came to the U.S. from Cambodia in 1980, Vin says the language some Republicans, including Trump, are using to describe immigrants is shaping his vote.
“I’m a gun owner, like I find I want to vote Republican,” Vin said. “But the rhetoric toward immigrants has been something that has made me not want to vote Republican.”
Like Georgia’s AAPI community, the Latino electorate is also growing. The state’s Latino eligible voter population quadrupled since 2000, according to the Latino Data Hub at UCLA. Latinos now account about 4.6% of registered voters in Georgia.
While both Latino and AAPI voters skew heavily Democratic, these groups are not homogenous and have diversity in voting preferences. Republicans think they can make up ground with some of these voters.
Daniela Usurin, who came to the U.S. from Uruguay 54 years ago, is voting for Trump because of his pledge to crack down on illegal immigration, which she says hurts people who came to the U.S. legally like her. She is also concerned by inflation.
“The prices of food and gas, they’re just getting way too high,” Usurin says. “I’m retired. I’m glad that I have a pension in addition to social security, otherwise I couldn’t make it.”
Voters outside metro Atlanta
Harris and Trump have held most of their rallies this year in vote-rich Metro Atlanta, home to the state’s Democratic engine and also to the independent-minded suburban voters both parties need to reach.
But to win, Republicans need to juice turnout in barn-red counties, activating low-propensity voters who have become engaged in politics because of Trump. Democrats need to cut into Republican margins in pockets of the state outside Atlanta, believing they can lose by less in rural counties and smaller metros.
One way Democrats are doing this is by engaging rural Black voters who historically have not received much attention from campaigns. Democratic candidates like Stacey Abrams and U.S. Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock pursued this approach in recent campaigns.
At a campaign rally with former President Bill Clinton in Columbus, Heather Smith says the attention is an encouraging sign. Smith lives in nearby Harris County, which hugs the Alabama border and remembers Clinton campaigning in Columbus in 1992, the year she turned 18.
“People are just out here working and doing their thing and they really don’t want to watch the news anymore,” Smith says. “So face to face contact is going to be the difference.”
Across the state, outside Augusta, Trump won Columbia County with 66% of the vote in 2016. He won it by 4 points less in 2020.
Columbia County resident Jennifer Michael supported former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley in the GOP primary. When Haley dropped out of the race, Michael was devastated, but not surprised.
Since then, she has struggled with how to vote and Michael says her analysis “only changed a little bit,” when Biden stepped aside.
“There’s been just so much turmoil and honestly I had an overarching feeling of dread,” she says. “There’s no other way to say it. It just wasn’t pretty.”
Michael, who is retired, says she cares about preserving Medicare and Social Security. She also supports abortion rights and has concerns about the border, but is hopeful Harris means it when she talks about signing the bipartisan border bill that stalled earlier this year. She says lately she has had to focus on cleaning up damage from Hurricane Helene, but has been trying to learn more about Harris.
“To see if she was somebody I could either be happy voting for, be okay voting for, or one of those where you hold your nose and you vote anyway,” Michael says. “I still don’t know. It will not be Trump. I can be 1000% sure it will not be him. Another Trump presidency scares the bejesus out of me.”",2024-11-01
NPR,DOJ lawyers slam 'glaring gap' in failure to investigate potential Israeli crimes,"DOJ lawyers slam 'glaring gap' in failure to investigate potential Israeli crimes
Justice Department attorneys wrote to Attorney General Merrick Garland this week, calling out the “glaring gap” between the department’s approach to crimes committed by Russia and Hamas — versus the department’s silence on potential crimes committed by Israeli forces and civilians.
The four-page letter, dated Oct. 21, explicitly calls on the department to investigate potential crimes committed by Israeli soldiers and civilians, including the killings of American citizens in the West Bank and Gaza.
""In prosecuting crimes committed by Russia, Hamas and other wrongdoers, the Department has appropriately demonstrated its commitment to upholding the rule of law in the midst of ongoing geopolitical conflicts,"" the letter says. “But against the backdrop of numerous potential violations of U.S. law by individuals and entities affiliated with Israel, the Department’s silence and apparent inaction is a stark omission.”
The letter, which was first reported by Zeteo, a new media organization on Substack, is a rare instance of public disagreement from within the Justice Department. Unlike at the State Department, there is no established internal channel for DOJ employees to express dissent over a policy issue.
NPR reported two weeks ago on the Justice Department's silence over four U.S. citizens killed this year in the West Bank and Gaza Strip — the victims' families say by Israelis — despite demands from the Americans' families that the department investigate.
The DOJ letter was anonymously signed “your colleagues.” NPR has confirmed that the three authors of the letter are mid-career attorneys at the Justice Department, two of whom work at department headquarters in Washington, D.C.
It's unclear how widespread the views expressed in the letter are among the approximately 10,000 attorneys who work at the Justice Department, or what impact it could have.
One of the authors, speaking on condition of anonymity due to concerns about potential professional retaliation, told NPR the letter was emailed Monday from a non-department email account to a senior official in the attorney general’s office.
The Justice Department declined to comment for this story.
""Fair and impartial application""
During his time as attorney general, Garland has frequently spoken about upholding norms and ""treating like cases alike."" That was the theme of a major speech he delivered in the department’s Great Hall to the DOJ workforce on Sept. 12.
In that speech, the letter says, Garland told the department's employees that ""as attorneys for the government, we should not be influenced by, among other factors, a person’s background, our feelings concerning the victims, and the effect of a charging decision on our professional and personal circumstances.”
The letter also raises remarks Garland made after Congress passed the Justice for Victims of War Crimes Act in 2022, which allows the department to prosecute a suspected war criminal in the U.S., regardless of the individual’s nationality.
""In the United States of America, there must be no hiding place for war criminals and no safe haven for those who commit such atrocities,"" Garland said at the time. ""This bill will help the Justice Department fulfill that important mandate.""
After Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Garland publicly condemned the “war crimes that the entire world has seen,” and set up a special team to focus on possible Russian atrocities. The department has since charged four Russian soldiers with war crimes in Ukraine for allegedly abducting and torturing an American citizen.
In the Israel-Hamas conflict, Garland has publicly confirmed the department is investigating the killing and kidnapping of Americans in Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel. The department also has brought terrorism charges against six Hamas leaders.
But, the letter says, there has been a “glaring gap” in the department’s enforcement of potential violations of U.S. law by Israeli government forces and citizens.
“Despite credible evidence of violations of U.S. law, and in contrast to the department’s public position regarding crimes committed by Russia in its invasion of Ukraine, the department has taken no public steps to hold the perpetrators to account, even when the victims are U.S. citizens,” it says.
The letter lists several Americans citizens who have been killed this year by Israeli soldiers or civilians, including Jacob Flickinger, Aysenur Eygi, Tawfic Abdel Jabbar and Mohammad Khdour.
“Not only has no one been held to account, but the department has made virtually no public announcement of any investigations or even an acknowledgment of its commitment to seek accountability,” the letter says.
It also says that there is “credible evidence” that the Israeli military may have committed war crimes in Gaza, including forced displacement and starvation, unlawful confinement, torture and inhumane treatment of Palestinian detainees and mass destruction of civilian property and infrastructure.
Warning about 'apparatus of politics'
The International Criminal Court prosecutor has requested arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defense minister on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The prosecutor also requested arrest warrants for three top Hamas figures on the same charges, although all three have been been killed by Israel.
Israel, a close American ally that the U.S. supplies with weapons, says its actions in Gaza have been in accordance with the laws of war.
The DOJ attorneys' letter points out that U.S. courts would have jurisdiction over Israeli soldiers or officials who travel to the U.S., as well as the more than 23,000 U.S. citizens who it says are currently serving in the Israeli military.
The same rigor that has been applied to holding Russian and Hamas perpetrators to account should be applied “where the perpetrators are acting on behalf of a political ally and the victims are stateless,” the letter says. “The disparate treatment of conduct by Israeli actors, reflected both in public statements and in charges the Department has brought, risks the precise implication you warned against—that our department has become ‘an apparatus of politics.’”
The department should open investigations into the killings of Americans and potential Israeli war crimes, if it has not already done so, the letter says, and state publicly that it is investigating. The letter also suggests that DOJ and FBI create a webpage for collecting evidence of potential Israeli war crimes, similar to what was set up for collecting evidence of possible Russian war crimes.
“Doing so will not only allow the department to raise awareness and provide guidance to those who may possess evidence of such crimes, but it will restore the public’s faith in the department’s commitment to basic principles of justice and equality under the law,” it says.",2024-10-25
NPR,Women sharing personal stories about abortion bans have become a political force,"Women sharing personal stories about abortion bans have become a political force
If the US Supreme Court had not overturned Roe v. Wade, Nancy Davis and Kaitlyn Joshua might never have met, or become public figures.
But within weeks of the ban taking effect in 2022, both women were denied abortion care in their home state of Louisiana.
Ever since, they have been talking about their frightening and fraught experiences, joining a new wave of women willing to publicly share their medical experiences, and wielding a new kind of political power.
Dozens of women have been speaking out loud what many previously had kept private. As part of the fight for abortion rights, many of them have been campaigning across the country for politicians — especially Vice President Kamala Harris — and participating in media interviews, political rallies, protests and lawsuits.
It’s an open question, but some believe their stories and the reproductive rights issue could change election outcomes — both at the federal level, and in states, including those considering ballot initiatives on abortion rights.
How Davis and Joshua went public
In the summer of 2022, Nancy Davis, already a mother of two girls, was expecting her third child. In late July, when she was 10 weeks pregnant, her doctors in Baton Rouge told her the fetus was developing without a skull. It’s called acrania, and is always fatal for the fetus.
But Louisiana had banned nearly all abortions on Aug. 1, and after that, Davis’s doctors refused to terminate her pregnancy.
Davis was devastated, and then she took a dramatic next step, one that has become increasingly common since the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe in the Dobbs case. She went public.
Davis emailed a local TV station in Baton Rouge, and started giving interviews to other local, and then national, news outlets.
Davis soon hired a civil rights lawyer and held a press conference on the steps of the Louisiana capitol, calling on state lawmakers to change the law. Her goal was to save other women from hearing the message the doctors had given her: “Basically they said I had to carry my baby, to bury my baby,” Davis said.
Even with all this publicity, it took Davis several weeks to gather enough money to travel to New York to end her pregnancy. Through it all, she continued to speak out, even appearing on the Dr. Phil show.
“I knew if I was going through it, other people was going through it as well,” Davis told NPR.
A frightening miscarriage at home
While Davis was talking to the media, another Baton Rouge woman, Kaitlyn Joshua, was beginning her own slow-motion collision with the new state law. It was early September 2022, and Joshua was 11 weeks pregnant with her second child. She was busy getting ready for her daughter’s fourth birthday, when she started miscarrying.
She was in excruciating pain, and bleeding so much that her husband feared for her life.
Over the course of two days, Joshua went to two different emergency rooms seeking abortion care to empty her uterus and complete the miscarriage. This would lessen the bleeding and pain.
But Louisiana’s abortion ban had only been in effect for six weeks, so doctors refused to perform a D&C procedure or prescribe medications for the miscarriage. Joshua ended up miscarrying at home, with only her family’s support, in pain and frightened for her health.
Joshua remembered seeing Davis telling her story in the news. She was inspired to go public as well. She spoke at a state health department hearing on Louisiana’s abortion ban, and later told her story to NPR and then to other prominent outlets.
Joshua and Davis met at an abortion rights rally in 2023 and became friends.
They lean on each other for support, especially when testifying against anti-abortion laws in Louisiana’s legislature capitol, which is 76% male, majority white, and comprised of a supermajority of anti-abortion Republicans.
Hitting the campaign trail with Democrats
Both Davis and Joshua began traveling with President Biden’s re-election campaign, and later switched to campaigning with Vice President Kamala Harris. Both women attended the 2023 State of the Union address.
Joshua appeared in a television campaign ad for Biden. She was also one of several women who spoke at the Democratic National Convention in August, sharing traumatic stories about how the Dobbs decision had harmed their pregnancy care.
“No woman should experience what I endured, but too many have,” Joshua told the convention crowd and millions of voters watching from home. “They write to me, saying, ‘What happened to you, happened to me.’”
The convention also featured two Texas women who sued their state after being denied abortions — Kate Cox, denied care after receiving a fatal fetal diagnosis, and Amanda Zurawski, who became septic after doctors refused to provide miscarriage care.
Another speaker was Anya Cook, a Florida patient who lost half her blood volume after she was denied abortion care and began miscarrying in a bathroom.
There have been many more patients with similar stories going public over the last two years. And those stories have helped shape the election in new ways.
How abortion storytellers could change voters' minds
On November 5, voters in 10 states will decide whether to add abortion rights to their state constitutions.
Depending on the outcomes, areas of the South and Midwest could experience dramatic reversals after two years of extremely rigid bans on abortion.
Vice President Harris is counting on support for abortion rights to help lead her to victory, and has promised to sign any federal bill that Congress might pass restoring abortions.
Republicans, sensing the political headwinds, have toned down aggressive anti-abortion messaging.
Former President Donald Trump has sent mixed messages, boasting about appointing the three Supreme Court Justices who helped overturn Roe, while also claiming his second term would be “great for women and their reproductive rights.”
Can personal stories sway voters?
Preliminary political research indicates that women like Davis and Joshua, telling their own personal stories, are reaching voters.
These stories have proliferated. A study from the University of California at San Francisco of major newspaper coverage found that just one year after the Supreme Court overturned Roe, 20% of stories about abortion included a patient’s personal experience — up from just 4% as recently as 2018.
These stories often feature women with wanted pregnancies who were denied medical care, said one of the study authors, Katie Woodruff.
“Certainly the general public did not expect an abortion ban to be affecting basic maternal health,” she said.
One poll found women voters rank abortion as their number two priority this election cycle, just a few points behind the economy.
Over three-quarters of women want abortion legal in all or most cases, another survey found. Even in swing states, majorities of both Democrats and Republicans told pollsters they support abortion rights.
Harvard professor Robert Blendon cautioned that voters often say they support certain policies, but that support hasn’t always dictated who they end up voting for.
But this year, there are some signals that the new cadre of abortion storytellers could be turning surging support for abortion rights into actual votes.
Tresa Undem, a pollster with PerryUndem, said her surveys show that voters who have heard stories like Davis and Joshua’s, when compared to those who haven't, are more likely to say the state of abortion rights will affect who they cast their ballot for in 2024.
The shift was particularly striking among independents who favor abortion rights: 73% who heard those stories said the abortion issue will affect which candidate they vote for.
But for those who hadn’t heard such stories, only 21% said the abortion issue would affect who they vote for.
Undem added that despite the rising media coverage, Republicans are less likely to have heard the stories of women denied care.
How advocates for ballot measures are using the stories
Advocates in Florida, one of the 10 states with an abortion rights measure on the November ballot, have made these stories central to their advertising and messaging.
The campaign is featuring the stories of women such as Cook and Shanae Smith-Cunningham, two Floridians who were each denied care after their waters broke early in pregnancy. Canvassers for the “Yes on 4” campaign bring them up every time they knock on a voter’s door.
“Our hope is that those stories are so impactful that they remember when they are in the ballot booth,” said Natasha Sutherland, the communications director for the ""Yes on 4"" campaign.
Organizers who recently won abortion rights ballot measures in Ohio and Michigan told NPR that personal stories were key to getting out the vote.
“That's what actually drives it home for people and makes them realize, ‘Wow, I need to get to the polls to do this, because there's somebody out there in my town, in my community, maybe in my family, that's counting on me to take this action,’” said Gabriel Mann, who worked as the communications director for Ohioans for Reproductive Rights, the group that passed Issue 1 establishing abortion rights in 2023.
Nicole Wells Stallworth, one of the leaders of Michigan’s Proposal 3 in 2022, said the campaign leaned into abortion stories after internal polling showed just how effective it was.
She said ads featuring women’s personal stories increased support for the proposal by an average of 5.7%. With moderate voters the shift was even greater: 6.9%.
The risks and rewards for abortion storytellers
All that data underline what Davis and Joshua say they have experienced routinely after telling their stories: people change their minds.
Joshua has spoken to Black conservative Christians about her story, and then heard them preach from the pulpit about the need for abortion care, she said. Davis’s own mother, who used to oppose abortion rights, now supports them, Davis said.
“People even say ‘You know, I've crossed over.’ Or, like, ‘Now I'm pro-choice, or, like, you made me change my way of thinking,” Davis said.
Speaking out can attract strong political blowback and online harassment.
After Joshua spoke at the Democratic National Convention, Louisina’s Attorney General posted on X that “Democrats have their facts wrong.”
Davis has found anti-abortion groups commenting on her story and suggesting that her fetus could have somehow lived without a skull.
Both women went on to have healthy pregnancies after their medical experiences being denied abortions.
Joshua now has a one-year-old son. Davis’s daughter, her third, was born in the spring.
Both continue to travel for the Harris campaign, children in tow, while juggling their jobs and other commitments.
Joshua was recently named one of the Women of the Year by Glamour magazine.
One question Joshua keeps encountering is why she doesn’t just leave Louisiana.
“And I'm like ‘No. I am a Black woman in Louisiana. My people built the state. We're gonna stay and fight for the state that we love,’” Joshua said.
“And I just think that says so much more.”

NPR,Harris makes her final pitch for her presidency : Consider This from NPR,"Harris makes her final pitch for her presidency
On Tuesday night, one week before election day, Vice President Kamala Harris made her closing argument to the American people.
""America, for too long we have been consumed with too much division, chaos and mutual distrust, and it can be easy then to forget a simple truth, it doesn't have to be this way,"" she said.
Standing at a podium on the Ellipse with the White House lit up behind her, the democratic nominee spoke to what the Harris campaign said was a crowd of 75-thousand.
The choice of venue was both visually striking and symbolic: It's the site where former President Donald Trump rallied his supporters on January 6, 2021 before they went on to attack the U.S. Capitol.
""Look, we all know who Donald Trump is,"" Harris said. ""He is the person who stood at this very spot nearly four years ago and sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol to overturn the will of the people in a free and fair election that he knew he lost.""
Over about half an hour, Harris made her final pitch to voters, reviewing the agenda she would pursue as President, and arguing Donald Trump poses an existential threat to American democracy.

Harris' case against Trump
Vice President Kamala Harris started off her campaign with a joyful message, offering voters ""a new way forward."" In the final weeks of the campaign, Harris has shifted to an anti-Trump focus, warning voters of the consequences of another Trump presidency.
Harris hit that point again in Tuesday's speech, hoping to combat what Democrats call ""Trump amnesia,"" says NPR's Deepa Shivaram.
""That's why you have Harris referring to abortion restrictions as 'Trump' abortion bans, trying to bring things Trump did back into the spotlight.""
This is such a close election that Harris not only has to bring out her base of Democratic voters, but also expand on that. Shivaram says it's essential for her to appeal to Republican voters who dislike the things Trump has done – like his actions on January 6th.
The campaign's final push
While her campaign has shifted anti-Trump, Harris has consistently emphasized that her campaign isn't all about voting against her opponent.
At Tuesday's event, Harris reminded voters of the agenda she would pursue as president. Some policy priorities she highlighted in her speech include expanding and restoring reproductive rights, and expanding Medicare to cover at home care for seniors.
Harris also promised to be a voice of unity.
""Donald Trump has spent a decade trying to keep the American people divided and afraid of each other. That's who he is,"" she said. ""But America, I am here tonight to say: That's not who we are.""
With less than a week until Election Day, Harris will be visiting seven swing states multiple times, doing more interviews, podcasts and other non-traditional media in an effort to appear in as many places as possible.

NPR,DA recommends resentencing of Menendez brothers for the 1989 slaying of their parents,"DA recommends resentencing of Menendez brothers for the 1989 slaying of their parents
Erik and Lyle Menendez should be resentenced for the 1989 slaying of their parents, the Los Angeles County District Attorney recommended on Thursday, citing recent public attention to the case in the wake of a new documentary about the brothers.
The recommendation will be presented to a Los Angeles Superior Court judge, and the brothers, who are serving life sentences, would be eligible for parole, District Attorney George Gascón said.
""Under the law, resentencing is appropriate,"" Gascón said, making clear that he still believed that the crime of murder had been committed but that there had been extenuating circumstances that made resentencing appropriate.
""I understand that sometimes people can get desperate,"" Gascón said.
Gascón said that because the two brothers were under the age of 26 at the time of the killings, he recommended the sentencing be changed from life without the possibility of parole instead to the lesser sentence of 50 years to life, which would make the Menendez brothers now eligible for release.
More than 30 years after the pair were convicted of the brutal murders of their parents, the case continues to grip the national focus, including a recent Netflix series about the siblings and deep dives by social media sleuths over the years.
On Aug. 20, 1989, Jose and Kitty Menendez were shot to death in their Beverly Hills home while they were watching television.
Two juries deadlocked in 1994 after Lyle, now 56 years old, and Erik, 53, testified that they shot their parents in self-defense. The brothers said they had feared their parents were going to kill them to prevent stories emerging about the alleged physical and sexual abuse of their sons.
The brothers said that Jose, a record executive, had been sexually abusive, while Kitty turned a blind eye to their molestation.
Jose has also been accused by one of the members of the hit Latin band Menudo, who said the then-RCA Records exec molested him in his early teens.
The Menendez brothers were 18 and 21 years old at the time of the killings.
After the shootings, the two went on a lavish spending spree, and initially, authorities believed that the murders had been the result of a mafia hit.
The brothers would eventually admit to killing their parents, citing the abuse, which was corroborated by another family member.
After a second trial, in which a judge limited testimony related to their sexual abuse, the brothers were convicted of the shooting deaths of their parents.
“Since the original prosecution of the Menendez brothers more than nearly three decades ago, our office has gained a deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding sexual violence,"" Gascón said.
""We recognize that it is a widespread issue impacting individuals of all gender identities, and we remain steadfast in our commitment to support all victims as they navigate the long-lasting effects of such trauma.""",2024-10-24
NPR,Here’s where Trump and Harris stand on 5 issues affecting workers,"Here’s where Trump and Harris stand on 5 issues affecting workers
Both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have promised to make life better for workers if elected. But the presidential candidates’ stances are miles apart on many issues affecting workers, including the minimum wage, overtime pay and the power of labor unions.
Here are five key issues that set the candidates apart:
1. Minimum wage
The federal minimum wage has been set at $7.25 an hour since 2009. Harris has called it ""poverty wages,"" noting it amounts to $15,000 a year for full-time workers. She told NBC News she wanted to increase it to at least $15 an hour, acknowledging that she’d need support in Congress for the change.
During a presidential debate four years ago, Trump said he’d consider a $15-an-hour federal minimum wage, if it does not hurt small businesses. Last month, during a photo-op at a McDonald’s, the former president dodged a question about whether he’d support raising the minimum wage, instead praising the workers and the franchises that employ them.
2. Overtime pay
A lot of Americans work overtime, which both candidates appear to recognize. But they differ on who should be eligible to earn time-and-a-half pay for work exceeding 40 hours a week.
Earlier this year, the Biden-Harris administration finalized a rule making 4 million more workers eligible for overtime pay. The rule is facing multiple legal challenges.
As president, Trump declined to defend a similar Obama-era rule, instead promulgating his own rule which resulted in far fewer people eligible for overtime pay.
Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation blueprint for a second Trump presidency, proposes an overhaul of federal overtime rules that would give employers more flexibility.
Trump has tried to distance himself from the document. But at campaign events this fall, he admitted, as a private-sector employer, he hated paying overtime and would sometimes hire more workers to avoid it.
""I'd say, 'No, get me 10 other guys. I don't want to have time and a half,'"" Trump said in Saginaw, Mich., on October 3.
Still, Trump has tried to use the issue to win over working class voters, by rolling out a proposal to make overtime wages tax-free. Many policy analysts have panned the idea, finding it could cost the government well over $1 trillion in tax revenues over the next decade.
On a side note, Trump — followed by Harris — proposed getting rid of taxes on tips. The Yale Budget Lab estimates even this more limited move would significantly increase the budget deficit while exacerbating inequities.
3. Manufacturing job creation
It’s clear no president will be able to restore America's manufacturing glory of yesteryear. But Trump has successfully drawn many white, working class voters into his fold by promising to bring back and protect their manufacturing jobs, including by lowering the corporate tax rate for domestic manufacturers and imposing tariffs on all imported goods.
Economists have warned, however, that Trump’s proposed tariffs would result in higher prices all around, including for U.S. manufacturers.
Harris has been trying to recapture those votes. She points to legislative wins over the past four years, including the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, that have created manufacturing and construction jobs. She's pledged to expand tax credits for companies that create union jobs in steel, iron and other areas of manufacturing and prioritize the retooling of existing plants in factory towns.
Both candidates have said they'd seek to remove regulatory burdens on manufacturers, allowing them to build new factories more quickly.
4. Labor unions
Where the two candidates perhaps diverge the most is on their view of unions.
Harris wants to strengthen unions and has vowed to get the PRO Act passed. The legislation, aimed at making it easier for workers to organize, has been stalled in Congress for years. She called on the federal government to be a model employer, by giving federal employee unions a bigger seat at the table and directing agencies to make sure their employees know they have a right to join a union.
Under the Biden-Harris administration, the National Labor Relations Board, the federal agency that hears labor disputes, has taken an aggressive approach to protecting workers' rights to organize and collectively bargain. Critics charge that the agency's interpretation of those rights is overly broad. Several companies, including SpaceX and Amazon, have filed lawsuits challenging the constitutionality of the NLRB's very existence.
By contrast, while in the White House, Trump gutted federal employee unions and expressed support for Right to Work laws, which weaken unions by allowing workers to opt out of paying union dues. He stacked the Labor Department and the National Labor Relations Board with corporate-friendly appointees. Project 2025 details more steps he could take to render unions powerless.
In an interview with SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk in August, Trump joked that he liked Musk’s approach to workers. “They go on strike, and you say, ‘That’s OK, you’re all gone. You’re all gone. Every one one of you is gone,’” Trump said.
Still, the former president maintains strong support among some pockets of union workers. In informal polling conducted by the Teamsters union this summer, Teamsters members said they preferred Trump over Harris by a 2-to-1 margin.
5. Noncompetes
Noncompete agreements, which prevent workers from taking a job at a competing business or starting one of their own, have not been a hot topic in the presidential race. Still, the future of these employment clauses could hinge on who wins the election.
An estimated 30 million Americans have signed noncompete agreements with their employers. The Federal Trade Commission voted in April along party lines to ban such agreements, finding that they suppress wages and stifle innovation.
The ban faced immediate legal challenges, and in August, a Trump-appointed federal judge in Texas blocked the rule from taking effect nationwide. U.S. District Judge Ada Brown ruled in favor of Ryan LLC, a tax services firm in Dallas, finding that the FTC had indeed overstepped its authority.
The FTC has appealed the ruling.
While noncompetes aren’t something Harris has spoken about on the campaign trail, she has previously voiced support for the FTC's ban, describing such agreements as ""anti-worker"".
Trump has not addressed noncompetes in his campaign, either.
Notably, among the lawyers representing Ryan LLC in its lawsuit against the FTC is Eugene Scalia, who served as Trump’s labor secretary from 2019 to 2021.
And in 2016, Politico reported that the Trump campaign included a broad noncompete in its own employment agreements, barring staff, volunteers, contractors and contractors' employees from working with any other presidential campaign for the duration of the election.",2024-11-01
NPR,Former model Stacey Williams is latest woman to accuse Trump of sexual misconduct,"Former model Stacey Williams is latest woman to accuse Trump of sexual misconduct
Another woman has accused Donald Trump of sexual misconduct, adding to a list of more than a dozen women who have accused the former president of inappropriate sexual behavior.
Stacey Williams, a former Sports Illustrated model, claims Trump groped her in 1993, while Jeffrey Epstein, who was later convicted of sex offenses, looked on. She recounted the incident to CNN this week, as well as on a Zoom call with Survivors for Kamala, a group that’s unaffiliated with the campaign.
“The second he was in front of me, he pulled me into him, and his hands were just on me and didn’t come off,” she told CNN in an interview.
“Then the hands started moving, and they were on the side of my breasts, on my hips, back down to my butt … they were just on me the whole time.”
In a statement, Trump campaign National Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt denied the allegations on Trump's behalf.
""It's obvious this fake story was contrived by the Harris campaign to distract from the deeply concerning and newly unearthed allegations"" about Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff, Leavitt wrote. Emhoff has been accused of striking an ex-girlfriend in 2012. The Harris campaign has denied this.
""Fake allegations like this are a disservice to women who are truly victims of assault,"" Leavitt added.
The alleged incident between Trump and Williams took place while Williams was dating Epstein, who was, in the 1980s and 1990s, a friend of Trump’s. Epstein had taken Williams to Trump Tower to meet Trump, and she says Trump immediately started groping her.
“This context made no sense because the hands were on me, and then he and Jeffrey just kept talking and looking at each other and smiling,” she said.
“I just had this really, like, sickening feeling that it was coordinated — that somehow the whole thing was, I was rolled in there like a piece of meat for some kind of weird, twisted game.”
Williams also says she received a postcard from Trump shortly after the encounter, where he wrote that Palm Beach, Fla. — site of what's now his Mar-a-Lago Club — was her ""home away from home.""
She told CNN that she didn’t talk about the incident for a long time, out of shame.
“I felt a wave of shame, and I just couldn’t think about it, face it, talk about it for a very long time. I put it in a little box inside of me, turned the key, locked it,” she said.
Many victims of sexual violence remain quiet long after those incidents occur.
Williams joins a list of women who have accused Trump of sexual assault and other forms of sexual misconduct. Trump has denied all of these allegations.
In addition, Trump bragged about groping and kissing women in the Access Hollywood tape, leaked one month before the 2016 election.
With just over a week until Election Day 2024, polls suggest that the electorate could have the widest gender gap in modern election history. Women voters preferred Harris by 18 points in the latest NPR Marist PBS NewsHour poll, while men voters preferred Trump by 16 points.
It’s unclear how much an allegation like this could sway voters; the Access Hollywood tape’s effects have been debated for years, and Trump did ultimately win that close race. In addition, most voters have their minds made up. This year’s polls have been remarkably stable in the months since Harris entered the race.",2024-10-25
NPR,Harris brings a bit of Trump into her rally to try to show him as ‘unhinged’,"Harris brings a bit of Trump into her rally to try to show him as ‘unhinged’
ERIE, Pa. — Vice President Harris brought a little bit of her Republican rival into her own campaign event on Monday in a bid to try to make more people pay attention to some of the most extreme threats he has made on the trail.
Saying “Please roll the clip” and pointing to a large video screen, Harris took the unusual step of showing a packed arena of supporters a highlight reel of former President Donald Trump that she said illustrates that he is “increasingly unstable and unhinged.”
The 30-second montage showed Trump repeatedly complaining about “the enemy from within” suggesting they should be jailed — or dealt with violently. Harris’ use of the clips is a sign she plans to ratchet up warnings about Trump in the homestretch.
“He is out for unchecked power. That's what he's looking for,” Harris said, urging people to vote.
The reel takes a page from Trump’s rally playbook
Similarly, Trump has shown reels of Harris at recent rallies — instances of Harris stumbling in interviews, as well as clips of her talking about policies he and his followers oppose. The videos also often fire up his crowds, drawing choruses of boos.
Trump has long used authoritarian language and praised authoritarians, but lately he has gone a step further, saying that police violence could curb crime, and that he would use the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to detain or deport people.
On Fox News on Sunday, Trump was asked whether he thought Election Day would be peaceful. In response, he talked about using the National Guard or the regular military to tamp down issues, specifically issues caused by his ideological opponents.
“I think the bigger problem are the people from within. We have some very bad people. Sick people. Radical left. Lunatics. And it should be very easily handled by — if necessary — National Guard or, if really necessary, by military,” Trump said. Harris used that clip in her montage.
It is unclear what he meant by this, especially since he is not currently president and has no power over the military.
Trump later specifically named Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who is running for the Senate as one of those “enemies from within.” Trump’s campaign has not responded to NPR requests for details on his comments on using the National Guard or military against U.S. citizens.
It’s part of a strategy to appeal to moderate Republicans and independents
Harris has been making a push to appeal to moderate Republicans and independent voters in states like Pennsylvania where polls show the candidates are essentially tied.
She has said she would reach across the aisle if she wins to put a Republican in her cabinet and would name a bipartisan council to advise her. She has campaigned with former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, and other prominent Republicans have endorsed her as well.
Harris also this weekend released a medical report describing her as being in excellent health. She is using it to draw a contrast with Trump, who is almost two decades older than her – and as a way to raise questions about his rambling speeches.
She has said Trump’s decision to skip a second debate and a CBS 60 Minutes interview show his advisers want to hide him from undecided voters. Trump is slated to do two town halls this week — one with Latino voters on Univision, the second on Fox News on Wednesday with an audience of women.
Meanwhile, Harris will do her first-ever interview with Fox News on Wednesday, taking questions from anchor Bret Baier.",2024-10-14
NPR,Trump tells Jewish voters they have 'no excuse' for supporting Harris,"Trump tells Jewish voters they have 'no excuse' for supporting Harris
Former President Donald Trump is casting himself as Israel’s ""protector"" and warning Jewish voters against supporting his rival, Vice President Harris.
Trump addressed the Israeli-American Council summit in Washington, D.C, on Thursday, during an evening focused on commemorating the October 7 attacks that sparked Israel’s war with Hamas.
Speaking to a mostly friendly crowd, Trump touted his past support for Israel and, without providing evidence, claimed that the Jewish state will soon cease to exist unless he’s elected.
“It’s total annihilation — that’s what you’re talking about,” Trump said. “You have a big protector in me. You don’t have a protector on the other side.”
Trump also accused Harris of “pandering” to Hamas supporters and said ""Jewish people have no excuse"" for supporting his Democratic rival. The Hamas attack on October 7 killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took more than 200 hostages, including some American citizens. Since then, health officials in Gaza say more than 40,000 Palestinians have died. Harris has said that she will support Israel’s right to defend itself while also calling the suffering in Gaza “devastating.”
Trump repeatedly reiterated his past criticisms of the majority of Jewish voters who’ve historically supported Democrats.
“Anybody who’s Jewish and loves being Jewish and loves Israel is a fool if they vote for a Democrat,” Trump said, telling Harris supporters, “You should have your head examined.”
The remarks have sparked pushback from Jewish groups
In a thread on X, Amy Spitalnick, CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, called on Trump to, ""Stop labeling those who don't support you as crazy or disloyal,"" and accused him of playing into antisemitic tropes that will ""lead to (more) violence against Jews.""
In a statement, Jonathan A. Greenblatt, CEO & National Director of the Anti-Defamation League, echoed the concern.
""Preemptively blaming American Jews for your potential election loss does zero to help American Jews. It increases their sense of alienation in a moment of vulnerability when right-wing extremists and left-wing antizionists continually demonize and slander Jews,"" he said, adding that Trump's comments could ""spark more hostility and further inflame an already bad situation.""
Spitalnick also criticized Trump's statements about immigrants from the Middle East, and his pledge to reinstate the policy known as the ""Muslim ban"" by refusing refugees from countries he described as ""terror-infested areas like the Gaza strip.""
Spitalnick wrote: ""If the antisemitism wasn't enough, he coupled it with full-on Islamophobia & racism.""
From the stage, Trump also told a story about a moment that shaped his understanding of domestic politics surrounding Israel. During his early days of campaigning for the Republican nomination, during a visit to Iowa in 2015, Trump said he was speaking to a group of “very religious Christians.”
Trump said he was surprised when his host encouraged him to “say something good about Israel.”
“I said my, my, my, how things have changed,” he said.
Trump went on.
“And I said, ‘We love Israel; we will save Israel; and we will fight with Israel,’ and the place went wild. I said, ‘What the hell is going on?’” Trump said. “They love Israel. I hate to say it, sometimes they love Israel much more than Jewish people in New York love Israel.”
Trump's remarks were the latest in a long history of accusing Jewish Democrats of being disloyal to Israel.
Polls suggest that while a majority of Americans as a whole express support for the Jewish state, white evangelicals are among the most supportive groups. American Jews overwhelmingly say Israel’s reasons for fighting Hamas are valid, although younger Jews are more divided in their opinions about Israel’s response to the October 7 attack.
Many Jewish voters in the audience expressed support for Trump
Perri Finkelstein, a 33-year-old American-Israeli dual citizen who lives in Israel, told NPR that her top voting priority is “whoever’s going to do right by Israel.” Finkelstein said she appreciated several of Trump’s policy decisions, including recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moving the U.S. Embassy there from Tel Aviv.
“I don’t think I have to like him in order to know that he’s gonna do right by my country,” she said.
But Danny Eisenberg, 73, a radiologist from Maryland, called Trump’s statements about Jewish voters “crazy” and “a little antisemitic,” adding that he believes Trump’s promises about supporting Israel are exaggerated. Eisenberg told NPR he believes Trump’s decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal had led to further instability in the region.
Trump's address to the Israeli-American Council comes just weeks after a 23-year-old Israeli-American, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, was found shot dead in a Hamas tunnel in Gaza, along with the bodies of five other hostages.
Other featured speakers scheduled for the three-day conference taking place this weekend include Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York and Republican megadonor Miriam Adelson.",2024-09-20
NPR,More than $10 billion has been spent on ads in the 2024 election,"More than $10 billion has been spent on ads in the 2024 election
Altogether, $10.5 billion has been spent on campaign ads in the 2024 election cycle, on races from president down to county commissioner, according to data compiled by the ad-tracking firm AdImpact and analyzed by NPR.
That total is up $1 billion from four years ago.
Democrats have outspent Republicans, $5 billion to $4.1 billion, from the beginning of the cycle, starting in January 2023. (Independent, third-party and nonpartisan groups account for the rest.)
Loading...
Twenty-three states this cycle have seen more than $100 million spent. But one state tops them all: Pennsylvania. An astonishing $1.2 billion has been spent on ads in the state, the first time in U.S. history that a single state has seen more than $1 billion in ads.
Loading...
Pennsylvania has been a political hotbed in this cycle. In addition to the presidential campaign, which has dumped in $576 million in ads, there are also competitive Senate and House races in the state. The Senate contest has seen $344 million, and that’s not even the most money spent on a Senate race. That honor belongs to Ohio, where about $518 million in ads have run.
Across the country, about $3 billion has been spent on the presidential election, including the primaries. That’s slightly lower than 2020, but that was skewed by former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg spending $586 million in ads for his failed Democratic primary effort. That was almost as much as the $651 million that President Biden’s campaign spent in the primary and general election against former President Donald Trump.
About $2.6 billion of this year’s total has gone to general election efforts, which started unofficially after Super Tuesday in March.
Since March 6, Democrats — including the Biden and Harris campaigns, as well as outside groups supporting them — have outspent Republicans, $1.6 billion to $956 million.
The presidential campaign has been concentrated in seven states. Almost $4 out of every $5 spent for the presidential election has gone to Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada.
Democrats have outspent Republicans in each of the seven states. The most, $578 million, went to none other than Pennsylvania. Each party spent more than a quarter of all their ad money in the Keystone state.
Loading...
The amount of money spent in the presidential election is remarkable compared to 2020, considering how much smaller the field of competitive states is and that Florida is out of the ad-spending picture.
In 2020, $371 million was spent in the general election on Florida, an expensive place to buy ads because of its multiple media markets. This year, only $4 million has been spent there.
In 2020, the most money spent was on Georgia. It was hotly contested in the presidential election and had a Senate runoff. But with all races combined in Georgia in 2020, $787 million was spent, almost half-a-billion dollars less than the spending seen in Pennsylvania this year. Georgia has seen the third-most spending specifically in the presidential election this year, $304 million, behind Pennsylvania and Michigan ($376 million).
The biggest spenders in this election include the presidential campaigns, committees trying to elect candidates to the Senate and House, as well as several outside groups.
Here are the top 10 spenders:
1. Harris for President (D) $513 million
2. FF PAC (D) $441 million
3. MAGA Inc. (R) $360 million
4. WinSenate (D) $353 million
5. Trump for President (R) $327 million
6. Senate Leadership Fund (R) $224 million
7. House Majority PAC (D) $207 million
8. Congressional Leadership Fund (R) $201 million
9. Biden for President (D) $111 million
10. Harris Victory Fund (D) $111 million
The ads with the most money behind them are from outside groups:
$36 million: FF PAC
More money has been spent on this ad, running since Oct. 22, than on any other. It’s from the pro-Harris outside group, FF PAC. It highlights a man who says he’s “a lifelong Republican” and voted for Trump twice, but is now voting for Harris.
$26.7 million: MAGA Inc.
This ad focuses on Harris’ record as a prosecutor and tries to paint her as a San Francisco liberal. It has run on heavy circulation since Oct. 9 in five of the seven swing states: North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, Pennsylvania and Michigan.
These are the top-two ads from the campaigns:
Harris campaign: economy contrast
This contrast ad focuses on what Harris wants to do for the economy compared to Trump. The Harris campaign has spent $19 million on this ad and has run it widely.
Trump campaign: cutting taxes
The Trump campaign has left the heavy lifting in the ad race to MAGA Inc., the principal outside group supporting his candidacy. The most the campaign has spent on a single ad has been this digital ad about ending taxes on Social Security benefits and tips.",2024-11-01

NPR,Broadway stars campaign to get out the vote,"Broadway stars campaign to get out the vote
A new video encouraging Broadway fans to vote has being popping up on social media feeds lately.
Set at a workers’ rally at the turn of the last century, the musical number called “Carrying the Message” plays off the 1990s musical Newsies, about a group of disenfranchised newsboys.
The original creators of Newsies, including composer Alan Menken and director Kenny Ortega, are behind this new take for the 2024 election. It also features a slew of Broadway talent such as Nikki M James, who starred in the Tony Award-winning political musical Suffs.
This music video is one of a number of ways — both online and on stage — in which the new nonprofit Broadway Votes has been working to inspire Broadway audiences to head to the voting booth.
""Because Broadway in particular is a commercial industry, very little partisan work gets done, it felt like this incredible opportunity to leverage the talents of people who work in the industry and encourage people across the country to get out and vote,"" said Catherine Markowitz, theater producer and co-founder and director of Broadway Votes.
Broadway Votes has also been mobilizing New York’s stages and stars to engage audiences lately through curtain-call announcements about the importance of voting at shows like Once Upon A Mattress, Hadestown and Little Shop of Horrors.
The nonprofit also organized a get-out-the-vote concert in New York's Times Square, a music video featuring Tony Award winning performer Alex Newell and the Broadway Inspirational Voices singing group in a performance of a new arrangement of “Keep Marching” from Suffs, and various online giveaways and contests, including a costume contest judged by Broadway celebrities Betsy Wolfe, J Harrison Ghee and Rachel Bloom. The winner will be announced on election day.
Data shared via email with NPR from the arts-focused voter registration nonprofit Headcount shows these efforts have so far led to thousands of voter registrations.
Broadway Votes has also inspired some formerly reticent theater insiders to become politically engaged.
""I've always found myself in between two worlds,"" said performer Tommy Bracco, who said he divides his time between his mostly red-leaning family on Staten Island and blue-leaning entertainment industry colleagues in Manhattan. ""And because so many people close to me are so passionate about this, I have kind of felt afraid to use my voice [for political causes].""
Now he's playing one of the leads in the “Carrying the Message” music video.
""Broadway Votes encouraged me to use my voice for the first time ever,"" Bracco said. ""In a world where everything is so divided, Broadway Votes is bringing people together.""",2024-11-01
NPR,Owners of ‘horrific’ funeral home plead guilty to federal fraud charges,"Owners of ‘horrific’ funeral home plead guilty to federal fraud charges
Carie and Jon Hallford have pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges, one year after the married couple fled Colorado, leaving 190 decaying corpses in their funeral home. They were accused of taking money from customers and a pandemic relief fund and spending it on themselves, paying for things like travel, plastic surgery and expensive cars.
The couple have been charged with numerous state and federal crimes. In April, they were indicted on 15 federal counts related to wire fraud and conspiracy charges.
The Hallfords had been set to begin a jury trial on the fraud charges last week, but as that date approached, they asked to change their pleas. They pleaded guilty on Thursday afternoon, at a hearing where victims’ families were able to listen via audioconference.
“The plea agreement, which stipulates that prosecutors will not request over 15 years imprisonment, still has to be approved by the judge,” The Associated Press reports. “It’s unclear when that will happen.”
Federal prosecutors said the pair operated two fraudulent schemes that, together, netted just under $1 million. On one hand, they funneled $882,300 from a COVID-19 relief fund for businesses; on the other, they victimized customers who paid for their loved ones’ remains to be treated legally and with respect.
The Hallfords’ Return to Nature Funeral Home had touted its service as being more natural, pledging to cremate or bury bodies without using embalming fluids or metal caskets.
But in reality, Assistant U.S. Attorney Tim Neff said at a court hearing earlier this year, the Hallford’s funeral home “turned into a macabre and ghoulish house of horrors, where bodies were stacked like cord wood, and left to decay and decompose.”
The duplicity unraveled a year ago, when law enforcement was alerted to a ""horrific"" odor coming from the Hallfords' facility in Penrose, Colo.
For several years, families had been given containers holding the purported cremains of their loved ones — but after discovering the scene at the funeral home last October, law enforcement concluded that the ashes could not have been from bodies sent to the funeral home.
In August, a judge overseeing a civil case ordered the Hallfords to pay $950 million to families whose loved ones’ remains were mishandled — a judgment seen as symbolic, given their lack of substantial assets.
As early as the summer of 2020, the Hallfords were discussing the mounting problem at their main facility, according to text messages quoted in court hearings. In them, Jon Hallford repeatedly cited the difficulty of finding a way to dispose of the bodies, and the threat of being exposed.
In October 2020, he sent a text telling his wife they had four possible options: build a new crematory machine; dig a hole and use lye on bodies; burn the bodies in a hole; or “(d) I go to prison, which is probably what's going to happen.""",2024-10-25
NPR,Why are some Evangelicals drawn to — and sticking by — Trump? This pastor weighs in,"Why are some Evangelicals drawn to — and sticking by — Trump? This pastor weighs in
On a late October evening in North Carolina's capital city, a massive stage in a dark auditorium is backlit by tall screens, and bass-thumping music and vocals are filling the space.
There's a table of judges in front of the stage. Think American Idol but with a clearly religious focus. It's worship team audition night at Cross Assembly Church inside the congregation's nearly 1,700-seat sanctuary on a sprawling, multi-wing campus that resembles a high school or community college.
This Pentecostal church is led by pastor Chad Harvey, whose sermons — often to weekly crowds of about 3,000 — usually feature on Cross Assembly's social media channels. Harvey says only a small part of his job intersects with politics, but there’s no way to completely avoid political discourse.
“If I thought the fate of history depended on the 2024 election, I'd be as anxious as you and popping as many pills you are. Fortunately, I don't believe that stuff,” he said in a sermon posted to social media over the summer. “My hope is in Jesus, not in the politics.”
These days, Evangelical and Pentecostal conservatives are a powerful force in Republican politics. And they have stuck by former President Donald Trump for three presidential elections in a row. In fact, in the closing weeks of a tight race in North Carolina, Trump has been appealing directly to religious conservatives.
In North Carolina, All Things Considered host Scott Detrow sat down with Harvey and talked about all of this — Trump, religion, politics in general — in a small side prayer room on Cross Assembly's campus.
This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.
Interview highlights
Scott Detrow: How much does politics come up in day-to-day conversation when you're talking to people here, when you're talking to people in the congregation, when you're doing your pastoral work?
Chad Harvey: You know, it's very interesting. I think an outsider looking into the Evangelical Pentecostal movement would assume that politics plays a huge role in the life of the church. It actually doesn't. I'd say 1-2% of my conversations are about politics. I think a lot of people are just trying to make ends meet. They're trying to live their lives.
Now, I've told our folks this, you know, our church is accused of being a little bit too political, and I said: “You know, the church is not getting more political, politics is getting more spiritual.” And so we're seeing this infiltration into the political realm of things that used to be the church's territory: family, human sexuality. Now politics is starting to tackle those spiritual issues.
Detrow: How do you think about which candidates you are going to support? Is it through the lens of the issues they support? Is it through how they come across as individuals?
Harvey: What I've told our congregation is we look at the platform, not the person. And so you can have some people with some pretty deep moral struggles who are upholding a platform that we support. And I tell our people, don't pay as much attention to the struggles — pay attention to the platform. Because here's what the Bible says: There's none righteous. No, not one. We're all messed-up people. So whether it be some of the accusations that have been lodged at (North Carolina Lieutenant Governor) Mark Robinson recently, whether it be Kamala Harris and Willie Brown, Donald Trump telling Howard Stern the sexual revolution of the 1970s was “my personal Vietnam” — they're all messed-up people. And so that's the one thing we have to keep in mind as a congregation.
Detrow: Let me just ask the direct question about this with Trump. Donald Trump has such a high support from so many Christians around the country, and yet is somebody who lives in a gold tower with his name on it, who crudely insults people and, among other things, is facing criminal charges. And some people just feel like this is not the message, as I understand it, of Christianity, but there's such a strong support. What's the best way you explain it to someone who says, I just don't understand that?
Harvey: So I would say, again, I keep going back to we're all messed up people. Trump is messed up. Kamala Harris is messed up. Joe Biden has had accusations thrown at him. We're all messed-up individuals. And so I think what I keep coming back to is a lot of people seem to think that we're having a continuous, 24/7 Trump rally in the Evangelical Pentecostal circle. We're actually not. We're well aware of his foibles. We're well aware of where he's messed up. I think the reason Trump is resonating with Evangelicals is this mess aside that we all know about, the platform he's supporting, like it or not, is closer aligned to our view of scripture than the other side.
Detrow: Does that create a world, though, where there's never any accountability for anybody personally?
Harvey: I do think that at some point, there will be a line that's crossed. And so at that point, what I said is, sure, that's fine. Let's just make sure we're using that standard across the board. So, “This candidate did this. I can't support him.” That's fine. Don't support him. The only thing I'm asking is to use that same standard.
Detrow: You mentioned the lieutenant governor, Mark Robinson. I want to ask about that because I think one of the first things that drew us was that he's spoken to Cross Assembly in the past, and you've gotten to know him a little bit.
Harvey: Yeah. Yeah.
Detrow: What do you make of him as a candidate and as a man?
Harvey: You know, as a man, very winsome. I think one thing that drew him to a lot of individuals in our congregation is we have somebody in high political office who's talking our language. I've said many times about Mark Robinson, for every strength is a corresponding weakness. His strength is he's not part of the political system. The weakness is sometimes he talks like a man who's not part of the political system, and maybe he phrases things that make people uncomfortable. But as an individual, I really feel like the values that he espoused from the pulpit really resonated with our biblical worldviews.
Detrow: What I'm hearing is that line hasn't been crossed yet.
Harvey: Yeah. ...He did speak at our church, and I think some people see that and say, well, do you view him as a spiritual leader? Well, no, I don't. He's still a political candidate.
Detrow: I think we've talked about this in pieces here and there, but I want to give you a chance just to directly talk about it in one swoop. What do you think more secular listeners, listeners of other religious persuasions, listeners who live in other parts of the country — what do you think it is they misunderstand the most about congregations like yours?
Harvey: Wow. That's a great question. I would say, again, kind of putting my ear to the ground and seeing what's being said about the Evangelical Pentecostal voting bloc, I think one of the biggest misperceptions is that this is what is dominating our mind. This is what's really driving us. I keep hearing this term, Christian nationalism. That's been the big buzzword in 2024. I've not heard of that until this year that we're just trying to impose our Christian beliefs on this nation and make us a Christian nation. That may be true for other congregations. I don't know that that's true for a large segment of Evangelical Pentecostal Christians.
You know, the Bible says, make it your goal to live a peaceful and quiet life. I think a lot of us just want to have a peaceful and quiet life, be able to share the good news of Jesus Christ. I don't think we're driven by this desire to make America a Christian nation, and I don't think politics really occupies as big a part of our brain as people think it does.",2024-10-29
NPR,Trump called Cheney a 'war hawk.' Harris condemned his violent rhetoric,"Trump called Cheney a 'war hawk.' Harris condemned his violent rhetoric
MADISON, Wis. — Vice President Harris said on Friday that violent language and insults that Former President Donald Trump used about former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney should disqualify him from holding the highest office in the country again.
Trump late Thursday described Cheney as a “radical war hawk” during an onstage conversation with conservative commentator Tucker Carlson in Glendale, Ariz. Cheney, who was one of only two Republicans on the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 riot, is Harris' most prominent Republican supporter.
""Let’s put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her,"" Trump said to Carlson. ""Let's see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face.""
""You know they're all war hawks when they're sitting in Washington in a nice building saying, 'Oh, gee, let's send 10,000 troops right into the mouth of the enemy,'"" Trump said.
Harris told reporters that Trump had suggested rifles should be trained on Cheney. ""This must be disqualifying,"" she said, describing Cheney as ""tough"" and ""courageous"" for taking a stand against Trump.
""Anyone who wants to be president of the United States who uses that kind of violent rhetoric is clearly disqualified and unqualified to be president.
On Friday, Cheney said Trump's comments demonstrate why she is supporting Harris instead of him.
This is how dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death. We cannot entrust our country and our freedom to a petty, vindictive, cruel, unstable man who wants to be a tyrant. #Womenwillnotbesilenced #VoteKamala https://t.co/URH5s929Sa
— Liz Cheney (@Liz_Cheney) November 1, 2024
Trump's campaign says the outrage over his comment is a 'hoax'
Trump’s campaign called the controversy over the remarks a ""hoax"" saying Trump was ""clearly describing a combat zone"" in his remarks — not suggesting that Cheney be put in front of a firing squad.
Trump had explained in his remarks that ""warmongers like Liz Cheney are very quick to start wars and send other Americans to fight them with no regard for the lives lost,"" his campaign said.
Trump has frequently talked about revenge and grievances on the campaign trail, describing domestic opponents as ""the enemy from within"" and suggesting that the military could step in to handle disruptions from his political opponents.
He has previously said that Cheney was guilty of treason and should be put in jail.
Trump campaigned in Dearborn, Mich., on Friday, a city with a large Arab American population. He reminded supporters that Cheney's father — former Vice President Dick Cheney — had sent Americans to wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
""They want to get the Arab American vote. They want to get the Muslim votes. So she picks Liz Cheney, whose father virtually destroyed the Middle East,"" Trump said at a rally in Macomb County. ""I don't think it's working out too well.""

NPR,"Off-color jokes, vitriol take over Trump Madison Square Garden rally","Off-color jokes, vitriol take over Trump Madison Square Garden rally
Donald Trump put on a rally in New York City’s Madison Square Garden on Sunday to kick off the final full week of campaigning for president, complete with celebrity guests and a new economic proposal. But repeated insults and at times racist and misogynistic remarks from guest speakers threatened to grab the most attention.
The final weeks of a campaign are often when candidates put forth a unifying message to gather as many voters as possible. Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally was instead marked by swear words, racist jokes about Latinos and misogynistic remarks.
The focus could help Trump grab headlines and mobilize some existing supporters, though it's unlikely to bring in new voters who are already turned off by some of the Republican presidential candidate’s rhetoric.
The first speaker at the former president’s Madison Square Garden rally, roast comedian and podcast host Tony Hinchcliffe, set the tone with a disparaging joke about welcoming Latinos into the U.S. “with open arms” while making a shooing motion.
He also disparaged Latinos with a crass joke about making babies and illegal immigration, quipped that Puerto Rico is “a floating island of garbage,” and joked that Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce “might be the next O.J. Simpson,” referring to the football star who was accused and later acquitted of murdering his ex-wife.
Kelce is in a relationship with pop singer Taylor Swift, who earlier this year said she would vote for Vice President Harris.
Trump has made anti-immigrant rhetoric a centerpiece of his campaign. As president, he also talked about ending the automatic right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to noncitizens — though many scholars agree changing the law could require a constitutional amendment.
The Trump campaign is currently fighting to get votes from women and Latinos. Polls suggest the gender gap in this year’s election could be the largest on record. The Harris campaign, in contrast, has been highlighting stories of women whose lives have been threatened by strict abortion bans.
The Harris campaign immediately seized on Hinchcliffe’s remarks about Puerto Rico. In a tweet posted after his introduction, Hinchcliffe wrote in response, “These people have no sense of humor.” He also added, “I love Puerto Rico and vacation there. I made fun of everyone… watch the whole set.”
The Trump campaign also distanced itself from Hinchliffe's remarks.
""This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign,"" Danielle Alvarez, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, said in a statement.
Defining who is an American
The rally marshaled high-profile Trump supporters including Terry Bollea — better known as the professional wrestler Hulk Hogan — television personality Dr. Phil McGraw and singer-songwriter Lee Greenwood.
But other Trump allies appealed to an “us versus them” mentality. Radio host Sid Rosenberg insulted former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, as well as the Democratic Party as a whole.
“The whole party — a bunch of degenerates,” he added. “Jew-haters and lowlifes, every one of them.”
Multiple speakers also insulted Harris, with private equity fund manager Grant Cardone calling her a ""fake."" ""Her and her pimp handlers will destroy our country,"" he said.
Conservative commentator Tucker Carlson later made fun of Harris’ mixed-race heritage.
“It’s gonna be pretty hard [for Democrats] to look at us and say, ‘You know what? Kamala Harris, she got 85 million votes because she’s just so impressive. As the first Samoan-Malaysian low-IQ former California prosecutor ever to be elected president. It was just a groundswell of popular support.’”
Carlson went beyond insults, nodding to the racist “great replacement theory” he has espoused in the past.
“People know in a country that has been taken over by a leadership class that actually despises them and their values and their history and their culture and their customs, really hates them to the point that it's trying to replace them,” he said. “They know someone who actually has affection for them and that's Donald Trump. And it’s requited.”
That sentiment was echoed later, when former Trump White House aide Stephen Miller told the crowd: “America is for Americans and Americans only.”
Tax credits and ‘enemy from within’
After a more than four-hour pre-program of speakers, Melania Trump made a rare campaign trail appearance, introducing her husband.
In his speech, Trump started by laying out his economic message, emphasizing the inflation that hit the country under the Biden administration, and saying he would fix it.
He also announced a new policy, saying he would implement a tax credit for people caring for family members at home.
Harris earlier this month announced her own plan to expand Medicare to cover that kind of caregiving.
Trump also devoted a large section of his speech, as he often does, to the topic of undocumented immigrants.
“Once I take office, the migrant invasion of our country ends and the restoration of our country begins,” he told the crowd.
Trump also took the time to address a recent interview with Fox News, in which he had characterized “radical left lunatics” as “the enemy from within” and proposed using the military against them.
He stood behind those comments at Sunday night’s rally.
“They’re smart and they’re vicious, and we have to defeat them,” he said. “And when I say, ‘the enemy from within,’ the other side goes crazy. Becomes a sound — ‘oh, how can he say’ — no, they’ve done very bad things to this country. They are indeed the enemy from within.”
However, Trump still attempted to make his speech into a message of unity.
“The Republican Party has really become the party of inclusion, and there’s something nice about that,” he said near the end of his remarks.

NPR,Worried about your 2024 ballot being counted? These states let you track it online,"Worried about your 2024 ballot being counted? These states let you track it online
Election officials in at least four states have reported ballots being damaged or put at risk in the past week, renewing focus on the security of the U.S. voting system. Experts say the incidents are rare — and that they don’t pose any sort of threat to the 2024 elections’ integrity.
“It's important for people to know it's not widespread,” says Lisa Danetz, an adviser to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law. “There's no need to panic.”
“Our systems are resilient,” Danetz tells NPR. “There are lots of layers of protection and there is a way for each person's vote — and only one vote — to be counted.”
Still, Danetz says, attempts to destroy ballots in drop boxes and mailboxes are “certainly concerning and a crime attacking our democracy.”
For any voter who wants to be sure their ballot is counted, she added, nearly every state has some form of online ballot tracking. The systems can send status updates and inform a voter if there’s a problem.
Here’s a guide to where things stand:
Ballot security questions pop up in 4 states
Problems have been reported in the past week in Arizona, Oregon, Washington state and Florida. Perhaps most alarmingly, ""incendiary"" devices were used on ballot drop boxes in the Pacific Northwest early Monday, damaging three ballots in Portland, Ore., and hundreds more in nearby Vancouver, Wash.
Fire also recently damaged ballots in a United States Postal Service mailbox in Phoenix, Ariz., where police say the confessed perpetrator says he wasn’t motivated by politics.
And on Tuesday, the elections agency in Florida's Miami-Dade County said an election worker was fired after a video posted online showed them driving off in a truck — and a sealed bin and bag of ballots falling onto the street, due to the vehicle’s rear door not being secured. Passersby then gave the items to the police. The ballots were already tallied from early voting, the agency said, calling it a case of human error.
You can track your ballot in 47 states and D.C.
Online ballot tracking for mailed-in or absentee ballots is available in every state except Illinois, Missouri and Wyoming — and even if there is no statewide system, some counties also provide the service.
In many cases, the services require you to enter your name, date of birth and zip code to let you look up your ballot’s status. Most sites will then send you texts or emails as your ballot progresses through the system.
If you’d like to track your ballot, a chart at the Vote.org website has links to each state's online services, along with links to county election agencies.
Voters using the systems can “track their ballot like an Amazon package via an intelligent mail barcode,” according to the National Vote at Home Institute, getting notifications when their ballot has arrived back at the elections office, and whether it’s been accepted.
One of the main tracking-service providers is BallotTrax, a division of i3logix Inc. based in Denver. The company says it’s active in 546 counties, across 26 states.
What are officials doing to keep ballots safe?
Conspiracy theories, misinformation and violent attacks have targeted the voting process in recent years, prompting governments to ramp up their protective and security efforts.
“You can see from the response to the recent incidents that there has been this important collaboration between election officials and law enforcement in the last few years,” Danetz says, noting that in many jurisdictions, the groups have been training together to practice how to respond to attempts to disrupt the democratic process.
In Maricopa County, Ariz., for instance, “precautions include [deploying] snipers, active-shooter drills and hourly monitoring of social media for threats and misinformation that could harm voters,” member station KJZZ reports.
The large and populous county will monitor more than 260 ballot drop boxes on Election Day. As in other places around the U.S., those drop boxes will have fire suppression canisters inside them, as a final layer of protection.
As a rule, Danetz says, drop boxes are securely mounted if they’re in an unstaffed location, often with some type of surveillance. They have tamper-proof seals, and when it’s time to remove ballots, she adds, that work is usually done by bipartisan teams.
What about ballots that are provisional — or ""cured""?
A provisional ballot is what you use if you’re trying to vote in person, but you hit a problem. In many cases, voters need this option if a poll worker can’t find a match for their name on the voting rolls.
Or, in the 36 states that require voters to show an ID, the voter has forgotten or doesn’t have an adequate form of ID.
Voters in these situations can ensure their provisional ballot will count by doing things like sending an email with a copy of their license, or getting their registration confirmed.
A ballot that needs to be corrected, or “cured,” often has a signature problem — either the voter forgot to sign, or their signature doesn’t match the one on file.
At least 33 states and the District of Columbia have a ballot curing process, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In general, officials are required to promptly inform the voter that their ballot is being rejected, giving the voter a chance to “cure” their ballot. Deadlines range from very tight — the closing time of polls on Election Day, for instance — to weeks after the election.
If you run into a problem voting, you can call an election hotline for help. The number — 866-OUR-VOTE, or 866-687-8683 — is staffed by the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.
Mail-in ballot deadlines vary widely
For people returning mail-in ballots, it’s common for states to require a ballot’s envelope to be postmarked by Nov. 5 — but states differ widely on their “receive-by” deadline.
Many states allow from three to 10 days after Nov. 5 for the ballot to be delivered. But others — including several swing states, such as North Carolina and Georgia — require mail-in ballots to be received by Election Day to count.
The U.S. Postal Service says that to be sure your mail-in ballot arrives by Election Day, “it would a good idea to mail it” by Oct. 29. If you missed that deadline and drop-off boxes are available in your voting district, you might want to find one.",2024-10-30
NPR,U.S. calls on a silent China to use its sway over Russia and North Korea,"U.S. calls on a silent China to use its sway over Russia and North Korea
WASHINGTON — The U.S. and South Korea have called on China to use its influence over Russia and North Korea to prevent escalation after Pyongyang sent thousands of troops to Russia to aid Moscow's war against Ukraine. Beijing has so far stayed quiet.
In a rare meeting earlier this week, three top U.S. diplomats met with China's ambassador to the United States to emphasize U.S. concerns and urge China to use its sway with North Korea to try to curtail the cooperation, according to a State Department official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday that the sides had ""a robust conversation just this week"" and that China knows U.S. expectations are that ""they'll use the influence that they have to work to curb these activities.""
""But I think this is a demand signal that's coming not just from us, but from countries around the world,"" he said at a news conference in Washington with Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and their South Korean counterparts.
Liu Pengyu, spokesman for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said in a statement that China's position on the Ukraine crisis is ""consistent and clear.""
China strives ""for peace talks and political settlement of the Ukraine crisis. This position remains unchanged. China will continue to play a constructive role to this end,"" Liu said.
The U.S. says 8,000 North Korean soldiers are in Russia near Ukraine's border and are preparing to help the Kremlin fight against Ukrainian troops in the coming days. China has yet to publicly comment on the move.
Beijing has forged a ""no limits"" partnership with Moscow, and while it has also been a major ally for Pyongyang, experts say Beijing might not approve of the closer military partnership between Russia and North Korea because it sees it as destabilizing in the region.
The Russia-North Korea partnership runs contrary to Beijing's goal for a peaceful Korean Peninsula, said Shi Yinhong, an international relations expert at China's Renmin University.
Beijing is ""aware of the complexity and danger of the situation,"" Shi said, noting that the ""fact that China hasn't said anything yet on the military alliance agreement between North Korea and Russia indicates that China strongly disagrees with it.""
Dennis Wilder, senior fellow for the Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue on global issues at Georgetown University, called Beijing's ""radio silence"" on North Korea's move ""staggering."" He said Beijing must find a balance between supporting Moscow and not angering the West, and that Chinese President Xi Jinping might ""for his own sake ignore the whole thing.""
Xi has built a personal relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and ""he cannot see Putin fail,"" Wilder said this week at a panel discussion hosted by the Washington-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies.
At the same time, Xi cannot anger the Europeans and Americans when his country's economy is struggling, Wilder said. ""So he's not going to say anything publicly about this,"" Wilder said.
Victor Cha, Korean chair at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said at the same panel discussion that for China, ""there's probably a combination of a little bit of exasperation, a little bit of panic and a little bit of they don't know what to do with regard to the current situation.""
It's unclear if Beijing was informed of Pyongyang's move in advance, Cha said. Beijing also could fret over Russia gaining more influence than China over North Korea, Cha said.
Austin said Thursday that China ""should be asking Russia some hard questions at this point and whether it intends to broaden this conflict by this kind of behavior.""
Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell, Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Dan Kritenbrink and Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs James O'Brien met with Chinese envoy Xie Feng in Washington on Tuesday, according to the State Department official, who would not detail the Chinese response.
Lu Chao, director of the Institute of American and East Asian Studies at Liaoning University in China's northeastern province of Liaoning, said the U.S. should not expect China to manage North Korea.
""It is not the case that China is responsible to manage North Korea and the U.S. is responsible for managing South Korea,"" Lu said. ""I hope the U.S. government could understand China's stance.""
Lu also said the troop deployment is ""a matter between Russia and North Korea,"" while China's attitude remains unchanged that the conflict should not be escalated.",2024-11-01
NPR,"In this school’s election, it’s pizza vs. chicken nuggets, with democracy as the winner","In this school’s election, it’s pizza vs. chicken nuggets, with democracy as the winner
The library at Salt River Elementary School is anything but silent on a recent Tuesday morning.
There’s blaring patriotic music from the loudspeaker as teachers and staff put finishing touches on decorations welcoming students on Voting Day. Books about democracy top the shelves at the entrance of the library. Every computer monitor reads “VOTE” in big letters, and red-white-and blue garlands line the walls.
In one corner, cardboard partitions serve as privacy booths for students to cast their ballots.
Setting aside for now the looming national election, the students at this tribal school in the swing state of Arizona will be voting on their favorite school lunch. The choice in this hard-fought campaign? Pizza, or chicken nuggets.
The stakes are high: Whichever menu item triumphs will be served next week as the students follow the U.S. presidential election. It’s part of a broader effort to teach even the youngest kids about democracy, and how their voices matter.
“I want these kids to grow up to be the voters of tomorrow,” says Dawn Burstyn-Meyers, who brought the annual event to this school 20 years ago, through a nonprofit called Kids Voting Arizona. “To maybe become a president or councilman to help their community.”
Building civics into the curriculum
Every year, students at the school, east of Scottsdale, get to choose between their favorite things: outdoor activities, school subjects and – this year – the top school lunch. Next week, they’ll also take part in a mock election to vote for president and vice president of the United States.
Teachers here are centering their lessons on civics, voting procedures and democracy. In Meyers’ music and movement class, the kindergarteners learn how to spell the word “vote.” Pom-poms in hand, they chant each letter as they form its shape with their bodies.
In Audrey Yellowhair’s class, sixth graders are assigned topics related to voting procedures they must present to their class. Joseph Miller reads aloud a poster his group is preparing: “The new president has to fight for our country and also heal the middle class and lower class.” Alonzo Lopez has been discussing the election with his family at home, and says exercising one’s civic duties is essential, especially for Native Americans like him. “It’s important,” he says, “because our ancestors weren’t able to vote.” Lopez has O'odham ancestry, like many who live in the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community (SRPMIC).
This year marks a century since the Indian Citizenship Act was passed by Congress, giving Native Americans the right to vote. But voter suppression tactics like literacy tests, inaccessible polling places and stringent voter ID laws prevented Native Americans in Arizona from voting until the 1970s, making them one of the last groups of Americans to be granted suffrage.
Voter turnout continues to be a challenge on this reservation, says Martin Harvier, the SRPMIC tribal council president.
He and his team are working hard on get-out-the-vote efforts, and these students are a part of it: “Hopefully the kids are also going home and letting their parents know, ‘Hey, I voted today and we would like you to go vote, in not only our tribal elections, but the national elections,' which is a very important election, we feel, in Indian Country. ”
Billboards for the national election dot the roads along the reservation, including signage in the O’odham and Piipaash languages, spoken by some families here.
For nearly two decades, Harvier has been coming to Salt River Elementary to take part in Voting Day. At 11 a.m., the students head to the library, where they receive a ballot, fill it out in a privacy booth and drop it into a ballot box. Then, Harvier places an “I Voted Today” sticker on their shirts.
'We know our voice needs to be heard'
Lynette Stant is wearing a T-shirt that reads “Registered Indigenous Voter” as she supervises her third graders. She’s beaming with pride, watching them take part in democracy.
“To put this into perspective, my parents were 9 years old when Indigenous people were given the right to vote [in Arizona]. I’m one generation removed,” she says. “So instilling the concept of voting in our students now is so important.”
She adds that her students have held debates in class about which presidential candidate will best serve their community’s needs. Some are especially passionate about economic issues, while many others are fervent supporters of women’s rights.
“As Indigenous people, we know the value of our voice because everything that we do is tied to the federal government, whether it be land, whether it be health care, whether it be education,” Stant says. “We know our voice needs to be heard.”
Once the ballots for favorite school lunch are in, the tension at Salt River Elementary is palpable. The student council gathers to count the votes.
Finally, as the school day comes to a close, the students stream back into the library, eagerly awaiting the results. Amid murmurs of support from both pizza and chicken nugget voters, the loudspeaker crackles at last.
“Are we ready for the results of our election?” asks Principal Amanda Guerrero. A silence takes over the library for the first time that day, until she announces that, with 137 votes, “the winner is … pizza!”
Cheers, screams and moans erupt. The crowd can hardly contain themselves. One disappointed nuggets-supporter tells NPR she was certain her candidate would win, but that partaking in the democratic process was still worth her while.",2024-10-30
NPR,Trump panned the CHIPS Act. Harris is in Michigan promoting it,"Trump panned the CHIPS Act. Harris is in Michigan promoting it
Vice President Harris toured a semiconductor plant in the swing state of Michigan on Monday to highlight big federal investments in manufacturing jobs that former President Donald Trump has recently panned.
The investments come from the CHIPS and Science Act — a bipartisan bill that's pouring $54 billion into the semiconductor manufacturing industry to try to bring back an industry that is dominated by Taiwan, South Korea and China.
""Look: we've got to win the competition for the 21st century. We're not gonna have China beat us in the competition for the 21st century,"" Harris said after touring a factory near Saginaw owned by Corning that makes polysilicon used in semiconductors.
The company received $325 million in CHIPS funding, and is nearly doubling its workforce to 3,000 people as it expands.
""These are the type of jobs that pay 40% above the regional median,"" Corning's chief executive Wendell Weeks said. ""They help people build lives, raise families and foster strong communities.""
The visit comes as some Democrats urge Harris to focus more on the economy in the waning days of the campaign.
Investments from the CHIPS Act have supported massive expansions of the semiconductor industry in Arizona — another swing state — as well as other regions of the country. The White House has said the projects backed by CHIPS funding have helped create more than 115,000 jobs.
On Friday, Trump blasted the law during a lengthy interview on The Joe Rogan Experience. ""That chip deal is so bad, Trump said on the podcast, saying the subsidies went to ""rich companies.""
Trump said he could have imposed tariffs to get more companies to built the facilities in the United States.",2024-10-28
NPR,Trump's former chief of staff called him a 'fascist.' Harris is campaigning on that,"Trump's former chief of staff called him a 'fascist.' Harris is campaigning on that
Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, who was former President Donald Trump‘s longest-serving chief of staff, called Trump’s leadership style “dictatorial,” “fascist” and lacking empathy in new interviews this week.
Now Vice President Harris — who is trying to peel off moderate Republican voters and independents in key swing states — is seizing on those warnings to bolster her argument that her opponent is a threat to democracy and too dangerous to hold the office.
""So the bottom line is this, we know what Donald Trump wants — he wants unchecked power. The question, in 13 days, will be what do the American people want?"" Harris said, referring to Election Day on Nov. 5.
Kelly, the highest-profile Trump-era official to publicly criticize the former president, said in an interview with The New York Times that Trump ""certainly falls into the general definition of fascist, for sure.""
“Certainly the former president is in the far-right area, he’s certainly an authoritarian, admires people who are dictators — he has said that,” Kelly said in the interview, published on Tuesday.
Kelly — who has not endorsed Harris — also said Trump had been being critical of those disabled, injured or killed while serving in the military.
Trump campaign says Kelly fabricated his stories
In response to Kelly’s comments, Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said Kelly has “beclowned himself with these debunked stories he has fabricated.""
“President Trump has always honored the service and sacrifice of all of our military men and women,” Cheung said.
Harris has sought to capitalize on the slew of former officials who now oppose Trump, holding events with them and urging moderate Republicans to vote for her, instead.
In a town hall with Univision, Trump said that only a “small number” of his former officials have publicly said they won’t support him.
Trump’s former Defense Secretary Mark Esper, Vice President Mike Pence and national security adviser John Bolton are among those who have been critical of Trump’s leadership since leaving office.
According to The New York Times, recent Trump comments about using the military against the “enemy from within” motivated Kelly to speak out against Trump.
The Atlantic also cited reporting that while his chief of staff, Kelly several times corrected Trump on his understanding of Hitler’s rule in Germany as a comparison for how to manage the U.S. military.",2024-10-23
NPR,Supreme Court sides with Democrats in Pennsylvania voting case,"Supreme Court sides with Democrats in Pennsylvania voting case
The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday left in place a lower court ruling that for now allows Pennsylvania voters to cast provisional ballots if their mail-in ballots have been invalidated.
Since 2019, all Pennsylvania voters have been able to cast ballots by mail, but to have their mail ballots counted, they have to follow strict rules laid out in the state election code. One of those rules requires voters to place their ballot into a “secrecy envelope” before placing it into the mailing envelope. Without the secrecy envelope, the ballot is considered “naked” and will not be counted.
Under a statewide notification system, voters get an email telling them that their naked ballot has been invalidated and that “you can go to your polling place on election day and cast a provisional ballot.” Most counties follow that practice, but some, like Butler County, Pa., do not.
After two voters in the 2024 primary election were notified that their ballots would not be counted because they had not put their ballots in the secrecy envelope, the voters went to the polls on Election Day to cast provisional ballots. But Butler County refused to count their votes.
The voters sued, arguing that the Board of Elections was obligated to count their provisional ballots. The Republican National Committee and the Butler County Board of Elections countered that under the state election code provisional ballots cast by those whose mail ballots were received on time cannot be counted, even if the mail ballots were deemed invalid.
In a 4-3 decision, Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court sided with the voters. The court determined that a naked ballot is automatically void, meaning it was never received or counted by the Board of Elections. Under that logic, if the ballot was never received, a voter is eligible to cast a provisional ballot.
The Pennsylvania Republican Party and the RNC appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court to block the decision. They argued that the state supreme court's decision “dramatically change[d] the rules governing mail voting” and usurped the state legislature's role of regulating federal elections.
On Friday, the Supreme Court declined to intervene, leaving in place the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling that allows provisional votes to be cast and counted when a “naked” mail-in ballot is invalidated.
It’s hard to say how many ballots the high court decision will affect or whether it will ultimately impact the outcome of the presidential election. The RNC estimates it could affect tens of thousands of voters. Other election experts say the number is likely far lower. Regardless of the number, Pennsylvania is sure to be a key state on Election Day and depending on how close the race is between Vice President Harris and former President Donald Trump, the decision could be critical in deciding the presidency.",2024-11-01
NPR,The GOP’s ‘survival instinct’ acts as an ally for Trump on Election Day and beyond,"The GOP’s ‘survival instinct’ acts as an ally for Trump on Election Day and beyond
Former President Donald Trump’s campaign for reinstatement has taken some unusual flak in recent days. One of his former chiefs of staff, retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, said the man he once served in the Oval Office fit the definition of a fascist, adding Trump spoke admiringly of the Nazi generals who had obeyed orders from the Nazi dictator Adolph Hitler.
Any such description from a credible source would have been fatal for many a presidential campaign in the past. The same could be said of testimony from others that Trump in office had little respect for the Constitution or regard for the rule of law.
These attacks follow upon a highly public salvo from the uber-Republican Cheney family: former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter Liz, who was co-chair of the House Select Committee to Investigate the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Both Cheneys had withheld their support for Trump during the primary season earlier this year, but this fall came out to endorse Harris.
They also extend the denunciations heard from a category of anti-Trump conservatives in the media known as “never Trumpers.” The group has included such illustrious figures on the right as William Kristol and George Will. Online publications such as “The Bulwark” have been sounding alarms from the right about Trump’s autocratic tendencies for nearly a decade.
In recent days, Trump himself has garnished the mix with salacious soliloquies on golf great Arnold Palmer’s anatomy and labels for Democratic Vice President Harris that use a four-letter expletive for excrement. He says her time in office has seen America become “the garbage can of the world.”
All this follows a months-long litany of statements and outbursts from Trump that indicated sympathy for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and affinity for autocratic figures elsewhere in global politics such as Hungarian strongman Viktor Orban.
Yet as Nov. 5 nears, none of the stories that might have torpedoed another politician’s prospects has had that kind of effect, or even made a detectable difference in the polls or the tenor of Trump’s campaign.
All that stands as evidence that Trump’s base of voters has largely tuned out negative stories about him, which is easily done by watching only Trump-friendly cable news, websites or social media. For those who are still exposed, such stories can be dismissed as “fake news,” a phrase Trump adopted in 2016 that has since proven popular among autocratic politicians around the world.
Beyond the hardcore base, the politics of addition
But Trump’s seemingly unfazed pursuit of this style also demonstrates something else about our present political moment. Trump has his fanatical base, to be sure, but he has more than that. If he did not have more, he would not have won in 2016 or attracted in 2020 the most votes ever cast for an incumbent president, even though he lost that contest.
Trump’s most loyal fans are often described as being ready to “crawl over broken glass” to vote for him, and these legions of such enthusiasts surely exist. But to win he needs more. All the polling shows the race too close to call in the national popular vote and in at least seven swing states.
So Trump needs voters who may have misgivings about him or some of his behavior but who have deep loyalty to the Republican Party or deep aversion to the Democrats.
Most notably, he needs mainstream Republicans who may well have preferred another nominee in 2016 or 2024 but who will abide another term for Trump rather than risk having a Democrat in the White House for the next four years.
This week, the popular Republican governor of New Hampshire, Chris Sununu, brushed off the Hitler remarks without questioning their authenticity. Sununu, who in the past has called Trump “crazy,” was asked on CNN if the Hitler talk prompted a reconsideration of the governor’s endorsement.
“No,” Sununu said. “We’ve heard a lot of extreme things from Donald Trump. With a guy like that it’s kind of baked into the vote.”
Days earlier, on ABC News, Sununu had dismissed the outrage over Trump threatening to use the military against the “enemy within” in the U.S. He called such reactions “hyperbole.”
And, Sununu said, he would be voting for Trump because he could not face four more years of a Democratic agenda.
Some defections, but do they prove the rule?
It must be said that in recent days there have been Republican officials who have spoken out against their party’s fealty to Trump.
After the Hitler remarks, for example, the most senior Republican in the Wisconsin state Senate announced he would not vote for Trump. In the same week, Shawn Reilly, the independent mayor of that state’s largest Republican city, said he would be voting for Harris.
Lifelong Republican David Holt, the mayor of Oklahoma City, wrote in a Philadelphia newspaper this week that he could not vote for Trump. Holt wrote that prior to 2016 he “took for granted that both [parties’] leading candidates respected the rule of law and deeply understood the concept that no president is above the law.”
The Harris campaign has compiled lists of hundreds of Republicans in public positions who have endorsed the Democrat. But as a rule, notable Republicans with recognizable names have stayed in the fold. The scenario first seen when Trump emerged from the candidate pack in 2015 is replayed again and again.
It goes like this: Trump says something headline-grabbing about Muslims or immigrants or the POW ordeal of Sen. John McCain. The statement prompts intraparty denunciations. But after a few days or weeks, Trump is still on top, unrepentant, unbent and unbowed — and so dominant in the media coverage as to marginalize his opposition.
After the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape aired in October 2016, such prominent Republicans as former House Speaker Paul Ryan declined to campaign with him. It did not seem to matter, even in Ryan’s home state of Wisconsin.
The controversies have erupted, reached a moment of apparent crisis and subsided. And the hardcore Trump support has often seemed to grow all the harder.
Respecting and obeying that hardcore has generally been the safe position for Republicans in statewide office or seats in Congress. They may not need to be front-line Trump defenders, but they cannot assume they will escape retribution if they openly support an opponent — especially a Democrat.
After the attack on the Capitol in 2021, Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy said Trump bore responsibility for the riot. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said Trump “summoned the mob and incited the mob.” Yet, within days, both Republicans were backing down. McCarthy was going hat in hand to Mar-a-Lago for a photo opportunity, and McConnell was unwilling to support Trump’s impeachment for his role in the Jan. 6 events.
It was apparent in each of these situations that whatever reaction might appear in some newspapers or on certain TV channels, the popular underpinnings of the Trump phenomenon remained solid. The soundings taken by Republican leaders confirmed this and guided their actions thereafter.
This has proven true even during the years after Trump was out of office and his return to power far from presumed. Even then, desertion to support a rival such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the primaries has cost former Trump allies their momentum, at a minimum, and cost some their party support.
The minority mindset and survival instinct
Is all this new? Not really. To some degree, the endgame in any presidential cycle consists of the two parties telling their loyalists to turn out and cast one for the team, largely to keep the other side from winning. In some cycles, that’s an easier sell than others. Democrats in particular have been resistant to the idea of turning out just because it was Election Day and voting “D” because they were supposed to.
It has long been said that in choosing their presidential candidates: Democrats want to fall in love while Republicans want to fall in line. Once a GOP has a front-runner, most Republicans recognize the power of pulling together to put that candidate over the top.
Republicans, at least in recent generations, have been more inclined to vote and to stick with the party when they do. That expresses loyalty, to be sure, but it also comes from what might be called a survival instinct. Republicans felt like the minority party for roughly half a century after Franklin Roosevelt swept into office and installed the New Deal in an era of Democratic dominance in other elections as well.
Republicans even felt like the minority party when their post-World War II candidates started winning the White House and winning second terms with bigger margins than their first. President Dwight Eisenhower did that, and so did successors Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush.
There have been plenty of voters in both parties who had to swallow hard before pulling the lever for their party’s man — or woman — in the past. References to holding one’s nose in the polling booth led some to refer to the “clothespin vote,” a regular feature of two-party politics where only the two major party nominees have any chance of being elected.
In the late 1990s, Republicans and not a few other observers were amazed that President Bill Clinton maintained his high voter approval ratings even in the depths of his impeachment over an affair with a White House intern. Even after the most damning evidence had been presented in public, Clinton’s approval rating in the Gallup Poll stayed above 60%. In December 1998, the month he was impeached, Clinton’s approval hit 73%.
Still, Trump has taken this dynamic to unprecedented levels. His rise to the presidency was not built on previous political experience or public service but on a media presence in a “reality show” based on his tough businessman persona. He has made a specialty of maintaining a connection with an audience through showmanship and media dominance that other candidates cannot match.
And given its unprecedented origins and sustainability, that connection seems all but certain to live on — whatever happens on Nov. 5.",2024-10-27
NPR,The ongoing lawsuits over whose mail-in ballots must be counted in Pennsylvania,"The ongoing lawsuits over whose mail-in ballots must be counted in Pennsylvania
Right now, there are several ongoing lawsuits across the state over whose mail-in ballots must be counted. With polls suggesting a tight presidential race, the final outcome of the cases could be key.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
In the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania, voters have already begun sending in their ballots by mail. Right now there are several ongoing lawsuits across the state over whose mail-in ballots must be counted. The final outcome of these cases could help determine who wins Pennsylvania's electoral votes, which could really matter, with polls suggesting we are in for a tight presidential race. NPR voting rights correspondent Hansi Lo Wang has been tracking this and is here now. Hi, Hansi.
HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise.
KELLY: What is the focus of these lawsuits?
WANG: They're all focused on what to do when a mail-in voter in Pennsylvania returns an absentee ballot on time but doesn't follow other rules for getting their vote counted.
KELLY: OK, before we get into the details, who is bringing these lawsuits?
WANG: Well, it's been voting rights groups, and they're arguing that sometimes voters make mistakes, and those who do should not have their ballots rejected. But Republican groups have been pushing back, and generally, they're arguing in the court that the state's election rules are the rules, and they should be followed exactly. You know, what's interesting is that all of these legal questions could be resolved by state lawmakers. In fact, a bipartisan advisory board recommended changes to Pennsylvania's election law to, quote, ""eliminate confusion and litigation."" But there's been partisan gridlock in Pennsylvania, so voters in the state really have to pay close attention to all the required steps for mail-in voting.
KELLY: OK, so they have to do each step exactly as it has been laid out. What are the steps?
WANG: If you are voting by mail in Pennsylvania, you have to first seal your completed ballot inside a yellow-colored secrecy envelope and put that yellow envelope inside an outer return envelope. And before you return it, you have to add your signature on that return envelope and handwrite the current date under your signature.
KELLY: Go back to one of the things you just said about that - the yellow secrecy envelopes - because those have been the focus of some of this litigation.
WANG: Yeah, election officials have been calling ballots that come without those secrecy envelopes naked ballots. And if you're missing that yellow secrecy envelope, your ballot is not supposed to be counted. But there's a lawsuit over whether Pennsylvania voters whose naked ballots are rejected can cast provisional ballots in person on Election Day. And this month the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said, yes, those provisional ballots should be counted, but this afternoon the Republican National Committee asked the U.S. Supreme Court to weigh in.
KELLY: OK, I got it. And then what about that other step you mentioned - ballots in return envelopes but that maybe are missing the current date handwritten by the voter?
WANG: Right. Some call these undated and misdated ballots. And to be clear, we're talking about ballots that arrive on time, but the issue is about this artifact of Pennsylvania's election rules that require the voter to handwrite the current date on that outer return envelope. And for now, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has ruled these undated or misdated ballots should not be counted, but that may not be the final word before Election Day. I'm watching a case out of Philadelphia that's working its way up the state courts.
KELLY: OK, so we're talking about what's happening in Pennsylvania. What should absentee voters in other states be keeping in mind as they're maybe looking at mail-in ballots and we're getting step by step closer to Election Day?
WANG: You know, mail-in voters in every state should take real care when they're returning their ballots. We often see thousands of ballots rejected in a state's election because of mistakes. And I should point out tomorrow is the postal service's suggested deadline for returning your ballot if it arrives - so it arrives by Election Day. And after that, absentee voters may want to consider returning their ballot in person...
KELLY: Right.
WANG: ...At their county election office or at a drop box if there's one nearby.
KELLY: NPR's Hansi Lo Wang. Thank you.
WANG: You're welcome.

NPR,"In outreach to Black men, Harris to vow to legalize weed, protect crypto","In outreach to Black men, Harris to vow to legalize weed, protect crypto
Vice President Kamala Harris is pledging Monday to legalize recreational marijuana, protect cryptocurrency assets and give 1 million loans to Black entrepreneurs, as part of her efforts to court Black voters who may be pivotal in the presidential race.
Polls show that some Black men may be gravitating toward former President Trump, Harris’ Republican rival, or not vote at all. Harris and other prominent Democrats are trying to counter that.
Among the initiatives being announced by Harris Monday:
- Legalizing recreational marijuana and providing opportunities for Black Americans to succeed in the industry
- 1 million fully forgivable loans of up to $20,000 for Black entrepreneurs and others to start businesses
- a plan come up with rules for cryptocurrency and other digital assets; more than 20% of Black Americans own or have owned cryptocurrency assets, according to the campaign
- invest more in Black male teachers, promote registered apprenticeships and credentialing opportunities in Black communities and investing in leadership training and mentorship programs like My Brother’s Keeper
- a National Health Equity Initiative focused on Black Men that addresses sickle cell disease, diabetes, mental health, prostate cancer, and other health challenges that disproportionately affect them
Harris will talk about the plan on Monday in Erie, Pa.
Former Rep. Cedric Richmond, a co-chair of the Harris' campaign, said her new announcement is part of her ""Opportunity Economy"" pledge — “an economy where people don't just get by, but get ahead. Where Black men are equipped with the tools to thrive: to buy a home, provide for our families, start a business and build wealth,” he said in a statement.
On Monday, Harris will meet with a group of Black men in Erie, Pa., before holding a rally in the city. And on Tuesday, she plans to meet with Black entrepreneurs in Detroit after a town hall conversation moderated by Charlamagne tha God, the influential Black radio host who has pulled very few punches with Democratic politicians.
She spent the weekend campaigning in North Carolina, attending a Black church in Greenville, N.C., before holding a rally in the community in a part of the state where Democrats are hoping to boost turnout among Black voters.
Obama weighed in last week
Softening of support among Black men could hurt Harris in what is shaping up to be a tight election. Most polls show her and Trump in a dead heat. Last week, former President Barack Obama, the first Black president, said he wanted to ""speak some truths"" about why turnout and enthusiasm for Harris was far behind what he experienced in 2008.
“Part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that,” Obama said.
In response, the Black Men for Trump Advisory Board issued a statement, calling Obama’s remarks “deeply insulting.”
“Black Americans are not a monolith, and we don’t owe our votes to any candidate just because they ‘look like us,’” they said in a statement. “It’s demeaning to suggest that we can’t evaluate a candidate’s track record — especially when Kamala Harris has done more harm than good to Black communities.”
As part of its outreach, the Harris campaign will specifically target Black men in the closing days of the election, her campaign said, with events including partnerships with influential Black males, and talks with Black business owners.

NPR,Arnold Schwarzenegger has endorsed Kamala Harris for president,"Arnold Schwarzenegger has endorsed Kamala Harris for president
Former Republican governor and actor Arnold Schwarzenegger has endorsed Democratic nominee Kamala Harris for president.
In a lengthy Wednesday post on X, Schwarzenegger said he does not typically give endorsements, as he doesn’t “trust most politicians,” but he understands his own influence.
He described former President Trump as “a candidate who won’t respect your vote unless it is for him, a candidate who will send his followers to storm the Capitol while he watches with a Diet Coke, a candidate who has shown no ability to work to pass any policy besides a tax cut that helped his donors and other rich people like me but helped no one else else [sic], a candidate who thinks Americans who disagree with him are the bigger enemies than China, Russia, or North Korea.""
I don’t really do endorsements. I’m not shy about sharing my views, but I hate politics and don’t trust most politicians.
— Arnold (@Schwarzenegger) October 30, 2024
I also understand that people want to hear from me because I am not just a celebrity, I am a former Republican Governor.
My time as Governor taught me to…
Schwarzenegger said he is frustrated with both parties' inaction, especially on issues such as immigration reform and national debt.
""It is a just game to them,"" he said.
He additionally highlighted some of his accomplishments during his time as California’s governor from 2003 to 2011, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving the state’s infrastructure and lowering the unemployment rate.
“That’s policy,” he said. “It requires working with the other side, not insulting them to win your next election, and I know it isn’t sexy to most people, but I love it when I can help make people’s lives better with policies.”
He concluded by saying, “That’s enough reason for me to share my vote with all of you. I want to move forward as a country, and even though I have plenty of disagreements with their platform, I think the only way to do that is with Harris and [her running mate] Walz.”",2024-10-31

NPR,"In an election race this close, Asian American voters have become a force","In an election race this close, Asian American voters have become a force
PHILADELPHIA — Exactly a month before Election Day, James Delos Reyes was waiting in the parking lot of Philadelphia’s only Jollibee.
This branch of the Filipino fast food chain has become the de facto meet-up spot for canvassers for the Asian and Pacific Islander Political Alliance (APIPA) — a group that is knocking on doors every day until the election for Vice President Harris and other candidates they’ve endorsed.
“It’s indicative of how much this area has grown in Asian population,” said Delos Reyes, the group’s deputy field director. “It is home to a large Korean, Viet, South Asian population that’s steadily growing. I guess we can count Filipinos up on that list, if Jollibee’s considered enough folks to open up a restaurant.”
Asian American and Pacific Islanders are the fastest-growing voting group in the country. In Pennsylvania, the number of eligible voters from this demographic group grew by a whopping 55% between 2010 and 2020.
It’s still a narrow slice of eligible voters — about 3% — in this critical state. But polls show the presidential race is essentially tied here, so AAPI turnout could help determine who wins.
Growth of the AAPI population in Pennsylvania has been massive
In 2020, President Biden won Pennsylvania by a razor-thin margin – in part thanks to record turnout among AAPI voters.
“The lesson from 2020 was that no matter how small a community is, they matter, especially in a time when the country is so polarized,” said Neil Makhija, the commissioner of Montgomery County.
The county invested in a brand new voting van — where people can register to vote and cast their ballots on the spot. The county plans to take it to Diwali events, fall festivals, and other community gatherings, Makhija said. He said the van is also equipped with information about voting in eight different languages.
For years, the majority of Asian American voters hadn’t been reached out to by either party, data from AAPIVote and AAPI Data shows.
In part that’s because it takes a lot of labor and money to translate flyers, signs and information on how to vote, said Delos Reyes. His group’s pamphlets in the Philadelphia area have every English sentence translated into simplified Chinese, Viet and Urdu.
While AAPI voters have overwhelmingly voted blue in the past, they haven’t been strongly tied to a specific party, which means they are persuadable targets. But once engaged in politics, Asian American voters tend to stay engaged, according to APIPA.
How candidates are reaching out this year
Harris’ campaign has three staffers dedicated to AAPI voter outreach, and they have boosted advertising in Asian American media.
One recent ad slammed Trump for the surge of anti-Asian hate during the COVID-19 pandemic. Another has Harris talking about her mother, an immigrant from India. The phrase “she is one of us” — referring to Harris — is displayed in the ad.
The Trump campaign has done less specific outreach to the community. A Trump campaign official speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to reporters said their strategy to reach AAPI voters is the same for Black and Latino voters — which is to try to tap into nostalgia for the economy when Trump was president.
This summer, Trump visited the Eden Center, a Vietnamese shopping center in northern Virginia, and rallied with Hung Cao, the GOP candidate for the Senate.
“I don't know what it is. You'll have to explain it. But the Vietnamese community loves me and I love them,” Trump said.
AAPI voters will also be critical in other states
Outreach from both parties to AAPI voters could be a deciding factor in other swing states, too. In Nevada, for example, AAPI voters make up nearly 12% of the state’s electorate.
Engaging specific communities within the AAPI demographic could matter, too. In swing states like North Carolina, Georgia and Michigan, Indian Americans are the largest ethnic group among AAPI voters.
In North Carolina, Democratic organizer Mona Singh with the group They See Blue said she saw a surge of interest from South Asians to campaign for Harris after the vice president entered the race.
When President Biden was still the nominee, Singh said she would see about five South Asian volunteers, on average, come out to canvas events Singh organized. Now, she said there are consistently around 20 canvassers.
Advocacy groups say they’re building for future elections, too
In past election cycles, the lack of outreach made many people in the community feel like politics wasn’t for them.
Jamie Min, 29, said he doesn't vote. He's a Korean American software engineer who says he has concerns about the economy and immigration.
“I think it's mostly the culture of just kind of being second-class, almost like and we kind of feel like we don't have a voice,” Min said as he took a look around this year's Kimchi Festival in downtown Philadelphia.
That feeling is something Linh Nguyễn, the executive vice president of AAPI Victory Fund, is trying to change. Her organization is a political action committee that has backed Harris, and works to engage and mobilize Asian American voters.
Nguyễn has worked for past Democratic campaigns, and said it used to be a “literal battle” to have rally signs translated into different Asian languages.
“I hate to say this, but we were barely on the map. And the understanding of who and what it means to be Asian in America was just not there in mainstream politics,” she said.
This cycle, they’ve put out mailers in California with pictures of families eating hot pot for dinner, and they’ve worked with Asian American influencers and bloggers to reach young voters.
“To see how it’s grown … is one of the most remarkable things I’ve seen in the last 10 years,” Nguyễn said.

NPR,The 2024 presidential race went from deja vu to to unprecedented overnight : Consider This from NPR,"The 2024 presidential race went from deja vu to to unprecedented overnight
It can be hard to remember from where we sit today, but when this presidential campaign began, it looked a lot like the last one.
Everything sounded familiar, down to the candidates. There was Trump talking about bringing back glory, and Biden wanting to restore the normalcy of a good and decent United States.
Former president Donald Trump and sitting President Joe Biden became the presumptive nominees for their parties in March making it the first presidential rematch since 1956.
We all know sequels are rarely more interesting than the original, and many were frustrated or indifferent to what seemed like a repeat of what we had already seen before.
Anyone with a pulse knows the last year has been anything but predictable.
And while we can't say what the outcome of this election will be, we can say that Americans have just lived through the most dramatic, eventful, unexpected presidential campaign of our lives.

A last minute substitution
Questions surrounding President Biden's fitness to serve in the oval office for a second term had already been circulating for months following his acceptance of the Democratic nomination.
But the June debate in Atlanta between Biden and Trump featured a performance from Biden that sent democrats into a tailspin. Members of the Democratic party began calling for Biden to drop out. But the president was resolute.
Weeks later, former speaker of the house Nancy Pelosi weighed in with an open ended conclusion:
""It's up to the President to decide if he's going to run. We're all encouraging him to make that decision, because time is running short.""
Then, while Democrats were wringing their hands, a major event rocked the Trump campaign when a would-be assassin took aim at the former president while he was onstage at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. A bullet grazed Trump's ear, while one attendee was killed, and another two were left critically wounded.
As Republicans fervently united around their leader, wearing ear bandages to show their support, Biden became sidelined with COVID.
Finally, on July 21st, the President posted on social media that he was ending his campaign.
He offered his quote ""full support and endorsement"" for Vice President Kamala Harris to be the party's nominee, cementing the decision in a formal address two days later.
A post-Biden race
Harris would have the shortest runway of any Presidential campaign in modern history. She would need to introduce herself to voters, explain a policy agenda, draw a contrast with Trump, and also choose a running mate.
On August 16th in Philadelphia, she announced her pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D).
A few days later, the Democratic convention in Chicago came with a rush of adrenaline as the party celebrated the first woman of color to lead the Democratic ticket.
The first and only debate between the two presidential candidates came on September 10th, in New York City.
They debated policy positions – including on the economy.
Trump had one view:
""The polls say 80 and 85 and even 90 percent, that the Trump economy was great, that their [democrats] economy was terrible.""
Harris had another:
""Donald Trump has no plan for you. And when you look at his economic plan it's all about tax breaks for the richest people. I am offering what I describe as an opportunity economy.""
Trump also pushed a false claim about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, saying they were eating people's pets.
That led to weeks of threats and violence against the community in Springfield.
And just five days later, Trump was golfing when his life came under threat once again, as Secret Service agents spotted a gunman lurking at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida.
He didn't fire, and Trump wasn't harmed.

NPR,JPMorgan Chase is suing customers over 'infinite money glitch' ATM scam,"JPMorgan Chase is suing customers over 'infinite money glitch' ATM scam
JPMorgan Chase has begun filing lawsuits against customers who took advantage of an “infinite money glitch” this summer — a technical issue with the bank’s ATMs that allowed people to deposit bogus checks and withdraw the money from their accounts.
The trend shot across social media with TikTok users broadcasting how to deposit the fraudulent checks and walk away with huge sums of cash.
The bank, which is the largest U.S. financial institution, has so far filed four suits — two against individuals and two against businesses. These have been in Los Angeles, Houston and Miami.
“Fraud is a crime that impacts everyone and undermines trust in the banking system,” Chase spokesperson Drew Pusateri said in a statement. “We’re pursuing these cases and actively cooperating with law enforcement to make sure if someone is committing fraud against Chase and its customers, they’re held accountable.”
In the largest of the four suits filed so far, in the Southern District of Texas, JPMorgan wrote that a ""masked man"" deposited a fraudulent $335,000 check into a defendant's bank account at an ATM.
The man allegedly then withdrew most of the cash before the bank had realized it was counterfeit. The bank said it is owed back a sum of $290,939.47.
“Chase prides itself on its efforts to protect its customers against fraudsters, particularly in an environment where bank and wire fraud are increasingly more commonplace,” the bank said in its filing.
“While fraud methods have evolved over time, the core intent to exploit and deceive remains unchanged,” it said.",2024-10-29
NPR,"In parroting a lie about migrants in Springfield, Ohio, Trump excites extremists","In parroting a lie about migrants in Springfield, Ohio, Trump excites extremists
When former President Donald Trump made a false claim in this month’s debate with Vice President Harris that Haitian migrants were eating pets in Springfield, Ohio, it stunned many who heard it. But perhaps among the most stunned were neo-Nazis, who, for weeks, had been trying to launch that racist lie into the mainstream.
“Whether they're neo-Nazi or white nationalist, all of them [were] thrilled,” said Jeff Tischauser, senior research analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center. “All of them [were] in almost disbelief that they had a presidential candidate recycle and reuse the rhetoric that has been popular in these movements for decades.”
One group, especially, was celebrating. The Blood Tribe, a neo-Nazi hate group that Tischauser estimates to have between 50 and 80 members nationally, posted to the group’s Telegram channel. The group claimed that it had “pushed Springfield into the public consciousness.”
“When Trump mentioned the pet-eating narrative, Blood Tribe was crowing about it,” said Cass Troy, an extremism researcher who runs an online publication called the Cassandra Report. NPR is using a pseudonym for Troy, because of Blood Tribe’s history of doxing its critics.
“They were delighted,” Troy said. “They take all responsibility for it, even though they don't deserve it.”
Reaching a more mainstream audience
The narrative about pet-eating has been decisively debunked. Even so, it has taken on momentum. Republican Vice Presidential candidate JD Vance has continued to repeat the lie, even after his campaign staff reportedly heard directly from Springfield officials that there was no evidence to support it. Since the debate, the city has fielded dozens of bomb threats against schools and other municipal facilities.
“This fear that's being created in Springfield is something that Blood Tribe is very proud of at this moment,” said Tischauser.
While the exact origin of the false claim is not clear, the Blood Tribe was early in featuring it on its alternative-tech Gab social media account. On August 11, a day after the group marched with swastika flags through Springfield, a commenter on the group’s page suggested that the city’s Haitian residents might eat pets. But on its alternative tech platform pages, the group’s reach has been limited. It wasn’t until EndWokeness, a right-wing account on X, posted about the topic on September 6 that the lie reached a significant audience.
“The concerning thing that's happening is we're seeing a convergence of far right mainstream people having the same talking points as out and proud neo-Nazis,” said Troy.
“I think that one of the things that people need to be cognizant of is anybody who perpetuates this narrative, do they want to be aligned with people like that?” she said. “You know, if you can't separate out your feelings about basic decency when it comes to immigration, maybe you can separate out basic decency when it comes to not being in league with a Nazi.”
Extremists are activated
After Trump amplified the falsehood during the nationally televised event, extremists have stepped up their in-person activities in Springfield. That Saturday, Proud Boys members from several chapters gathered in the city, KKK leaflets were distributed and a white power organization called the Aryan Freedom Network posted flyers on utility poles.
“They're just so much more energized now than I've seen them in a long time,” said Tischauser. “Leaders of the Blood Tribe [and] leaders of other white supremacist groups are excited about the possibility that this is a recruitment boon because of the size of the audience that got this message.”
Tischauser said in some ways that moment in the debate echoed a moment from four years earlier, when Trump told the Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by” during the 2020 election season. Then, leaders from that group responded jubilantly on social media, and the group was launched onto the public radar.
But Tischauser noted that it’s not an exact comparison. Trump’s statement did not directly point to an extremist group. And even though it has energized these groups, Troy said this energy is not about promoting Trump’s candidacy. Instead, she said it’s about capitalizing on a moment where many Americans may be ready to consider their agenda of racial hate.
“They're not playing at politics,” explained Troy. “They're playing at messaging and what's getting traction. They want the idea to move forward. They don't actually care who does it.”",2024-09-24
NPR,"Pushed by public opinion shift, Democrats adopt immigration restrictions","Pushed by public opinion shift, Democrats adopt immigration restrictions
When President Biden took office on Jan. 20, 2021, he did what he had promised: he rescinded many of former President Donald Trump’s draconian immigration policies.
But three years into his presidency, Biden and the Democratic leadership changed its approach to immigration, focusing heavily on enforcement, restrictions, and punishments — a strategy at times indistinguishable from the Trump administration. Their positions have moved significantly to the right in part due to Republican attacks and changing public views on border security.
This has left immigration rights advocates wondering whether Democrats will focus again on providing pathways to legal status for millions of unauthorized migrants in the U.S.
“What we are seeing is that the center of the Democratic Party is now adopting the same policies, the same postures, that MAGA Republicans were fighting for about six years ago,” Elora Mukherjee, the director of the Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at Columbia Law School, told NPR.
Some immigrant rights advocates say misinformation, as well as a record number of unauthorized crossings during the Biden administration, have put Democrats in a position where they have to prove they can be tough at the border.
Add to that: Republican-led states have been trying to regulate immigration on their own.
An ""outdated"" approach
In the last six months, Biden issued a number of executive actions that mimic those from the Trump administration, including limiting most asylum petitions at the U.S. southern border.
That proposal went into effect in the summer and temporarily suspended the processing of most asylum claims after the seven-day average of unauthorized crossings in the southern border exceeded 2,500.
This was the same rule Trump used in 2017 to ban immigrants from several majority-Muslim countries, and again in 2018 suspending the right to petition asylum for migrants crossing the border illegally.
Prior to 2024, Biden was already adopting some of Trump’s immigration proposals: he kept Title 42 in place for two years, a provision meant to quickly turn back migrants to Mexico for public health reasons.
Andrea Flores, who served as the director of border management on the National Security Council under the Biden administration, said Democrats continue to use an “outdated” approach first used by former President Barack Obama, and expanded by Trump, “that is all about asylum and restricting asylum, and blocking people from being able to raise asylum claims.”
Flores said for the last decade, both Democrats and Republicans have looked at the issue of border security through the lens of limiting or expanding access to asylum.
“But that isn’t really a full answer on the challenges we see at the border,” Flores said. “It’s less about how Democrats have shifted — it's more about why we aren’t talking about better solutions than the same policies that have already failed to create order at the U.S.-Mexico border.”
There have been some advancements, Flores concedes.
An example, she says, are Biden’s policies that have reduced the number of unauthorized crossings while protecting migrants fleeing their countries. The humanitarian parole program for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans allows up to 30,000 eligible migrants a month to come to the U.S. for up to two years after being vetted.
The idea behind the program is to reduce the number of migrants attempting to come to the U.S. illegally.
According to the American Immigration Council, nearly 500,000 migrants from those four countries have come to the U.S. in the last two years under the humanitarian parole program.
“That innovation, more than any asylum restriction in the last 10 years, led to the most sustainable drop in those people making unauthorized crossings at the border,” Flores said.
According to the Department of Homeland Security, encounters with migrants from Venezuela, Cuba, Haiti and Nicaragua between ports of entry are down 99 percent since the program started. Earlier last month the White House announced it would not renew the legal status of those in the country under the parole program.
White House spokesperson Angelo Fernández Hernández told NPR in a statement that the Biden administration “has put forward a balanced approach in order to secure our border and make our immigration system more fair and just.”
He said the most recent policies have led to a decrease of more than 55 percent in unlawful crossings at the southern U.S. border.
In December, border agents processed nearly 250,000 migrants, a record high. But those numbers have dropped dramatically since Biden’s asylum restrictions. In September, the number of migrants processed was about 54,000.
Fernández Hernández said the White House continues to call on Congress to “reform our broken immigration system, pass the bipartisan Senate bill, and provide the funding we have requested for additional border security personnel and resources.”
That bipartisan border agreement had initial support in the Senate, but got derailed after Trump persuaded House Republicans to oppose it.
That legislation would have overhauled the asylum system, imposing severe restrictions for those seeking asylum, and would have raised the initial credible fear threshold for migrants. It would have also increased detention capacity.
The proposal would have also created a pathway to citizenship for Afghan evacuees and allies.
But the Democrats' approach has created uncertainty, said Mukherjee, with Columbia Law School.
“There’s a real sense of fear … in immigrant communities across the country with the impending election,” Mukherjee said. “Because no matter who takes office, we are very likely to see massive changes in the immigration system.”
Trump’s impact on Democratic policies
For many immigration observers, the positions taken by Democrats over the last decade seem to contrast with the policies proposed by the leaders they once saw as close allies.
Bruna Sollod is with United We Dream Action, the political arm of an immigrant youth-led advocacy organization. Her organization was key in lobbying Obama to launch in 2012 the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, best known as DACA.
She says the way Republicans have mischaracterized the increase of migrant crossings along the southern U.S. border has pushed Democrats to take more restrictive actions.
“The Republican Party, the MAGA Republicans, have been so strategic in lying to the American people about this crisis at the border that now everyone believes this thing is happening when it’s not,” Sollod said.
According to survey results released by the Pew Research Center last month, an overwhelming majority of Trump and Harris’ supporters are in favor of “improving border security.”
Nearly 30 percent of Harris’ supporters back mass deportations, the Pew survey found.
Sollod says she believes that Democrats have been left with trying to be “seen as tough.”
“The thing is, you are never going to be seen tougher on immigration than Donald Trump, who has promised mass detention and deportation of people,” Sollod said.
Congressman Greg Casar, a Democrat from Texas, says Trump’s focus on false narratives about immigrants is one of the reasons the conversation around immigration has changed so much.
“The Democrats’ response, in my view, should be to provide a vision of what a functional, orderly, lawful, and humane immigration system could look like,” Casar said.
That includes, Casar says, pathways to citizenship.
“The Democratic Party should be able to play offense on that issue,” Casar said. “Unfortunately, I think, Trump’s relentless fear mongering and scapegoating in the immigrant communities has pushed the Democratic Party into being more fractured on this issue than we need to be.”
Cautious optimism on Harris
Many immigrant rights activists are cautiously optimistic about what a Harris presidency could mean for immigration.
The Harris campaign declined a request for comment and referred NPR to remarks the vice president made in Arizona last month. There, she called for revamping the immigration system. She vowed more punitive measures for migrants who cross without authorization, and called for a pathway to citizenship for “hard-working immigrants who have been here for years.”
Sollod, with United We Dream Action, said many of Harris’ policies don't fully align with her group’s priorities, but she said she believes a potential Harris administration could be persuaded to pursue more progressive policies.
“I know it won’t be easy, because it never is,” Sollod said. “Politicians, I’ve learned through this work, never do anything out of the kindness of their hearts — they do things when they are pushed.”",2024-10-29
NPR,Steve Bannon feels 'empowered' after four months in federal prison,"Steve Bannon feels 'empowered' after four months in federal prison
Steve Bannon, the right-wing podcaster and one-time political adviser to former President Donald Trump, was released from federal prison Tuesday morning after serving four months behind bars for contempt of Congress.
Bannon was convicted in 2022 on two counts for defying subpoenas from the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters. He left prison a week before Election Day, as Trump and Vice President Harris deliver their respective closing messages in a tight race for the White House.
Just hours after his release, Bannon returned to host a new episode of his daily podcast, “War Room.” Dressed in a black shirt and with his gray hair slicked back, Bannon falsely claimed that former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent him to federal prison as a political prisoner “to tamp down the power of this show and to break me.”
“Four months in federal prison didn’t break me. It empowered me,” Bannon told his online audience. “I’m more energized and more focused than I’ve been in my entire life.”
Bannon echoed the false argument of other Republicans, including Trump, who accuse Democrats of weaponizing the Justice Department and the legal system against members of the party.
Bannon served his four-month sentence at the federal lockup in Danbury, Conn. Another former Trump aide, Peter Navarro, also served four months in prison after being convicted of the same charges.
A variety of people filled in on the “War Room” podcast while Bannon was in prison. He marked his return to the podcast with a fiery message for Trump’s supporters ahead of Election Day, telling them: “This is a fight not simply for the direction of this country but what this country stands for.”
Democrats, Bannon claimed, “have no intention of giving up power.”
Trump’s supporters in Congress also have lobbed accusations of politicization against the Justice Department, pointing to the two federal indictments brought against the former president for allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 election and for hoarding classified documents.
Attorney General Merrick Garland has rejected the allegations. In recent years, the department has twice indicted President Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, for gun and tax crimes; charged two Democratic members of Congress with corruption; indicted the Democratic mayor of New York City on corruption charges; and investigated the president himself over his handling of classified documents after his vice presidency.
At a news conference later in the day, Bannon said his immediate focus is getting Trump supporters to the polls before and on Nov. 5, and on ensuring ""election integrity.""
""My focus is on victory next Tuesday and the biggest number possible, because folks: don't think it's going to end on Tuesday,"" he said. ""This is going to take a while to sort through.""
That said, Bannon accused the Harris campaign of preparing for a possibly contentious legal fight after Election Day. He left out that the Trump campaign is making similar preparations.",2024-10-29
NPR,A judge orders Virginia to restore registered voters purged too close to Election Day,"A judge orders Virginia to restore registered voters purged too close to Election Day
A voter removal program in Virginia illegally purged registered voters from the state’s rolls too close to this fall’s election, a federal judge ruled Friday.
U.S. District Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles, who was nominated by President Biden, has ordered the state to put removed voters back on the state’s registration list and blocked Virginia from “continuing any systematic program intended to remove the names of ineligible voters” through Election Day.
“Virginia will immediately petition the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and, if necessary, the U.S. Supreme Court, for an emergency stay of the injunction,” Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in a statement.
Former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, voiced his support for Virginia’s appeal on his social media platform, calling the order “a totally unacceptable travesty.”
Eligible voters in Virginia still have time to register to vote in this fall’s election. In-person voter registration continues at voting sites through Election Day.
The ruling marks the second time this month a federal court has temporarily blocked voter purging efforts by a Republican-led state for violating the National Voter Registration Act.
Passed in 1993, the federal law bans Virginia and most other states from systematically removing registered voters within the 90 days before a federal election. That “quiet period,” which began in August for this fall’s races, is designed so that eligible voters have enough time to work out any issues before they’re kicked off lists and can’t cast a ballot in an upcoming election.
In August, Youngkin issued an executive order calling for “daily updates” to the state’s voter rolls in order to remove people who were not able to verify they are U.S. citizens to the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles.
The Justice Department and immigrant advocacy groups argued in court that this voter removal program was carried out during the 90-day quiet period and relied on DMV data that can be wrong or out of date to determine people’s U.S. citizenship status.
After the judge ruled, challengers of Virginia’s program said the court’s decision would help ensure naturalized U.S. citizens in Virginia can exercise their right to vote this fall.
“Every American citizen, regardless of where they were born, has the freedom to vote,” Paul Smith, the Campaign Legal Center’s senior vice president, said in a statement. “We’re glad the court acted so every Virginian can make their voice heard in this upcoming election.”
""Last-minute voter purges not only violate the law but also undermine the core principles of our democracy, especially when they are premised on xenophobic lies,"" said Celina Stewart, CEO of the League of Women Voters of the United States, in a statement.
Trump has claimed on his social media platform that the DOJ case against Virginia was filed to help Democrats “cheat” in the upcoming election. There is no evidence for that assertion.
Documents that the court ordered the state to release show that Virginia’s program has removed more than 1,600 registered voters from its rolls during the quiet period, Ryan Snow, an attorney with the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, who is representing the groups challenging Virginia, said Wednesday during a call with reporters.
Last week, a federal judge blocked a similar program led by Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, a Republican. U.S. District Judge Anna Manasco, who was nominated by Trump, ruled that Allen “blew the deadline” under the National Voter Registration Act when he announced a voter purge program 84 days before the last day of voting.

NPR,We talked politics at the North Carolina state fair — and learned 3 key things,"We talked politics at the North Carolina state fair — and learned 3 key things
North Carolina crashed the swing state party in 2024, especially after Vice President Kamala Harris replaced President Joe Biden atop the Democratic presidential ticket.
All along, political observers had expected six states to decide whether or not former President Donald Trump would return to the White House: Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Nevada, Arizona and Georgia.
But North Carolina was the state Trump won by the smallest margin in 2020, and as this year's presidential contest has entered its final stretch, both parties are pouring resources, time and energy into the Tarheel State. Polls show a close race in North Carolina.
To get a sense of where things stand away from the campaign rallies themselves, an NPR team took on the hardship assignment of a trip to the state fair. Amid the midway rides and fried food stands, we learned three key things about the race in North Carolina.
1. Election ads — and Mark Robinson — loom large
The most remarkable thing about our time in North Carolina was how inundated we were by the election. Every commercial break on just about every TV channel is filled, start to finish, with campaign ads. The same goes for the radio, and the pre-roll ads popping up on YouTube and social media feeds.
The election wormed its way into the fairgrounds, too: vendors were selling airbrushed t-shirts featuring Trump's defiant post-assassination attempt fist pump, with the caption ""You Missed!"" A beef jerky stand converted its tip jar into a straw poll, with one cup featuring an image of Harris and the other of Trump. (Trump had a decisive $12-to-$0 lead in this unscientific poll.)
""I get to the point where I'm ready for the election to be over,"" Deja Boston told us, as she, her husband Rahmode, and their 6-month-old-daughter Kynslei stopped near the North Carolina Democratic Party's booth. She sees ""too many"" ads — ""a thousand."" The Bostons tick off the incoming political content: text messages… television… radio…
What, if anything, has cut through all that noise? The Bostons both instantly respond: Mark Robinson.
The state's Republican lieutenant governor, who's running for governor, is playing a starring role in many of the ads blanketing North Carolina. Not necessarily his own campaign's ads, but rather, Democratic attack ads trying to link Republicans up and down the ballot to Robinson's controversial statements and policy stances, especially his strict opposition to abortion rights.
The Trump campaign and other Republicans have distanced themselves from Robinson, especially in the wake of a CNN report Robinson denies that ties him to racist and offensive comments made on a pornographic website. But he still has his supporters.
""He's very vocal, he's very opinionated,"" said Faye New. ""But they have taken some of the things he said out of context. They don't tell you the whole paragraph. They just see one line and say, ‘Oh, that sounds nasty, let's put it in there.’""
2. Everyone is anxious
Faye New is an unabashed Republican hardliner. We approach her because of her outfit: a bright pink WOMEN FOR ROBINSON cap, and a t-shirt that reads, ""I'm voting for the convicted felon."" (A New York jury found Trump guilty of falsifying business records in a criminal case earlier this year. He's facing felony charges in three additional cases, as well.)
She's quick with an answer on everything, except … the outcome of what's shaping up to be an incredibly tight race in North Carolina. Both the Trump and Harris campaigns have spent millions of dollars in the state, and have returned week after week for campaign events. Polls show a near-deadlocked race in a state that hasn't voted Democrat on the presidential level since 2008. ""It's tighter than I like it,"" New concedes. ""But you never know ‘til it's all said and done.""
Later on, we come across Debbie and Lew Love, who are wearing homemade hats supporting Harris: they feature a blue comma, as in the punctuation, and a red cursive LA. They voted earlier that day, and likely don't share many opinions with New, except that same anxiety about the result. ""My gut starts churning at 2 a.m., and I can't get it off my mind,"" Debbie Love said. “I just pray about it.""
Lew Love takes a more optimistic view: ""If [Democrats] can carry North Carolina, we'll be in good shape.""
That's true. The state's 16 electoral votes will likely play a key role in either Harris or Trump's path to 270, and the White House.
3. The 2024 election is about … many things
The political importance of North Carolina is clear. What's less clear is what the 2024 presidential race is primarily about. We asked every voter we came across what, to them, the stakes and story of the election were, and got a wide range of answers.
Like many Democrats, Debbie Lew said it came down to reproductive rights and the ongoing fallout in state legislatures across the country from the U.S. Supreme Court's 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade.
""Don't make me start crying over the abortion thing. It tears my heart out of my chest,"" Lew said. ""Because if a 12-year-old, 13-year-old, 16-year-old — if they're impregnated,"" she said, trailing off. ""I need to have the right to decide.""
The North Carolina legislature passed a 12-week abortion ban in the wake of the Dobbs decision. It's a major theme of Democratic campaign ads, and Harris is campaigning on signing a federal law restoring protections previously granted by Roe v. Wade.
Many Republicans see the race differently — even Dr. Bill Pincus, who was manning North Carolina Right To Life's booth at the fair. Pincus spoke passionately about how he believes life begins at conception, and that to him, opposing abortion rights is about protecting life. But when we asked him what the election was about, he said the economy. ""I think the real thing is everybody's hurting, because prices have gone up so much,"" he said.
Inflation has leveled out over the past year, but the topic remains raw, and politically potent, for conservatives. Derek Nipper, who was working the state Republican Party's booth, said for him, the election is about ""my wallet. I remember when Trump was in office, I was able to put up not a lot, but maybe $200 a paycheck."" Now, he said, ""I'm struggling to make it to payday with money in my pocket.""
There's one more factor — one that Harris is not campaigning on directly, but that's nevertheless top of mind to many voters. ""To be honest with you,"" said Deja Boston, ""it's just historical for me as a Black woman.""",2024-11-01

Today's top stories
Vice President Harris and former President Donald Trump headed West yesterday to deliver their closing arguments of the campaign to voters in the critical swing states of Arizona and Nevada. Both candidates are hoping to win over Latino voters in the states and talk about border security, one of the biggest issues for the campaign. While in Arizona, Harris criticized remarks Trump made at a rally Wednesday, where he claimed he would protect women ""whether the women like it or not."" She framed the comment as a warning about the potential consequences of a second Trump presidency for women.
- 🎧 Almost every day this week, Harris has jumped onto things Trump has said to emphasize her argument that he is not fit for office, NPR’s Tamara Keith tells Up First. Trump is working to win Latino voters and distance himself from the “garbage” comment a comedian made about Puerto Rico at one of his rallies. Trump is also trying to take back the narrative after President Biden appeared to say Trump supporters are garbage before clarifying he was talking about the comedian’s bad joke.
The Labor Department will provide an update on the job market this morning. This comes after several economic reports this week that showed the U.S. economy appearing to be in good shape.
- 🎧 The upcoming employment report is expected to indicate significantly slower job growth for October, according to NPR’s Scott Horsley. This slowdown is influenced by factors such as the Boeing strike and other labor disputes, along with the temporary effects of Hurricanes Helene and Milton. During the summer and early fall, consumer spending increased at an annual rate of 3.7%, primarily supported by solid wage gains. Overall, the economic data released this week has been largely positive, with inflation decreasing, wages rising and the economy growing at a healthy pace.
Thousands of union canvassers will be going door-to-door in swing states this weekend because they have a lot at stake in this election. Over the past four years, many feel the Biden-Harris administration has supported them by joining them on picket lines, creating more union jobs through legislation, and expanding overtime pay eligibility. Some say they now view Trump as a threat, as he enacted policies during his presidency that weakened federal employee unions.
- 🎧 NPR’s Andrea Hsu says the unions know that Trump has a lot of support from white, working-class voters, which includes some of their members. While canvassing they plan to highlight comments Trump made recently joking with Elon Musk about firing striking workers reminiscing about how he hated to pay overtime and would just hire more workers to avoid it. Even though they are pulling out large efforts, the persuasion phase of the campaign is largely over, Hsu says. But on the other hand, past research also shows that just asking people if they intend to vote increases the probability that they will.
Behind the story
I’ve had OCD for most of my life. It started in fourth grade as a fear of throwing up and turned into avoiding germs, sick people, any moving vehicle and situations without a clear exit.
By middle school, I couldn’t eat anything without saying a prayer first, or else I was convinced I’d vomit. I had to drop my Spanish minor in college, which required studying abroad, because I refused to board an airplane where I or someone near me may throw up.
I took my first flight in five years in January and have taken 16 flights since then!
Growing up, my parents and I had heard of OCD but didn’t know that it could manifest in the ways I experienced. This lack of understanding delayed my diagnosis and eventual treatment — and I’m not alone.
Those who experience violent or sexual intrusive thoughts also tend to delay getting treatment because they stay quiet, according to Dr. Christopher Pittenger, the director of Yale’s OCD Research Clinic. They know the thoughts they have are irrational, yet can’t get rid of them.
I talked to people who live with a variety of intrusive thoughts about harming themselves or others, questioning their own sexual orientation and breaking up with partners despite being in healthy relationships.
I’m not offended when people say “I’m so OCD” when they really mean “I like to keep my space tidy” — but until there’s a greater understanding of the scope of the disorder, it won’t get any easier for those of us who experience lesser-known forms of OCD to get help.

NPR,Philadelphia DA sues Elon Musk over $1 million giveaway to registered voters,"Philadelphia DA sues Elon Musk over $1 million giveaway to registered voters
On Monday, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner asked a state judge to stop Elon Musk’s $1 million giveaway to registered voters, calling the scheme “indisputably an unlawful lottery.”
Krasner brought the suit against Musk and his political action committee, America PAC.
“America PAC and Elon Musk are running an illegal lottery in Philadelphia (as well as throughout Pennsylvania),” the suit said.
“In other words, America PAC and Musk are lulling Philadelphia citizens – and others in the Commonwealth (and other swing states in the upcoming election) – to give up their personal identifying information and make a political pledge in exchange for the chance to win $1 million. That is a lottery.”
Musk announced the cash prize to voters in Pennsylvania during a stump speech earlier this month in support of former President Donald Trump.
“I have a surprise for you,"" Musk said shortly before bringing out a giant check. ""We are going to be awarding $1 million to people who have signed the petition — every day, from now until the election.”
Almost immediately, the promise of a cash prize caught the attention of election law experts, who warned that incentivizing a person to vote violates federal law.
""If you look at the conditions, you must be a registered voter,"" UCLA election law professor Richard Hasen told NPR. ""And so this is essentially a lottery that's open only to people who register to vote. So it’s either an incentive for someone to vote or it’s a reward. And either way, it violates federal law.""
Several people in key swing states have already reportedly won the cash prize from signing the petition, which purports to support the constitutional promises of free speech and the right to bear arms.

NPR,What could happen at the Supreme Court under Harris and Trump,"What could happen at the Supreme Court under Harris and Trump
The upcoming election, less than a week away, could reshape the U.S. Supreme Court — or not, depending on retirements, deaths, or other unforeseen events. The only certainty is political struggle.
Depending on who wins the presidential election, and control of the Senate, the current 6-to-3 conservative supermajority could remain the same, be trimmed to 5-to-4, or expand to an even larger and more lopsided conservative majority.
The public, for the most part, understands that if there is a Supreme Court vacancy, the president’s nominee will generally reflect the president’s views. But, there is a genuine possibility that if the Senate is controlled by the opposition party, the open seat will remain unfilled—not for months, but for years.
Indeed, there is also a real possibility that lower court seats will go unfilled, unless there is significant backroom horse-trading. In short, with power split between the White House and the Senate, there could be unprecedented gridlock on judicial nominations that extends all the way up to the Supreme Court and down to the appellate and even district courts.
'The Merrick Garland treatment'
In recent years, Republicans have wielded their power in unprecedented ways to prevent a president's Supreme Court nominee from being confirmed. When conservative Justice Antonin Scalia died unexpectedly in 2016, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell immediately announced that no Obama nominee would be considered at all prior to the election that was nearly a year away.
Obama went ahead anyway, figuring that old norms would prevail if he nominated a respected and centrist judge, someone acceptable to both Democrats and Republicans. Judge Merrick Garland seemed the best fit, but Garland didn’t even get a hearing, much less a vote. Four years later, after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Senate Republicans put the pedal to the metal just weeks before the election, rapidly pushing through the confirmation of judge, now Justice, Amy Coney Barrett.
This year, conservatives are just as determined to keep or expand their 6-to-3 Supreme Court majority. So what happens if Kamala Harris is elected president, but the Senate flips to Republican control?
“We’ll give you the Merrick Garland treatment,” says conservative scholar Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law, Houston. “We’ll have the seat open for three or four years,” he says.
A Trump win and a Democratic Senate
Would the reverse happen if Trump is elected but the Senate remains in Democratic hands?
Democrats like to think of themselves as “more responsible” than Republicans, but the pressures would be enormous to do unto the Republicans what they did to the Democrats.
Republicans “essentially crossed the Rubicon” in 2016 with the Garland nomination, says Harvard law professor Noah Feldman, who has written extensively about the court's history.
""Given that we’re in a world of…controversial revolutionary decisions, neither party would be likely to give a positive vote to a nominee of the president from the opposite party,"" he said.
NYU law professor Bob Bauer, who served as White House counsel for two years in the Obama administration, notes that institutional norms aren't necessarily permanent.
The whole notion that ""a certain process has to be respected, regardless of the potential impact on one party or another,"" he says. ""It's not a norm if it doesn’t command general adherence anymore.""
So what if Trump is elected, and the Senate flips, as expected, to Republican control? The only thing then standing between nominating and confirming a new Trump-appointed justice would be two moderate Republican senators, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine. If the Republican margin in the Senate is 52-48, their votes aren't needed; JD Vance would cast the tie-breaking vote as vice president even if Murkowski and Collins voted against the nominee.
So, what recourse would the Democrats have in a situation like that? How would they fight a Trump nomination? After all, there is no filibuster anymore to block a vote. Democrats abolished the filibuster for lower court nominations in 2011 in response to Republicans routinely blocking judicial nominations. Republicans then abolished the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations in 2017 after Trump was elected and nominated Neil Gorsuch to fill the seat that GOP leader McConnell had held open after Scalia's death.
Democrats are only candid about this when speaking not for attribution. As one put it, “We would largely be left with the politics of personal destruction, investigating every aspect of a nominee’s life to find something that is disqualifying.""
Unforeseen circumstances
Of course, right now, there is no vacant seat at the Supreme Court.
Although the deaths of Justices Scalia and Ginsburg prove that nothing is certain, they were far older than any member of the current court. Scalia was just days shy of turning 80 and Ginsburg was 87. In contrast, the oldest members of the current court are also among its most conservative. Justice Clarence Thomas is 76 and Justice Samuel Alito is 74, followed by liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor, 70, and Chief Justice Roberts, 69.
Some of the most politically active conservative thinkers would like to see Thomas and Alito step down for younger conservative judges who could serve for many decades longer and move the conservative needle even further to the right. They see as their ""farm team"" the ultra-conservative Fifth Circuit Court of appeals, populated with former Thomas and Alito clerks whose decisions are often reversed even by the current conservatives on the Supreme Court, including the men they once clerked for.
But those who know Thomas and Alito well are adamant that neither man would leave the court at this point. Several NPR spoke to would only speak candidly on condition of anonymity. “What would he do, go home and fly flags with his wife at the beach?” said one Alito ally, adding that the court is “Alito’s life.” As for Thomas, his friends and former clerks say he would see retirement as “caving into his critics” and being “driven off the court.”
So if there are no retirements or unexpected health crises, the court could well remain as is.
A period of dysfunction
That leaves the lower courts, which get less attention than the Supreme Court, but decide many more cases. During the last year of the Obama administration, when Republicans controlled the Senate, not one nominee to a regional appeals court was confirmed, though 10 trial court judges, a tiny fraction of vacancies, were. The result was that on the day Trump was sworn in, there were 105 judicial vacancies to fill.
Professor Blackman expects that if Harris is elected and Republicans control the Senate, something similar could happen for a full four years.
“They may just stop, confirming” any lower court judges, he says.
Other conservatives think that is far too dire a prediction. They expect that especially in states where both senators are Democrats, there would be horse-trading and a deal that allocates judicial seats — basically, the Democrats get one, for example, for every two or three GOP nominees.
Harvard's Feldman says he sees no light at the end of the tunnel when the parties are split, with a president of one party, and a Senate controlled by the other party. But dysfunction, he thinks could lead to change … eventually.
“We might have what I call the incredible shrinking Supreme Court,” he says, adding that “if we have divided government and we have justices naturally retiring or dying and they don’t get replaced, we could go down to eight, to seven, to six and eventually the public might start to notice and complain about it, and then some sort of compromise formation might be reached.” That said, he acknowledges a process like that could take 15 or 20 years.
If he's right, the end of dysfunction is a long way of off.
In the meantime, Justice Clarence Thomas, the most senior and seasoned Supreme Court justice, provides a lesson of longevity and power. If he serves another three years, he will break Justice William O. Douglas’ 36-year record for length of service on the court. Indeed, even sooner, when the next president is sworn in this January, Thomas will be making decisions that directly effect his 11th presidential administration.",2024-10-30

SAVANNAH, Ga. — Former President Donald Trump said economic policies he would enact in a second term would create an environment to ""steal"" manufacturing jobs that have moved overseas through tax cuts and tariffs.
In a winding speech in front of about 2,500 raucous supporters in the Johnny Mercer Theatre in Savannah on Tuesday, Trump shared his ideas for a ""manufacturing renaissance"" that he says would bring millions of jobs back to the U.S. from overseas.
""With the vision I'm outlining today, not only will we stop our businesses from leaving for foreign lands, but under my leadership, we're going to take other countries' jobs,"" he said. ""Did you ever hear that expression before? Have you ever heard that we're going to take other countries' jobs? It's never been stated before. We're going to take their factories — and we had it really rocking four years ago — we're going to bring thousands and thousands of businesses and trillions of dollars in wealth back to the good ole' USA.""
Trump called for lowering the corporate tax rate from 21% to 15% for ""those who make their product in the USA,"" continued a push for ""substantial tariffs"" on imported goods and proposed special manufacturing zones on federal land ""with ultra low taxes and regulations for American producers.""
""We're going to use our resources to our benefit,"" Trump said, also touting fewer environmental regulations around manufacturing. ""And it'll be clean and environmentally perfect so that American — and Americans can manufacture everything that we need, the resources we have right here, American soil. It's got everything: it's got the rare earth, it's got the oil, it's got the gas. We have everything — the only thing we don't have is smart people leading our country.""
Trump didn't offer specifics on many proposals. Some economists — and fellow Republicans — have warned that key Trump policies, like expanded tariffs, may hurt American consumers by making things more expensive and could harm American workers if countries enact retaliatory tariffs on exports.
""I’m not a fan of tariffs, they raise the prices for American consumers,"" Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters Tuesday. ""I’m more of a free-trade kind of Republican that remembers how many jobs are created by the exports that we engage in. So, I’m not a tariff fan.""
The main thrust of Trump's address was tax and manufacturing policy, but like most of his speeches it meandered through his typical campaign stump speech themes.
He attacked Vice President Harris as the ""tax queen"" whose proposals to tax unrealized investment gains for certain ultra-wealthy Americans would lead to a financial depression, but also riffed that she had ""bigger cognitive problems"" than President Biden.
He repeated his promise to enact mass deportations of migrants, expounded upon Russia's military history (noting that ""they beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon, that's what they do"") when discussing the war in Ukraine and recounted the two assassination attempts against him this summer, among other deviations from the topic of the economy.
Notably, Trump did not attack Georgia's Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, thanking him for being ""fantastic"" after excoriating Kemp at an Atlanta rally in early August that highlighted the rift between Trump and popular Republicans in the state who did not yield to his demands to overturn the 2020 election.
He did, however, continue to criticize parts of the electric vehicle industry and Biden administration rules around emissions that some Republicans call a ""mandate."" Georgia has quickly become the country's EV manufacturing capital, including a massive Hyundai compound about 25 miles outside of Savannah, the state's largest-ever economic development project that has seen a nearly $8 billion investment.
Trump's latest visit to Georgia comes as polls show the former president's likeliest path to victory runs through Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.

NPR,"There are a lot of nonpartisan voters in Nevada, making the swing state hard to read","There are a lot of nonpartisan voters in Nevada, making the swing state hard to read
Julian Herrera knows who he’s voting for. The 22-year-old Las Vegas resident’s vote is largely motivated by taxes, the housing market and the cost of living.
That’s why he’s voting for former President Donald Trump, just like he did in 2020. He feels that Trump is best to handle the economy better than Vice President Harris would.
“It's been much, much worse with Joe Biden,” said Herrera, who is 22 and works in real estate investment. “And I just don't understand what would be different since [Harris has] already been the VP for three and a half years.”
But one thing is different for Herrera in 2024: he is no longer registered in the Republican Party.
“The people that are actually a part of that party, the everyday person that is you know, that extreme white right wing that's just way too much like, ‘Oh my God, I hate liberals, I hate Democrats,’ and all that — that's kind of what pushes me away from that,” Herrera explained.
Herrera is just one of what’s been an explosion of nonpartisan voters over just the last four years in Nevada.
There are more nonpartisan voters than both Democrats and Republicans in the state: four in 10 registered voters are not affiliated with either major political party — a jump of 11 percentage points from 2020. Meanwhile, the percentage of registered Democrats decreased by 7 points between 2020 to 2024, and registered Republicans dropped by nearly 4 points.
The rise in nonpartisan voters is partly due to a 2020 law in Nevada that automatically registers new voters who do business at the DMV — like getting a driver’s license — as nonpartisan, giving voters the option to manually register for a political party later.
But Sondra Cosgrove, a historian at the College of Southern Nevada, says that’s only part of the picture.
“There's probably a lot of voters that just didn't feel like reregistering,” Cosgrove admitted.
“But there is a large number of very young voters who are registered [as] non-partisan, who feel really disengaged and alienated from the political parties,” she continued.
Because it’s been so difficult figuring out which kind of nonpartisan outnumbers the other, Nevada has become one of the most unpredictable swing states in a matchup with razor-thin margins.
Jon Ralston, the editor in chief of the Nevada Independent, is often referred to as the state’s voting expert, but his presidential crystal ball has never been this foggy.
“It's a big question mark,” Ralston said. “I usually have a feeling, even by this point, of who is going to win. I thought that about [Hillary] Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020.
“I am just not sure now,” he added.
There are other reasons why the state is a curveball. It’s using an all-mail voting system for the first time. There’s a ballot measure that would enshrine abortion rights, which Democrats hope will turn out voters. This is also the first election, though, since Nevada, which used to vote reliably for Democrats, toppled its sitting Democratic governor in the 2022 midterms.
Political parties pay attention
“They're going to play a major role,” said Tai Sims, communications director for the Nevada Democratic Party. “Which is why we've, you know, built an on-the-ground team.”
Six of the party’s 14 state offices are in rural communities, in order to court voters they don’t always reach.
“It's because most of these people, we see as Democrats maybe being registered as those nonpartisan or as those independent voters,” he said.
But Republican pollster Bob Ward, who conducts polling on Nevada for AARP, has a different view on these unaffiliated voters.
“They are likely to be either disillusioned Republicans or Trump fans,” Ward said. “And these are not large margins.
”I don't mean to say that all of these people are that way,” Ward continued, “but he has the advantage among these people.”
Halee Dobbins is the communications director for Arizona and Nevada for the Trump campaign. She thinks nonpartisan voters will help Republicans keep that advantage.
“They know they trust President Trump on issues like the economy, on issues like immigration, on tackling the housing affordability crisis,” she said. “And so those are the things that we feel like will really turn out a lot of voters this election.”
Nonpartisans divided
That’s not going to turn out 54 year-old nonpartisan Vance Acevedo, though.
“I don't believe for a minute that he would be able to take his ‘concept of a plan’ and actually implement anything,” Acevedo said, referring to a comment Trump made at the presidential debate against Harris.
“He's had a concept of a plan for health care. Why didn't he implement it for four years? He had a concept of this immigration wall. Where is it? Mexico is going to pay for it. Did they? No,” he said, chuckling.
Acevedo is most turned away from Trump because of his rhetoric, including that he wants to have generals like the ones Hitler had.
“I find it quite disturbing and concerning, and I think there would be less support for Trump if people actually thought maybe he was going to do what he's saying he's going to do,” he said.
So imagine Acevedo’s surprise when his partner, a fellow nonpartisan, told him he already voted for Trump. It was, as Acevedo put it, a “radical reversal of his prior position”: Acevedo, an ex-Republican, voted for Trump in 2016 while his partner voted for Hillary Clinton. Then, they both voted for Biden in 2020.
This time around, the couple still respects each other’s decision.
“We have to cancel each other out, I guess,” Acevedo joked.
Of course, there will be nonpartisan voters who simply choose not to vote for either candidate — including Roy Douglas. He likes to vote on the issues: He’s for voter ID laws, but cares about protecting abortion rights.
Douglas, who lives in Reno, knows he can’t vote for Trump. “I think Trump’s just a buffoon,” he said. And as for Harris? Douglas, who is 59 years-old, can’t vote for her because of the Biden administration’s policy on the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, and as a maintenance supervisor at a prison, he criticizes her past policies on criminal justice while she was attorney general for California.
He doesn’t mince words when talking about the election.
“I'd rather chop my hand off with a rusty saw than vote for either of those two,” Douglas said.",2024-10-31
NPR,What happens when Social Security runs out of money? : The Indicator from Planet Money,"What happens when Social Security runs out of money?
Social Security has thus far been self-sustaining—payroll taxes go into this big fund, which then pays out monthly checks. But the problem we have now is the money coming into that fund is not keeping up with the money going out.
The election hasn't been great for people concerned about the government's finances. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that Donald Trump's election proposals will speed up the rundown in the Social Security fund by a few years.
So, when Social Security runs out of money as it's projected to do ... could we just borrow more money? And if so, what would that mean for the already rising government's debt?
Today on the show, how worried should we be about Social Security and the federal debt? We explain a fresh indicator to assess whether or not America's getting too far in the red.

NPR,Harris and Trump enter the home stretch with rallies in 2 key Midwest swing states,"Harris and Trump enter the home stretch with rallies in 2 key Midwest swing states
DEARBORN, Mich./MILWAUKEE — Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Harris crisscrossed two Midwest swing states on Friday, as Trump made a last-minute bid to win over Arab-Americans in Michigan while Harris denounced her Republican opponent for violent remarks about former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney.
Heading into the final weekend of the presidential campaign, Trump made a brief stop in the heavily Arab American city of Dearborn, Michigan, where he called for an end to conflict in the Middle East but offered no specifics on how he would do so if elected to a second term.
Visiting The Great Commoner coffee shop in Dearborn, Trump used the appearance to make a pitch to voters that are angry with how the Biden administration has handled Israel's war in Gaza and Lebanon.
""We have a great feeling for Lebanon and I know so many people from Lebanon, Lebanese people and the Muslim population, they're liking Trump and they've had a good relationship with him,"" he said. ""This is it, this is where they are, Dearborn. We want their votes and we're looking for their votes and I think we'll get their votes.""
Both Trump and Harris had Friday night rallies in Milwaukee, part of several stops in the key ""Blue Wall"" states of Michigan and Wisconsin.
Trump has a fraught relationship with Arab and Muslim voters, spending much of the last decade demonizing them. In his first days in office, he signed an executive order that banned travel from majority-Muslim countries, and has expressed support for a similar ban if elected again.
At a rally earlier this year in Wisconsin, he implied a surge of migrants into the U.S. would lead to a terrorist attack similar to the Oct. 7, 2023 attack in Israel, vowing that ""we do not need a jihad in the United States of America.""
Now, in a state that he narrowly won by 10,000 votes in 2016 and President Biden won in 2020, Trump's outreach represented a last-minute effort to convert a key demographic group to his side.
Harris called Trump's remarks about Cheney ""disqualifying""
Speaking to reporters ahead of her Wisconsin stops, Harris addressed the violent language used by Trump in a late-night diatribe against Cheney, calling the remarks ""disqualifying.""
Asked about Trump's visit to Dearborn, Harris told reporters she had a ""significant amount of support"" from Arab Americans because of her position on ending the war in Gaza and her commitment to a two-state solution — and because of her positions on economic issues.
Harris has had her own struggles with Arab American voters stemming from opposition to the war in Gaza. Leaders of the ""uncommitted"" movement, which grew out of Democratic opposition to President Biden's policy toward Israel and Gaza, has said it would not endorse Harris for president, but it has urged supporters to ""vote against"" Trump. Harris' rallies are often interrupted by protesters upset about the war in Gaza.
A tussle over the economy
Harris and Trump also spent Friday focused on blue-collar workers, which make up a significant portion of the electorate in both states. Together with Pennsylvania — the third of the ""Blue Wall"" states — Michigan and Wisconsin are home to a higher eligible-voting population of white voters without college degrees than the four other swing states up for grabs.
At IBEW Local 890 in Janesville — a city that lost thousands of jobs when a GM plant closed in 2009 — Harris panned Trump's record on manufacturing jobs.
""He said Wisconsin would soon be home to a plant that he called ... the eighth wonder of the world,"" Harris said, referring to a Foxconn factory that was promised but never built. ""Typical for a person that is all talk, no walk,"" she said.
As Harris drove into the town of Little Chute, Trump supporters waved flags and signs outside. But there was also a long line of Harris supporters who couldn’t get in to the overstuffed high school gym.
In the closing stretch of her campaign, Harris has jettisoned a line she had used in nearly every speech, describing herself as the underdog in the race. Now, she is talking more and more about winning.
Even though polls show the race is too close to call in swing states, Harris campaign officials told reporters they have been reassured by early voting data and by recent focus groups with undecided voters.
""Make no mistake: we will win,"" Harris said at stops on Friday.
At his rally in Milwaukee, Trump zeroed in on Friday's jobs report showing employers added a scant 12,000 jobs in October — a figure that was skewed by an ongoing strike at Boeing and by the impact of Hurricanes Milton and Helene.
""These are the worst numbers anybody's heard of,"" Trump said.
""I stand before you today is the only candidate who can rescue our economy from total obliteration and restore it to strength, prosperity and actual greatness,"" he added.
Trump held his Milwaukee rally at the Fiserv Forum, the same arena where he formally accepted the Republican nomination days after an assassination attempt. He won the state in 2016, but lost it to Biden four years ago by just over 20,000 votes.
The final push
This weekend, Trump and Harris will be racing from swing state to swing state, trying to rally supporters and win over the last remaining undecided voters. Harris will have stops in Georgia, Michigan and North Carolina before wrapping her campaign Monday with a set of rallies in Pennsylvania — including one in Allentown, where more than half of people are Latino, mainly Puerto Rican.
Trump will be traveling to Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. He also has a stop in Virginia — a state Harris is widely favored to win. He'll end his campaign with stops Monday in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Michigan.

NPR,The Trump campaign tries to distance itself from Puerto Rico ‘joke’ at MSG rally,"The Trump campaign tries to distance itself from Puerto Rico ‘joke’ at MSG rally
Vice President Harris was promoting a new pledge to boost Puerto Rico’s economy in Philadelphia on Sunday — contrasting her approach with that of former President Donald Trump — when her message got some unexpected traction thanks to her opponent’s rally in New York.
A comedian warming up the crowd at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” — drawing outrage from Boricuas far and wide, and boosting support for Harris’ message.
Megastar Bad Bunny posted Harris’ video message pledging to work to create more jobs on the island and rebuild its rickety power grid to his 45 million Instagram followers, and other Puerto Rican artists followed suit.
Trump's campaign has distanced itself from the joke, one of several offensive lines from his act. Trump himself did not yet directly comment on it at two campaign appearances in Georgia on Monday.
But speaking from Wausau, Wisconsin, Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance dismissed the controversy.
""The way that we unite the country is to talk about the issues the American people care the most about,"" Vance told reporters, saying he had heard about the offensive material but hadn't seen it.
""I'm not going to comment on the specifics of the joke, but I think that we have to stop getting so offended at every little thing in the United States of America — I'm so over it,"" Vance said.
Other Republicans similarly sought to distance Trump from the remark.
""Puerto Rico isn’t garbage, it’s home to fellow American citizens who have made tremendous contributions to our country,"" wrote Florida Sen. Marco Rubio in a post on X. ""I understand why some people were offended by a comedians jokes last night. But those weren’t Trump’s words. They were jokes by an insult comic who offends virtually everyone, all the time….. because that is what insult comedians do.""
The 'joke' could have political impact in a key state
Puerto Ricans living on the island don’t get to vote in the presidential election. But Boricuas living on the mainland do — and in Pennsylvania, a pivotal state in this year’s race, they wield significant clout.
According to UCLA’s Latino Policy and Politics Institute, about 580,000 Latinos in Pennsylvania can vote in this election — and most of them are Puerto Rican.
Unidos US Action Fund said it would work to amplify the issue in the swing states Pennsylvania, Arizona and Nevada as it works to get out the Latino vote.
""This level of disrespect toward Puerto Ricans and Latinos at large is unconscionable and, more importantly, a reminder that when people show you who they are, believe them,"" said Rafael Collazo, executive director of the group, in a statement.
After Hurricane Maria hit the island in 2017, Trump questioned the death toll and fought with San Juan’s mayor over the federal response to the disaster. During a visit to the island after the storm, he infamously threw rolls of paper towels into a group of people at a church collecting supplies.
On Monday, the Harris campaign cut a new television ad with the comedian's comments superimposed over images of the island after 2017's Hurricane Maria and footage of Trump throwing rolls of paper towels into a group of people at a church collecting supplies.
Harris told reporters she was proud to have the support of Bad Bunny and Jennifer Lopez, and said Trump's rally was an example of how he has divided the country.
""Donald Trump spends full time trying to have Americans point their finger at each other, fans the fuel of hate and division. And that’s why people are exhausted with him,"" Harris said.
It was a message that former President Barack Obama echoed at a rally for Harris in Philadelphia, as he decried the “island of garbage” line from the MSG rally.
“These are fellow citizens he’s talking about,” Obama said. “Here in Philadelphia, they are your neighbors, they are your friends, they are your co-workers, they go to school with your kids. These are Americans. ”",2024-10-28
NPR,Florida fighting with the U.S. Justice Department over prosecuting Ryan Routh,"Florida fighting with the U.S. Justice Department over prosecuting Ryan Routh
MIAMI — Florida’s Attorney General is asking a federal judge to stop the U.S. Justice Department from blocking the state from investigating and prosecuting Ryan Routh. Routh is charged with attempting to assassinate former President Donald Trump while he was golfing in September.
Deputies arrested Routh after fleeing from what the FBI says was a “sniper’s nest” at Trump’s golf club in West Palm Beach. He’s charged with several counts, including attempting to assassinate a major Presidential candidate. Routh has pleaded not guilty.
Shortly after his arrest, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said the state would open its own investigation. At a news conference, DeSantis questioned whether the Justice Department, which is prosecuting Trump in two criminal cases, can handle Routh’s prosecution fairly and transparently.
The federal government quickly blocked that move. Justice Department officials cited a law which gives the federal government superseding authority over state investigations in cases like this. In a letter to Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody, U.S. Attorney for Florida’s Southern District Markenzy Lapointe said that the federal indictment of Routh on a charge of attempted assassination “resolves any potential uncertainty” about whether the federal law preempting the state’s authority applies.
That same law, Lapointe says, “does not preclude state prosecutions permissibly following the conclusion of the federal prosecution.”
Moody has filed a complaint in federal court asking a judge to overrule the Justice Department’s action and allow the state’s investigation of Routh to go forward. She says forcing Florida to wait to begin its investigation until the federal government completes its prosecution makes the state’s case harder to prove at trial. “Evidence disappears, memories fade, and the State has no way to force the federal government to cooperate.”
By blocking the state’s investigation and prosecution of Routh, she says the federal government is illegally taking authority from the state guaranteed under the Constitution’s 10th amendment. “The federal government’s attempt to thwart Florida’s investigation vastly overreads (the law),” Moody says, “and any enforcement of it would constitute illegal executive action.”
It's not clear when the federal judge will rule on the request.",2024-10-24
NPR,What the Harris campaign is doing to try to win over more Black men,"What the Harris campaign is doing to try to win over more Black men
ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. — From behind her barber chair and in her community, Cherita Evans — who goes by “Storm the Barber” — has picked up on a troubling trend for Vice President Harris’ campaign.
“Most of my female family and friends — they're voting for Harris,” Evans said in an interview at the Head Changerz shop last week. But she said some of the men in her life aren’t so sure. “I think ... a lot of men aren't ready to vote for a woman.”
“In my community, you have a lot of men, who, you know, won’t even be under a female leadership in church,” said Evans.
This is a problem the Harris campaign is racing to address as early voting begins in key states where every vote will count. Polls show former President Donald Trump may be making some inroads with Black male voters — and other Black men may not vote.
That’s why on Tuesday Harris will be taking questions from callers in swing states in a town hall conversation moderated by Charlamagne tha God, an influential Black radio host who has pulled very few punches with Democratic politicians.
The challenge was underscored by former President Barack Obama this week. He spoke what he called “some truths” about how energy and turnout for Harris in Black communities was not what it was when he was running — and said that it “seems to be more pronounced with the brothers.”
“Part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that,” Obama said.
What Harris is doing to reach Black male voters
Harris’ campaign is working to engage Black male voters, including hosting tailgate events at homecomings at historically Black colleges. Harris also had a conversation on All the Smoke, a podcast hosted by two former NBA stars, where she talked about her identity — something she hasn’t often leaned into on the campaign trail.
This weekend, Harris is in North Carolina meeting local Black leaders. On Sunday, she plans to attend a church service in Greenville, and later hold a rally. The city is in Eastern North Carolina, a section of the state with a large Black population, but where turnout among those voters has lagged in recent years.
Her path to the presidency runs through communities like Rocky Mount, where NPR first met Evans back in May.
At that time, Evans was less than enthusiastic about the election, saying she didn’t like Trump or Biden. Evans was disappointed that Harris had disappeared from the spotlight.
“After she became vice president, it seemed like she just kind of got quiet,” said Evans.
Evans said she thinks Harris is a better candidate than Biden — but not perfect.
“I’m going to be honest with you: I don’t really like Trump, so I am going to vote for her,” said Evans. “But I don’t think she’s done a very great job of addressing the main issues that we are having.”
Like so many voters this year, Evans says gas prices are high and groceries are too expensive. She sees Harris talking about going after companies for price gouging in the ads that show up constantly on the TV in the barbershop — but Evans doesn’t buy that as a real solution.
There's a generational divide in voting
Back in May, Evans was cutting the hair of Christian Pounds, a 22-year-old college student. At the time he didn’t like either candidate and didn’t think his vote would change anything.
Reached on the phone this week, he said he’s definitely planning to vote. “When Biden dropped out, I was kind of happy,” Pounds said, explaining he thought Biden was too old for the job.
The other night, Pound says he got into a heated discussion with his uncle and his cousin about voting. His cousin isn’t planning to vote. “My uncle was like, ‘You better vote for Kamala Harris.’”
Pounds said he sees a real generational divide among his friends and family — “the young people vs. the old, when it comes to voting vs. not voting,”
In the neighboring community of Wilson, Mike Harris is a barber at Style Masters. He’s been voting for Democrats all his life, and said he hopes Harris will become the first female president.
But the same isn’t true for all of his clients and friends
“Some people — I don't know if they joking or not — say they are” voting for Trump, said Mike Harris.
“Some people don't believe in female leaders, but I tell them all the time ... my mom raised me and my brother in our house. So I think that, you know, women can do the job,” Mike Harris said.

NPR,Enforcement was considered discriminatory. Now New Yorkers can jaywalk legally,"Enforcement was considered discriminatory. Now New Yorkers can jaywalk legally
Just about everybody on the streets of New York City seems to jaywalk — but now it's no longer illegal.
Supporters of the measure to decriminalize jaywalking said enforcement was often discriminatory.
“Let's be real: jaywalking is a way of life in New York City. It’s how people navigate our city,” said Council Member Mercedes Narcisse of Brooklyn, the lead sponsor of the legislation, said in a statement to NPR.
“Penalizing residents for crossing the street as they go about their day is outdated and unnecessary, especially given how disproportionately these penalties have been enforced,"" she said.
Jaywalking officially became legal last weekend, a month after the New York City Council passed a bill to stop police from issuing tickets for pedestrians who stepped outside the lines — a crime that used to carry a penalty of up to $250.
""Police officers have told me they prefer to spend their time on real safety concerns, not handing out jaywalking tickets,"" Narcsisse said. ""This law frees them up to focus on more critical community issues, making better use of their efforts and resources.""
New York police have long faced criticisms for stopping Black and Hispanic pedestrians at a far steeper rate than white citizens.
Gothamist reported that in the first six months of 2024, the New York Police Department issued 786 pedestrian-related summonses, 77% of which went to Black or Hispanic people.
“We’re seeing discriminatory enforcement of this, but the other thing is that it’s not keeping us any safer,” said Council Member Tiffany Cabán of Queens, who was one of the bill’s sponsors.
The Legal Aid Society, which has long been critical of the jaywalking penalties, praised the City Council for getting the law passed and said it would be monitoring the NYPD to ensure they respected the new legislation.
“Decriminalizing jaywalking in New York City is long-overdue and eradicates a mechanism that the New York City Police Department (NYPD) has, for decades, employed as a pretext to stop, question, and frisk New Yorkers, especially those from communities of color,” the Legal Aid Society said in a statement.
“With this legislation now codified, we hope that both the Adams Administration and the City Council will continue to abolish relic laws that serve no public safety purpose and only ensnare people in the criminal legal system,” the group added.",2024-10-30
NPR,"At the site of Trump’s Jan. 6 rally, Harris makes her closing pitch for the campaign","At the site of Trump’s Jan. 6 rally, Harris makes her closing pitch for the campaign
A week before Election Day, Vice President Harris used the spot where her opponent held his Jan. 6, 2021 rally to give a sweeping speech laying out her priorities and excoriating her opponent for his character and past actions.
Delivering the closing argument of her campaign, with the White House illuminated in the background, Harris said it’s time to move on from the divisive and chaotic era of her opponent, former President Donald Trump.
""America: this is not a candidate for president who is thinking about how to make your life better. This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance and out for unchecked power,"" Harris said.
The event was far from any swing state. But it was aimed at creating the kind of big moment that could break through to what campaign operatives call ""low propensity"" voters who aren't usually all that interested in politics — and to convince them to cast a ballot.
More than 40,000 people went through security for the event, Harris' campaign said, with many more outside the perimeter.
Harris highlighted Trump's 'enemies list'
On Jan. 6, 2021, Trump held a rally on the Ellipse, with the White House in the background, telling his supporters to “fight like hell” on the day Congress was meeting to certify that President Biden had won the election.
""Look, we know who Donald Trump is,"" Harris said. ""He is the person who stood at this very spot nearly four years ago and sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol to overturn the will of the people in a free and fair election — an election that he knew he lost.""
In contrast, Harris pledged she would ""seek common ground"" and listen ""to people who disagree with me.""
Responding to Harris' address, Trump's campaign said she was ""lying"" and ""name-calling"" and said she should have done more to address the cost of living and border security as vice president.
""As for President Trump, his closing argument to the American people is simple: Kamala broke it; he will fix it,"" his campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.
Some Democrats have worried Harris’ warnings about Trump are not enough to get across the finish line in a very tight race where voters rank economic concerns as their top priority.
Harris acknowledged voters are still getting to know her
Harris sought to use the speech to recap her promises and values, saying she recognized that ""this has not been a typical campaign"" — a nod to the fact that President Biden sitting in the White House behind her had stepped down this summer from his bid for a second term after a catastrophic debate against Trump.
""I know that many of you are still getting to know who I am,"" she said, describing her middle-class upbringing and career as a prosecutor.
""There's something about people being treated unfairly or overlooked that, frankly, just gets to me. I don't like it,"" she said.
Harris touched on two hot-button issues of the campaign in her remarks — abortion rights and border security.
She sought to separate her policies from those of Biden, saying she would bring her own ideas to the job, and would focus on lowering costs for groceries, prescription drugs, homes, child care and elder care.
""Donald Trump's answer to you is the same as it was the last time: another trillion dollars in tax cuts for billionaires and big corporations, and this time, he will pay for it with a 20% national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported,"" she said, describing Trump's pledge to hike tariffs.

Video of the final the moments before Othel Moore's December 2023 death shows the Black 38-year-old heaving with a mask covering his face, hands restrained behind his back and legs bound together as a guard watches from outside the cell.
Four former staffers at the Jefferson City Correctional Center have pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder. Charges against a fifth were dropped, Department of Corrections spokesperson Karen Pojmann said.
A criminal complaint alleges that guards pepper-sprayed Moore, placed a mask over his face and left him in a position that caused him to suffocate.
Moore's mother and sister separately filed a wrongful death lawsuit.
Surveillance video provided by Moore family lawyers shows a number of incarcerated men stripped down to their boxers with their hands restrained behind their backs as guards filter through cells and belongings on Dec. 8, 2023, the day Moore died.
While standing handcuffed just outside his cell door, a guard pepper-sprayed Moore, according to Cole County Prosecuting Attorney Locke Thompson's office.
Video released by Moore's family then shows him being led away from the other incarcerated men. Guards held his arms as he went down to his knees and eventually lay face down on the floor.
Guards then bound his legs together and put a mask over his face before strapping him into a cart in a reclined position, the video shows.
As he was restrained, the video shows Moore swayed back and forth but did not appear to struggle with guards.
Guards told investigators that Moore was not following orders to be quiet and that he spit at them, although witnesses said Moore was spitting pepper spray out of his mouth.
Video shows guards then wheeled Moore to a locked cell, where he initially attempted to push himself to a more upright position before falling back into the reclined headrest.
His movements gradually slowed for about 20 minutes until he lay motionless, his head slumped to one side.
A nurse arrived about 10 minutes after Moore went motionless, calmly checked his pulse and moved his limp head. The nurse and another staffer briefly applied rapid compressions to his upper body before he was wheeled out of the cell.
The Moore family's attorney, Andrew M. Stroth, said in a Tuesday news conference that prison staff acted with ""no sense of urgency.""
In a separate statement, Stroth said the video highlights ""the complete disregard for the sanctity of life, deliberate indifference and failure to provide emergency medical care to Othel by the medical staff.""
Ten staffers and contractor employees were fired in response to Moore's death.
""We have taken and will continue to take steps necessary to mitigate safety risks to everyone in our facilities,"" said a June statement from the department after criminal charges were filed against several former staffers. ""We take seriously our responsibility for creating the safest environment possible and will not tolerate behaviors or conditions that endanger the wellbeing of Missourians working or living in our facilities.""
Pojmann in a Tuesday email said body cameras are now used at all of the state's maximum-security facilities.
Three of the former staffers charged with second-degree murder in Moore's death have scheduled court appearances in January. A fourth faces trial Dec. 11.",2024-10-30
NPR,"As war in Gaza fractures Democrats, Republicans see an opening with Jewish voters","As war in Gaza fractures Democrats, Republicans see an opening with Jewish voters
Jewish voters have been a reliable voting bloc for Democrats for decades, but the war between Israel and Hamas has complicated that relationship.
As Vice President Kamala Harris faces continued pressure from progressives in the Democratic Party to cut off military aid to Israel, some Republicans see an opportunity to win over Jewish voters in key states.
“Israel is in, literally, the fight for its existence,” former Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman, now the national chairman of the Republican Jewish Coalition, told a room of supporters at a country club in suburban Detroit on Monday. “The existence of the Jewish state is at risk today — both in terms of war and battle … as well as what happens in the United States in terms of whether our support is there unequivocally or whether folks are gonna step back.”
Some in the audience wore red kippahs — a symbol of their Judaism — with the word “TRUMP” printed on one side.
Sheila Weissman, from nearby West Bloomfield, stood outside the event clutching several yard signs, including one that read “Kamala — Oy Vey.”
“It’s been a tepid response at best by this administration,” Weissman said about antisemitism in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas-led militants. The attack killed 1,200 people in Israel, according to the Israeli government. Israel's military response has killed at least 43,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health.
As a swing state voter, Weissman said she’s concerned about war in the Middle East and antisemitism at home.
A report released by the Anti-Defamation League — using an expanded definition of antisemitism to include some anti-Zionist language — found a record number of those types of incidents in the year since the Hamas attacks, including thousands surrounding left-wing anti-Israel demonstrations.
Weissman said she thinks those realities could reshape voting patterns among Jewish Americans, who’ve historically sided overwhelmingly with Democrats.
“October 7th changed things,” Weissman said. “The things that happened in this country on college campuses, I mean, it's just really terrifying.”
Weissman has heard the claims that former President Donald Trump has condoned antisemitic rhetoric. But she thinks his words are sometimes taken out of context. And she likes his record on Israel, including his decision to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem.
The RJC is investing $15 million in the 2024 campaign, in an effort to win over Jewish voters in swing states through ads, canvassing and other outreach. The group is highlighting Trump’s record of support for Israel, including efforts to normalize relations between Israel and some of its Arab neighbors through the agreement known as the Abraham Accords.
RJC CEO Matt Brooks says it’s the organization’s largest investment in a campaign ever, in part because he sees this year as a likely “inflection point” for Jewish voters.
Many Jewish Democrats are still supporting Harris
Michigan State Sen. Jeremy Moss, a Jewish Democrat, says Jewish voters are concerned about antisemitism across the political spectrum, but he believes they ultimately will support the Democratic nominee as most have in the past.
“Kamala Harris has held the line against these extreme voices that spout off antisemitism when discussing this Israel conflict on the far left right now,” Moss said.
Moss — who has criticized Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a fellow Democrat, over her remarks about Israel — said Harris has struck the right tone when it comes to the conflict. Harris has repeatedly said she believes Israel has a right to defend itself from threats across the region, and has called for bringing Israeli hostages home and protecting Palestinian civilians.
“But then you look at the other side and Donald Trump platforms anti-Semitic extremism in the Republican Party on the far right,” Moss said.
Moss said most Jewish voters also align with Harris on other key issues, including abortion rights — which has become a major focus of the Democrats’ closing message to voters across the country.
Recent polls from the Jewish Democratic Council of America suggest those numbers are holding steady. But some others, including one from the conservative Manhattan Institute, suggest what the organization’s report characterized as “growing cracks in that support.”
Alan Cooperman, director of religion research at the Pew Research Center, says small religious groups are difficult to poll accurately.
“I think honestly, nobody knows,” he said. “Nobody knows whether the Jewish vote is different in this election from past presidential elections.”
Jews make up only around 2% of the United States population, but many live in swing states including Michigan, Arizona and Pennsylvania — and even small groups can make a difference in a close election.
At a Harris campaign event on Monday in the critical state of Pennsylvania, second gentleman Doug Emhoff reiterated the vice president's commitment to supporting Israel and fighting antisemitism. Emhoff, who himself is Jewish, reminded the crowd of the anniversary this week of the deadly mass shooting attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018.
“When Kamala is President, she will continue to stand with Israel and with the Jewish community — our community,” Emhoff said. “She will reject anti-Semitic hate and the notion that Israel does not have the right to exist.”",2024-10-29
NPR,Here are the key Electoral College dates to keep in mind ahead of Inauguration Day,"Here are the key Electoral College dates to keep in mind ahead of Inauguration Day
Former President Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election — culminating with the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol — put a spotlight on what are essentially ministerial steps between Election Day and Inauguration Day.
And with Trump, the Republican nominee, refusing to commit to honor the results of the 2024 presidential election, these incremental aspects of the process are worth paying attention to again.
Here are the key dates ahead:
Nov. 5 — Election Day
The end of voting marks the beginning of reporting results. While no votes can be cast after Election Day, many states allow postmarked mail ballots to come in for several days after, and for voters to fix errors with their ballots.
Over the next few weeks
Election officials will always tell you that results reported on election night are unofficial. Over the next few weeks, they'll confirm those tallies, add in provisional ballots and ballots from overseas, and deal with any recounts, getting to the official results by both local and state certification deadlines. (These deadlines vary by state; you can see all of them here.)
Dec. 11 — The appointing of electors
This is a key deadline: It's when a state ""executive"" has to certify the state's presidential electors. (The governor is a state's default executive, unless state law ahead of time designates another official.) According to the Electoral Count Reform Act, which was passed on a bipartisan vote in 2022, this deadline is six days before the electors meet, which this year is...
Dec. 17 — The meeting of electors
The appointed presidential electors from each state will meet in their state capitals to cast their official votes for the candidate who won their state's votes. Together, these gatherings are referred to as the meeting of the Electoral College.
Dec. 25 — The arrival of the electoral votes
The president of the Senate and the national archivist must receive the electoral certificates of each state by the fourth Wednesday in December.
Jan. 3, 2025 — The swearing-in of the new Congress
The new Congress is sworn in before its members count the presidential electoral votes.
Jan. 6 — The counting of electoral votes in Congress
In the election's final step, members of Congress convene to count the electoral votes.
Following the effort to overturn the 2020 election, the Electoral Count Reform Act also introduced a series of reforms to this joint session, such as clarifying that the vice president's role (as president of the Senate) in overseeing this count is ""ministerial,"" and raising the threshold for objections to a state's electoral slates to one-fifth of each chamber.

NPR,Judge unseals new evidence against Trump in the Jan. 6 election interference case,"Judge unseals new evidence against Trump in the Jan. 6 election interference case
In a newly unsealed court filing, special counsel Jack Smith provides the most detailed picture yet of his criminal case against Donald Trump for allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 election and why the former president isn't immune from prosecution.
U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is presiding over the case, released the filing, with minor redactions, on Wednesday.
The special counsel uses the 165-page document to make his case that Trump's actions around the election were made in a private capacity and not in his official role as president.
The filing comes after the Supreme Court ruled this summer that presidents enjoy broad immunity for official acts while in office, but not for unofficial acts as a candidate or a private citizen.
""When the defendant lost the 2020 presidential election, he resorted to crimes to try to stay in office,"" the special counsel's team writes. ""With private co-conspirators, the defendant launched a series of increasingly desperate plans to overturn the legitimate election results in seven states that he had lost.""
A D.C. grand jury indictment accused Trump of actions that culminated in the violent siege at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. If he regains the White House, Trump is expected to direct new Justice Department leaders to drop the landmark case.
Prosecutors accuse Trump of spearheading a conspiracy to overturn the results of the 2020 election and disenfranchise millions of American voters.
""At its core, the defendant's scheme was a private criminal effort,"" the special counsel writes. ""In his capacity as a candidate, the defendant used deceit to target every stage of the electoral process.""
The filing offers several new details about Trump's actions
The broad strokes of the special counsel's allegations against Trump have long been known. The filing, though, adds some new details, including sensitive testimony from witnesses and notes taken by former Vice President Mike Pence.
It also offers some colorful details, largely designed to tie Trump to overlapping conspiracies to overturn the 2020 election.
In one section, the filing details what Trump was doing on Jan. 6, 2021, as a violent mob of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. Trump, it says, settled into the dining room off the Oval Office around 1:30 p.m. and spent the afternoon reviewing Twitter on his phone while Fox News played in the background.
At one point, a staffer rushed into the dining room to tell Trump that Pence had been rushed to a secure location because of the rioters. The staffer hoped, the filing says, that Trump would do something to ensure Pence's safety.
Instead, the document says, Trump ""looked at him and said only, 'So what?'""
The new filing also provides a closer look at Trump's interactions with his former political aide, podcaster Steve Bannon, including a phone call the two men had the day before the Capitol riot, the new court filing says.
Just a couple of hours later, Bannon told his podcast audience that ""all hell"" would break loose the following day.
Lawyers for Trump and for Smith, the special counsel, had clashed over whether the court filing should be released, given its potential impact on the 2024 presidential election, where Trump is the Republican nominee.
Ultimately, Chutkan agreed to release part of the government's new arguments against the former president, saying the public must understand the court's eventual decision on immunity and therefore needs access to the government's arguments.
In response to the release, Trump posted to TruthSocial to accuse Democrats of ""Weaponizing the Justice Department against me because they know I am WINNING.""
""This is egregious PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT, and should not have been released right before the Election,"" he continued.",2024-10-02
NPR,New polling finds Harris gaining with a group she has struggled with: Black men,"New polling finds Harris gaining with a group she has struggled with: Black men
Black voters have long been the loyal backbone of the Democratic Party, but polls this year have shown some younger Black men may not feel the same degree of party loyalty that their mothers, sisters or aunts do.
About one in five younger Black men say they support the Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, according to new polling of voters done for the NAACP between Oct. 11-17. The poll of 1,000 registered Black voters had a margin of error of 3.14 percentage poins.
Support for Trump has dropped since August, according to data from the group announced on Monday. But it’s still a warning sign for the Harris campaign, which needs strong turnout from Black men in tight races in swing states and has been working to address this vulnerability.
Harris downplays the concern even as she courts Black male voters
The issue was elevated by former President Barack Obama, who delivered a blunt message to young Black men on Oct. 10 about backing Harris.
Harris has said that she knows she has to “earn” the votes of Black men, just as with any other demographic. But in an interview with The Breakfast Club, a popular Black radio show, Harris dismissed the idea that she has a particular weakness with Black male voters.
“The brothers aren’t saying that,” she said in the interview, which aired Tuesday. She described the issue as a “media narrative.”
“The Black men, in particular, who are at the rallies have recently been saying, 'Don’t you listen to that. And they got to stop with all that noise. We support you,'” Harris said.
Joshua Doss with HIT strategies, the biggest Black-owned political consulting firm in the country, said he thinks the concerns have been overplayed.
“The truth is, Black men are the least Trumpy male voters in America — full stop,” Doss told reporters. HIT strategies conducted the surveys for the NAACP.
The latest survey of registered voters found Black men under 50 have decreased their likelihood to vote for Trump to 21%, down from 27% in August — and increased their likelihood to vote for Harris to 59%, up from 51% in August.
What Harris has been doing on the trail to reach Black voters
Since Obama’s warning, the Harris campaign has been working to get their message out to young Black men, including a town hall with Charlamagne tha God and the Club Shay Shay podcast.
Harris spent much of the day Sunday in Philadelphia courting Black voters — attending church and then later visiting a barbershop to meet Black men, before dropping by a historic Black-owned bookstore in the city.
“The path to victory runs right through all the leaders who are here,” she told a largely Black crowd at a rally in Philadelphia.
Derrick Johnson, the president of the NAACP, said “mis- and disinformation that is circulating on social media” was the biggest challenge in getting young Black voters to the polls.
Johnson noted the median age in the Black community is 32, so many people are getting their news online rather than from traditional news platforms. “Our goal is to try to penetrate that as much as possible,” he told reporters.
The NAACP poll showed that messaging on health care seems to be translating more effectively to Black men in recent weeks, increasing their likelihood to vote.
On Saturday, former first lady Michelle Obama made a direct plea to men — and framed this election as a fight to protect the reproductive rights and healthcare for the women in their lives.
“I’m asking y’all from the core of my being to take our lives seriously — please,” Obama said. “Do not put our lives in the hands of politicians — mostly men — who have no clue or do not care about what we, as women, are going through.”",2024-10-28
NPR,How many ways can you tell someone to vote? : Consider This from NPR,"How many ways can you tell someone to vote?
There are plenty of ways to encourage people to vote, as the presidential candidates and their supporters are demonstrating in this final stretch of the campaign.
There's the direct approach, from former president Donald Trump at a rally in Georgia., borrowing a page from Nike, telling supporters: ""Just Vote. Whichever way you wanna do it.""
At another Georgia event, Democratic Vice Presidential nominee Tim Walz encouraged voters to imagine their future selves.
""Even some of you younger people, you will be on your porch in a rocking chair some day and there will be a little one at your knee. They will say, what did you do in 2024 to save democracy?"" You will say, 'Every damn thing I could do.'""
By this point in the campaign, the focus has shifted from persuasion to motivation, and the candidates want to make sure everyone who already leans their way actually casts a ballot.
That's why you hear former first lady Michelle Obama reminding potential supporters of Vice President Kamala Harris that they don't have to tell anyone how they voted.
""If you are a woman who lives in a household of men that don't listen to you or value your opinion, just remember that your vote is a private matter. Regardless of the political views of your partner, you get to choose.""
And it's why you hear Trump laying out an alternate vision of politics within marriage.
""Make sure you vote and bring all our friends that want to vote for us. Tell them, 'Jill. Get your fat husband off the couch. Get that—get that fat pig off the couch. Tell him to go and vote for Trump, he's gonna save our country.""

The efforts to get the votes for Harris
Behind the scenes, of course, there is a huge operation to back these voting efforts up. Texts and phone banks, and door to door canvassers all trying to make sure no gettable vote is left on the field.
This year, the two campaign strategies look a little different. To break them down, Consider This was joined by two NPR correspondents who have been watching all of this. First, there's Asma Khalid, who has been covering Vice President Harris's campaign, and says it's been an ambitious effort.
""The campaign says it has roughly 2000 staffers and 250 offices across the key swing states. Now, in terms of what that operation looks like, it's a combination of traditional phone banking and doorknocking, volunteers just making cold calls,"" Khalid said.
""And then it's also about relational organizing, people texting, say, friends and family. One thing I think that is worth pointing out is that when Harris became the Democratic nominee and replaced Joe Biden at the top of the ticket, there was this sudden surge of organic enthusiasm among different demographic groups. You probably remember those Zoom calls, right? Like white women for Harris, Indian-Americans for Harris. And even though these are ostensibly unaffiliated with the campaign, they are an extremely powerful organizing tool that frankly, Democrats did not have before.""
So who did Harris' campaign try to reach in these final days?
""The campaign has a three pronged vision in the key states, and it's pretty similar whether you're talking about Georgia or Pennsylvania,"" she added.
""First off, the goal is to solidly win the cities. Secondly, they're trying to win the suburbs convincingly, and they think they have an edge on issues like reproductive rights and the threat that they believe Trump poses to democracy. They think that this could really resonate with college educated voters in the suburbs. And lastly, they are trying to lose by less in rural areas. This is really interesting because to this point, as an example, the campaign says about a third of their Pennsylvania offices are in counties. Trump won by double digits last time.""
And Trump's
NPR's Stephen Fowler says it's not so easy to cross compare those numbers for the Republican side of these efforts.
""There's no direct comparison because Republicans don't share those numbers to the same degree. But it is less than the Democrats, partially because Republicans keep focus on this program, called Trump Force 47,"" Fowler said.
""They're relying on grassroots volunteers with a lot of enthusiasm to be the ones doing the door knocking, talking to their own neighbors and friends in their communities, and also talking to people who don't often vote instead of primarily using paid canvassers. Now the canvassers are still there, but those are handled mainly by third party groups run by people like Turning Points, Charlie Kirk and billionaire Elon Musk.""
Fowler says despite their reach, these groups are relatively inexperienced, and some Republicans are worried that potential voters for them could be falling through the cracks.
But are these fears rational with the history of Trump's popularity? Listen to the full episode of Consider This to find out.

Conspiracy theories about election fraud have lit up social media as Election Day is less than a week away and millions of Americans have already cast their ballots. There are massive efforts to collect suspicious incidents and frame them as a coordinated effort to steal the election. The ""Election Integrity Community"" on X is one hub for these efforts. The community is set up by the social media site's owner Elon Musk's super PAC and invites users to ""share potential incidents of voter fraud or irregularities you see while voting in the 2024 election.""
- 🎧 Trump supporters are collecting evidence of voter fraud in an effort to safeguard the vote, NPR’s Huo Jingnan tells Up First. The online evidence gathering involves a lot of first-person accounts of people running into mistakes or things they didn’t expect. A big narrative of this election is that noncitizens are voting in large numbers. “To be clear there have been incidents of noncitizens voting illegally, but it happens in very small numbers and there is no sign that it has affected election results,” Jingnan says. This builds an impression that voter fraud is happening everywhere when in fact it’s very rare.
Nearly 40% of women under the age of 30 cite abortion as a top issue in this election. Abortion access will be directly on the ballot in 10 states next week. Vice President Harris has stated that if she is elected, she will restore reproductive freedom and sign a bill that enshrines the right to an abortion. In contrast, former President Donald Trump and his allies have discussed the possibility of implementing national abortion limits often referred to as a minimum national standard. However, Trump rolled that back on the campaign trail weeks ago, saying he would veto a federal abortion ban.
- 🎧 Harris wouldn’t be able to expand abortion rights alone. She needs Congress’ support, NPR’s Elissa Nadworny says. Even if she could get something passed, she would face legal challenges and a now conservative Supreme Court. If Trump became president, he could limit abortion by enforcing an anti-obscenity law called the Comstock Act. It could be used to criminalize abortion by banning abortion pills and medical instruments needed for the procedure. Once in office, a president could use executive authority to strengthen privacy laws to protect women from prosecution. In contrast, the president could create abortion tracking requirements.
A series of Facebook ads seemingly advocating for Harris are actually spreading misinformation about her current policy positions in an attempt to mislead voters. These ads, which have been viewed millions of times in swing states, are posted by an account called “Progress 2028,” which suggests a liberal counterpart to the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025. The ads claim that Harris intends to implement a mandatory gun buyback program, provide Medicare benefits and driver’s licenses to undocumented immigrants and ban fracking. Funding for these ads comes from a dark money group backed by Musk and others, according to the campaign tracking site Open Secrets.

NPR,Grammy-winning rapper Lil Durk is charged in murder-for-hire conspiracy,"Grammy-winning rapper Lil Durk is charged in murder-for-hire conspiracy
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — Grammy Award-winning rapper Lil Durk has been arrested in Florida on federal charges that he paid for the attempted 2022 revenge killing of rapper Quando Rondo at a Los Angeles gas station, a shooting that resulted in the death of Rondo's cousin.
Durk, 32, is charged with conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire in the slaying of Saviay'a Robinson, 24, who was gunned down on Aug. 19, 2022, according to an FBI affidavit released Friday.
Five other members of Durk's Chicago-based rap collective, “Only the Family"" or “OTF,” have also been arrested and at least two more arrests may be forthcoming, according to court documents that have been filed. Durk was arrested Thursday night in South Florida as he attempted to flee the country, the FBI says.
Durk, whose real name is Durk Banks, won a Grammy earlier this year for Best Melodic Rap Performance for his song “All My Life,” which featured J. Cole. He has also been nominated three times and was a featured performer on Drake's “Laugh Now Cry Later.”
Martin Estrada, the U.S. attorney for Los Angeles, called the shooting “a cold-blooded murder.""
“The shooting occurred in the open, at a gas station at a busy intersection, endangering many others in the area,"" Estrada said in a statement. “Violent gun crime of this sort is devastating to our community and we will have zero-tolerance for those who perpetrate such callous acts of violence.”
FBI Agent Sarah Corcoran said in her affidavit that OTF members engage “in violence, including murder and assault, at the direction of Banks and to maintain their status in OTF.”
Durk's representatives did not immediately respond to emails Friday seeking comment.
According to Corcoran's affidavit and other federal court records, the shooting stems from the November 2020 slaying of OTF rapper King Von, 26, at an Atlanta nightclub after Von and Rondo got into a fight. Records say a friend of Rondo's pulled a gun and shot Von several times, killing him. Von, whose real name was Dayvon Bennett, had two hit singles, ″Crazy Story″ and “Took Her to the O.”
Authorities say Durk made it known that he would “pay a bounty” to anyone who killed Rondo, whose real name is Tyquian Bowman.
Almost two years later, a murder plot quickly came together, Corcoran wrote.
On Aug. 18, 2022, Durk's associates learned that Rondo was staying at a Los Angeles hotel. That day, Deandre Wilson, Keith Jones, David Lindsey, Asa Houston and a fifth unnamed suspect flew from Chicago to San Diego and then drove to Los Angeles using funds provided by Durk, Corcoran said.
That day, Durk allegedly texted an associate arranging the flights, “Don’t book no flights under no names involved wit me.” Corcoran said there is video evidence that Durk was staying at a house in the San Fernando Valley that day.
Once arriving in Los Angeles, the OTF members met Kayon Grant, who had flown there on a private jet. Grant, a top OTF associate, got the men hotel rooms, purchased four ski masks and obtained two luxury sedans, court records say. Grant allegedly gave Jones, Lindsey and a third unnamed suspect guns, including one that had been converted into a machine gun.
The next day, the group allegedly followed Rondo and Robinson as they drove a Cadillac Escalade to a Los Angeles marijuana dispensary, a West Hollywood clothing store and then a gas station across the street from the Beverly Center.
There, Houston allegedly parked his car behind the station so Jones, Lindsey and the unnamed defendant could ambush Rondo. They got out and opened fire, killing Robinson, who was standing outside the Escalade, but missing Rondo, the indictment and news stories about the shooting say.
The suspects then went to an In-N-Out hamburger stand where they discussed payment with Grant and then flew home to Chicago from San Diego, Corcoran and other documents say. Wilson allegedly later paid Jones and Lindsey an undisclosed amount.
Grant, Jones, Lindsey, Wilson and Houston were arrested Thursday in Chicago on conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire charges. No attorney information was immediately available for those men in court records.
After their arrests, Corcoran wrote, Durk booked two flights from South Florida airports — one to Dubai and one to Switzerland. He then booked a private flight to Italy, but was arrested in Miami before he could board it.
Durk and the other defendants are being held pending their transfer to Los Angeles.
In 2019, Durk and King Von were charged in Atlanta with a drive-by shooting that left a man wounded in the leg. Prosecutors dropped the case against Durk in 2022, two years after Von's slaying. Durk had denied his involvement.
In 2014, Durk pleaded guilty to felony aggravated unlawful use of a weapon and felony possession of a firearm after he was seen carrying a gun on a Chicago street. He was spared jail time.
Two villages in Chicago’s western suburbs, Bellwood and Broadview, last week honored Durk and announced collaborations with his charity, Neighborhood Heroes Foundation, to provide youth mentors.
But on Friday, Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson announced she had severed ties to Neighborhood Heroes and had withdrawn the honorary key to the village given Durk.
While acknowledging that Durk and other suspects are presumed innocent, village residents have “even higher moral and ethical standards of behavior,” Thompson wrote on the village’s Facebook page.
A telephone message seeking comment from Andre Harvey, Bellwood’s mayor, was left at his office.",2024-10-26
NPR,Housing is expensive. Here’s how Harris and Trump promise to bring costs down,"Housing is expensive. Here’s how Harris and Trump promise to bring costs down
Vice President Kamala Harris and former president Donald Trump don’t agree on much, but they do on one thing: The cost of housing is too high.
Housing costs have become a major source of worry and financial stress for many Americans as prices have outpaced paychecks and the share of renters burdened by housing costs has grown. Home prices have risen about 50% in the last five years, and many households are struggling to find a home they can afford to buy.
Here’s how the Harris and Trump campaigns say they will address the country’s housing woes.
Kamala Harris’s housing plan
When Harris talks about housing, she makes it personal, remembering how her mother saved up to buy a home and recalling her mother’s pride when she bought it. Then she hits the highlights of how she plans to make housing more affordable.
“As president, I will fight to help first-time homebuyers with your down payment, take on the companies that are jacking up rents, and build millions of new homes,” Harris said in a speech this week at the Ellipse, near the White House.
For Harris, the plan is a mix of increasing supply, providing financial support to aspiring homebuyers and curtailing corporate landlords.
Building a lot more homes
Harris wants to build three million new housing units. America is millions of housing units short, and increasing supply would help bring down rents and mortgages. Many housing experts agree that this focus on supply is a good approach.
To amp up that construction, especially at the cheaper end, Harris wants to expand the existing tax credits that are used to build affordable rental housing. She also wants to create a new tax credit that would incentivize building more starter homes.
Harris also proposes a $40 billion fund to spur new methods in housing construction, including more affordable home designs and new ways to finance construction.
The vice president also vows to cut the red tape that slows housing construction and makes it more expensive to build.
But much of the regulation and bureaucracy that limits housing is at the state and local level. The federal government has a limited ability to shape those rules, though it can certainly incentivize what it wants to see happen.
Assistance for first-time buyers
Harris is calling for $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers. With prices so high, down payment assistance for first-time buyers “can really help people make that leap,” says Shamus Roller, executive director of the National Housing Law Project.
But many economists argue that this support would actually drive prices higher.
Giving a bunch of people an extra $25,000 will increase demand, says Michael Strain, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a center-right think tank. And there’s already a lot of demand. More buyers bidding on homes would lead to higher prices, Strain says.
And though first-time buyers are the target of the assistance, “a lot of that $25,000 is going to go to the sellers of homes, and not to the buyers of homes,” Strain says.
The 2024 GOP platform also calls for tax incentives and support for first-time buyers. It’s not clear what the eligibility requirements would be in either party's proposal.
Targeting corporate landlords
Harris is calling on Congress to pass two bills she says would lower rents. One would remove tax breaks from large investors that buy up single-family homes, and another would prohibit landlords from using algorithmic software to increase rents.
Donald Trump’s housing plan
Trump’s plans when it comes to housing are much less detailed than Harris’s, but the former president frequently brings up housing costs in his speeches.
Like Harris, Trump talks about building more homes. He has called for opening more federal lands for housing, an idea that Harris also supports. He also pledges to slash regulations and make it easier to build.
A focus on mortgage rates
Trump says he’ll bring down mortgage rates to make homebuying more affordable, even though the president doesn't set mortgage rates or interest rates (though his or her policies can affect them).
At a rally last month in Arizona, Trump lamented the prevailing mortgage rates. Rates were then a little over 6%, but Trump overstated them by several points.
“Today the mortgage rates are at 10%, 11%, 12%, you can't get the money. We're going to bring it down very fast, we're going to bring energy down. We will drive down the rates so you will be able to pay 2% again and we will be able to finance or refinance your homes drastically,” he said.
During the pandemic, mortgage rates did dip below 3% at the end of Trump's presidency. But it's been more than three decades since they were at 10%, and they're far below that level now.
Trump says he’ll bring mortgage rates down by slashing inflation. But inflation has cooled significantly, and many economists say that other aspects of Trump’s economic plans would make inflation worse.
A crackdown on immigration
Trump and his vice-presidential nominee JD Vance have blamed undocumented immigrants for driving up housing prices. At the vice presidential debate last month, Vance said competition from illegal immigrants is one of the most significant drivers of home prices in the U.S.
This is another exaggeration, though there is some effect.
Immigrants do increase housing prices, just like any population growth does, if supply doesn't keep up with demand, according to Albert Saiz, associate professor of urban economics and real estate at MIT.
But the effect is not nearly as large as the Trump campaign has made it sound.
“That effect is relatively small,” Saiz says, and it cannot account for much of the rise in rent prices. One analysis found rents have increased 19% since 2019, rising 1% this year.
The effect on housing prices would be larger in an area where there is a higher concentration of immigrants, Saiz adds.
Trump has also talked about conducting a mass deportation of illegal immigrants, which would have a number of effects on the housing market. There would be fewer people in the country, decreasing demand for housing. But it would also remove a significant number of construction workers, which would likely make building new homes more expensive.
“My baseline view is that the deportation scheme that President Trump is discussing would increase home prices, not decrease home prices,” says Strain, the AEI economist. “But I think we know very little about what he actually has in mind.”",2024-10-31
NPR,Harris releases her medical report — and uses it to raise questions about Trump,"Harris releases her medical report — and uses it to raise questions about Trump
Vice President Harris on Saturday released a medical report — a document that her campaign is using to draw a contrast with her older rival — and dared former President Donald Trump to do the same.
This is the first time Harris, 59, has released results of a physical. Similar to reports released by previous commanders-in-chief, the two-page letter says that Harris is in excellent health and has “the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the presidency.”
Harris told reporters traveling with her that every candidate for president had released medical information ""except Donald Trump in this election cycle.""
""It is clear to me that he and his team do not want the American people to really see what it is that he is doing and whether or not he actually is fit to do the job of being president of the United States,"" she said.
Trump released a three-paragraph letter about his health a year ago
This medical disclosure come as Harris and Trump seem locked in a tie, less than a month before Election Day — each looking for ways to shake up the race and win over the small number of undecided or persuadable voters in swing states.
Harris’ campaign has been raising questions about whether Trump, 78, is up to the job, drawing attention in particular to his rambling and disjointed speeches as a sign that he has slipped.
""He talks at his rallies about fictional characters. He constantly is in a state of grievance about himself,"" Harris said on Saturday, rhyming off a list of failings. ""He is quite unfit to do the job,"" she said.
Trump in Nov. 2023 released a three-paragraph letter from a doctor about his health. It said Trump’s “overall health is excellent” and that his “cognitive exams were exceptional.”
On Saturday, Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung said that the former president had voluntarily released information over the years that showed ""he is in perfect and excellent health to be commander in chief.""
Trump’s health has been a subject of speculation since he first released a short statement as a candidate in 2015 that said he would be “the healthiest individual ever elected” to the office — a letter that his then-doctor later said that Trump himself had dictated. The veracity of subsequent reports were also widely questioned.
When President Biden, 81, was still running for a second term, stumbles, mumbles and mistakes drew headlines and his age became his greatest political liability with voters, while Trump’s age and acuity came under less scrutiny.
After he was seemingly overwhelmed during his June debate with Trump, Biden was pressured by his party to bow out and pass the torch to a younger leader.
Here are some highlights from Harris' medical report
Dr. Joshua Simmons, a White House Medical Unit physician who has been Harris' doctor since Jan. 2021, wrote the three-page report. He said.
- Harris has seasonal allergies and has been on allergen immunotherapy to reduce her symptoms. She occasionally uses Atrovent but has never experienced severe symptoms, angioedema or anaphylaxis, her doctor said.
- She is nearsighted and wears contacts, but can read comfortably without contacts or glasses.
- Her most recent physical exam was in April 2024. She is up-to-date on preventive care like colonoscopy and annual mammograms. She takes a Vitamin D3 supplement.
- She is at low risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
- She works out daily and eats healthy; does not smoke and drinks only occasionally and in moderation.",2024-10-12
NPR,Appeals court sides with GOP on Miss. law that provides grace period for mail ballots,"Appeals court sides with GOP on Miss. law that provides grace period for mail ballots
A conservative U.S. appeals court has sided with Republicans in ruling against a Mississippi law that allows election officials to count mail ballots that are postmarked by Election Day but arrive after it.
The ruling by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals — which covers Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas — is not in effect immediately, and the judges sent the issue back to a lower court for further consideration. The decision is likely to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
In its ruling Friday, a panel of all Trump-appointed 5th Circuit judges reversed a lower court ruling and wrote that the acceptance of ballots ends on the “election day” designated by Congress.
“Text, precedent, and historical practice confirm this ‘day for the election’ is the day by which ballots must be both cast by voters and received by state officials,” the court wrote. “Because Mississippi’s statute allows ballot receipt up to five days after the federal election day, it is preempted by federal law.”
The judges declined to grant Republicans’ initial request for an injunction, sending the issue back to the lower court for “further proceedings to fashion appropriate relief, giving due consideration to 'the value of preserving the status quo in a voting case on the eve of an election.' ”
The GOP argument against ballot grace periods
The Republican National Committee, along with the Trump campaign, has filed multiple lawsuits in various states ahead of this year’s general election aiming to disqualify ballots that arrive after Election Day.
Roughly 20 states plus Washington, D.C., accept and count mail-in ballots that are received after Election Day. (Many states require that those ballots be postmarked on or before Election Day.) States provide these grace periods in case voters forget to return their mail ballots in a timely manner, if there are issues with the postal service, or if there are other unforeseen issues like bad weather and natural disasters.
The GOP has argued, however, that states don't have the right to decide when to stop accepting ballots.
Conor Woodfin, who represented the Republican Party during oral arguments at the 5th Circuit, told the court that “the meaning of Election Day is not up to the subjective views” of individual states.
“For decades after Congress established the uniform national Election Day, those words meant the day that ballots are received by election officials,” he said.
Republicans also argued in their lawsuit that mail voting disproportionately hurts them because “voting by mail is starkly polarized by party.”
“For example, according to the MIT Election Lab, 46% of Democratic voters in the 2022 General Election mailed in their ballots, compared to only 27% of Republicans,” they wrote in their challenge. “That means the late-arriving mail-in ballots that are counted for five additional days disproportionately break for Democrats.”
This legal challenge in Mississippi is part of a larger effort from the GOP, including in the swing state of Nevada, aimed at invalidating certain mail ballots.
Democrats say the GOP cases don’t reflect “modern reality”
Democrats have called these particularly legal challenges “fringe lawsuits” that are aimed at sowing distrust in elections.
Joyce Vance, a professor at the University of Alabama School of Law, said the lawsuits are part of an effort by the GOP to “make it more difficult for some kinds of Americans” to cast a ballot.
“The RNC is really trying to set up a possible rule for the future where only ballots that are cast and counted on Election Day count,” she told NPR. “And that might have been great in the 1800s when farmers were going to market on a Tuesday and casting their ballots while they were in town, but it doesn't reflect the modern reality where we have early voting days and have mail-in voting days precisely to accommodate the fact that not everybody can get away during normal business hours on a Tuesday to vote.”
Vance said removing grace periods for mail ballots disproportionately affects members of the military and their families — particularly those who live overseas — as well as people with disabilities or an illness.
“So, all sorts of folks who are fully entitled to vote [would] get disenfranchised by a rule that would cut off ballot counting on Election Day itself,” she said. “I think the principle advancing is this effort to really make it more difficult for some kinds of Americans to vote.”
Caren Short, the director of legal and research for the League of Women Voters of the United States, said in a statement that states should be making “voting more accessible to voters—not less.”
“When a state makes voting available via absentee ballot, it must not disqualify voters who follow the rules and cast their ballot by having it postmarked by election day,” she said. “Our democracy is stronger when all votes are counted, regardless of how you decide to vote.”
Vance said this case is likely to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, where it is “anyone’s guess” whether the court will hear the challenge — and whether the case would be settled before this year’s election ends.",2024-10-25
NPR,"Sikh separatist, targeted once for assassination, says India still trying to kill him","Sikh separatist, targeted once for assassination, says India still trying to kill him
It is a phone call Gurpatwant Singh Pannun remembers well. It was June 17, 2023. After playing phone tag for a day, he and his close aide in Canada finally managed to connect.
“He told me that he was informed by the Canadian intelligence officials that there is a serious threat to his life and he might be killed,” Pannun recalled.
On that call, his aide, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, said that assassins were coming for Pannun as well. The conversation is seared into Pannun’s memory because of what Nijjar told him — but also because it was the last time the two men spoke.
The following day, gunmen shot Nijjar dead in the parking lot of a Sikh temple outside Vancouver, Canada. Canadian authorities have arrested four Indian nationals in connection with the murder.
Nijjar’s warning for Pannun, a dual U.S.-Canadian citizen, also proved prescient. Five months later, the U.S. Justice Department announced it had foiled a plot to assassinate Pannun in New York City. An Indian national was charged in the alleged murder-for-hire scheme, and has pleaded not guilty.
Nijjar's killing and the purported plan to assassinate Pannun are part of a broader trend around the world in which foreign governments seek to silence critics overseas, including in the United States.
Last week, prosecutors announced charges against a new defendant in Pannun's case: a former Indian intelligence officer, Vikash Yadav, who allegedly orchestrated the plot.
In the last few years, the Justice Department says it has foiled at least four assassination plots tied to a foreign power. Three of those allegedly link back to Iran, including one targeting Iranian-American activist and journalist Masih Alinejad. The fourth — allegedly targeting Pannun — involves India.
The Indian government denies any involvement in Nijjar’s killing or the purported plot against Pannun.
After the U.S. announced charges in the Pannun case, India set up its own internal inquiry to investigate. Just over a week ago, Indian officials were in Washington for meetings to discuss the case and for both sides to provide an update on their respective investigations.
The State Department called the meetings “productive.” The Indian Embassy did not respond to a request for comment.
""Well-documented"" threats from India
Pannun, who was born in India but moved to the U.S. in 1992, told NPR earlier this year that the threat to his life came as no surprise.
“I have been threatened directly by the Indian parliamentarians while sitting in the Indian parliament,” he said. “They have stated that we are going to kill Pannun, even if we have to do a surgical strike. These are well-documented, the statements of the government officials.”
In particular, he points to remarks Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made several times in recent years, including early this July in India’s parliament.
“Today, post 2014, India enters your home and kills you,” Modi said before lawmakers. “Carries out surgical strikes. Carries out air strikes.”
In Pannun’s view, Modi’s threat about how India deals with its perceived enemies is directed at people like him.
Pannun is a Sikh separatist. He is a leading figure in the Khalistan movement, which wants to create an independent Sikh homeland carved out from northern India. He and his organization, Sikhs for Justice, have been spearheading a global referendum for independence.
Khalistan referendum campaign
Pannun is a practicing attorney. At his law office in Queens, boxes of case files and legal books lined the walls. His legal work pays the bills, but much of his time he dedicates to the Khalistan cause.
In his office, he has a green screen set up and camera for the videos he produces and posts online for the campaign.
Behind his desk hung a yellow and blue Khalistan flag. On the wall was a framed picture of the Golden Temple in Amritsar, India, the holiest site in Sikhism.
Pannun and Nijjar first worked together to document the events surrounding the Indian military’s attack on the temple in 1984, known as Operation Blue Star, and the government’s bloody, nearly decade-long effort to stamp out an armed Sikh insurgency fighting for independence. Thousands were killed.
The two men then shifted their focus to the future and started the Khalistan referendum campaign. The idea is to have Sikhs around the world vote on the question of creating an independent Sikh state. It is an unofficial referendum, and not legally binding.
Pannun has dedicated his life to the campaign. He told his family years ago that his advocacy work would put him at odds with India’s government.
“I have told them very clearly what it would entail and where it can lead,” he said. “That’s why when we are talking about assassination attempts and killings and threats, that doesn’t come as a surprise to us. That doesn’t come as a surprise to the family.”
""Survive to the finish line""
The Modi government in 2020 designated Pannun and Nijjar terrorists for their separatist work.
Pannun rejects the allegation. He said he follows the law, and that his campaign is a peaceful, democratic process.
India’s response, he said, has been to come after him, and that has forced him to look over his shoulder.
“That’s how I’m going to survive to the finish line,” he said.
The alleged assassination plot was not a one-off. He said there are active threats against his life right now. That danger has not forced him to end his separatist work, but it has forced him to take precautions.
At his office, a security team screens visitors with a metal detector. Body guards ferry him to and from work. He had security before the alleged plot, he said, but he’s beefed it up since the case was charged last year.
“Today, what you see is very, very obvious,"" he said of his security detail. “This is a message that I’m giving that I’m not out there to do it in suicide mode. I’m going to continue to campaign and I’m going to continue to protect myself.”
Still, the threat on his life has altered, to a degree, how he operates. The interview with NPR was in his office, in part, because it is secure.
“I cannot just abruptly take a car and jump in the car and go anywhere,” he said. “That’s what I have been advised by my security details. That’s where you get killed.”
He’s changed his residence several times since the alleged plot was foiled. He doesn’t go to restaurants much. He said he hasn’t been to the grocery store in years; he gets things delivered instead. And he's curtailed his on-the-ground campaign appearances.
Boycotting Indian-owned businesses
He remains very active online, though, and regularly posts videos on Instagram. Some of them show pro-Khalistan rallies, while others offer heated challenges against India or Indian officials.
In one from last November, Pannun declares: “Sikhs are facing existential threat under the successive India regimes.”
“We are going to target India,” he adds. “From Air India to made in India, we are going to ground everything.”
Some Indian media outlets interpreted that as a threat in light of the 1985 bombing of an Air India passenger jet flying from Canada to India that killed more than 300 people. A Canadian Sikh was found guilty in 2003 for involvement in the bombing. A Canadian court acquitted two others.
Pannun pushed back, calling that interpretation of his video an “Indian narrative,” and saying he was calling for a Sikh boycott of Indian-owned businesses.
“The objective behind it is that I want the (Sikh) community to stop funding their own genocide,” he said. “I want the community not to spend a dime on Indian-owned businesses.”
Breaking up the Indian state
He’s also come under criticism over posters with the words “Kill India” and the names and photos of Indian officials that the placards claim were involved in Nijjar’s killing. One of the officials pictured was Sanjay Kumar Verma, India’s high commissioner, who was among the six Indian diplomats recently expelled from Canada.
Pannun said his goal is to break up the Indian state.
“I say to kill Modi politics. We are in America. We say ‘kill Biden politics,’ we say ‘kill Trump politics,’” Pannun said. “’Kill India’ means balkanize India. India is not a human being. India is in a union of states. We want to balkanize India.”
Some of his posts on social media are about his late colleague and friend, Nijjar. His assassination, Pannun said, has left a hole.
“You feel the vacuum, but then you also get the strength and the courage: what Nijjar stood for, for what he gave his life, for what he has spent the last 15, 16 years with us,” he said.
But Pannun also said there’s no time to sit back and grieve. There is work to be done, a campaign to run, despite the risks.
“I would rather take a bullet in my head than stop the Khalistan referendum campaign,” he said.",2024-10-27
NPR,The Jan. 6 riot included Marines. The military is wrestling with the consequences,"The Jan. 6 riot included Marines. The military is wrestling with the consequences
For more reporting about Josh Abate and extremism in the military, listen to the new series 'A Good Guy' from NPR's Embedded podcast.
“Have you ever tried to overthrow the U.S. government?”
If you’re trying to get top secret security clearance for a government job, that’s a standard question for the required polygraph exam. And the answer, obviously, should be no.
But Josh Abate couldn’t say no if he wanted to pass the test.
“It depends,” he said, when he took the exam in early 2022 for an internship.
The polygrapher paused and asked him to elaborate.
“Well, on January 6th, I went into the Capitol building.”
That was the first time Abate, a 24-year-old sergeant in the Marines, had talked openly about what he did that day.
At that point, he was doing well in the Marines. He made sergeant early, got a Navy commendation medal and was selected for this coveted internship with the National Security Agency.
“If you get the internship, you can basically ride that out until retirement if you wanted to,” he said. “It exponentially grows your career.”
Abate has always wanted to be a Marine. “There's nothing else I wanted to do. There was no plan B,” he said. “It was Marine Corps.”
Abate is tall and muscular, with short brown hair and a bit of a baby face. One of his forearms is covered in a large and colorful tattoo depicting the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. It’s from Revelations 6, he says.
He grew up in rural Virginia, about 30 miles west of Washington, D.C., and met his wife, Ashley, when they were both in high school taking part in Junior ROTC. Abate is the son of a former Marine who became a cop. He tells us his dad is a Republican and his mom, a nurse, is a Democrat. Abate recalls that they would often argue about politics.
But for Josh and Ashley, there was one politician for them: Donald Trump.
Ashley is blond and petite, and the day NPR interviewed her, she held their infant daughter as she spoke to us.
She called Trump a moral man and said they share the same values.
“You know, I come from a household where religion, manners, work ethic, that kind of thing, is very important,” she said.
And Josh? He said he likes the fact that Trump is supportive of a strong military.
Josh said he gets most of his news from Fox and conservative websites. When asked, he said he hasn’t seen headlines like when Trump called fallen soldiers “losers” and questioned John Kelly, his former chief of staff, saying, “I don't get it. What was in it for them?"" at a 2017 Memorial Day event in Arlington National Cemetery, where Kelly’s Marine son, Robert Kelly, is buried. He was killed in Afghanistan in 2010.
A text invite
In the months before Jan. 6, 2021, Abate was at Marine Base Quantico, about an hour south of Washington. Fox News was playing on several base TVs most of the time. The pandemic was raging. Tens of thousands of Americans had died from COVID-19 at that point and most public spaces like bars and restaurants had been shut down. Abate and his fellow Marines were stuck in the barracks, day after day, staring at screens. The Marines even canceled a training trip to Norway.
Abate found that annoying.
“We were just cooped up in our rooms,” he recalled. “You didn’t join the Marine Corps to stay in your bedroom and work for a couple of hours a day and play video games.”
After the elections that November, the main message being spread by Fox anchors, reporters and guests was the same: Joe Biden had “stolen” a victory from President Donald Trump. Abate was buying into it.
So were two of his friends, Sgt. Dodge Hellonen and Cpl. Micah Coomer. They were planning to drive out to Washington, D.C., for the now infamous “Stop the Steal” rally. And they texted Abate, asking him if he wanted to come along. He said he accepted because he wanted to listen to Trump’s speech.
“I actually wanted to see him speak in person, like, the last time as sitting president,” Abate said.
The two Marines picked up Abate at his home and drove north to Washington. But he said the traffic getting into D.C. slowed them down, so they missed the speech on the Ellipse, near the White House, which ended with Trump telling the crowd that they had to fight for their country. “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol,” Trump said.
Abate said they all noticed a crowd heading that way and joined in, crossing the wide lawn toward the iconic building.
Something ugly
They entered through the Senate wing doors about seven minutes after the crowd broke through. This was the first entrance to be breached that day, so Abate and his friends were among the first people to actually go into the Capitol.
“We walked right in,” he said. “We didn't see any signs that, you know, said ‘do not enter’ or ‘no trespassing.’ And as soon as we walked through the door of the Capitol building, there were two police officers standing right across from the door. I figured if we weren't supposed to be there, they would have told us to get out. Nobody was trying to be, like, rambunctious.”
He told us he was inside the Capitol for about an hour and saw or heard no yelling, breaking glass, or violence.
But we were outside the Capitol at the exact same time and we experienced something very different — something ugly — and reported on that extensively. While getting crushed by a crowd of angry Trump supporters, we met rioters who spoke proudly into NPR microphones about plans to hang politicians from gallows before storming up the marble steps and surging through doors and windows. The overwhelming evidence is of one of the most violent and shocking days in American history.
Meanwhile, Abate said he calmly and quietly strolled the halls for about an hour, helped put a MAGA hat on a statue, and then finally left with his friends when police ordered everyone out.
Then he said they drove south, back toward Quantico, before joining Ashley at a restaurant called Fatty’s.
“Holy crap”
While they were eating, every TV screen in the restaurant showed images of a raging mob at the Capitol, surging into the building and punching cops, smashing some with flagpoles and their own shields.
“We were all just looking at it like, holy crap,” Ashley said.
She said she turned to her husband, wide-eyed. “Did you see any of the stuff they’re talking about?” she said she asked him that night.
He said no. But all three Marines looked at each other. “Like, we should probably not talk about this,” Abate remembered. He told us he took out his phone and started deleting all pictures and videos from the day.
“I knew that if word broke that Marines were in the Capitol it would reflect badly on the Marine Corps,” Abate told us. “And I knew that even though I didn’t do anything bad — I didn’t cause any violence, I didn’t perpetrate any sedition or treason and things like that — I knew that I would just be grouped into everything.”
The three never talked about Jan. 6 with each other again. And before long, Coomer was transferred to another assignment at Camp Pendleton, Calif. Hellonen was off to Camp Lejeune, N.C.
Over a year later, Abate passed that polygraph test — the one where he admitted being in the Capitol on Jan. 6. He was sent to a special signals intelligence school in Florida. Josh and his wife returned to the Washington, D.C., area at the end of 2023, ready to start that prized internship and set up a home with Ashley, who had just found out she was pregnant.
“Just be truthful”
Just two weeks before Abate was about to start his NSA job at Fort Meade in Maryland, he got a text. His sergeant wanted to meet for a cup of coffee. “Change into civilian clothes,” he told Abate, who figured the meeting was about his internship. But after passing the building where Abate was supposed to work, they pulled into the parking lot of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service.
“So NCIS just wants to ask you a few questions,” the sergeant told him. “Nothing to worry about. Just be truthful.”
Abate said he got a sinking feeling.
A half dozen agents came from both sides of the building and surrounded him, telling him he was under arrest for Jan. 6. They clasped on handcuffs and escorted him to an interrogation room.
“I was like, s***, this is happening,” Abate said.
They showed him pictures of himself inside the Capitol, along with Hellonen and Coomer. Then they put Abate in the back seat of a government car and drove him south to Washington, where he was booked. He spent the night in jail, sleeping on a metal bench with a bright light shining from the ceiling.
What he didn’t know yet was that not all of his Marine friends were able to keep that vow of silence about being inside the Capitol.
According to the FBI, just three weeks after Jan. 6, Coomer sent a private message to a friend. An FBI search warrant found that he was talking about the extremist movements present in the Capitol that day, including guys in Hawaiian shirts who often call themselves the Boogaloo Bois. Coomer said to his friend, “I’m waiting for a Boogaloo.”
His friend wrote back asking, “What’s that?”
Coomer simply replied: “Civil War 2.”
Both Coomer and Hellonen declined our requests for comment.
The charm offensive
All three Marines were charged with the same crimes in early 2023. Federal prosecutors had them on four charges, including entering a restricted building and disorderly conduct.
Over the next few months, Abate was placed on administrative duty at work. And as he and Ashley waited at home for the legal case to run its course, the grim reality set in. “You think all the typical things,” she said. “Like, what are we going to do when he loses his job?”
Abate and his lawyer, Dave Dischley, a family friend in Warrenton, Va., were eventually able to work out a deal with prosecutors. They were willing to drop most charges in exchange for a guilty plea on just one misdemeanor. And the recommendation was a reduced sentence of 21 days in jail.
Abate appeared before U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes, a Biden appointee. She was assigned to Hellonen and Coomer, as well. She declined a request for an interview.
But what we know about Judge Reyes is that, going into the sentencing, she was openly stunned that a Marine would participate in the insurrection. “It’s scary to think that our active duty military were part of the insurrection,” Reyes told Abate, according to a transcript of the hearing. Reyes said she was inclined to give Abate six months behind bars.
Abate told the court in a written statement that he was wrong about the election being stolen, about what Trump was telling the country. “Each of the lies circulated by President Trump were incredibly harmful to our democracy and our unity as a nation.”
And then came the letters. More than 50 of them from family members, friends and fellow Marines. Judge Reyes said she read them all beforehand. Twice.
One was from a Gold Star mom whose son was killed in 2011. “I have met many Marines that are truly good Marines and good people,” she wrote. “Josh is one of those Marines.”
The mother of a childhood friend wrote: “Even though I’m a strong liberal, I would never consider Josh to be a threat. I truly believe he is just fundamentally good.”
Not everyone was willing to write a letter. Abate said a fellow Marine told him basically, ""Josh, I like you, but not what you did.""
But there were more than enough to sway Reyes. She went as far as telling Abate that his case had made her a “better judge.” And she gave him a sentence: 279 hours of community service — one hour she said, for each Marine casualty in the American Civil War.
“She mentioned something about how she’s kind of envious of the story that I can tell my daughter and help her learn from my mistakes,” Abate told us. So this federal judge had gone from being openly disgusted with Abate for joining the violent mob at the Capitol, to essentially helping to craft a redemption story for him.
“Maybe this won’t be so bad after all,” Abate remembers thinking.
An unlikely assist
Earlier this year, NPR spent several hours talking with Abate and wanted to learn more about his activities that day. His description of the insurrection — that he meandered in and never really noticed that what he was doing was wrong — just didn’t make sense based on what we saw that day.
We went through a few other direct questions about Abate’s actions that day.
Did you chant?
“No.”
Of the statue he put the MAGA hat on: A statue of what? A specific person?
“I don’t remember,” he said. “It was just a random statue in the Rotunda.”
He really didn’t see anything disturbing or aggressive?
“I think if I had seen any violence, I would have left sooner,” he said.
On Feb. 21, he called us back for a second interview. When we arrived, he was holding a printout from the FBI’s official statement of facts and started reading from it.
“ ‘Abate appears in the crowd and then he walks,’ ” he said. “And it talks about how he walks and walks and walks and walks and walks. And nothing in our summary of our actions is actually, you know, spooky or violent or scary. I thought it was humorous that they, in their summary of me, my time in the Capitol building, that’s all they could really sum it up to was walking.”
But down at the bottom of the printout it said “Page 1 of 45.” So clearly there was a lot more to the story.
Including video.
A few weeks after we talked with Abate, the House Republicans started dropping some 5,000 hours of security camera footage from Jan. 6 on a public video platform, including time stamps. The security footage does not contain any audio.
What we saw was that seven minutes after the doors to the Capitol were breached, Abate walked in with Hellonen and Coomer. They slowly made their way toward the front of a crowd just 20 steps from the House chamber itself. At one point, Abate cupped his hands around his mouth, and the video shows he clearly is chanting “stop the steal” over and over. At one point, Abate is holding a yellow flag with the words “Don’t Tread on Me.” He appears to gesture to his friends to follow him to the front of the crowd toward the chamber doors. Soon, tear gas starts to fill the hallway. They make their way out of the space and back into the Capitol Rotunda.
Way in the back of the Rotunda video, you can make out Abate taking a hat out of someone’s hands and trying to place it on top of a statue. He finally gets it on there by climbing onto the pedestal.
It’s a bust of Martin Luther King Jr.
From there, Abate and his friends became part of a large, rowdy crowd. The front of the crowd is facing off against a line of Capitol Police who are attempting to push everyone out. Abate stands firm amid the crush and scuffles happening around him, not turning around and leaving. Finally, after several minutes and jostling in the crowd around them, the three of them make their way out of the Rotunda and out of frame.
The story that Abate told us — about an almost casual stroll through the Capitol — just didn’t hold up.
We called his lawyer to tell him what we’d just watched and to ask to sit down with him again. Abate declined.
The Marines and Jan. 6
Despite avoiding jail time, Abate’s career with the Marines was still on the line. In December 2023, he had a retention hearing, where a panel of his colleagues would decide whether he stayed or would be kicked out. It was held in a nondescript government building at Quantico. The hearing lasted 4½ hours.
Retention hearings are administrative but structured like a courtroom. There was a Marine officer who argued in Abate’s defense, saying he was remorseful and accepted responsibility for what he did. His defense lawyer, Dave Dischley, was also there.
Ashley and their baby showed up to support him. Dischley made sure to introduce them to the room.
Another officer served as a kind of prosecutor. One of the points he argued is that Abate by his actions violated an agreement he signed when he joined — one that explicitly forbids participation in extremist activities. The officer said Abate should be kicked out with an other-than-honorable discharge, a red flag to all future employers.
Several Marines acted as witnesses, all telling the panel that Abate is a fine Marine.
“I would say that his initiative is top-notch, sir,” one said.
“By far the most outstanding professional Marine I’ve ever encountered,” said another. “Gentlemen, I wouldn’t be here if someone didn’t give me a second chance. If he can pull off what I know he’s capable of, as a man, as a Marine, as a father, he will show that growth can occur, and that he can overcome even something as trivial as this.”
And then something truly startling happens. The panel includes two officers and a senior sergeant. They all are asked by Abate’s defense attorney about their views on the attack on the Capitol. Are they positive, negative or indifferent?
“Depending on what news source you look at, you get a different narrative, different perception,"" Lt. Col. Sean Foley said. ""It’s a tale of two cities, and at this point, I mean, to be honest I’m tired of hearing about it three years later.”
Then Master Gunnery Sgt. Steven Glew, who said, “So I wasn’t there. I can’t say I know exactly what happened there. So I’m indifferent to what happened that day.”
And finally, Capt. Spencer Morris: “The video footage I’ve seen of the day, specifically focused on the more violent parts of Jan. 6, it definitely gives me a negative perception of how things transpired.”
In the end, the panel unanimously decided to keep Abate in the Marine Corps. Separate panels for Hellonen and Coomer did the same. But Coomer was kicked out shortly after his hearing by a general at Camp Pendleton; Hellonen ran out his enlistment — his contract with the Marines was up — and he left the Corps.
Glew, who had said he was indifferent to what happened that day, was the only one of the panelists who agreed to talk with us about why he voted to retain Abate.
“I have just seen a lot of him in me,” Glew said. “And then, you know, just seeing his family there, his baby, just made me think, you know about my family and what they would have been going through if I was in Josh’s position.”
Extremism in the ranks?
Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro will be the one who makes the final decision about Abate’s fate in the Marines. Ten months later, he has yet to make the call.
Digging into Abate’s story and the aftermath of Jan. 6, we learned that Abate was by far not the only Marine — active or retired — who went into the Capitol that day. Some one-third of the 200 active and retired military participants arrested for their role in the Capitol attack were Marines. That’s a disproportionate number, considering the Marines are the smallest of the fighting forces.
“It is shocking when somebody that’s taken an oath to protect the country is doing something to harm it,” said Michael Jensen, who researches domestic terrorism at the University of Maryland. He said the Marines have one of the highest rates of extremist activity going back more than three decades.
“The Army is the largest branch, so you’d expect for it to have the highest numbers,” he said. “But the second highest number comes from the Marine Corps. They are having an outsized impact driving these numbers of cases, yet they are doing the fewest investigations.”
The Jan. 6 attack forced the Pentagon to come up with a definition of prohibited extremist activity. That definition came out at the end of 2021, and it basically says service members can’t get involved in any activities that call for political violence, passing out literature or raising money for extremist groups, liking something on social media, even wearing clothing or having bumper stickers that promote extremist causes.
Each of the services this year put out guidelines and said they would start collecting data on any extremist activities in the ranks. Right now, the military has yet to start collecting data that was called for in the recently released guidelines, but Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and other officials say they think the numbers are small. Still, some say that even a small number of extremists can have an outsized effect on the military force.
We have spent the last six months trying to get officials to talk about the new guidelines, and most have refused. But just a few weeks ago, we were able to ask the Marines' top officer, Gen. Eric Smith, this question: Do the Marines have an extremism problem?
He said a minuscule percentage of Marines engage in inappropriate behavior.
“What I don’t want to do is hit a fly with a sledgehammer,” he said, “and accuse all Marines of doing something untoward because that’s just not the case.”
But what about the lopsided number of Marines who took part in the Capitol attack?
“No, I don’t worry about that. I think what you see is an anomaly. Those individuals who participated in the Jan. 6 events, those weren’t Marines. They were individuals masquerading as Marines. Our culture didn’t bind to them.”
We’d heard the word “anomaly” before. In Abate’s retention hearing from his defense lawyer Dave Dischley.
“The odds that another event like January 6th is going to occur in this country, you know, in the next hundred years in this country, I think is very slim,” Dischley said. “I think we can all agree to that. The odds that Sergeant Abate would be a part of that? Less than a fraction of a percent.”
But an Associated Press investigation found that nearly 100 people were killed or injured since 2017 in plots that included U.S. military or veterans, most of them in service of a far-right agenda.
In mid-October — just weeks before the 2024 election — Trump was asked about the Capitol attack at a Univision town hall. His answer was defensive and laced with inaccuracies. He also called it “a day of love.”
As for Abate, he wasn’t ruling out another vote for Trump in 2024.
“I still like Trump,” he said. “There's no bad taste in my mouth about Trump.” But, he said, he was still deciding.
We called Josh Abate back one more time as we wrapped up reporting, to ask again if he still liked Trump. But through his lawyer, he declined to speak with us again. He was done telling his story.
Correction Oct. 26, 2024
A previous version of this story incorrectly said U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes sentenced Joshua Abate to 279 hours of community service for each American killed in the American Civil War. It should have read that Abate was sentenced to 279 hours of community service for each Marine casualty in that war. Also a previous version of this story incorrectly said 200 participants were arrested for their role in the Capitol attack. It should have said 200 active and retired military participants were arrested.",2024-10-25
NPR,Man who attacked Nancy Pelosi's husband gets life in prison,"Man who attacked Nancy Pelosi's husband gets life in prison
SAN FRANCISCO — The man who was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison for attacking the husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi with a hammer in their California home was sentenced Tuesday to life in prison without the possibility of parole following a separate state trial.
A San Francisco jury in June found David DePape guilty of charges including aggravated kidnapping, first-degree burglary and false imprisonment of an elder.
Before issuing the sentence, Judge Harry Dorfman dismissed arguments from DePape's attorneys that he be granted a new trial for the 2022 attack against Paul Pelosi, who was 82 years old at the time.
“It’s my intention that Mr. DePape will never get out of prison, he can never be paroled,"" Dorfman said while handing out the punishment.
One of the defense attorneys, Adam Lipson, asked Dorfman before the sentence was handed down to consider DePape’s mental health and isolation that made him susceptible to online propaganda.
“This is a man who has always been a peaceful, law-abiding person up until his activation,” Lipson said.
When given the chance to address the court prior to his sentencing, DePape, dressed in prison orange and with his brown hair in a ponytail, spoke at length about Sept. 11 being an inside job, his ex-wife being replaced by a body double, and his government-provided attorneys conspiring against him.
“I’m a psychic,” DePape told the court, reading from sheets of paper. “The more I meditate, the more psychic I get.”
In a letter read in court by the victim's daughter, Christine Pelosi, Paul Pelosi called for the maximum sentence, saying the “last peaceful sleep” he had ended abruptly “when the defendant violently broke into my home, burst into my bedroom and stood over my bed with a hammer and zip ties demanding to see my wife, yelling ‘Where’s Nancy?’”
He said the attack left him with bumps on his head, a metal plate in it, dizziness and nerve damage in his left hand. Sleeping alone at home evokes memories of the attack, he said.
Previously, a federal jury convicted DePape of assaulting a federal official’s family member and attempting to kidnap a federal official. In May, he was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison during an unusual resentencing hearing that resulted from judicial error. The punishment in the state trial will run concurrently with the federal sentence.
DePape’s attorneys have said the state trial amounted to double jeopardy following his federal conviction. Even though the criminal counts were not exactly the same, the two cases stem from the same act, they argued. The judge did dismiss some of the state charges but kept others that were not covered by the federal case.
The Oct. 28, 2022, attack on Paul Pelosi was captured on police body camera video just days before the midterm elections and shocked the political world. He suffered head wounds, including a skull fracture that was mended with plates and screws. His right arm and hand were also injured.
DePape, a Canadian citizen who has been living in the U.S. for years, admitted during his federal trial that he planned to hold Nancy Pelosi hostage, record his interrogation of her, and “break her kneecaps” if she did not admit to the lies he said she told about “Russiagate,” a reference to the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign.",2024-10-29
NPR,"After a chaotic vote count in 2020, here's what Detroit will do differently this year","After a chaotic vote count in 2020, here's what Detroit will do differently this year
DETROIT — In 2020, what was then called the TCF Center became a tinderbox as Detroit poll workers counted the presidential election results.
A crowd of Republican observers at the center grew increasingly angry as false rumors of voting fraud spread across social media.
Now, four years later, Detroit election officials say they’re determined to avoid a repeat of the chaos that engulfed poll workers.
Fraud claims lit a chaotic fuse
The scene became a centerpiece of Donald Trump’s false narrative that the 2020 election was rigged against him.
“In Detroit there were hours of unexplained delay in delivering many of the votes for counting,” he said then. “The final batch did not arrive until 4 in the morning. And nobody knew where they came from.”
But officials in charge of tabulating those election results counter that no one asked at the time why those ballots arrived so late.
Detroit Elections Department Chief Operating Officer Daniel Baxter says he could have supplied the answer. He supervised poll workers who had to wade through more than 170,000 absentee ballots — about two-thirds of all the votes cast in the city.
“You gotta remember we were in the middle of the pandemic. Nobody wanted to go to the polls on Election Day, so they opted to vote by absentee,” Baxter said. “And some of them were a little slower than others in terms of getting them delivered. And that is exactly what you experienced at 3 o’clock, 4 o’clock in the morning.”
But as the vote-counting wore on, the situation deteriorated. Hundreds of people converged on the convention center. It escalated when the hall reached full capacity and certain challengers were ordered to leave.
“I heard banging on the windows,” Baxter recalled. “I heard chanting, ‘Stop the count! Stop the count!’ It was a hairy moment.”
Baxter said it was hard for those counting votes to keep from being distracted. And then things got worse.
“Someone made the bad call of putting cardboard up on the windows. When I discovered that I made sure it was removed,” he said. “I got on the microphone and explained to our staff, all of our poll workers, that we were not going to stop counting until the last ballot was delivered here.”
What's changed for the 2024 election
After the near riot, those who game-planned for the next presidential contest hardened their resolve to protect poll workers, says City Clerk Janice Winfrey, who oversees all of Detroit’s elections.
“We got through 2020 when all of that happened, the threats and the hurling insults at election workers. And it wasn’t expected. So now we know that may happen and we are ready if it should happen,” Winfrey said.
That includes new security procedures designed to block any Election Day upheavals at what is now called Huntington Place.
Officials moved the central polling location to the enclosed, cavernous Hall A, on the opposite end of the center from where votes were tallied in 2020.
Baxter says there won’t be any banging on windows at Hall A.
“There’s no windows. And if you do not have credentials you cannot be inside in any area. Those folk who decide to be present for protests or whatever, the Detroit Police Department has designated an area where they can be.”
Baxter says the new location is also a smaller and more secure space than its 2020 counterpart.
He says it’s usable because Michigan now allows Detroit to tabulate absentee ballots more than a week ahead of Election Day.
That means fewer workers are needed for each shift because the vote-counting is spread across numerous days.
“We only have 50 tables for processing. In 2020 we had 134 tables. That made for more people, more challengers, more poll workers,” Baxter said. “Now at the table you have 300 ballots that you have to process, versus 3,000 ballots in 2020.”
There are also magnetometers guarding the doorways. Media, poll workers and challengers must swipe a driver’s card, state ID or some other form of identification to get credentials.
And Baxter says officials will keep track of how many people get in.
“A digitized check-in system will contain a maximum number for each group and organization,” he said. “Once we max out on that number no one will be allowed entry, whether it’s the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, the NAACP, the League of Women Voters or whoever they are.”
The need to harden infrastructure as well as resolve became glaringly apparent in 2022.
Winfrey, the city clerk, notes there was an incident at a building roughly 4 miles away from Huntington Place, where a GOP challenger confronted a deputy clerk in an alley behind the Elections Department.
“All of our windows on the first floor of our building has been replaced with bulletproof glass,” Winfrey said. “We have uniformed and plain-clothed officers. And the alleyway is now blocked off.”
Winfrey and Baxter estimate with early voting this year, workers will tabulate about 90% of Detroit’s ballots by early evening on Election Day.
That means poll workers should be able to leave the convention center much earlier than in 2020, shielding them, officials hope, from any disruptions by angry poll challengers.",2024-10-31
NPR,"Susan B. Anthony broke the law by voting in 1872. In 2024, women honor her courage","Susan B. Anthony broke the law by voting in 1872. In 2024, women honor her courage
When Americans take to the polls on Tuesday, they will be following in the footsteps of famed suffragette Susan B. Anthony, who on Nov. 5, 1872, cast an illegal ballot to make her voice heard as a full citizen of the United States.
Anthony was born into a Quaker family in Adams, Mass., in 1820, a full century before American women were officially granted the right to vote.
As a young woman, she dedicated herself to social justice — campaigning as a teenager against the practice of slavery, and later as an adult, joined forces with Elizabeth Cady Stanton to further the cause of women’s rights.
For 45 years, Anthony traveled across the country, delivering thousands of speeches in support of women’s suffrage, facing ridicule and cruelty from those who took offense to her demand for civil rights.
When the 15th Amendment was passed to eliminate voting discrimination on the basis of race but not gender, Anthony — now controversially — took offense to the sentiment that Black men would be allowed to vote before white women.
“I will cut off this right arm of mine before I will ever work or demand the ballot for the Negro and not the woman,” Anthony once famously said.
Despite relentless campaigning for women’s rights to vote, Congress continued to ignore their demands.
So in the 1872 election race between the incumbent candidate Ulysses S. Grant versus Horace Greeley, a defiant Anthony and 14 other women went to their local polling station in Rochester, N.Y., and demanded ballots on the basis that they were taxpaying citizens with as much agency as any man.
“She wanted to know if under [the 14th Amendment] she was a citizen and had a right to vote,” an election official reported Anthony as saying. “At this time, Mr. Warner [the Supervisor of Elections] said, ‘young man, how are you going to get around that? I think you will have to register their names’—or something to that effect.”
Two weeks later, Anthony was arrested at her home, where she reportedly told the marshal to handcuff her “as they would arrest a man.”
Though she died in 1906 before her dream of full women’s suffrage had been realized, she is remembered as a champion of women’s rights.
In 2016, when Hillary Clinton ran for president as the first female nominee of the Democratic Party, women flocked by the thousands to Anthony’s burial site in Rochester and covered her headstone in their ""I Voted"" stickers.
Now, as Vice President Harris hopes to make history as the first woman elected to the White House, already women are patching Anthony’s headstone with voting stickers to honor her memory.",2024-11-01
NPR,Meet the Democrats using porn ads to convince Trump voters to stay home,"Meet the Democrats using porn ads to convince Trump voters to stay home
Earlier this year, Wally Nowinski and his buddy Matt Curry were texting back and forth about what they — two regular voters with no ties to any political campaign — could do to defeat Donald Trump in the presidential election.
""I'm in California, I could drive to Nevada and knock on doors or something, but I'm not going to reach 5 million people that way,"" Nowinski told NPR. Curry lives in New York.
The two friends work in tech with experience in digital advertising and startups, and Nowinski was particularly interested in what he calls ""sub-prime"" ad markets, aka porn sites.
Political candidates and their allied PACs don't advertise in these spaces because they don't want to associate their brands with explicit content, making the online pornographic market perhaps the last untouched frontier in political advertising.
According to AdImpact, more than $10 billion will be spent in political ads in 2024 in all races across television, streaming, radio and digital platforms.
While advertising in the Philadelphia suburbs, for instance, is quite expensive, ads on porn sites are inexpensive and have almost no competition. ""These ads are like real cheap and it's like weirdly relevant to this campaign,"" Nowinski said.
The relevance they saw was a market they believe can reach one of the key voter demographics in 2024.
""There’s 3 million non-college white men across the 'blue wall' states, that's a lot of people, and they're probably breaking for Trump like 65-70%,"" he said. ""You only need to make a very few of them change their mind to possibly make an impact on the election.""
So Nowinski and Curry did what virtually no regular voters do: They formed a political action committee and raised a modest $100,000. About $25,000 has already been spent in just the last few weeks of October, when inconsistent voters often decide whether to get off the couch or not. Nowinski says their ads have already notched 5 million views.
Simple ads, carefully targeted
One of the hurdles was finding pornographic sites that would allow political advertising, which some of the largest distributors of pornography, like PornHub, do not allow. Then, Nowinski said, they had to be able to target the ads in the seven swing states, but with a heavy focus on the ""blue wall"" states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, where larger demographics of white men reside.
The ads are simplistic: a five second static image the viewer must see before they can hit ""skip"" to get to the video they’re there to watch. The image has ominous music and features things like a woman in lingerie with this message: ""Trump’s Project 2025 will ban porn. Enjoy while you can."" The ads also instruct the viewer to ""Google Trump porn ban.""
Their goal is also simple: Convince some of these Trump-leaning, porn-watching white guys to sit out the election.
""While this is certainly a different sort of approach, it's not unusual and it's smart in some ways, in a lot of ways it's smart to go where your audience is,"" said Steve Caplan, a professor at the University of Southern California, who is teaching a class this semester on political advertising in the 2024 campaign.
To be clear, Trump has not endorsed a pornography ban, and his campaign has repeatedly distanced itself from the conservative blueprint Project 2025, although it was crafted by Trump allies and it does call for all pornography to be outlawed.
""I think it's a fascinating example of how far campaign advertising, targeting and hyper targeting has evolved,"" said Caplan.
With $75,000 in the bank to spend by Election Day, Nowinski estimates their swing state ad campaign could hit 20 million views. He also says they'll probably keep the PAC alive after this election, but he's not sure where exactly to take it from here.
""I'll probably keep the PAC alive because there's other opportunities that are like niche efficiency plays, or kind of unexpected angles that I'd like to explore more potentially in future elections,"" he said.",2024-11-01
NPR,"First Gaza, now Lebanon: How support for Israel’s war is influencing Michigan voting","First Gaza, now Lebanon: How support for Israel’s war is influencing Michigan voting
DEARBORN, Mich. — This city, home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the country, is a city in deep mourning over two wars in the Middle East thousands of miles away.
The signs of that grief are everywhere.
At a funeral for a Lebanese American man killed in an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon.
At a candlelight vigil where people bowed their heads in prayer.
And on the walls of a local coffee shop and art gallery, Black Box, covered in the colors of Lebanese and Palestinian flags. Playing cards with pictures of President Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken are also taped up, each marked with the words “war criminal.”
Many residents here have loved ones who have been killed in Lebanon and Gaza. They say they feel betrayed by the Democratic Party over the administration’s continued military support for Israel despite global alarm over the level of civilians killed and suffering.
They’re trying to figure out how to express this pain at the ballot box in less than a week.
Fractured support for Harris
Back in February, a self-described anti-war coalition called the Uncommitted Movement, led by Arab and Muslim American Democrats, rallied voters to send a message to President Biden: get a cease-fire, stop sending weapons to Israel, or risk losing voters in Michigan.
More than 100,000 voters heeded the call during the Democratic primary and checked “uncommitted” on the ballot.
Today, Biden is no longer the Democratic candidate, and Vice President Harris is at the top of the ticket. However, for those who chose ""uncommitted"" — the majority of whom have voted Democratic in the past — support for Harris is by no means guaranteed in this key swing state, where she and former President Donald Trump are neck and neck.
All these months later, there is no cease-fire in Israel’s war on Hamas in Gaza. In fact, it’s expanded to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Calls to end or condition U.S. military aid to Israel over the level of civilians killed and infrastructure destroyed have gone largely unheeded.
“It’s such a tough moment. It feels like a moment of impossibility,” said Abbas Alawieh, the co-founder of the Uncommitted Movement and a Democratic organizer. “I'm feeling a certain level of despair, and I'm also feeling the contradictions of that despair being so rooted in the policy of our government to send weapons and bombs to kill people I love.”
The unity that was so apparent in February among Arab Americans, young voters and other progressives in the Detroit metro area has fractured, and people are divided on how to express their objections to U.S. policy with their limited political power come Election Day.
“When [Harris] became the candidate, we made this offer that if you change the policy, then we’ll automatically endorse you, and if you can’t change the policy then give us something,” Alawieh said, his face pale and his hands shaking as he spoke in a Dearborn cafe. “Not only did they not give us anything, they actively worked to push voters for whom this is a top issue away.”
The inability to get anything from Harris has diminished the credibility of this movement in the view of so many in his own community, home to the largest Lebanese American population in the country. Their families hail from the cities and towns being bombed by Israel right now. More than 2,700 people have been killed in a matter of weeks and over a million displaced, according to the country's Health Ministry.
Despite Alawieh’s pain over the deaths of his own family members in Lebanon and his displaced loved ones, he is still choosing Harris.
“I'm looking at Trump's plans, and I know it could get worse,” he said. “Trump is actively accepting contributions from people who want the full annexation of the West Bank. Trump, very importantly, has very specific plans for how he will criminalize our anti-war organizing here in this country. And that is a clear difference from Vice President Harris.”
It’s a choice that has isolated him. Alawieh’s movement didn’t endorse Harris but still warned against voting for a third party and of what it sees as the dangers of a Donald Trump presidency.
“I've gotten a lot of criticism from my own beloved community members for this position. Some ask me, what could be worse than genocide?” he said. “I have a hard time figuring out how to respond to that.”
They’re voting for Trump and Stein
People here don’t use the word “war” to describe what’s happening in Gaza, where more than 43,000 people have been killed, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, aid has been intermittently blocked by Israel, hospitals bombed and people are trapped and unable to flee. They say genocide.
It’s the subject of a case before the International Court of Justice and something Israel denies. Israel says it's going after Hamas which led the deadliest attack in that country’s history that killed some 1,200 people and saw fighters take some 250 hostages, according to Israeli officials.
The International Criminal Court's prosecutor is also seeking arrest warrants for both Israeli and Hamas officials over alleged war crimes.
Now all those voters Alawieh helped mobilize just a few months ago are “being left on the table"" by his party.
And across the cafe, Samraa Luqman, a Yemeni American community organizer, is ready to pick those votes up for Trump.
She said she met with former President Trump recently in Dearborn, where he made a promise to her to end the war. That stands in stark contrast to his public statements, in which he said Israel should “finish the job” and criticized Harris and Biden for calling for a cease-fire. At a rally for Trump just this weekend, speakers used racist and misogynistic rhetoric, including Rudy Giuliani. He demonized Palestinian toddlers, falsely claiming they are “taught to kill us at two years old.”
Asked why, despite this rhetoric, she believes Trump’s promise to end the war, Luqman says he’s more likely to do so than Harris.
“Believe him or not, if there is a 99% chance that Trump is going to continue the genocide and I have to weigh it against 100% chance that it's going to continue under Harris, I'm going to take the 99% chance,” she said. “The fact that there is that slight hope means that I need to go with the best thing for my people.”
And she’s not the only one making this calculation. This weekend, several prominent Arab and Muslim leaders endorsed Trump at a campaign rally in Michigan.
Luqman’s children are half-Palestinian, and this year of watching kids being killed is intolerable, she said. She blames the Biden administration and Harris directly for these deaths.
“It hurts a lot. That hurt has transformed into rage,” she said. “I will do everything in my power to ensure Harris loses. Whatever I can do. And, I’m still a Democrat.”
She sees this as a path to building real political power for a community that has over 200,000 votes in Michigan. For context, Trump won this state by about 11,000 votes in 2016 and Biden won by over 150,000 in 2020.
“If Muslims are credited with swinging an election,” she said, “imagine the political strength we're going to have. Both Democrats and Republicans are going to be vying for our vote.”
But most Arab American and Muslim Americans NPR interviewed around Dearborn said that if they don’t stay home on Election Day, they’ll go with a third-party choice: Jill Stein.
The Green Party candidate has been actively campaigning in Michigan promising to “end the genocide.”
She has no chance of winning, but she could pull a chunk of support from Harris, and the Harris campaign is running out of time to win these voters over.
Some see Harris as the “strategic choice”
In the last few weeks, her campaign has made overtures. Last month, Harris met with some American Muslims and Arab Americans over an hour away in Flint. This weekend, a different group of Arab Americans endorsed Harris in Dearborn. They called her the strategic choice despite their disappointment. Trump, they said, has shown indifference to Palestinian suffering while promising mass deportations and the revival of a travel ban on majority-Muslim countries, known as the Muslim ban.
The Harris campaign told NPR she is “committed to earn every vote” and that she has been steadfast in her support for American Muslims “including ensuring that they can live free from the hateful policies of the Trump administration.”
Some American Muslims view this as Harris making a real effort despite having to uphold Biden’s policies.
“I’m not voting for Kamala because I’m afraid of Trump. I see her as a great candidate,” said Imam Mika’il Stewart Saadiq, a Black Muslim leader born and raised in Detroit.
He is one of 25 American imams from across the country who endorsed Harris in an open letter.
“I don't think it's fair that we lay the blame of the mess of eight years of older white men at the feet of a Black woman in our generation who's saying cease-fire now before the president said it,” he said in an interview. “We've seen what Trump can do. We've seen what Biden can do. Let's see what she can do.”
Saadiq voted uncommitted in the primary, but once Harris got on the ticket he got behind her.
“I respect people's righteous indignation and people saying I just can't vote. I'm never going to try and convince a Palestinian American that they should understand my political calculus,” he said. “But then when it comes to Trump and the MAGA beast at the gate, again we ask the question, OK, now are you asking me to sacrifice myself? Because remember, anti-Black racism, usually when you're darker, you get it the worst.”
He shares a parable from the Islamic Prophet Muhammad to make his point. The story is about a boat with lower- and upper-deck passengers.
“We're all in the same boat. We are Americans,” Saadiq said. “People at the bottom of the boat, they want water, so they're like, ‘Hey, we have an idea. We're going to bust a hole in the bottom of the boat and get water.’ If the people at the upper level don't stop them, then everybody sinks. So in this hysterical political climate, there are some of us that say, OK. Don't put the hole in the bottom of the boat. Don't sink everybody.”
But with just days until the election and the war expanding, many Arab and Muslim American voters in this battleground state said they already feel like they’re sinking.

NPR,Fake videos from Russian propagandists aim to raise tensions ahead of Election Day,"Fake videos from Russian propagandists aim to raise tensions ahead of Election Day
In a video posted to X on Thursday, a man claiming to be a Haitian immigrant says he's already voted for Vice President Harris in Gwinnett County, Ga., and is headed to vote again in nearby Fulton County. Seated in what appears to be in a van next to another purported Haitian immigrant, he says they arrived in the U.S. six months ago and have already become American citizens.
State and federal officials say the video was likely created by Russian propagandists trying to undermine confidence in the election.
""This is obviously fake and part of a disinformation effort. Likely it is a production of Russian troll farms,"" Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said on Thursday. On Friday, federal officials weighed in, saying they also believe the video was ""manufactured"" by Russian influence actors.
""This Russian activity is part of Moscow's broader effort to raise unfounded questions about the integrity of the U.S. election and stoke divisions among Americans,"" the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said in a joint statement.
The video is the latest hoax that researchers say matches the output of a Russian operation known as Storm-1516, which they say is pumping out a steady stream of phony material in the final days of voting. The operation is known for producing staged videos that it launders through online influencers and sham news outlets. It has been tied by Clemson University to the notorious Russian ""troll factory"" that targeted the 2016 presidential election.
In just the past two weeks, researchers at Clemson and Microsoft have linked Storm-1516 to a fake video purporting to show ballots marked for former President Donald Trump being destroyed in Pennsylvania and baseless accusations against Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz. Federal officials also attributed those videos to Russia.
""Immediately I was suspicious of this [Georgia] video, just when I saw the style and production value,"" said Darren Linvill, co-director of Clemson University's Media Forensics Hub, which first identified the Storm-1516 operation last year.
The subject matter also matches the Russian tactic of amplifying existing divisive narratives to American voters, he said.
""This is connecting to existing stories that are being told about the Haitian community, about immigrants being used for voting,"" Linvill said. ""The Russians understand these schisms, and they use those schisms to spread their messages.""
The account that Linvill identified as the first to share the video on X has since deleted it. In a direct message exchange with NPR, the person running the account wrote, ""I took it down because I wasn't sure if it was 100% accurate and I don't want to be liable for misinformation.""
It's not clear exactly how the fake Georgia video reached this X account. The account told NPR it saw the video on Telegram, but did not respond to follow-up questions.
The video has continued to spread widely on social media, primarily X, spurring Raffensperger to call publicly on X owner Elon Musk and leaders of other platforms to take it down.
""X found these posts to be violative of our Civic Integrity Policy and we are taking action against the posts,"" a spokesperson for X said. Another X account that posted the Georgia video, which has also posted other content connected to Storm-1516, has been suspended.
Facebook is putting labels on the video informing users that U.S. intelligence officials have said it was manufactured by Russian influence actors.
The IRA's successor
In 2016, Russian operatives working at the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg impersonated Americans and posed as news sources on social media to push false and misleading stories to U.S. voters.
The IRA was the creation of Yevgeny Prigozhin, the Russian oligarch and erstwhile confidant of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who died in 2023. In a recent report, Clemson identified connections between Storm-1516 and another group founded by Prigozhin in 2021 called the Russian Foundation to Battle Injustice.
""We believe this is IRA 2.0. It's the same people, it's the same network, it's the same old ownership,"" Linvill said.
Today, Linvill says Storm-1516 has refined some of the IRA's methods. Its videos sometimes appear on websites disguised as news outlets, such as a site posing as a nonexistent San Francisco television station that shared a staged video accusing Harris of injuring someone in a 2011 hit-and-run. (There's no evidence the incident occurred.)
Some sites sharing the operation's content are part of a network of websites masquerading as local U.S. news outlets that the misinformation-tracking company NewsGuard and the New York Times have reported are run by John Mark Dougan, a former deputy sheriff from Florida who now lives in Moscow. Dougan denies working for the Russian government. However, a European intelligence agency obtained documents showing he is working directly with Russian military intelligence, according to reporting by the Washington Post.
Linvill says Storm-1516 is also now relying on real people, rather than bots or fake accounts, to spread their messages and videos.
He said that reflects both a change in Russian tactics and an environment in which many Americans are more receptive to claims of malfeasance amid Trump's ongoing attacks on election integrity.
""They've put effort into building the network. They put effort into making these connections with real humans,"" Linvill said. ""But it is also true that people are now primed for [that]. You can't separate these things. The Russians changed their tactics to conform to the changes in our reality.""
As Election Day approaches, government officials are cautioning Americans to be on the alert for more Russian attempts to target confidence in the election.
""We are very concerned about how our foreign adversaries will specifically target after Election Day, in that period of time where election officials around the country are taking the incredibly important work of certifying the official results,"" a senior CISA official, who spoke to reporters on the condition of anonymity, said on Friday.
Linvill says he's braced for a new fraudulent video every day. ""I'm sure they've got them queued up,"" he said.

NPR,"Americans bet $100 million on Trump v. Harris, but at what cost?","Americans bet $100 million on Trump v. Harris, but at what cost?
An election betting advertisement flashed on screen during coverage of former President Donald Trump's rally at Madison Square Garden this weekend on the Right Side Broadcasting Network, a conservative media company.
""Bet on the US election,"" the ad for Kalshi said as Trump spoke on stage. ""Bet $100 on Trump, Get $175.""
More than $100 million has been legally wagered on the presidential race on the platform, days out from Election Day. This explosion in legal betting comes after a federal appeals court earlier this month allowed KalshiEX LLC, an online-betting company, to open an election prediction market.
The company's CEO, Tarek Mansour, told NPR his election market — which shows a 63% chance of Trump winning as of Tuesday — is a ""mechanism for truth"" and help regular people hedge against unpredictable political risk. But critics like Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., have called the legal decision a ""huge mistake"" that harms American democracy.
Kalshi is still battling federal regulators in court. But retail investing platform Robinhood also started offering bets on election contracts this week. That leaves Americans free to make tens of millions of legal election bets, with little known about how they will impact one of the closest and most contentious presidential elections in decades.
Betting on U.S. elections
Wagering on the U.S. presidential election is nothing new. Bets on presidential candidates were common during the turn of the 20th century. Betting commissioners in New York City controlled these markets at a place called the New York Curb Exchange.
Not only did bets occur, the markets were fairly accurate during a time before scientific political polls, according to NPR's former gambling correspondent and current editor Keith Romer.
""Of the 15 presidential elections between 1884 and 1940, the betting market correctly calls the race in 11,"" Romer told NPR's Planet Money. ""It's too close to call in three. And they only get one wrong.""
Major papers, like The New York Times, would publish the betting odds as a source of information, Romer said. But in the latter half of the 20th century, during the advent of scientific polling and a number of prohibitive gambling laws, election betting fell out of favor.
In recent years, prediction markets have brought election betting back. On the social media platform X, the Trump campaign, tech billionaire Elon Musk and pollster Nate Silver often post the latest presidential betting odds on Polymarket, an offshore prediction market U.S. citizens can only use illegally.
To date, $2.5 billion has been bet on the presidential election on Polymarket, which also gives the former president a 66% chance of election victory. Suspicious activity has raised questions about the site's accuracy: Blockchain researchers cited by Fortune say there's evidence some one-third of the volume on Polymarket's presidential betting market is artificial.
Kalshi for the first time gives Americans a legal platform for their wagers, which CEO and co-founder Mansour argued offers voters accurate information, in contrast to political polling.
Rajiv Sethi, a professor of economics at Barnard College who has been studying these markets for years, said the ""jury is still out"" on whether prediction markets are better than traditional political polling — but it's close.
""They generate outputs that are actually quite competitive with the best models,"" Sethi said.
Affecting election outcomes?
Mansour, the CEO, said the goal is to broaden election betting to the general public, similar to the creative financial vehicles that are available to hedge risks for ""high-net-worth individuals"" at investment banks like Goldman Sachs, his former employer.
He gave the example of an environmental company protecting itself against the election of a candidate who proposes slashing climate change initiatives.
""People can now do something about it,"" Mansour said. ""They can reduce their exposure and volatility towards events that they don't really have control over.""
When asked about nefarious betting meant to falsely inflate the odds of a given candidate, Mansour said election markets are ""self-correcting"" because bettors will see an opportunity to make money on an inflated outcome.
""The only outcome is basically — the people who tried to manipulate in the first place lost a lot of money,” Mansour said during an interview conducted when the Kalshi odds mirrored those of public polls.
Mansour admitted election betting isn't a zero-risk proposition, but said Kalshi is federally regulated — meaning regulators would be able to intervene if someone tried to manipulate a market.
""Everything is super transparent and everyone can see anything you do and know your name and your address and what you're doing and the government is monitoring,"" Mansour said. ""It feels like a pretty bad place to try to do any of these things.""
Sethi, the Barnard professor, largely agreed, citing a 2012 case when an anonymous person bet $7 million to increase the odds of then-Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney winning the election, and failed when other gamblers caught on. But Sethi said there still is a potential for manipulation.
""Your belief about whether a candidate is viable, is doing well, is likely to prevail, can affect things like fundraising, support, the enthusiasm, volunteer effort and so on,"" Sethi said. ""These things can actually affect the actual outcome of the election.""
'A huge mistake'
One week from Election Day, the Kalshi market favors Trump by over 30 percentage points — while most political polls show Harris and Trump statistically tied. This misalignment has raised questions about the accuracy of these markets.
Merkley, the Oregon senator, has opposed Kalshi from the start and proposed a bill in Congress to ban all election betting.
""Allowing election betting is a huge mistake,"" Merkley told NPR. ""It turns elections from a place where you exercise your principles to where you exercise your pocketbook. It corrupts our American elections.""
Beyond the moral challenge, Merkley said the law prohibits it. He says it's against Regulation 40.11 from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which prohibits trades on ""terrorism, assassination, war, gaming, or an activity that is unlawful under any State or Federal law."" The CFTC is fighting Kalshi in court.
""Gaming is betting on the outcome of a contest,"" Merkley said. ""An election is a contest. These are not commodities. This is not oil. This is not silver.""
Kalshi's Mansour said he knows election betting comes with a stigma of corruption, but argued the critique doesn't hold water.
""We fought for these markets not because we think they threaten election integrity,"" Mansour said. ""On the contrary, we think they promote it.""",2024-10-29
NPR,Supreme Court allows Virginia to purge individuals from voter rolls,"Supreme Court allows Virginia to purge individuals from voter rolls
Just six days before Election Day, the Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed Virginia to continue its purge of more than 1,600 individuals from the state's voter rolls.
The vote was 6 to 3, along ideological lines, with liberal Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissenting.
On Aug. 7, exactly 90 days before Election Day, Virginia’s Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed an executive order expediting the removal of noncitizens from the state's voter rolls. The state maintained that the program only removed those who were ineligible to vote due to lack of citizenship.
In early October, the Justice Department and advocacy groups sued, contending that the state had in fact purged at least some eligible voters and that it did so in violation of a federal law that bars systematic removals from voting rolls in the 90 days prior to an election. Specifically, the 1993 National Voter Registration Act creates a “quiet period” within 90 days of a federal election. During those 90 days, states are prohibited from “systematic[ally]” removing “ineligible voters” from the rolls because of the increased possibility of errors.
The challengers alleged that Virginia's voter purge did exactly what the federal law was aimed at preventing; it removed eligible voters who, as a result of the state's action, did not know they were no longer eligible to vote.
A federal district court agreed, ordering Virginia to restore the approximately 1,600 voter registrations that were cancelled. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that order. Virginia then appealed to the Supreme Court, asking the justices to allow the state to strike the voters purged in the 90 days prior to the election.
The state contended that the lower courts “misinterpreted the NVRA.” They argued that the “quiet period” cannot apply to noncitizens, since they are already ineligible to vote. Even if the “quiet period” did apply here, the state argued, the program was sufficiently individualized, not systematic.
On Wednesday, the Supreme Court sided with Virginia, leaving the purged voters off the rolls and allowing the purge to continue.
In a statement, Youngkin called the order ""a victory for commonsense and election fairness.""
Because Virginia allows in-person voter registration through Election Day, there is still time for eligible voters to register and vote in the election.
The significance of court's the ruling is more a matter of the signal it sends than how the court's action will effect the election in Virginia, where polls show Vice President Harris well ahead of former President Trump. The signal it sends is that if a majority of the justices had an appetite for election appeals like this one, they almost certainly will have an appetite for election appeals from more contentious states in the coming days and weeks.",2024-10-30
NPR,2 close calls have the Secret Service facing criticism and an uncertain future,"2 close calls have the Secret Service facing criticism and an uncertain future
The U.S. Secret Service is once again embroiled in controversy following a second apparent attempt on the life of former President Donald Trump.
The agency came under criticism in July when a gunman at a Trump rally in Butler, Pa., was able to fire multiple shots at the Republican presidential nominee, killing one rally attendee, striking Trump's ear and wounding two others.
The Secret Service had been made aware of a ""suspicious male"" loitering near the rally, but officials lost track of him.
Now, just over two months later, a second alleged gunman was able to make it within several hundred yards of Trump in West Palm Beach, Fla.
This time, the man, armed with a semiautomatic rifle, was thwarted when an agent saw the barrel of the man's gun sticking out through the bushes as the former president played golf. The agent began shooting at the armed man, and the gunman did not return fire, according to authorities.
Trump was uninjured in that event, and in a Monday interview on the social media platform X, he praised Secret Service agents for having done a ""great job"" in protecting him.
But both incidents added to criticism of the agency for letting danger get so close to a person under its protection.
What is the Secret Service?
The Secret Service is the official protection system for sitting and former presidents and vice presidents; their families; major party nominees to those offices; visiting foreign heads of state; and others. As of now, the agency has 36 people under routine protection, including President Biden and his family, as well as former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama.
The agency was founded in 1865 under the Department of the Treasury to help combat counterfeiting of U.S. currency following the Civil War. Ironically, President Abraham Lincoln signed approval to start the agency on the same day he was shot.
It wasn't until the 1901 assassination of President William McKinley that the Secret Service would be tasked with protecting the president.
In the years since, the agency has been at the forefront of a number of history-altering events in U.S. politics, including the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and serious attempts on the lives of Presidents Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan.
Following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the U.S., the agency shifted from the Treasury Department to the Department of Homeland Security, which was created in response to the attacks.
The Secret Service's reach as a law enforcement agency has expanded broadly since then.
What are the problems with the agency?
The agency aims for a ""zero-fail"" mission. But the recent attempts against Trump have called into question the agency's leadership and its operatives' ability to do their jobs.
The Secret Service is currently helmed by acting Director Ronald Rowe, who stepped into the role after Kimberly Cheatle's resignation in the wake of the attempt on Trump's life in July.
Lawmakers slammed Cheatle for the Secret Service's response to that shooting, including failures to communicate with local law enforcement officials before and during Trump's rally in Butler and its lack of a good plan to secure the roof that ultimately gave the gunman a clear line of sight to shoot at Trump.
The Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General in July launched its own review into the Secret Service's process for securing the Trump rally.
At a news conference on Monday, Rowe defended his agency and said that following the Pennsylvania shooting, he ordered a paradigm shift of being more proactive instead of reactive. But, he said, the organization needs help.
""We have done more with less for decades,"" Rowe said. ""We have immediate needs right now.""
The Secret Service operates on a budget of just over $3 billion. It employs some 3,600 special agents, 1,600 Uniformed Division officers and more than 2,000 additional personnel.
In a meeting last week with members of Congress, Rowe asked lawmakers for better training for countersnipers and the ability to hire more staff, he said. It wasn't immediately clear how much extra money or personnel the agency is asking for.
Biden similarly noted the agency's issues on Monday, telling reporters: ""The service needs more help.""
What is Congress' role?
Various committees in Congress have launched their own probes into the incidents around Trump.
Following the July assassination attempt, the U.S. House established a task force to investigate the shooting, while the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee launched an investigation.
Speaking on Tuesday in a fireside chat with the right-wing America First Policy Institute think tank, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said the House task force would expand to include an investigation into the Sunday incident as well.
But lawmakers are divided on whether the Secret Service's problems could be fixed by more money.
Johnson acknowledged that the agency faces problems but questioned whether those issues needed to be solved with additional funding.
""The Secret Service, as you've seen reported, suggests that they have a manpower shortage. And look, it's about allocation of resources,"" he said. ""I'm not so sure it's a funding issue, but Congress will be willing to do what's necessary.""",2024-09-19
NPR,"On Arizona's campaign trail, there are 22 tribal lands. He set out to visit them all","On Arizona's campaign trail, there are 22 tribal lands. He set out to visit them all
On a warm summer day in June, Johnny Lehi stands a few steps off U.S. Route 89 under the harsh, northern Arizona sun.
He stares at a windswept expanse of red rocks, cliffs and clay that he hopes he’ll soon be able to officially call his own.
Over two decades ago, Lehi’s tribe — the San Juan Southern Paiute — signed a treaty with the Navajo Nation that set aside parts of Navajo land for the Southern Paiute people, one of 22 federally recognized tribes in Arizona, and the only one without a reservation.
“Elders fought for us, and the majority of them are not here no more to see what they pushed for,” says Lehi, the tribe’s vice president.
Though the tribes struck a deal, the treaty has yet to be recognized by Congress — a water rights settlement that will formalize the arrangement awaits a vote in Washington, D.C.
Until then, the Southern Paiute are stuck renting space on the Navajo reservation in nearby Tuba City.
Renting, not owning.
“It’s a big step for us to actually have something of our own,” says Lehi.
Standing next to Lehi is someone’s who’s vote could help the Southern Paiute take that step: U.S. Rep. Ruben Gallego. The congressman, running for an open Senate seat in Arizona, says he supports the tribe’s push for a federally recognized homeland.
Gallego, in turn, could use tribal support to win in this swing state, where roughly 6% of the population identifies as American Indian, according to Census data.
And while Native Americans have traditionally voted for Democrats, Gallego says the Democratic Party has often taken them for granted.
“A lot of times, by the time Democrats pay attention to Indian country or tribal votes, it's usually the last two weeks,” he says. “We're like, ‘Oh man, we're down. We need to find more votes.’ Like, let's get out there, right? It's just very disrespectful.”
Gallego, who speaks highly of friendships he made with Native Americans serving alongside him in the Marines, says he sought to change that nearly two years ago, when he first launched his campaign. He purposefully spent part of his first day on the campaign trail on Native land, with members of the Navajo and White Mountain Apache tribes.
And he set a goal for himself: to visit all of Arizona’s federally recognized tribes while running for Senate.
NPR traveled with Gallego on three such trips, to the San Juan Southern Paiute, Hopi and Havasupai tribes.
While campaign stops for Gallego, the trips have also served as a rare opportunity for tribal leaders. Typically, they’re the ones traveling to Washington, D.C., to meet with senators and congressmen, not the other way around.
Lehi hopes the visit provided Gallego a tangible sense of what’s at stake for his people.
“He's been here, he's seen it now, and he felt the land, you know,” he says.
The political power of Arizona's tribal leaders
Tribal leaders are well aware of the political power they wield in Arizona.
“In the last election cycle, 2020, it was the native votes in Arizona that overturned, and made this a blue state,” says Alfred Lomahquahu, the Hopi tribal registrar.
The boast is no exaggeration. According to an Associated Press analysis of voter turnout on large swaths of tribal land in Arizona, a surge in 2020 — compared to the 2016 presidential election — helped push Joe Biden to victory in a state where Democrat’s hadn’t won a presidential contest since 1996.
Trips like Gallego’s visit to the Hopi Reservation, where he meets with the tribal council and has lunch in the village of Bacavi, are necessary steps to court native voters, Lomahquahu says.
""Most native tribes are all about actually meeting the person and getting to know them. That really comes down to who they're going to vote for,” he says.
The fight for Native American votes
Gallego’s Republican rival, Kari Lake, has sought to cut into the traditional Democratic advantage among Native Americans. According to her campaign, she’s made multiple trips to the Navajo reservation — the largest reservation in Arizona and the U.S., spanning three states. She has the endorsement of Myron Lizer, a Republican and the former vice president of the Navajo Nation.
But Gallego had a head start, having launched his campaign about 10 months before Lake. He’s also gone out of his way to visit remote tribes that aren’t easy to get to.
That’s why, last month, he embarked on a hike into the depths of the Grand Canyon to visit the Havasupai Reservation — his 20th tribe so far.
There’s two ways to get there: A helicopter ride, or an 8-mile, 2,000 foot descent. Citing a phobia of helicopters from his time in the Marines, Gallego opted to walk.
“After we're done with this, we're gonna have to stretch our shins, because we're not young men anymore,” he quips about halfway through the journey.
The trail starts with a steep descent before leveling out to a gradual decline on a dry wash through towering red rock canyon walls. It’s full of reminders of why Gallego didn’t get here sooner as he planned — shattered trees and debris washed away by a flash flood that briefly shutdown Supai, a world-famous tourist destination for the picturesque waterfalls that turned deadly in August.
The tribe takes pride in clearing the path for the tens of thousands of tourists that visit each year. Bernadine Jones, chair of the Havasupai tribal council, says they’re glad Gallego took the long way to get there.
“Even if you flew in, you don't see, you know, where we're at when you've never made the visit, how deep in a canyon we live, isolation, and I think just hiking in made it a step further,” she says.
“This is what you need to know,” she adds. “This is what it's like.”
The tribe greets Gallego, after four hours of hiking with a handful of campaign staffers and a dozen reporters, with a ceremonial basket dance and lunch — “Supai tacos,” made with the village’s famous fry bread.
They’re quick to point out that, if they support Gallego’s Senate bid, they expect his help in return.
They’re concerned a nearby uranium mine may taint the aquifer that supplies the clear, blue-green waters of Havasu Creek — the water that attracts tourists from around the world, but also sustains life for the tribe.
“We need to keep it alive so we can go swimming, we can grow our crops down here,” says Daley Manakaja, a tribal elder who describes himself as a “leader of children.”
The tribe makes sure Gallego has a chance to see what’s at stake. On UTVs, they drive Gallego and his entourage the extra two miles it takes to get to Havasu Falls, where the creek cascades over a 100-foot cliff, the top of which serves as campsite for tourists staying overnight in the canyon.
There, Gallego takes a hard-earned break after the hike — he wades into the basin at the foot of the falls.
But time is running out to meet his goal of visiting all of Arizona’s federally recognized tribes. With Election Day on Tuesday, the campaign says he’s still got two tribes to go.",2024-11-01
NPR,Trump rallied at Madison Square Garden in New York days before election,"Trump rallied at Madison Square Garden in New York days before election
Former President Donald Trump rallied in Madison Square Garden Sunday evening — leaving key battleground states and instead spending precious time in liberal New York City for an ""epic event,"" according to the Trump campaign.
The splashy rally itself — in a landmark arena that has played host to superstars, musicians, and political events in the past — threatened at times to be overshadowed by the vitriol coming from the speakers who preceded Trump at the event.
This isn't the first time Trump has rallied in and around New York City. Back in May, during his felony hush-money trial, the former president campaigned in the South Bronx, courting minority voters. Then in September, Trump held another rally in Long Island where he told the crowd, ""We are going to win New York.""
The former president lost his home state by around 23 percentage points during the 2016 and 2020 elections. Current polling averages of the Empire State show Trump is trailing Vice President Harris by around 15 points.
Despite this, the Trump campaign is pouring significant resources and star power into Sunday's rally at Madison Square Garden. Star surrogates like former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii), tech billionaire Elon Musk and Trump running mate Sen. JD Vance (Ohio) are all set to speak. They will notably not be in key swing states — the ones that will determine who wins the White House.
Harris, meanwhile, spent her Sunday in a swing state — Pennsylvania — speaking after the sermon at the Church of Christian Compassion in West Philadelphia, and picking up some books at Hakim's Bookstore.
She met with a group of young Black men at PhillyCuts barbershop, and sat in a chair that the barbers called the ""lucky chair"" — they told her that all candidates running for office who sat in it won their elections.
House control via New York
A closer look at the guest list provides political reasons for the Madison Square Garden rally. The list features prominent Republicans House Speaker Mike Johnson and New York Rep. Elise Stefanik.
Back in 2022, Republicans narrowly won control of the U.S. House thanks to a handful of New York districts that elected Republicans — such as Rep. Nick LaLota, Rep. Anthony D'Esposito and Rep. Mike Lawler. These Republicans, who represent districts from Long Island to Syracuse, now face tough races against Democrats this November.
Trump likely won't win the Empire State for himself this year, but the campaign is certainly working hard to keep Republican control of the U.S. House.
Beyond political strategy, the event is gaining attention — a important commodity in the final days of the election. Madison Square Garden also has a storied political past.
In 1936, President Franklin D. Roosevelt gave one of his most important and combative speeches at the New York venue, railing against the establishment. Three years later, 20,000 gathered there for a ""Pro America Rally"" supporting Adolf Hitler in 1939.
And in 1962, Marilyn Monroe sang happy birthday to 45-year-old President John F. Kennedy. In 2004, the Garden hosted the Republican National Convention. Now it welcomes a Republican once again.

NPR,Questions arise over White House transcript of Biden call to Latino activists,"Questions arise over White House transcript of Biden call to Latino activists
White House press officials altered the official transcript of a call in which President Joe Biden appeared to take a swipe at supporters of Donald Trump, drawing objections from the federal workers who document such remarks for posterity, according to two U.S. government officials and an internal email obtained Thursday by The Associated Press.
Biden created an uproar earlier this week with his remarks to Latino activists responding to racist comments at a Trump rally made by the comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who referred to the U.S. island territory of Puerto Rico as a ""floating island of garbage.""
Biden, according to a transcript prepared by the official White House stenographers, told the Latino group on a Tuesday evening video call, ""The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters — his — his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it's un-American.""
The transcript released by the White House press office, however, rendered the quote with an apostrophe, reading ""supporter's"" rather than ""supporters,"" which aides said pointed to Biden criticizing Hinchcliffe, not the millions of Americans who are supporting Trump for president.
The change was made after the press office ""conferred with the president,"" according to an internal email from the head of the stenographers' office that was obtained by The AP. The authenticity of the email was confirmed by two government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters.
The supervisor, in the email, called the press office's handling of the matter ""a breach of protocol and spoliation of transcript integrity between the Stenography and Press Offices.""
""If there is a difference in interpretation, the Press Office may choose to withhold the transcript but cannot edit it independently,"" the supervisor wrote, adding, ""Our Stenography Office transcript — released to our distro, which includes the National Archives — is now different than the version edited and released to the public by Press Office staff.""
The edit of the transcript came as the White House scrambled to respond to a wave of queries from reporters about Biden's comments. The president's remarks clashed with Vice President Kamala Harris' near-simultaneous speech outside the White House in which she called for treating Americans of differing ideologies with respect.
The Trump campaign quickly moved to fundraise off the quote, and the next day, Trump himself held a photo op inside a garbage truck to try to capitalize on Biden's criticism.
Harris on Wednesday distanced herself from Biden's comments — making the clearest break from the president since she took over for him at the top of the Democratic ticket just over three months ago. ""Let me be clear,"" she told reporters, ""I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for.""
According to the email, the press office had asked the stenographers to quickly produce a transcript of the call amid the firestorm. Biden himself took to social media to say that he he was not calling all Trump supporters garbage and that he was referring specifically to the ""hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump's supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally.""
The stenographers office is charged with preparing accurate transcripts of public and private remarks of the president for preservation by the National Archives and distribution to the public.
The two-person stenography team on duty that evening — a ""typer"" and ""proofer"" — said any edit to the transcript would have to be approved by their supervisor, the head of stenographers' office.
The supervisor was not immediately available to review the audio, but the press office went ahead and published the altered transcript on the White House website and distributed it to press and on social media in an effort to tamp down the story.
White House senior deputy press secretary Andrew Bates that evening also posted on X the edited version of the quote and wrote that Biden was referring ""to the hateful rhetoric at the Madison Square Garden rally as 'garbage.'""
The supervisor, a career employee of the White House, raised the concerns about the press office action — but did not weigh in on the accuracy of the edit — in an email to White House communications director Ben LaBolt, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and other press and communications officials.
""Regardless of urgency, it is essential to our transcripts' authenticity and legitimacy that we adhere to consistent protocol for requesting edits, approval, and release,"" the supervisor wrote.
The supervisor declined to comment to The AP and referred questions about the matter to the White House press office.
Asked to comment, Bates did not address the alteration of the transcript and said: ""The President confirmed in his tweet on Tuesday evening that he was addressing the hateful rhetoric from the comedian at Trump's Madison Square Garden rally. That was reflected in the transcript.""
House Republicans, meanwhile, were debating launching an investigation into the matter. House Republican Conference Chairwoman Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., and House Oversight and Accountability Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., on Wednesday accused White House staff of ""releasing a false transcript"" of Biden's remarks.
In a letter to White House counsel Ed Siskel on Wednesday, they called on the administration to retain documents and internal communications related to Biden's remarks and the release of the transcript.
""White House staff cannot rewrite the words of the President of the United States to be more politically on message,"" the lawmakers wrote to Siskel.
Stefanik and Comer said the action could be in violation of the Presidential Records Act of 1978.",2024-11-01
NPR,Support from rural Democrats will be crucial for Harris to win this swing state,"Support from rural Democrats will be crucial for Harris to win this swing state
Jakai Britton was not planning on casting a ballot this election season. When a group of door knockers came to his neighborhood, he wasn’t planning on having a conversation, either. But in the span of a couple minutes, he’d agreed to both.
Britton, a 28-year-old non-affiliated voter in Nash County, North Carolina, was pulling out of his driveway in a black SUV, airport bound, when a canvasser from the organization Down Home North Carolina approached his car.
“Can we get five minutes of your time?” door knocker Alex Cook asked. Her plea for five minutes turned into a plea for two minutes, and Britton said yes. From the passenger side window, while Britton’s car was still running, Cook made her case for why he should vote for the Democratic down-ballot candidates the organization had endorsed. She focused on the way the local races would impact health care, an issue that resonated with Britton.
“So, do we have a vote from you?” Cook asked.
“Yeah, you’ve got a vote from me,” Britton said.
To Down Home North Carolina, the stakes of the 2024 election are too high to let a potential voter like Britton go. Nash County is near-evenly divided between white and Black residents, and in recent presidential elections, it was near-evenly divided by its results. In 2020, President Joe Biden won the rural county by two-tenths of a point. In 2016, former President Donald Trump won it by the exact razor-thin margin.
In the small town of Nashville, where the group canvassed that day, it did not feel evenly divided. There were Trump signs everywhere, and plenty of MAGA flags. Still, Down Home found plenty of Democratic and non-affiliated doors to knock on.
“What I noticed is that there's a lot of people who want to stay out the way,” said Adon Bermudez-Bey, Down Home’s regional field director. “They see the Trump signs, they see what's going on in the school boards, city council. They're just like, ‘I'm going to stay out of it.’ We're trying to tell them there's an organization that specifically focuses on rural areas to pull those folks out.”
Bermudez-Bey said Down Home’s platform was “survival,” helping poor and working class people get basic needs met like housing and education. In an election season like this one, the organization is mostly focused on local races, but they endorse candidates up and down the ticket, usually Democrats. Most of their time is spent urging residents — especially residents of color — to get out and vote.
“They don’t open the door all the time,” Cook said. “So one out of 10 doors, you might get someone.”
North Carolina's state Democratic chair, Anderson Clayton, is also focused on turnout this election. The 26-year-old from rural Person County is the youngest state party chair in the country.
“Joe Biden lost the state by 74,000 votes in 2020, which we know is a field margin, and that can come from all of our counties across the state,” Clayton told NPR in October.
There are potential barriers to getting those votes. North Carolina has some of the most extreme partisan-drawn maps in the nation. The state’s governor, Roy Cooper, is a Democrat, but Republicans hold a supermajority in the statehouse.
Still, Clayton has made reaching out to rural Democrats a key part of her strategy. The stakes are clear: The Tarheel State has more rural voters than any other 2024 presidential swing state.
“I'm not going to win rural North Carolina this year. I'm trying to bring back margins in it,” Clayton said. “There's a difference in trying to talk to rural voters and talking to rural Democrats. I'm trying to talk to rural Democrats this year. People that showed up in 2008 that ain't showed up since because they haven't had somebody to vote for and they didn't feel like their vote actually mattered.”
Back in Nashville, Down Home door knockers make their pitch to another resident. Sean Jones says he plans on voting, though in the presidential race, he hasn’t made up his mind. He said he’s leaning toward Vice President Kamala Harris.
“I just recently went to go see my brother in prison this weekend, and he was kind of on my head about voting,” Jones said. “He wanted me to vote for Trump, but I still wanted to vote for Kamala. So I'm still trying to, like, look into the politics as far as what’s what and who’s who.”
So soon before Election Day, finding a true undecided voter can feel like a rarity. But Down Home encounters them all the time, even within their own ranks. Adon Bermudez-Bey, speaking only for himself and not for the organization, told NPR he’s also undecided on the presidential race — even as he led a group of canvassers for an organization that has endorsed Harris.
“I don't know if I'm voting for Kamala yet, just full transparency,” Bermudez-Bey said. “But I know that I'm definitely not voting for Trump.”
Bermudez-Bey cited his concerns about Harris’ time as a prosecutor in California, and her support for Israel during the ongoing war in the Middle East. He set a deadline for himself: By the last day of early voting in North Carolina, he’ll decide between Harris or a third-party candidate.
In the meantime, though, Bermudez-Bey said he still sees the merits of a Harris presidency — at least for Down Home’s goals.
“No, it's not going to be perfect, but it's going to be a lot easier for us to organize under her presidency than Trump's,” he said.
The motivation of voting against Trump, rather than for Harris, was in the air a dozen miles away at an early voting site in Rocky Mount, Nash County.
“I just feel like Donald Trump is for billionaires and not for working class people,” said voter Lynn Jones, who spoke to NPR after casting her ballot for Harris.
Her neighbor Donnell Jones, no relation, was by her side. He had just voted for the first time in his life. Lynn said the two of them had had a series of conversations in recent weeks about going to the polls together.
“I just thought, you know, he was at an age where this just should have happened a lot sooner,” Lynn said. “But I know sometimes people are stuck in their ways, so I didn't pressure him. Just, ‘Hey, let's go vote together then.’”
That resulted in one more vote for Harris.
“I voted for the lady,” Donnell said.
If Democrats win Nash County, and win North Carolina, it will be through thousands of interactions like what Down Home is doing — and on a more casual level, what Lynn Jones did with her neighbor Donnell. The key will be nudging others to show up and vote, regardless of how disengaged or skeptical they were at the beginning of those conversations.
Early voting in North Carolina ends on November 2. So far, more than 3.6 million voters have cast their ballots.",2024-10-31
NPR,"Montana camper offered his killer a beer — and it held suspect's DNA, sheriff says","Montana camper offered his killer a beer — and it held suspect's DNA, sheriff says
When Dustin Kjersem’s girlfriend found his body at a campsite in the Montana woods, she suspected Kjersem had been killed by a bear, because of the severity his wounds. But police say a man did it — and that they’ve now arrested a suspect who has admitted to the crime.
The accused killer “removed items from the campsite he believed had evidence that could tie him to the crime,” including an axe used against Kjersem, Gallatin County Sheriff Dan Springer said in a news briefing on Thursday.
But he missed a beer can, Springer said. Using DNA from the can, the Montana state crime lab was able to find a match: Daren Christopher Abbey.
“This individual confessed to the murder of Dustin Kjersem,” the sheriff said of Abbey, who is 41.
Abbey is being held in Butte on a charge of deliberate homicide, as well as two counts of tampering with evidence. He has been denied bond, according to Gallatin County records.
State correction department records show Abbey has four or more arrests for DUI, raising the offense to the felony level. He has multiple tattoos on his abdomen and arms, including swastikas and Viking symbols.
Investigators are still working to determine a motive for the killing. Springer said that while Abbey has told them his version of events, investigators are still working to ensure they know the whole truth.
“There does not appear to be any connection between our victim and our suspect,” Springer said, adding later, “This appears to be a heinous crime committed by an individual who had no regard for the life of Dustin Kjersem.”
Describing Kjersem’s final days, the sheriff said the 35-year-old set up camp on Thursday, Oct. 10, in the Moose Creek area about 35 miles south of Bozeman, where he planned to spend the weekend with his girlfriend.
“This camp included a wall tent complete with wood stove, beds, lamps, and multiple other items,” Springer said.
Kjersem’s girlfriend had to work on Friday, so he planned to leave the campsite to bring her back that night.
“Dustin did not show up to pick up his girlfriend and she became worried,” Springer said. “On Saturday morning, she and her friend drove to the campsite and found Dustin deceased in the tent.”
Abbey, who has ties to the nearby town of Big Sky, told investigators that he also planned to camp on that Thursday -- but when he reached the site where he planned to set up, Kjersem was already there.
“He stated that Dustin welcomed him to the campsite and offered him a beer,” the sheriff said. “At some point, this individual struck Dustin Kjersem with a piece of solid wood, stabbed him in the neck with a screwdriver and ultimately hit him with the axe.”
Springer alleged that Abbey took a number of items from the campsite, including an Estwing camp axe, a Remington shotgun, a Ruger Blackhawk revolver, and an orange YETI brand cooler.
As NPR reported earlier this week, the sheriff’s office initially said that when Kjersem’s death was reported, a bear attack might have been to blame.
But wildlife officials found no signs of bear activity, and an autopsy supported the idea that the case was a homicide, setting off a search for Kjersem’s killer.

NPR,Former 'Bob's Burgers' actor sentenced to 1 year in prison for role in Capitol riot,"Former 'Bob's Burgers' actor sentenced to 1 year in prison for role in Capitol riot
WASHINGTON — An actor known for his roles in the television comedies Bob's Burgers and Arrested Development was sentenced on Monday to one year in prison for his part in a mob's attack on the U.S. Capitol nearly four years ago.
Jay Johnston, 56, of Los Angeles, joined other rioters in a “heave ho” push against police officers guarding a tunnel entrance to the Capitol during the Jan. 6, 2021, riot. Johnston also cracked jokes and interacted with other rioters as he used a cellphone to record the violence around him, prosecutors said.
Johnston expressed regret that he “made it more difficult for the police to do their job"" on Jan. 6. He said he never would have guessed that a riot would erupt that day.
“That was because of my own ignorance, I believe,” he told U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols. “If I had been more political, I could have seen that coming, perhaps.”
The judge, who sentenced Johnston to one year and one day of imprisonment, allowed him to remain free after the hearing and report to prison at a date to be determined. Nichols said he recognizes that Johnston will miss out on caring for his 13-year-old autistic daughter while he is behind bars.
“But his conduct on January 6th was quite problematic. Reprehensible, really,” the judge said.
Johnston pleaded guilty in July to interfering with police officers during a civil disorder, a felony punishable by a maximum prison sentence of five years.
Prosecutors recommended an 18-month prison sentence for Johnston. Their sentencing memo includes a photograph of a smiling Johnston dressed as Jacob Chansley, the spear-carrying Capitol rioter known as the “QAnon Shaman,” at a Halloween party roughly two years after the siege.
“He thinks his participation in one of the most serious crimes against our democracy is a joke,” prosecutors wrote.
Johnston played pizzeria owner Jimmy Pesto Sr. in Bob’s Burgers, a police officer in Arrested Development and a street-brawling newsman in the movie Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. Johnston also appeared on Mr. Show with Bob and David, an HBO sketch comedy series that starred Bob Odenkirk and David Cross.
Johnston, a Chicago native, moved to Los Angeles in 1993 to pursue an acting career. After the riot, Johnston was fired by the creator of Bob's Burgers, lost a role in a movie based on the show and has ""essentially been blacklisted” in Hollywood, said defense attorney Stanley Woodward.
""Instead, Mr. Johnston has worked as a handyman for the last two years — an obvious far cry from his actual expertise and livelihood in film and television,"" Woodward wrote.
Woodward accused the government of exaggerating Johnston’s riot participation “because he is an acclaimed Hollywood actor.”
Johnston attended then-President Donald Trump's “Stop the Steal” rally near the White House on Jan. 6 before he marched to the Capitol. He used a metal bike rack to scale a stone wall to reach the Capitol's West Plaza before making his way to the mouth of a tunnel entrance that police were guarding on the Lower West Terrace.
“When he was under the archway, he turned and waved to other rioters, beckoning them to join him in fighting the police,” prosecutors wrote.
Entering the tunnel, Johnston helped other rioters flush chemical irritants out of their eyes. Another rioter gave him a stolen police shield, which he handed up closer to the police line. Johnston then joined other rioters in a “heave ho” push against police in the tunnel, a collective effort that crushed an officer against a door frame, prosecutors said.
Johnston recorded himself cracking a joke as rioters pushed an orange ladder toward police in the tunnel, saying, “We’re going to get those light bulbs fixed!”
A day after the riot, in a text message to an acquaintance, Johnston acknowledged being at the Capitol on Jan. 6.
“The news has presented it as an attack. It actually wasn’t. Thought it kind of turned into that. It was a mess,” Johnston wrote.
FBI agents seized Johnston's cellphone when they searched his California home in June 2021.
More than 1,500 people have been charged with Capitol riot-related federal crimes. Over 1,000 rioters have been convicted and sentenced. Roughly 650 of them received prison time ranging from a few days to 22 years.",2024-10-29
NPR,Harris and Trump bring their closing arguments to 2 key Southwest swing states,"Harris and Trump bring their closing arguments to 2 key Southwest swing states
LAS VEGAS — The presidential campaign headed west on Thursday with Vice President Harris and former President Donald Trump taking their closing arguments to voters in the critical swing states of Arizona and Nevada.
With five days to go until voting closes on Election Day, the candidates are looking to win over Latino voters in the two states — and talk about border security, one of the biggest issues for the campaign.
In Arizona, Harris criticized remarks made by Trump at a rally on Wednesday that he would protect women ""whether the women like it or not."" She framed the comment as a preview of the damage a second Trump presidency could mean for women.
""He does not believe women should have the agency and authority to make decisions about their own bodies,"" Harris said. ""He simply does not respect the freedom of women or the intelligence of women to know what’s in their own best interest and make decision accordingly,"" she added. ""But we trust women.”
Harris used her campaign stops Friday to draw a contrast between herself and Trump when it comes to issues affecting Latino voters. The Mexican regional band Los Tigres del Norte warmed up the crowd before Harris took the stage in Phoenix, and at one point in her address she led the audience in a chant of ""Si se puede,"" or ""Yes you can.""
""He insults Latinos, scapegoats immigrants -- and it's not just what he says, it's what he will do,"" Harris said of her Republican opponent. ""If elected, you can be sure he will bring back family separation policies, only on a much greater scale than last time.""
Arizona — which Trump lost by less than 11,000 votes in 2020 — remains one of the most closely contested states in this year’s election. Republicans are hoping a ballot measure that would make illegal border crossings a state crime will help motivate support for Trump, while Democrats have sought to mobilize voters around a ballot measure that would enshrine the right to an abortion in the state’s constitution.
The race in Nevada
After Arizona, Harris traveled to Nevada for rallies in Reno and Las Vegas.
In Las Vegas, Harris was introduced by the pop icon Jennifer Lopez, who spoke about a comedian’s crude joke referring to Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage” at Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden in New York last weekend.
""At Madison Square Garden, he reminded us who he really is and how he really feels,"" Lopez said. ""It wasn't just Puerto Ricans that were offended that day, okay — it was every Latino in this country.""
The remark at Trump's rally initially brought a wave of backlash against the former president, but by Wednesday Harris was having to clean up comments made by President Biden during a video call in which he sounded like he was calling Trump supporters “garbage.” Trump responded in Wisconsin on Wednesday by speaking to the press from inside a garbage truck.
Trump continued to attack Harris for the remark in a campaign stop Thursday in Henderson, just outside of Las Vegas.
“How stupid is a man to say that,” Trump said. “How stupid is a man to say that. But she believes it, too.""
His meandering address touched on a wide range of topics. Trump claimed Harris lacked the stamina to run for office, hyped his social media platform TruthSocial and bragged about his endorsement from Elon Musk.
""I would say, you got to say, in terms of computer, I would say he's probably about as good as you get,"" Trump said about Musk.
At one point, Trump also suggested that Border Patrol officers are able to determine which migrants are good and which are bad just by looking at them.
""They go trouble, trouble, trouble, — no trouble — trouble, trouble. They can look at them and they can see good or bad,"" Trump said.
Trump was in the Phoenix suburb of Glendale later on Thursday speaking at an event with Tucker Carlson, the conservative commentator known for stirring controversy.
With their stops in Nevada, home to a large population of service industry workers, both candidates were returning to a state where they have touted plans to eliminate taxes on tips for hourly workers.
In Nevada, Latinos make up just over one in five eligible voters, while in Arizona they represent 25% of the eligible voter population, according to the Pew Research Center. Democrats have traditionally won significant shares of the demographic, but polling has shown the Republican nominee chipping away at that advantage.
A rare stop in New Mexico
Trump also made an unusual campaign stop in New Mexico on Thursday, a state that has not elected a Republican to the White House since 2004. The rally in Albuquerque marked his first time in the reliably Democratic state since his 2020 run for the White House.
Trump told the crowd he traveled to the state to win over Latino voters.
""I’m here for one simple reason: I like you very much, and it’s good for my credentials with the Hispanic or Latino community,"" he said.
Trump said it would take record turnout from Latino voters for him to win New Mexico, and also claimed he's won the state every year he’s run for president, despite back to back losses in 2016 and 2020.
The home stretch
Starting Friday, the two campaigns will be racing from swing state to swing state trying to rally supporters and win over the last remaining undecided voters. Harris will have stops in Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin before wrapping her campaign Monday with a flurry of rallies in Pennsylvania — including one in Allentown, where more than half of the people are Latino -- mainly Puerto Rican.
Trump will be traveling to Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin. He also has a stop in Virginia — a state Harris is widely favored to win. His campaign has not yet announced where he will spend his final day of campaigning.",2024-10-31
NPR,"As ACA sign ups start, more Americans have health insurance than ever. Will it last?","As ACA sign ups start, more Americans have health insurance than ever. Will it last?
More than 21 million Americans buy their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, and open enrollment for next year’s Obamacare plans started Friday, Nov. 1.
People can shop for plans on Healthcare.gov, or their state-based marketplaces from Georgia Access to Covered California.
This year, premiums are still very affordable — for many people, premiums are $10 or less per month — and there are more plan options than ever. “I think this is really reflecting a turnaround in the ACA marketplaces,” says Cynthia Cox, who directs the Program on the Affordable Care Act for KFF, a nonpartisan health research organization.
Those low premiums and numerous plan options have spurred record high enrollment in ACA plans.
Most Americans get their insurance through their jobs or through a public program like Medicaid or Medicare. But still, this program has a big impact. As enrollment in the marketplaces set new records in the last few years, the number of uninsured Americans has dropped dramatically.
“Under President Biden and Vice President Harris, more Americans have access to a doctor, a hospital through their own health insurance than ever in the history of the country,” Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra tells NPR. After this year’s open enrollment, he adds, “I have no doubt that we'll see another record set of Americans who have health care coverage.”
But this could be the high watermark for enrollment in these plans, depending on who is elected president and whether the next Congress acts to keep extra federal subsidies, which have made the health plans so affordable.
What’s new this year
One group that’s newly eligible for these subsidized marketplace plans is Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals recipients, also known as Dreamers. Secretary Becerra says that an estimated 100,000 DACA recipients are expected to enroll.
“It's a good day for all these folks because for the longest time they've been working [and] paid taxes and not had a chance to get their coverage through the Affordable Care Act — that changes,” he says.
Camila Bortolleto is one of the Dreamers who’s been waiting for this. She came to the U.S. with her family from Brazil when she was nine. She’s now 36, living near Danbury, Ct., and uninsured, since her job with health benefits ended over the summer. That has meant, for example, paying out of pocket at urgent care when a dog bit her a few weeks ago.
“It is stressful,” she says. “I do need to get a checkup. I do need to go to the dentist now. And you never know when a random emergency's going to strike.” She planned to sign up as soon as enrollment opened on Friday.
Also new in 2025 is a rule that allows low income people to enroll in a marketplace health plan at any time of the year, not just during fall’s open enrollment period. That mirrors how enrollment works for Medicaid, the public health insurance program for people with low incomes.
Insurance companies will also have to follow new limits on how long patients should have to wait to get a doctor’s appointment.
“Some marketplace plans have very narrow networks — that means that there are very few doctors or hospitals that the insurance company will pay for you to see, so it could be harder to get an appointment,” Cox explains. “This is one step towards trying to make sure that having health coverage also means having access to health care.”
A consequential election for these health plans
Although health policy has not been a big focus of the presidential race, this whole picture could change depending on the outcome of the November election.
Former president Donald Trump has not campaigned as much — this time — on the problems with the Affordable Care Act, but he did say in the presidential debate he has the “concepts of a plan” for what could replace the law. Vice President Harris says she wants to preserve the law and improve on it.
The makeup of the next Congress could also play a big role in the future of these marketplaces. The extra federal subsidies that have made premiums so affordable will expire at the end of next year, unless lawmakers vote to extend them or make them permanent.
Important dates
Enrollment will be open until Jan. 15 in most states. To get coverage that is ready to go on Jan. 1, 2025, though, people need to sign up by Dec. 15. And Idaho has its own open enrollment period rolling from Oct. 15 to Dec. 15.
There are 17 states that run their own health insurance marketplaces, but everyone can start at HealthCare.gov to find out how to pick a plan in your state.",2024-11-02
NPR,"Trump campaign hack traced to three Iranians seeking to disrupt election, DOJ says","Trump campaign hack traced to three Iranians seeking to disrupt election, DOJ says
The Justice Department on Friday unveiled criminal charges against three Iranian hackers employed by Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corp. for targeting and compromising the electronic accounts of Trump campaign aides and others.
The indictment alleges the hacking is part of Iran's effort to erode confidence in the U.S. electoral process ahead of the November presidential election.
Attorney General Merrick Garland, speaking at a press conference on Friday, said the U.S. government is tracking various plots by Iran to harm American officials, including former president and current Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
""These hackers impersonated US government officials, used the fake personas they created to engage in spearphishing, and then exploited their unauthorized access to trick even more people and steal even more confidential information,"" FBI Director Christopher Wray said on Friday, according to his prepared remarks.
The FBI had been investigating after the Trump campaign last month said it had been hacked and suggested Iran was involved, without providing specific evidence for that.
The three men are accused of wire fraud; conspiracy to obtain information from protected computers; and material support to a terrorist organization.
Garland said both the Trump and Harris campaigns have been cooperating with the investigation.
The defendants are outside the reach of the U.S. and it’s not clear when, if ever, American authorities may be able to arrest them.
Several technology companies have also been monitoring and reporting on hacking threats to the U.S. from foreign countries, including Iran.
Google Threat Intelligence Group's John Hultquist said Iran's attacks are constantly evolving.
Hackers from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard ""regularly assume the guise of hacktivists or criminals and have increasingly targeted random individuals through email and even text messages,"" he said in a statement.
""Most of this activity is designed to undermine trust in security, and is used to attack confidence in elections in particular.""",2024-09-27

PHOENIX — Both parties are ramping up their efforts to court Native American voters in the final stretch to Election Day.
This demographic could swing the election results in several closely divided states like Arizona.
Native Health, an urban Indian health center, has held several voter registration events across the Grand Canyon state in the run-up to the election.
“I always think that the Native vote in Arizona shouldn't be discounted,” said Walter Murillo, CEO of Native Health. “In such a tight race, I think any marginal or incremental influence that a candidate or issue might have really, really depends on convincing American-Indian voters.”
President Biden only won Arizona in 2020 by about 10,000 votes — less than a 1% margin — in a state where Native Americans make up 5% of the population.
Native Americans have traditionally voted for Democrats, and the Harris campaign is seeking to ensure that pattern continues in 2024.
The Harris campaign on Oct. 2 launched the Native Americans for Harris-Walz coalition, aiming to mobilize tribal leaders, organizations and voters. The campaign dubbed its operations in Arizona, home to 22 federally recognized tribes, the “most expansive tribal organizing program ever in the state,” a campaign official told NPR on Oct. 12, speaking on background to discuss sensitive campaign strategy.
The campaign has already hired over 20 staff members, with plans for more, to focus on the state’s tribal areas. This is the largest Native voter outreach team for a Democratic presidential campaign in the state. Staff dedicated to Native American communities have also been hired in Wisconsin.
The Democratic National Committee on Monday announced a six-figure ad campaign targeting Native voters — dubbed the “I will Vote” campaign — in Arizona, North Carolina, Montana and Alaska, with digital, print, and radio ads with a majority being placed in local and national Native-owned publications. This is their third, and most expensive, Native-focused ad campaign.
Vice President Harris on Oct. 8 received an endorsement from the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe in Nevada, the first-ever endorsement from the tribe in a presidential election, with the tribe citing record funding to tribes and Native American federal appointments.
Tribal leaders and young people in Nevada and Arizona spoke with Harris and her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz last week as they rallied in western swing states.
“It means so much to be back with the Gila River Indian Community,” Harris said, noting that last summer she was the first vice president to visit that tribe, mainly based outside Phoenix. “I strongly believe that the relationship between tribal nations in the United States is sacred — and that we must honor tribal sovereignty, embrace our trust in treaty obligations and ensure tribal self-determination.”
Voters already making their choices
At a powwow in Phoenix, tribal members gathered for an evening of dancing, fry bread and sales.
Kevin Jackson, a member of White Mountain Apache, has “Democracy is Indigenous” flags above his jewelry stand. He has already cast his ballot for Harris.
“I think we need someone in there who's going to help out and help us build our infrastructure because right now it's awful,” Jackson said, noting he hopes to attend the inauguration if she is elected.
Across the park, Charles Quimayousie is making his way through the vendors. A member of the Tohono O’odham tribe, he also hopes Harris wins.
“That wall just feels too prejudiced to me,” Quimayousie said, referring to Trump’s border wall — one of the former president’s signature campaign promises to stem migration into the U.S.
“It's a good thing, but it just turns me away because when they built that, it went right through my reservation, and some of my people are still on that side, so I'm against that all the way,” he said.
Both said their tribes generally would agree with them — though there are members who will support Trump.
Gerel Nells, who lives in Mesa and is Navajo said that between Harris and Trump he prefers Trump.
“I did like the fact that Trump put aside a plan for the missing and murdered Indigenous women of this nation,” he said. However, he has already turned in his ballot for comedian Dave Chappelle.
GOP hopes to stave off Democratic efforts
To the east of Phoenix, across the border in Gallup, New Mexico, members of the Navajo Nation pulled in to set up their booths and shop at the Gallup Flea Market, on a sunny Saturday morning.
Navajo Nation, also known as the Dine, is the largest federally recognized tribe both in terms of enrolled members and geographical land. Its territory spans the state borders of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. Organizers are looking beyond state lines for mobilizing Arizona voters.
“I do feel like the Natives kind of brought it over last time to the Democrat side,” said Ina Noggle, who was tending to the Arizona GOP’s table at the market. She's campaigning for Trump in Arizona.
“We're just out there trying to present the different platforms and what they have been familiar with and explaining to them that the Democrat Party is no longer the party of their grandparents and their parents,” she said. Noggle talks to voters about issues like abortion and energy independence.
Noggle, Halee Dobbins — the RNC’s communications director — and others at the event said they were not asking market-goers to vote for a specific candidate — but rather approached the conversation by talking about values.
“It makes the conversation more fruitful and more productive, honestly,” Dobbins said. “If you talk to the Navajos based on their values, that's where you really get people to feel comfortable talking about who are they going to vote for. You don't want to start with ‘Are you just going to vote for this candidate?’”
She said the Trump campaign has been meeting with Navajo Nation members at markets, rodeos, parades, and other local events, and Arizona GOP ran an ad on tribal radio to urge voters to “vote Republican.” The campaign didn’t share statistics about how much they’re spending on Native voters overall.
As a part of their showing at the flea market, the McKinley County GOP drove about a dozen cars waving GOP flags for Trump, and New Mexican Republican candidates by honking their horns. Some people waved and honked back. Others grumbled at them to get out.
Making inroads
Still, GOP organizers said they have noticed a change.
“Four years ago it was like, we’d get like so many fingers,” said Pablo Martinez, who is the McKinley County GOP chair and joined Arizona organizers at the market. “But it's different now. Like people are coming out of their shells and there’s a little more pride.”
At the stand, market-goers picked up signs and stickers in support of Trump and Senate GOP candidate Kari Lake. Tribal members walking by assured their support.
Democrats had their own presence in the market.
Brenda Hoskie, a member of the Navajo Nation and chair of the McKinley County Democratic Party in New Mexico, said she had organized precincts and others to put up mutton stew stands on Election Day and for early voting, which began last week.
“After people vote, they can eat and give out signs,” she said.
Since the Navajo Nation stretches across both states, she hopes her efforts will shore up Democratic support among the Navajo in Arizona, as well the San Juan Southern Paiute tribes.
“We need to win Arizona. So I'm out there making sure that we are not sitting back,” Hoskie said.",2024-10-14

The manosphere is a sprawling ecosystem of podcasts, YouTubers, message boards, and more aimed at disgruntled men. Now a subset of the manosphere aimed at Black men is exposing cracks in Black voters' steadfast support of Democrats. On this episode, we take a look at how the Black manosphere came to be and wonder: could this loose community of aggrieved dudes swing the election?
