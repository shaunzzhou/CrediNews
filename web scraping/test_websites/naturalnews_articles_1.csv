Natural News,UN report confirms MASS RAPE of Palestinian hostages in Israeli torture camps – NaturalNews.com,"It turns out that Israeli soldiers are doing everything and more that they accused Hamas of doing to substantiate the full-scale invasion and destruction of the Gaza Strip by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).
One key portion of the UN document explains how IDF soldiers ""motivated by extreme hatred towards & a desire to dehumanize the Palestinian people"" are mass raping Palestinian hostages in Israel's torture camps, among other crimes against humanity.
""The Commission documented more than 20 cases of sexual and gender-based violence against male and female detainees in more than 10 military and Israel Prison Service facilities, in particular in Negev prison and Sde Teiman camp for male detainees and in Damon and Hasharon prisons for female detainees,"" the report states.
""Sexual violence was used as a means of punishment and intimidation from the moment of arrest and throughout detention, including during the interrogation and searches.""
(Related: Israel's own war footage is highly incriminating because it shows a ""devastating"" level of civilian harm in Gaza.)
The official claim is that Hamas committed such horrible atrocities on Oct. 7, 2023 that Israel has no choice but to respond with horrible atrocities of its own – an eye for an eye.
One would think that if Israel really stood against what Hamas did, it would behave differently. But instead, Israel has proven to the world that it is no better than Hamas – and is arguably much worse, based on what the UN report found.
Keep in mind that many of the claims made against Hamas, including ""babies backed in ovens"" and ""mass rapes,"" were complete fabrications that Israel made up as justification to turn right around and do those very same things to the Palestinian people as punishment.
Israel's version of justice, at least under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, involves the following crimes against humanity (be warned that the following information is graphic; reader discretion advised):
""Detainees were beaten if they did not comply,"" the UN report states about what happens to non-obedient female Palestinian prisoners. ""In another case, a soldier took off his trousers and pressed his crotch to a detainee's face, saying: 'You are my b----. Suck my d---.""
These are the types of horrific human rights abuses the history books claim have only ever happened to Jews, and specifically during World War II. It turns out that Israel is a perpetrator of these crimes against humanity once you peel back all the political layers to find the truth.
It should be noted further that the UN commission that put together the above-linked report sent nine requests to Israel for information, only to receive no response whatsoever before its publishing.

Natural News,"Zelensky in trouble as Russia captures more settlements, villages on Ukraine’s eastern front – NaturalNews.com","According to the Hungarian financial news outlet Portfolio, two settlements located near the Ukrainian city of Kurakhove, Zolotya Niva and Zorjane Perse – one is located just north of Kurakhove and the other just south – just fell to Russia, though Kiev is reluctant to acknowledge it.
Ukraine's chief of staff hinted that the two settlements were lost when he admitted that the area around Kurakhove ""was the site of the heaviest clashes on the eastern front."" This is a politically correct way of saying that Ukraine is losing the war in the areas that matter.
Russia has been so successful in capturing more villages and settlements on Ukraine's eastern front that Ukrainian forces have been forced to retreat, in some cases. For example, Kiev just lost Ugledar (Vuhledar) to Russia despite having previously defended the ""fortress,"" as Ukraine had been calling it, for two full years.
""The city, which is strategically important, was labeled a 'fortress' by its previous defenders due to its massive tower blocks that rose up from the surrounding plains,"" says the staff of Remix News.
(Related: Did you know that the Zelensky regime is persecuting Christians in Ukraine?)
Another area that recently fell under Russian control is Toreck, which a Ukrainian army spokesman confirmed. Igor Kimakovsky, an adviser to the Russian administration of the Donetsk region, told Russian media that Russian troops ""have penetrated the city center from different directions and now control all high-rise residential buildings.""
Ukrainian military bloggers are admitting much the same about Russia's continued advances. NATO and the West would have everyone believe that Vladimir Putin is losing, but the truth seems to be that Zelensky is the one who is swirling the drain.
Portfolio reported that Ukrainian bloggers ""admitted that the initiative in the region belongs to the Russian army,"" this referring to Russia now controlling Toreck and the areas around it.
In the direction of Siversk, Russian forces have reportedly also captured Verkhnokamyanskoe and Grigorovka, two other former Ukrainian strongholds. Images and video footage are circulating the web showing Russian troops raising their country's flag over the ruins of Grigorovka.
Russian troops have further entered Serebyianka as they battle their way to a full takeover just like they did in Toreck and these other areas of eastern Ukraine.
Ukrainian armed forces have since begun trying to fortify the Dnipropetrovsk region as Russia advances further towards its next targets.
Russian forces are suffering mass casualties the deeper they penetrate into Ukraine, losing about 1,200 troops to serious injuries or death every day, according to Ukraine. Assuming this is true, Russia still has the upper hand against Ukraine, which cannot afford to lose this many troops without losing, as Putin is clearly advancing further and further into Ukraine.
Toreck, by the way, which also goes by the name of Toretsk, was a front-line city for Ukraine ever since 2014. Russia's apparent victory in capturing the city, which included ""completely erasing"" the city's buildings and structures, represents a major blow to Kiev.
""This forces our troops to move around since there is nothing to hold onto in those sectors,"" said Ukrainian military spokeswoman Anastasia Bobovnikova in a statement to Reuters.
""This is a scorched-earth tactic.""
If Russia is able to fully capture the hilltop of Toreck, Moscow will then have the ability to obstruct a major supply line that connects Ukraine's operation rear with Ukrainian forces in the eastern part of the country.
The Russia-Ukraine war seems endless, much like the Israel-versus-the-rest-of-the-Middle East war. Learn more at Chaos.news.

Natural News,Journalist challenges State Department over U.S. foreign policy on Israel: “People are sick of the BS” – NaturalNews.com,"As tensions rise globally, with conflicts ongoing in Ukraine, Gaza and Lebanon, the Biden-Harris administration's approach has been increasingly criticized for its lack of consistency and accountability.
Cosgrove's outburst came in response to what he perceived as a dangerous game of nuclear brinkmanship being played by the U.S. with Russia, particularly as the administration continues to support Ukraine in striking targets deep within Russian territory. This escalation is occurring alongside multiple ongoing wars, with the potential for a broader conflict erupting between Iran and Israel. Despite these rising tensions, the U.S. has persisted in distributing billions in military aid to these conflict zones, exacerbating violence while sidelining calls for negotiations or ceasefires.
During the briefing, Cosgrove questioned Miller about the moral implications of U.S. policies in the Middle East, specifically regarding the conflict in Gaza. He pointedly remarked, ""This administration has financed a genocide in Gaza for the last year, and every day you’re up there denying accountability for it. So, what gives you the right to lecture other countries on their morals?""
Miller's response avoided directly addressing the accusation, focusing instead on maintaining a policy-oriented discussion. He stated that Cosgrove could share his views elsewhere, dismissing the journalist's concerns as outside the scope of the briefing.
The exchange escalated as Cosgrove passionately retorted, ""People are sick of the b------- in here. It [the Gaza conflict] is a genocide. You are abetting it. And you are risking a nuclear war in Ukraine for this proxy war.""
This moment resonated widely on social media, with many praising Cosgrove for his candidness. Users expressed gratitude for his willingness to articulate sentiments that many feel but struggle to voice in public forums.
This confrontation underscores a broader frustration among journalists covering complex international conflicts, particularly those with competing narratives.
Since the renewal of hostilities between Hamas and Israel over a year ago, media coverage has faced scrutiny, with accusations of bias from both pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian perspectives. The ongoing restrictions on international journalists' access to Gaza have further complicated reporting efforts, leading to calls for greater media freedom. (Related: Four columnists quit Jewish Chronicle over Gaza coverage based on ""wild fabrications."")
Rebecca Vincent, director of campaigns at Reporters Without Borders, highlighted the dire situation for journalists working in conflict zones.
""Israeli forces have systematically restricted coverage of Gaza and targeted journalists who take enormous risks to report the truth. This has directly impacted global access to information on the war, which is critical to the public interest,"" she noted.
Vincent emphasized the necessity for journalists to operate freely, asserting that the world has a right to know what is happening in Gaza.
The complexities of these conflicts, combined with government policies and restrictions on the press, have contributed to a growing distrust in mainstream media. Many argue that reliance on official sources has only deepened the divide in narratives, fueling misinformation and confusion among the public.
As Cosgrove's remarks reverberate through online platforms, they reflect a collective yearning for accountability and transparency from those in power. His passionate critique highlights the urgent need for a more honest dialogue about the consequences of U.S. foreign policy, particularly as the stakes continue to rise in an increasingly volatile world.

Natural News,The Corporate Transparency Act — The most aggressive domestic spying program since the Patriot Act – NaturalNews.com,"(Article by Peter McIlvenna republished from TheGatewayPundit.com)
These words reflected the general and growing distrust of the government.
Today, this quote could be reinterpreted to say, “I’m from the federal government, give up your personal data, and as long as you don’t step out of line, we will keep you safe”. Not as snappy but truer today than ever before.
By the end of this year, every citizen in the United States will be required to hand over the personal data of their small business, S-corp, LLC, HoA, Board of Directors, Trustees, Real Estate Holdings, etc., to the Federal Government’s law enforcement database, operated by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCen) under the Department of Treasury. Welcome to the Corporate Transparency Act (CTA).
President Trump saw this act for what it was, just another way for the Federal Government to target the middle class and their political enemies. President Trump vetoed this unconstitutional power grab in 2019, but it’s back.
In an unprecedented act of overreach, the Federal Government is moving to aggressively collect data on all small business owners, who make up the backbone of the U.S. economy, for reasons that seem “murky” at best.
The sole goal appears to be setting up yet another new database of citizens to monitor, observe, and punish. The Feds are moving to implement the CTA at warp speed, and in seeming total secrecy, as the majority of the millions of small business owners in the United States have no idea this law even exists.
By not informing the public, it seems as if FinCEN’s true intent here is to “catch” millions of small business owners in “non-compliance” so that they can be investigated and audited by the Department of Treasury and punished.
Your mandatory compliance is required by January 1st, 2025, or you could face massive fines, and up to 2 years in federal prison.
After President Trump’s veto, it was quietly stuffed back into the pork of the Defense Authorization Act in 2021. And so, without a word to the American public, the largest and most aggressive, warrantless domestic spying program in U.S. history was enacted into law.
Never heard of it? Join the club! Millions of U.S. small business owners have no idea this law exists or that they are required to be in full compliance by January 1, 2025 or they will be subjected to hefty fines of $591 dollars per day.
Failure to self-report to FinCen’s law enforcement database carries up to 2 years in federal prison for being in violation.
As a Brit, I am no stranger to government overreach and tyranny, but I still have a few questions.
My first question is why are U.S. Citizens who have committed no crime – and where no probable cause exists to believe they have committed a crime – being required to self-report into a law enforcement database, solely on the basis that one day they might commit a crime?
There was a very popular movie in 2002 called the “Minority Report.”
The premise, as I recall, is that there is no longer any crime because law enforcement relies on the use of“pre-cogs” to predict who will commit a crime, and then the “pre-crime” bureau goes out to arrest that individual before they ever commit a crime, in order to ensure they don’t commit the crime that they never committed, in the first place. Seems perfectly reasonable?!
So in addition to “defund the police” and the “thought police”, we now have the “pre-crime” police housed under FinCEN at the Department of Treasury. Didn’t the IRS Union, also under the same Department of Treasury, just endorse Kamala Harris for President? What could possibly go wrong?
Does anyone remember the Lois Lerner IRS scandal? The IRS was forced to admit that it, specifically, targeted conservative non-profit groups for added scrutiny, with the intent to punish and/or deny their non-profit status based on the whims of an unelected partisan bureaucracy operating out of the Department of Treasury.
The IRS was, ultimately, forced to admit that it used political partisanship to target Americans, and they entered into a settlement with the non-profit groups they targeted.
Did I mention that no one was ever held accountable or served any jail time for the unlawful targeting by a federal agency of American Citizens on the basis of political affiliation? But you, as a small business owner, will surely go to jail if you fail to comply with the Corporate Transparency Act.
The Corporate Transparency Act is the “for profit” equivalent of the Department of Treasury’s partisan overreach and scrutiny. At that time, non-profits with the word “tea party” and “patriot” were targeted, politically, by the IRS and subjected to further scrutiny and/or outright denial of their 501c3 status.
Under the CTA, say an overtly aggressive anti-second amendment bureaucrat decided to do a word search for “gun”, “firearm”, “patriot”, “freedom” – you get the idea – they would have a ready list of small business owners to target, and potentially investigate and audit, for something as simple as a name. It happened before with conservative non-profits, think it can’t happen again with for profit businesses?
Under the CTA, for profit business entities with fewer than 20 employees and less than 5 million in revenue are in the cross hairs. Yes, you read that correctly, if you make more than 5 million dollars annually, or employ more than 20 full time employees – you are EXEMPT from this invasive self-reporting requirement that could land you in prison.
That means, Blackrock, Amazon, Facebook, Pfizer Apple and ExxonMobil can operate “business as usual”, but “grandma’s donut shop” will be required to show her “paper’s please”, if she wants to make a living.
Business registration and entity creation is, and has always been, handled at the state level through state corporation commissions or like organizations.
Why is the federal government overreaching into a state rights issue and creating a massive federal database in violation of the commerce clause?
This means that even though you are a registered entity at the state level, if you do not self-report and register at the federal level, you will not be able to operate your small business.
Why aren’t the State Attorney General’s weighing in on this issue? I hope that is not a rhetorical question.
CTA is the last nail in the coffin of what remains of the illusion of a “free market” economy in the United States and it is a massive economic surveillance program with little to no discernable oversight.
People are slowly starting to take notice, so there is still time and hope. Just weeks ago the Community Associations Institute filed a lawsuit against the United States Department of Treasury challenging the application of the Corporate Transparency Act.
But the CAI, and other small business owners who have also filed suit, cannot do this alone.
A federal judge in Alabama has already ruled this law “Unconstitutional”, yet the Federal Government continues to move full speed ahead, and with little regard for the Constitutionality of this unprecedented overreach.
More interesting, still, is that the ruling of “unconstitutionality” was ruled to only apply to the plaintiffs in the case, setting a very dangerous legal precedent whereby if you complain you get to keep your Constitutional rights, but if you don’t, you lose them.
Both camps – republicans and democrats – need to weigh in on this before November. This is the most dangerous step the United States has ever taken towards nationalizing small private business ownership under a federal umbrella.
A tactic long practiced and executed by Marxist governments. This needs to be a front and center campaign issue to protect over 33 million small businesses from being destroyed by the Federal government.
Small businesses employ 61.7 million Americans, totaling 46.4% of private sector employees. It’s time to stand up to this blatant attack on state’s rights that seeks to control and/or destroy the economic lifeblood of America.
Every small business owner in America needs to make their voice heard on this issue or it will be too late.

Natural News,Israel’s own footage shows “devastating” civilian harm caused by Gaza air strikes – NaturalNews.com,"Contrary to the claims of the Netanyahu regime, Israel Defense Forces (IDF) are killing an exceptional amount of innocent people in the Gaza Strip with its ""precision"" attacks, validating concerns that Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people.
Airwars analyzed hundreds of video clips released by the Israeli military over the past year showing that Israel's airstrikes in Gaza are not the ""precise campaign"" that Israel claims them to be; they are causing ""devastating levels of civilian harm,"" according to the group, which along with Sky News released a film this week about all this that you can watch below:
(Related: IDF has begun planting Israeli flags in southern Lebanon to claim the territory as part of ""Greater Israel."")
Airwars investigators spent countless hours watching Israeli footage of the airstrikes, geolocating each and every one of them, and tying them to known incidents in which Palestinian civilians had been harmed or killed.
In the first month of the war alone, Israel engaged in 17 airstrike incidents that Airwars determined resulted in civilians being injured or killed. More than 400 Palestinian civilians, more than 200 of which were children, died because of those 17 airstrikes alone.
Keep in mind that those 17 Israeli airstrikes that first month of the war represent just one percent of all the footage that Israel has released over the past year. More than 40,000 Palestinian civilians, many of them children, have died over the past year from Israeli airstrikes.
Airwars director Emily Tripp commented that the video footage in question is basically ""grainy black and white clips with few details [with] captions declaring they were striking Hamas targets.""
""The message they wanted the world to see was one of a precise campaign, a controlled narrative of careful and calculated warfare,"" she added in a statement.
""Even in the strikes the Israeli military itself published footage of – the ones it chose to show the world – we found hundreds of civilians killed. This is yet more evidence that the practices of the Israeli military are leading to unprecedented levels of civilian harm.""
On Oct. 25, 2023, just days after the Hamas attack on October 7, Israel conducted an airstrike on the residential al-Taj tower. Airwars identified at least 101 civilians who were killed as a result, including 44 children and 37 women. Israel claimed the strike was targeting a ""Hamas tunnel,"" but the Netanyahu regime never provided any evidence to back that claim.
Another thing to note is that in many Israeli airstrikes, including the one on the residential al-Taj tower, Israel does not give prior warning to residents to evacuate – this is just what Israel tells the rest of the world it does to try to legitimize mass murder.
The Israeli military declined to be interviewed as part of the Airwars investigation, instead choosing to release a lengthy statement full of denial about the group's ""extremely concerning"" deep look into the matter.
""Many of the accusations and claims presented in the investigation are baseless and constitute speculation, raising concerns about the intent behind the investigation presented,"" the IDF complained about the contents of the investigation and associated film.
Around the time that the International Court of Justice (ICJ) produced allegations of genocide against Israel, the Israeli military suddenly decreased the amount of airstrike footage it released to the world.

Natural News,Iron Dome FAILS as Hezbollah rockets strike northern Israeli settlement – NaturalNews.com,"Israeli authorities are currently investigating the reasons behind this failure, which comes amid escalating tensions along the Israel-Lebanon border. The Israeli military stated that approximately 90 rockets were fired from Lebanon, around 20 of them targeting Kiryat Shmona, resulting in the deaths of two Israelis due to shrapnel.
Sirens were activated due to a false alarm regarding a potential drone attack, further heightening public anxiety. Fire and Rescue Services reported that several buildings caught fire from direct hits, with Incident Commander Chief Reshef Dror Buchnik stating, ""Fires are raging in multiple buildings that sustained direct hits, and firefighters are working to contain the spread while searching for victims."" (Related: Israel’s much-touted Iron Dome is failing catastrophically while IDF armor is systematically destroyed by Hamas fighters.)
This incident follows a significant bombing campaign by Israel in Lebanon that began on Sept. 23 and has killed over a thousand people, including many high-ranking Hezbollah leaders led by Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed on Sept. 27.
Despite this bombing campaign, Hezbollah's rocket and drone attacks against Israel have not ceased, and the group continues to strike various military targets, including major cities like Haifa and Tel Aviv. The group’s ground forces have also effectively repelled ongoing Israeli attempts to enter Lebanese territory.
Since its activation in 2011, the Iron Dome has successfully intercepted thousands of rockets, primarily those launched from the Gaza Strip. On the day of the recent Hezbollah attack, the system was reportedly engaged in intercepting missiles from Iran and may have been overwhelmed by the sheer volume of projectiles.
The Iron Dome consists of multiple batteries equipped with advanced radar systems that detect incoming short-range rockets. Each battery typically includes three or four launchers, with a capacity of 20 interceptor missiles. When a rocket is detected, the system assesses whether it is headed toward a populated area; if so, it launches an interceptor to neutralize the threat. If the rocket is projected to land in an open area, it is allowed to fall, conserving missile resources.
While the Iron Dome is approximately 90 percent effective, it has limitations, particularly when faced with mass rocket attacks, which can overwhelm the system and allow some projectiles to get through.
Each interceptor missile is estimated to cost between $40,000 and $50,000, placing a financial burden on the defense system during sustained conflicts. The United States has played a critical role in supporting the Iron Dome, investing heavily in its development and replenishing its interceptor missiles during times of conflict.
The Iron Dome is part of a multi-layered air-defense strategy that includes the Arrow system, designed to intercept long-range missiles, and David's Sling, which targets medium-range threats like those believed to be possessed by Hezbollah. Both of these systems were developed in partnership with the United States. The older Patriot system, initially used during the First Gulf War to intercept Scud missiles, continues to serve in intercepting aircraft and drones.
To address the Iron Dome's limitations, Israel is advancing the development of the Iron Beam, a laser-based system that aims to intercept short-range threats at a significantly reduced cost. While still in development and not yet operational, the Iron Beam is expected to be a transformative addition to Israel's defense capabilities. Earlier this year, President Biden signed a bill allocating $1.2 billion for the procurement of the Iron Beam.

Natural News,Israeli airstrike hits key border crossing between Lebanon and Syria – NaturalNews.com,"The Israeli military reported targeting Hezbollah positions close to the Masnaa crossing, asserting that the group has been utilizing this vital route to smuggle weapons into Lebanon. This strategic move underscores the ongoing tensions and the multifaceted nature of the conflict, which has seen a dramatic escalation in recent weeks.
The airstrike, which took place on Oct. 4, caused significant destruction to a section of the road, effectively severing vehicle access to the crossing. However, despite the damage, many people are still attempting to make the journey on foot.
Distressing images have emerged showing families navigating over rubble and scrambling through a large crater left by the bombing, desperately seeking to escape the violence. According to figures from the Lebanese government, more than 300,000 individuals have fled to Syria in a span of 10 days, reflecting the overwhelming urgency to leave Lebanon amid the ongoing bombardments.
The airstrike occurred approximately 700 meters from the checkpoint on the Lebanese side and around 5 kilometers from the actual border. Aid workers have voiced concerns about the implications of this destruction, indicating that it not only obstructs the movement of civilians but also severely hampers the delivery of food and humanitarian supplies. (Related: Hezbollah, Lebanese Armed Forces repel Israeli advances in southern Lebanon.)
Matthew Hollingworth, the director of the UN's World Food Program, emphasized that the damage to the road near the Masnaa crossing would disrupt the essential overland transport of goods, which is often the most cost-effective way to deliver commodities into Lebanon. He stressed the critical importance of maintaining alternative routes, particularly those in northern Lebanon, to ensure both the safe passage of people and the influx of humanitarian aid.
Historically, the Masnaa crossing has served as the primary route for individuals moving from Lebanon into Syria and from there onward to Jordan and the Gulf States. This crossing also facilitated travel westward toward Beirut, the capital, which has suffered extensive bombing in recent days. The situation is further complicated by the ongoing conflict, as many residents find themselves caught between the violence in Lebanon and the uncertainty of returning to Syria, where the situation remains volatile.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) stated that the strike specifically targeted a site at the border crossing involved in the transfer of weapons to Hezbollah. Additionally, they claimed to have hit a 3.5-kilometer underground tunnel connecting Lebanon and Syria, though the precise location of this tunnel was not disclosed. In a statement prior to the strike, the IDF labeled the Masnaa crossing as a key conduit for Hezbollah's weapons transfers and accused the group of camouflaging smuggling operations among civilian traffic, calling on Lebanese authorities to conduct thorough inspections of vehicles.
As the violence escalates, many individuals fleeing eastward are Syrian nationals who have been living in Lebanon, returning to their home country to escape the bombardments. One woman from Beirut shared her experience of sending her son back to Syria with others from their neighborhood due to the increasingly perilous conditions in the capital.
In response to the mounting humanitarian crisis, Syria's government announced on Oct. 6 that individuals crossing the border would no longer be required to pay the typical entry fee of $100. This measure aims to facilitate the movement of those seeking refuge and underscores the urgency of the situation.
On the same day as the airstrike near Masnaa, additional strikes targeted areas near Beirut-Rafic Hariri International Airport, which is located close to Dahieh, Hezbollah's stronghold.
The toll of the conflict is staggering. According to Lebanon's public health ministry, 37 people were killed and 151 wounded in ground and air assaults on Oct. 3 alone. Since the fighting erupted in October 2023, over 2,000 individuals have reportedly lost their lives in Lebanon due to Israeli airstrikes.

One of Israel's most outspoken defenders since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas incident, Rapaport is so loved by modern-day Israel that he was recently invited to make his first official stand-up comedian appearance in Israel at the Jerusalem Theatre in West Jerusalem where he reportedly ranted for more than an hour, delivering to the audience what The Jerusalem Post described as ""manic, profane energy.""
Rapaport is wildly foul, in other words. The way he speaks and how he speaks it is pretty much the definition of profane and everything that is not chosen by the Most High as a representative of morality or godliness.
The Jerusalem Post says Rapaport ""came across as sincere and thoughtful before the near-sellout audience, which clearly was staunchly on his side before he uttered a word,"" this despite his constant ""use of four-letter and sometimes 12-letter words"" once he started to run his mouth.
Rapaport also joked about the recent pager attack that the Israeli military launched on Lebanon, telling the audience to turn off their phones ""and if any of you have a pager on them, just leave – right now!"" he bellowed to loud cackling, cheers, and applause.
""You know that study that talks about straight guys getting the same reaction to seeing two males kissing as they get when they see maggots? I get that when I hear Jews talk like this,"" wrote someone on X, formerly Twitter, about how it feels to listen to Rapaport rant.
""If you're the 'master race' then you should have no trouble surviving without American help,"" wrote another. ""Return all the weapons we subhumans designed and built. Return all the money we subhumans gave you. And go your own way.""

Gen. Michael Flynn responded to the above tweet by confirming that the helicopter is, in fact, ""a military aircraft,"" based on his knowledge and expertise.

""Yes they blew tents and supplies around, but I would be [sic] a years salary this was unintentional.""
The United Cajun Navy responded to Perry by explaining that Blackhawk pilots ""are the Top Guns of the rotary wing"" and ""don't lose situational awareness.""
""They don't make mistakes,"" the Cajun Navy added. ""This was not a combat situation, this was a flex. The pilot did what he intended to do. We said what we said.""
Others tried to push the same ideas as Perry to suggest that this fiasco was due to a situational awareness problem rather than malintent, but the Cajun Navy is not budging from what it says definitely happened that day.

Apparently, the same type of thing is happening down in Greenville, S.C., another area that was hit hard by Helene. The man in the following video explains that FEMA helicopters are blocking Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport (GSP) to prevent aid and supplies from reaching Helene victims.
""FEMA came in and halted all that operation,"" the man explains. ""When there's 1,000 of pounds of supplies over there that could be taken, they're just sitting there doing nothing and blocking the runway with however many helicopters.""

Natural News,October 1 marked day one for Brits having to register their backyard chickens with government: All unregistered birds now ILLEGAL – NaturalNews.com,"As of October 1, it is now illegal in the United Kingdom to have chickens on your property that the government does not know exist. Whether you raise them as pets or for food, all chickens, pigeons and birds of prey in England, Wales and Scotland must now be registered with the authorities.
Great Britain's original claim was that all backyard chickens must now be registered with the government because otherwise they will spread avian flu and put everyone at risk. Many now see through this obvious cover story lie.
Under the previous rules, only flocks of 50 or more birds had to be registered with the government's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). Now, the government is demanding to know about even just one single bird on a person's property, even if that bird's eggs are strictly for personal use.
Brits have former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to thank for this egregious new requirement. It was a ""consultation exercise"" conducted by the Sunak regime that ultimately led to the Labour government implementing the new measure.
Less than 3,500 members of the public responded to Sunak's exercise. And of these, only 13 percent expressed support for requiring all individual birds to be registered and tracked by the government.
""There has been an outpouring of frustration that people will have to comply with another level of bureaucracy,"" commented Jane Howorth, who heads up the British Hen Welfare Trust, a group that supports the change but with one worry: that volunteers will be deterred from keeping ""rescue hens"" on their property.
As of now, psittacines and passerines (budgies, parrots, canaries and other similar species) are exempt from the new rule as long as they are kept within a dwelling or inside a dedicated ""bird house"" that has no access to the outdoors.
Every other type of bird, including chickens, must now be registered as part of an annual record-keeping exercise managed by DEFRA. Violators risk being fined £5,000 (€5,989) or imprisoned for six months.
Ironically, the new rule came into effect within a week of the UK being officially declared as bird flu-free.
""So do we unregister the chicken we're having tonight?"" joked someone on X / Twitter about the ridiculous new rule.
""I've been trying to register my flock for two days but my initial email never comes,"" said another. ""I'm going to be ticked if I go to jail for poultry crimes.""
Others joked about how they are registering their frozen chicken pieces and ""chicken breasts in the fridge"" with UK authorities.
""Do you think I need to register the eggs, too?"" one asked mockingly. ""Future chickens?""
Another quoted Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the new rule clearly violates:
""Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food (chickens), clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social etc.""
""What if my chickens identify themselves as cats?"" asked another, jokingly referencing all the LGBT gender dysphoria and perversion being pushed on American society by reckless deviants.
""How will they find out?"" asked another. ""Will they come to count my eggs?""
If We the People let them, the government will take away all our rights and turn us into slaves in order to ""protect"" us – and many would argue this has already happened. Learn more at Tyranny.news.

(Related: Hurricane Helene wrecked the grid across western North Carolina and upstate South Carolina – it could be months before power is fully restored.)
Recalling how things went during Katrina, the man in the above video explains that despite being stationed in San Diego at the time, he was called up and brought to Louisiana within 96 hours, which is not the case for Helene.
There is so much destruction from Helene but most people are unaware of it because there are no news crews in the affected areas to report on it. Instead, the government has taken control of the situation but is not providing the aid that people need.
""The American people should be angry at what our government is doing to this town,"" he says, referring to Asheville. ""There are people hurting here. There are so many people dying.""
""I drove past young kids about five to seven years old. They were brother and sister, and they were looking for their parents. We got them to a church. These young kids don't know where their mom and dad are.""
The biggest roadblock to aid in western North Carolina right now is the Department of Defense (DOD), the executives of which have ""hamstringed"" the military, according to the man. And the man to blame is none other than Alejandro Mayorkas, the Biden regime's head of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).
""If you're angry, you should be,"" he says, ""because this is what our government thinks about us. They're not here to help us. We have to take care of ourselves.""
Local law enforcement is no longer operating like it was pre-Helene, which means many locals are having to self-police. Anyone who knows anything about emergency medical care is also trying to do whatever he or she can to help in lieu of there being actually emergency medical personnel on site.
""You're not here: it is very bad,"" he says. ""We need water. We need food. We need clothes. I'm in a budget motel and I'm very grateful, and I feel somewhat guilty that I have a roof over my head and a shower. And it's right across from the airport.""
One thing is for sure: the people of western North Carolina and upstate South Carolina have a long cleanup road ahead of them. Learn more about the damage at Disaster.news.

Natural News,British MPs of all political stripes call for Israel to be sanctioned over crimes against humanity in Gaza – NaturalNews.com,"A total of 51 MPs so far from seven different political parties backed a motion calling for the Labour government in power to respect the United Nations (UN) General Assembly's 18 September resolution demanding that Israel end its occupation of all Palestinian territories as well as accept the International Court of Justice's (ICJ) advisory opinion that the Israeli occupation violates international law.
Concerning the UN resolution, the United Kingdom's Labour government abstained on the vote. And as of now, there is no official agreement in UK politics that the ICJ's determination concerning Israel's occupation of Palestinian territory is valid.
The new motion ""welcomes that the UN resolution calls on states to comply with their obligations under international law and to take concrete steps to address Israel's lawful presence in the OPT [Occupied Palestinian Territory]."" It further states that the House of Commons ""believes the adoption of this resolution places new obligations on the Government"" and ""calls on the Government to act in support of the UN resolution and ICJ opinion including by ending all military exports to Israel, banning the import of goods from illegal Israeli settlements and revoking the 2030 Roadmap which deepens UK economic, trade and security ties with Israel.""
(Related: Did you hear that Israel's Minister for Social Equality and Women's Empowerment is ""personally proud of the holocaust of Gaza?"")
Most of the British MPs who support the motion are Independents, though there are a few Labour members as well as members of nationalist parties like the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru in Wales who support it also. It was sponsored by a coalition of independent and Labour MPs including Zarah Sultana and Diane Abbott.
All five of the independent MPs who campaigned on a pro-Gaza platform – Jeremy Corbyn, Shockat Adam, Adnan Hussain, Ayoub Khan and Iqbal Mohamed – support the motion, as do Liberal Democrat MP Andrew George and two other Green Party MPs. Not a single conservative MP supports the motion.
The motion was tabled on October 8 and remains an ""early day motion,"" meaning there is no fixed date for it to be debated. In most cases, early day motions do not end up getting signed by ministers.
Along with the motion, some MPs, including Labour MP Olivia Blake, want Foreign Secretary David Lammy to stop selling arms to Israel.
""It is not only a moral but also a legal necessity that the UK halt arms sales and licensing with Israel,"" Blake wrote in a letter to Lammy, adding that she wants the government review into the UK's arms sales and licensing agreements with Israel to be expanded. She also asked Lammy when such a review will actually take place.
The UK is seriously considering imposing sanctions on Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir for callous comments these two made in reference to the Palestinian people.
Smotrich stated this week that starving the civilians in Gaza might be justified as part of Israel's ongoing military campaign while Ben-Gvir called the perpetrators of settler violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank ""heroes.""
""We are looking at that because they're obviously abhorrent comments,"" said UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer.
Even if sanctions are imposed on them, Smotrich and Ben-Gvir have both said that they will not be changing their positions on Gaza.
""They don't scare me and I will continue to act only according to Israel's highest national interests,"" snarled Ben-Gvir in a statement.
""No threat will prevent me from doing the right and moral thing for the citizens of Israel,"" Smotrich also said.

Natural News,Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah reportedly agreed to a ceasefire before he was ASSASSINATED by Israeli military in Beirut – NaturalNews.com,"Bou Habib revealed this in an interview with PBS's Christiane Amanpour, saying: ""He agreed [to a ceasefire]. Lebanon agreed completely, Lebanon agreed to a ceasefire."" The Lebanese government consulted closely with Hezbollah during the negotiations, with Lebanese Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri directly involved in coordinating with the group.
According to Bou Habib, after these consultations, the agreement was communicated to American and French officials, who in turn relayed that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had also approved the ceasefire. ""We informed the Americans and the French [that's] what happened and they told us that Mr. Netanyahu also agreed on the statement that was issued by both presidents,"" Bou Habib added.
The ceasefire plan, which was backed by the U.S., France and several of their allies, called for a 21-day halt in hostilities between Israel and Lebanon to create space for diplomacy and de-escalation. As reported by the Associated Press, the statement from the international coalition read: ""We call for an immediate 21-day cease-fire across the Lebanon-Israel border to provide space for diplomacy."" The plan was seen as a potential turning point in the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, offering a brief window for negotiations.
However, the ceasefire deal appeared fragile from the beginning. U.S. officials clarified that Hezbollah itself would not be a formal signatory to the agreement, although they anticipated that the Lebanese government would coordinate its acceptance of the plan with the group.
Israel was expected to ""welcome"" the proposal, with formal acceptance likely to come during Netanyahu's speech at the United Nations General Assembly later in the week. Despite this expectation, Netanyahu's office downplayed the plan, stating that the ceasefire was merely a proposal and that the prime minister had not officially responded to it. (Related: Hezbollah’s next projected leader is reportedly a hardliner with deep religious, political and familial ties to Iran.)
In contrast, Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, acting as interim prime minister during Netanyahu’s trip to the U.S., rejected the ceasefire outright. Katz vowed that there would be no cessation of hostilities in northern Israel, emphasizing that the Israeli military would continue its operations ""with full force until victory."" He further assured that Israeli citizens who had been evacuated from the northern regions due to the fighting would not return home until the threat from Hezbollah was completely neutralized.
These events have fueled speculation that Israel might have used the ceasefire negotiations as a ruse to lure Nasrallah into Hezbollah's headquarters. Rumors suggest that the Israeli military used the opportunity to drop a devastating bombardment of 85 bunker-buster bombs on Nasrallah's location, killing not only the Hezbollah leader but also dozens of Lebanese civilians in the surrounding area. While Israeli officials have neither confirmed nor denied these allegations, the attack has reignited tensions in the region and has cast a shadow over the possibility of a peaceful resolution.
Hassan Nasrallah, born in 1960 in northern Lebanon to an impoverished family, rose to become one of the most influential and controversial figures in the Middle East. The eldest of nine children, Nasrallah initially studied theology in Iran before joining the Amal Movement, a Shia political and paramilitary organization. He co-founded Hezbollah in the 1980s and after the assassination of its leader, Sayyed Abbas Musawi, by Israeli forces in 1992, Nasrallah took over as the group's chief.
Under Nasrallah’s leadership, Hezbollah evolved into a formidable military force, backed by Iran and boasting a military strength surpassing that of the Lebanese army. Hezbollah's role in pushing Israeli forces out of southern Lebanon in 2000, after an 18-year occupation, cemented Nasrallah's status as a hero in the eyes of many in the Arab world.
His personal losses in the conflict were also significant – his son, Hadi, was killed in combat with Israeli forces in 1997, the same year Hezbollah was designated as a terrorist organization by the United States.

Natural News,Conventional polls show Trump and Harris locked in DEAD HEAT as Election Day nears… they are setting up a STEAL – NaturalNews.com,"The polls, conducted earlier this October among thousands of likely and registered voters, indicate that the high stakes and fierce competition between Trump and Harris is tighter than ever. National polls reveal that Trump is experiencing a resurgence in support, while key battleground state polls show that candidates narrowly lead each other in certain states. (Related: POLL: More voters trust Donald Trump over Kamala Harris on immigration policy and border security.)
For instance, an ABC News/Ipsos poll, conducted from Oct. 4 to 8, shows that Trump significantly closed the gap with Harris. The Democratic presidential candidate holds a narrow lead at 50 percent to Trump's 48 percent among likely voters and 49 percent to 47 percent among all registered voters. Among all adults, excluding those who are unlikely to vote, the race has tightened with only a one-point difference between the two, well within the two-point margin of error.
These numbers mark a substantial gain for Trump since mid-September when a similar poll showed him trailing Harris by five points.
A CBS/YouGov poll, conducted from Oct. 8 to 11, also shows a similar result, with Harris holding a 51 percent to 48 percent lead over Trump among likely voters. This slight edge is just outside the 2.3 percentage margin of error and represents a one-point drop for Harris since September.
Additionally, an NBC poll, conducted from Oct. 4 to 8 among registered voters, shows the candidates tied at 48 percent, with a one-point loss for Harris and a four-point gain for Trump over the past month.
Meanwhile, in key battleground states, polls show that candidates narrowly lead each other.
A Wall Street Journal poll, conducted among voters in the seven key swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, reveals that Trump leads Harris by a razor-thin margin of 46 percent to 45 percent. Trump holds an advantage in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Nevada, while Harris has the upper hand in the remaining four states.
That Trump and Harris are locked in dead heat has been evident in other polls conducted in September.
A Rasmussen poll, conducted among 1,893 likely voters, reveals that Trump narrowly led Harris at 47 percent to 46 percent, leaving three percent undecided and another three percent favoring third-party candidates. Both candidates have strong backing within their parties, with Trump supported by 87 percent of Republicans and Harris by 84 percent of Democrats. Among independents, Trump leads Harris by five points.
Demographically, Trump has an edge among White (51 percent) and Hispanic (52 percent) voters, while Harris is favored by Black voters (67 percent). The two are nearly tied among non-Black minority voters. Harris has substantial support from liberals (87 percent), while Trump holds 74 percent of conservative voters.
Economic factors also influence voter preferences, with higher earners (over $200,000 annually) leaning toward Harris, while Trump is more popular among lower-income voters with annual incomes of between $30,000 to $50,000.
Other polls show similarly close results, with Harris leading slightly in Pennsylvania in a New York Times, Sienna College and the Philadelphia Inquirer poll.
A poll jointly conducted by The Hill and Emerson College also shows Harris leading by a slim margin in Michigan (49 percent to 47 percent) and North Carolina (49 percent to 48 percent). In contrast, the poll shows Trump has a small advantage in Arizona (49 percent to 48 percent), Georgia (50 percent to 47 percent), Pennsylvania (48 percent to 47 percent) and Wisconsin (49 percent to 48 percent). The two candidates are tied in Nevada at 48 percent.

Natural News,Florida House Rep. Richard Rowe Jr. DIED SUDDENLY after wishing death on “anti-vaxxers” – NaturalNews.com,"Former Florida House District 23 progressive Rep. Richard Rowe Jr. is the type who uploaded photos of his COVID-19 Vaccination Record Card from the CDC on social media. He also wished death on people who refused the injections, calling them the derogatory term ""anti-vaxxers"" while going on a profanity-laced Facebook tirade.
""Let me be real clear ... I do not give a **** what happens to anti-vaxxers. I don't,"" Rowe hatefully wrote in a Facebook post during the ""pandemic.""
""Let Darwin do his work. They helped to kill 700,000 Americans. I do not have the pity or tears to spare for any of them. It's all dried up now. Sorry. At this point, I'm just hoping they feel 1/10th of the pain theyve [sic] caused everyone. The kids will be fine. THEY'RE going to suffer. And I ******* well think they've earned it.""
When he posted his signed ""vaccination"" card from the CDC, also to Facebook, Rowe admitted that he views his obedience to the medical police state as morally superior to the ""anti-vaxxers"" who protected their immune systems from Big Pharma's experimental poisons.
""Yeah, I'm mostly here for personal ego,"" Rowe narcissistically wrote. ""Already had COVID last year, so not worried about catching it. But I want to maintain my smug sense of moral and intellectual superiority while making fun of Darwin'd [sic] anti-vaxxers. It's actually pretty noble, really.""
(Related: Back in the summer, pro-vaccine journalist Jane Hansen died suddenly from a brain tumor, this just three years after she proudly announced on social media that she got jabbed with Pfizer's mRNA injections.)
It was all fun and games for Rowe until he ""died unexpectedly,"" according to friend Travis Akers who uploaded a eulogy of sorts for the now-deceased Florida politician.
""He passed away Thursday following a medical episode while walking his dog,"" Akers wrote about what became of Rowe once the ""vaccines"" did their job on his now-decaying remains. ""My thoughts are with the family and loved ones of Richard.""
Rowe was just 41 years old when he passed suddenly. In addition to being a politician in Florida's District 23, Rowe was a truck driver who did not have any children of his own.
""For private people that were lied to about mRNA vaccine poison I feel very bad about the health issues so many are now facing,"" tweeted Ohio attorney Tom Renz about Rowe's death. ""For public officials or influencers that were willfully ignorant or paid to lie it’s much more difficult to feel pity. For jerks like this the best I can do is pray for his family.""
""How many in his district have been injured or killed because of his position and did this guy get any campaign money from people paid to promote this poison? Again – sad – but all I can do is pray for his family.""
On X / Twitter, someone quoted Romans 12:19-21 as a possible explanation for Rowe's sudden death.
""Vengeance is mine, says the Lord. Maybe this is an example,"" this person wrote.
""If he was for the shot and took the shot, he was duped,"" wrote another.
""There was so much fearmongering. I was in the D.C. area during the initial lockdown and there were SWAT teams on the corners near the NIH. Total martial law. If you drove anywhere, you'd be pulled over and questioned. It felt like the world was going to end from communicable disease.""

Natural News,More Americans identify as Republicans than Democrats for the first time in three decades – NaturalNews.com,"This comes from a recent Gallup poll that analyzed the environment surrounding the upcoming election. The survey found the current environment to be very favorable to the Republican Party.
The poll found that 48 percent of Americans identify as Republicans or lean toward the GOP, while only 45 percent identify as or lean Democrat. Furthermore, 46 percent of Americans say the Republican Party is better able to tackle the ""most important problem facing the country,"" while 41 percent think Democrats are doing a better job.
In a statement, former President Donald Trump claimed Gallup's data as a win for his campaign, posting on his social media platform Truth Social: ""The first time since they started keeping track that there are more Republicans than Democrats – and it's solely because of President Donald J. Trump!""
Gallup stated that Americans' party affiliation has had a ""strong"" relationship to previous presidential outcomes. It also noted that Trump won in 2016 when self-identified Democrats outnumbered Republicans by three percentage points, 46 percent to 43 percent.
""Party affiliation and voting are strongly predictive of individuals' vote choices, with the vast majority of identifiers and leaners voting for the candidate of their preferred party,"" Gallup said. ""At the aggregate level, there are typically more Democrats and Democratic leaners than Republicans and Republican leaners in the U.S. adult population. Democrats have won presidential elections in years in which they had larger-than-normal advantages in party affiliation, including 1992, 1996, 2008, 2012 and 2020.""
The issues that Americans presently consider to be the most important ""tend to favor the GOP,"" according to Gallup's Jeffrey M. Jones, including the economy (24 percent), immigration (22 percent), the government (17 percent) and inflation (15 percent).
Gallup analysts reported that ""nearly all"" factors are now indicating a Republican Party victory in November. (Related: POLL: Trump and Harris locked in DEAD HEAT as November approaches.)
Historically, Democrats won the White House when a larger proportion of Americans identified as Democrats. In 1992, when Bill Clinton won his first term in office, 52 percent of Americans identified as or leaned Democrat, compared to around 40 percent who identified with the GOP.
During Clinton's reelection campaign in 1996, the margin was a little lower, with 50 percent of Americans identifying as Democrat and 41 percent identifying with the Republican Party.
In 2000, when George W. Bush landed in the White House, the gap was far closer – similar to the gap between Trump and Hillary Clinton in 2016 – with 48 percent of Americans identifying as Democrats and 43 percent as Republicans. In 2004, the nation was evenly split, with 47 percent identifying as Democrats and Republicans each.
From 2004 onward, the margins between the Democrats and the GOP have stayed fairly close, but the Liberals maintained an advantage. When Barack Obama took the White House, 49 percent identified with the Democrats compared to 41 percent with the GOP. In 2012, the gap closed with 47 percent identifying with the Democrats and 43 percent with the Republicans.
In 2020, 48 percent of Americans affiliated themselves with the Democratic Party and 43 percent with the Republicans.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his security cabinet are saying that a major retaliation strike is imminent, regardless of what Washington thinks about it.
""It is not certain that Washington will agree with us, but it knows that we have to respond,"" an Israeli official familiar with the matter told local media.
(Related: Even though Biden says he is against the idea, Israel is still planning to move forward with more attacks on Iran.)
It is not so much that the Biden regime opposes Israel responding to Iran as it is the White House simply wanting to have more authority over how Israel responds. Washington says it wants better ""alignment"" with Israel before any further attacks are launched.
U.S. deputy secretary Kurt Campbell described what is currently transpiring in the Middle East as ""a moment of peril,"" adding that more communication is needed between the U.S. and Israel on how to proceed.
""I think we recognize as important as a response of some kind should be, there is a recognition that the region is really on a knife's edge, and real concerns about an even broader escalation or a continuing one,"" Campbell said.
Israel is also facing more attacks from Hezbollah in response to Israel's continued attacks on southern Lebanon. As new strikes destroy buildings in central Beirut, Hezbollah is reportedly planning to retaliate by bombarding Tel Aviv with missiles.
Iran, meanwhile, has closed its airspace and diverted all civilian flights as it awaits Israel's response. Tehran's Imam Khomeini International Airport is also said to be shutting down temporarily in anticipation of another Israeli strike.
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian says his country is not at all interested in participating in a war with Israel, but if ""Israel acts against us, we will respond.""
Biden told participants in a recent call with the G7 that his regime is ""discussing with the Israelis what they are going to do.""
""All seven of us agree that they have a right to respond,"" Biden said, referring to Israel. ""We are giving them advice. I will talk to Bibi relatively soon.""
The Biden regime has done next to nothing to even try to help the millions of victims of Hurricane Helene who are still without power, and in some cases water and road access, all throughout the Appalachian. Instead, he is dead-set focused on Israel and its interests.
In case you have not noticed, Israel is almost always the one that provokes its neighbors, who then respond, as Iran and Lebanon are doing, with their own attacks. After that happens, Israel tries to play the victim as if it was the one that was attacked first in order to justify even more attacks.
Quoting Netanyahu, who stated to reporters that ""whoever attacks us, we will attack them,"" a commenter had this to say about Netanyahu's deception:
""Netanyahu conveniently leaving out all the unprovoked attacks he launched on Lebanon, Syria and Iran. Ever the victim.""

(Related: Evidence is already emerging to suggest that Kamala Harris will ""win"" Arizona due to voter fraud.)
Peters herself tweeted links to the data files she compiled that were deleted by the authorities and replaced with fake data files to produce the election result they wanted in 2020.
There are three links' worth of files in her tweet, as well as a link to Tina Peters' website, which contains even more.
Report No. 3 is especially damning in that it shows a duplicate ballot image database was loaded into the system, emptied as a container, and filled with only some batches of ballots and not others.
""It appears to be a smoking gun,"" someone wrote on X / Twitter about these revelations. ""The only way to know if it indicates tampered ballot images is to review the paper ballots, which are surely destroyed by now.""
Report No. 1 also shows that election records required by both state and federal law to be preserved were deliberately destroyed. Further, the certification system used on the voting systems failed to meet federal and state requirements.
""The report suggests further investigation to determine if the failures were due to malicious intent or negligence and what impact this may have had on election security,"" someone added on X / Twitter.
Despite claims by some that Peters and her ""unidentified man"" friend committed a crime by making these backups in the first place, Wendi Strauch Mahoney from UncoverDC.com explains how what Peters and her friend did was actually required by law.
Mahoney's article is extensive, revealing everything there is to know about the case. Peters is now behind bars for the next nine years because of her brave efforts to expose the voter fraud she witnessed in the 2020 election.
Peters' three reports represent ""a meticulous"" and careful study into the various illegal activity that was propagated by the powers that be (TPTB) to effectively steal the 2020 election from Trump.
""The reports include evidence of wireless access, the ability for anyone with access to change vote totals by computer or cellphone, database edits, remote changes to data, security issues with the Microsoft SQL Server, log files that were allegedly not preserved and were allegedly overwritten, and 'uncertified software was installed, rendering the voting system unlawful for use in elections,'"" Mahoney writes.

Asif Merchant entered the country in April and was arrested on July 12 as he prepared to leave the country. It appears that Merchant was the Iranian threat the Secret Service was briefed on before Trump's July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.
According to an X post of Fox's Bill Melugin, Merchant ""was admitted into the U.S. via parole for 'significant public benefit' when [Customs and Border Patrol] encountered him at the airport in [Texas] in April after he flew in from overseas."" The sponsor of his parole ""was the FBI Dallas office, for 'security interests.'""
According to Melugin and the FBI, the Bureau allowed the Pakistani into the country so they could monitor him and build a case.

— Bill Melugin (@BillMelugin_) August 7, 2024
""Merchant was arrested on July 12th, nearly three months after he was admitted into the US. The FBI had eyes on him during this time, and utilized numerous undercover agents, who Merchant thought were hitmen he was hiring,"" Melugin wrote.
According to reports, Merchant was trying to hire assassins to kill Trump on behalf of the Iranian government. He allegedly explained his plot involved multiple criminal schemes: stealing documents or USB drives from a target's home; planning a protest; and killing a politician or government official.
He met with purported hitmen, who were actually undercover U.S. law enforcement officers, in New York. He allegedly told them they would receive instructions on who to kill either the last week of August or the first week of September after Merchant had departed America. He paid them $5,000.
Analysts are now wondering if Thomas Crooks, the attempted assassination suspect who was immediately taken down by Security Service, had been in communication with Merchant or any other people hiring to kill the Republican presidential nominee. News reports indicated that Crooks had multiple cell phones and encrypted accounts communicating with people in other countries.
Meanwhile, former FBI agent Steve Friend also told bestselling author and journalist Lee Smith that it's unusual that Merchant ""was in the country for several months before they executed the arrest."" He also suggested the feds did not have any proof Merchant had connections to the Iranian government or that he had intentions of targeting Trump before he came to America.
""Why would the FBI invent a plot to kill Trump?"" Smith stated. ""By claiming the Iranians are responsible for this effort deflects attention from the fact that the real two would-be assassins, Crooks and Ryan Routh, are Democratic Party supporters. Further, says Friend, it boosts FBI statistics. 'If they had just been aware of some plot and brought it to light then it would have been a disruption of a domestic terrorist plot. But because they arrested him, it's dismantlement, which is a very rare and very valuable statistic.'"" (Related: STAGED: FBI ""stopped"" an alleged assassination plot orchestrated by a suspected terrorist who entered the U.S. via a special permission given by the bureau itself.)
Back in September, Merchant pleaded not guilty to the federal charges alleging he attempted to commit an act of terrorism and murder-for-hire to assassinate Trump.
He was indicted on federal charges in August, after being previously arrested and charged by complaint the month prior. If convicted of the charges contained in the indictment, he faces up to life in prison. He was ordered detained pending trial during the hearing in Brooklyn federal court.
""The Justice Department will not tolerate Iran's efforts to target our country's public officials and endanger our national security,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement following the indictment. ""As this terrorism and murder for hire charges against Asif Merchant demonstrate, we will continue to hold accountable those who would seek to carry out Iran's lethal plotting against Americans.""
The defendant named Trump as a potential target but had not conceived the scheme as a plan to assassinate the former president, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity.
There are no suggestions that Merchant was tied to an apparent assassination attempt on Trump at his Florida golf course, or a separate shooting of the Republican presidential candidate at a rally in Pennsylvania in July.
Iran's mission to the United Nations said in August that the ""modus operandi"" described in Merchant's court papers ran contrary to Tehran's policy of ""legally prosecuting the murder of General Qasem Soleimani,"" an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps commander.

Natural News,"France turns on Israel: “It’s time to stop sending arms to Israel,” says Macron – NaturalNews.com","In a statement, Macron declared that ""it's time to stop sending arms to Israel,"" this move marking a sudden shift away from the West's usual support-Israel-at-all-costs credo. And Macron wants other countries to follow his lead.
""I think that today, the priority is that we return to a political solution, that we stop delivering weapons to fight in Gaza,"" Macron said.
Macron's announcement came almost a year to the day since the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack that prompted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to launch an Old Testament-style crusade against Israel's enemies not only in Gaza but in Lebanon, Iran and elsewhere.
(Related: Israel's next move appears to be to attack Iran's nuclear facilities, which Biden has said he will not back.)
Members of Macron's own political party delivered a scathing rebuke against him for deciding to cut Israel off from deadly weapons, as did Netanyahu who delivered a video statement in condemnation of Macron's move, which you can watch below:
My message to Macron >> pic.twitter.com/BHyh0Fso19
— Benjamin Netanyahu - ?????? ?????? (@netanyahu) October 5, 2024
United Kingdom Defense Secretary John Healey told reporters when asked if he agrees with Macron's decision that he and his country – Great Britain is France's closest military ally – do not, and still plan to send Israel more weapons.
""No: we work a different system,"" were Healey's exact words to the media about the UK's apparently unquenchable support for Israel.
The UK did suspend the sale of certain arms components to Israel after determining that there is a real risk that they are being used in violation of international humanitarian law. The UK is stopping short, though, of imposing a full arms blockade like Macron has.
Macron's arms embargo is something that some lawmakers and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have been calling for ever since it became clear that Israel has no plans of stopping the war until all of its enemies are dead.
Many on X / Twitter expressed criticism towards Netanyahu for his pride and arrogance.
""If you win 'with or without their support,"" let's see you do it without their support,"" one said, challenging Netanyahu to walk the walk he so boastfully talks. ""This video is redundant then and you can stop begging the U.S. and the UK for weapons. Do it without their support as you said. I want to see you try.""
Others took the opposite approach, praising Netanyahu for taking a stand ""against terrorism.""
According to an Israeli official who spoke to Politico.eu on the condition of anonymity, Netanyahu loves being criticized.
""It actually helps him with his core supporters,"" the official said. ""It underlines how he is Israel's champion. That's why he pushes back so forcefully on Macron or others and always will.""
Israel will probably be fine without France's support, seeing as how France is hardly Israel's number-one supporter. That would be the United States, Israel's strongest ally, who sends the most weapons to Israel.
""Feels strange to agree with Macron on something but I'll give credit where credit is due (if they actually follow through),"" wrote someone else on X. ""End the wars and and the support for genocide!""
""69% of arms are from the USA and 30% of arms are from Germany,"" wrote another about where Israel gets most of its weapons. ""France is doing the right thing, though. They should join South Africa's ICJ case along with Spain and all the other countries.""

Natural News,Struggling coalition of gun owners for Harris-Walz has an average of only 8 members per state – NaturalNews.com,"The group, called GIFFORDS Gun Owners for Harris-Walz, is an initiative led by the GIFFORDS PAC, a prominent pro-gun control organization founded by former Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. The coalition, launched on Oct. 3, seeks to rally gun-owning Democrats and pro-gun voters to support Harris and Walz and counter Republican attacks regarding their past stances on gun control issues.
""As a gun owner, I know supporting the Second Amendment and commonsense gun safety policies go hand-in-hand, and so do many gun owners. That's why we're launching GIFFORDS Gun Owners for Harris-Walz,"" Giffords said.
She added that ""gun violence is the number one killer of children and teens in the United States"" and that ""it's affecting Republicans and Democrats alike.""
""That's why the vast majority of gun owners support policies like background checks on all gun sales. Harris-Walz is the only ticket that will support responsible gun ownership and put public safety first. Both Vice President Harris and Governor Walz are gun owners who are committed to saving lives. We must do everything we can to send them to the White House,"" Giffords argued.
The Arizona congresswoman, a well-known figure in the gun control advocacy space, delivered a notable address at the 2024 Democratic National Convention (DNC), speaking alongside her husband, Sen. Mark Kelly. Giffords became one of the most visible advocates for stronger gun control measures after surviving an assassination attempt in 2011.
However, several reports reveal that the group only has around 400 active members across 45 states, with an average of about eight members per state.
This endorsement contradicts Harris' support for different anti-gun legislation.
During her tenure as district attorney in San Francisco, Harris supported Proposition H, a total ban on handgun possession, as well as the sale, manufacture and distribution of all firearms and ammunition within city limits. The proposal, which was struck down after a court ruled that it violated the Second Amendment, required residents, except peace officers, security guards and active military personnel, to surrender their firearms within four months of its passage. (Related: INTEGRITY ISSUE: Kamala Harris distances herself from past far-left stances to win voter support.)
Harris also helped draft the safe-storage bill, a proposal that charged private citizens who failed to store firearms in their homes properly. The bill allowed policemen to inspect legal gun owners at home to check if they properly secure their firearms. The law also required legal gun distributors to submit inventory reports to the police every six months and banned firearms in public housing, even if the owner possessed them legally.
During her short-lived presidential campaign in 2019, Harris also repeatedly advocated for a mandatory buyback program for assault weapons.
But now that she is running again for president, Harris has been separating herself from her previous far-left agenda to win voter support.

Natural News,"Jerusalem Post celebrates how Jews influence the world, naming top Jews in government, media, entertainment and finance – NaturalNews.com","The number-one Jew on the list is Doug Emhoff, the husband of 2024 Democrat presidential contender Kamala Harris. Referring to him as ""the Jewish Second Gentleman,"" the JPost features Emhoff as ""racing to be the first presidential husband.""
Second on the list is Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, another Democrat, followed by billionaire Bill Ackman, whom the JPost highlights for his work on ""battling campus antisemitism.""
U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is fourth on the list, referred to by the JPost as a ""top U.S. diplomat ... (who is) shaking up world events."" Behind him is none other than Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in fifth place, described as being a ""detached prime minister shirking ... responsibility.""
Behind Netanyahu are Rachel and Jon Goldberg-Polin, a Jewish couple and parents who are ""fighting to free Hamas's ... hostages,"" followed by World Jewish Congress head Ronald S. Lauder in seventh place on the list, credited for ""working for peace.""
(Related: Remember when Daily Wire host Andrew Klavan declared that calling Christ the King is ""antisemitic?"")
Several top Israeli war leaders also made the list, including Itamar Ben-Gvir in eighth place for ""shaping Israel's national ... security for better and worse,"" and David Barnea, the Mossad chief who is ""battling ... the Iranian threat.""
Yoav Gallant, who we report about regularly, made No. 10 on the list for being Israel's ""wartime defense chief."" Behind him is Sheryl Sandberg over at Facebook who received 11th place for ""speaking up for the women ... sexually abused by Hamas.""
Mexico's first female and Jewish president, Claudia Sheinbaum, made 12th place on the JPost's list followed by self-appointed Israeli ambassador Sylvan Adams in 13th place and Israeli President Isaac Herzog in 14th place.
Israel Defense Forces (IDF) chief of staff Herzi Halevi received 15th place followed by three of Israel's wartime political leaders who together received 16th place: Bezalel Smotrich, Moshe Arbel and Nir Barkat.
Marc Rowan, a ""philanthropist"" who is ""taking U.S. ... universities to task"" received 17th place followed by former Hamas hostages Amit Soussana and Noa Argamani who are credited as ""former hostages raising awareness ... of Hamas's crimes.""
The list goes on and on to list many powerful people in politics, entertainment, finance and other industries who are both Jewish and influential. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, for instance, is listed in the 22nd spot for being ""a wartime president and role model for ... democracy.""
Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook is another powerful Jew who took spot No. 28 as ""a symbol of Jewish entrepreneurial success.""
Jerry Seinfeld clocked in at No. 29 for being ""a comedian who gets serious on supporting Israel"" while ""Jake Trapper,"" as the JPost mistakenly called CNN lead anchor Jake Tapper, tied with Dana Bash and The Daily Wire's Ben Shapiro in the No. 34 spot for ""Jews in the news.""
Anti-Defamation League (ADL) head Jonathan Greenblatt ranked No. 40, followed by Srulik Einhorn at No. 42, listed as ""the strategic mastermind behind Netanyahu's success.""
""The husband of the vice president is more influential than the secretary of state?"" asked someone on X / Twitter about why Doug Emhoff is No. 1 compared to Blinken as No. 4. Clearly the JPost is gunning for a Kamala presidency starting in 2025.
""Jake, Dana, and Ben are all the same modern-day fascists,"" wrote another, referring to Jake Tapper, Dana Bash and Ben Shapiro who despite appearing on different sides of the political aisle are all working towards the same endgame.

Natural News,Big Government vs. Big Tech: Justice Department outlines proposal to break up Google – NaturalNews.com,"This move aims to dismantle what is described as an illegal monopoly held by Google in the online search sector. A judge had previously concluded in August that Google, which handles 90 percent of internet searches in the U.S., had established this monopoly unlawfully.
The Justice Department has outlined remedies that could dramatically alter the landscape of how information is accessed on the internet by Americans, potentially diminishing Google’s revenue and enabling competitors to expand. These proposed remedies are designed to prevent Google’s historical dominance from expanding into emerging sectors like artificial intelligence. (Related: Trump tells supporters he plans to prosecute Google for rigging election information in favor of Kamala.)
The world's fourth-largest company with a market capitalization of over $2 trillion, Alphabet is under mounting legal pressure from competitors and antitrust authorities.
The department emphasized that effectively addressing the harm caused necessitates “not only ending Google’s control of distribution but also ensuring Google cannot control the distribution of tomorrow.”
Additionally, the Justice Department is considering urging the court to halt Google’s substantial payments to secure its search engine as the pre-installed or default option on new devices. In 2021, Google paid $26.3 billion to various companies, including Apple, to maintain its search engine as the default on devices, which has helped preserve its dominant market position.
Google, planning to appeal, described the proposals on a corporate blog as ""radical"" and ""far beyond the specific legal issues in this case."" The company asserts that its search engine remains a top choice due to its quality and contends it faces significant competition from entities like Amazon. Google also noted that users have the freedom to select alternative search engines.
The Justice Department's efforts also include proposals to forestall Google's control over future technology developments in AI. They may require Google to make its indexes, data and models used for search and AI features accessible to competitors and proposes restrictions on Google’s agreements that could limit other AI firms' access to web content. The department suggests allowing websites to opt out of having their content used by Google to train AI models.
Google warned that these AI-focused proposals might inhibit the industry's growth. The company argued: ""There are enormous risks to the government putting its thumb on the scale of this vital industry – skewing investment, distorting incentives, hobbling emerging business models – all at precisely the moment that we need to encourage investment.""
A detailed proposal from the Justice Department is expected to be submitted to the court by November 20, with Google set to present its counter-proposals by December 20.
In Europe, Google is unlikely to face a breakup order from European Union antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager before she leaves office next month due to the complexity of the case although there is pressure to speed up the process, sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
Reuters reported last month that Vestager is considering an order to end Google's anti-competitive practices in its ad tech business, but will not order a breakup as she had previously warned.
Google earlier this year sought to end the EU antitrust investigation with an offer to sell its advertising marketplace AdX, but European publishers rejected the proposal as insufficient.

Natural News,Georgian Parliament Speaker Shalva Papuashvili signs pro-family bill that would ban extreme LGBT ideology – NaturalNews.com,"In September, the Georgian Parliament voted 84-0 in favor of ""On Family Values and Protection of Minor,"" a bill that would protect society from the pseudo-liberal ideology and the inevitable harmful consequences of extreme LGBT ideology. The legislation would ban same-sex marriages and adoptions by same-sex couples, public displays and support of the LGBT rainbow flag and media depictions of LGBTQ+ relationships and individuals. It would also ban gender alteration procedures and prevent changes to gender designations on official documents.
The ruling Georgian Dream Party provided the necessary votes for its passage. However, the opposition party of Zourabichvili refused to sign the proceedings and returned it to the parliament on Oct. 3. (Related: Georgian MP introduces bill that seeks to ban LGBT propaganda and indoctrination efforts (most of which target youth.))
But the Georgian Dream and its allies in parliament had enough seats to override her opposition. The speaker had five days to sign and publish the law after the president refused. The law will take effect 60 days after publication, more than a month after the crucial Oct. 26 parliamentary elections.
""Today, according to the Constitution of Georgia, I am signing the law 'Protection of Family Values and Minors,' which was not signed by Salome Zurabishvili,"" Papuashvili posted on his official Facebook account on Oct. 4.
""The law, which I am signing, does not reflect current, temporary, changing ideas and ideologies, but is based on common sense, historical experience and centuries-old Christian, Georgian and European values.""
In his Facebook post, Papuashvili also criticized Zurabishvili for her refusal to sign the bill.
""Symbolic that the nominal leader of the homeless and worthless Opposition, who has become a lovable president, refuses to sign a law that protects what is most valuable to a person – family and children. This refusal clearly shows where Salome Zurabishvili stands and where are the anti-national oppositionists hiding behind her, who did not dare to openly express their opinion on this law and shamefully escaped from the hall while voting on the law,"" he wrote.
The speaker also claimed that the legislation reflects common sense and historical experience, despite anticipated criticism from the international community.
""I understand that signing this law will cause criticism from some foreign partners, but we Georgians have never been afraid of others' evaluations when it was our belief, common sense and loyalty to our country and when we saw that civilization currents were cutting the wrong trench. This has gotten us through millennia. This is how we preserve our identity. At the same time, in the same foreign country, we see the spirit of millions of people agreeing with this law,"" he said.
Similarly, Papuashvili stated in September that the collaboration between Georgia and the EU should not involve ""blindly"" following directives. Instead, he advocated for a ""two-way path"" characterized by ""mutual learning, mutual respect and mutual acceptance.""
""Georgia is one of the first cradles of European civilization. We are co-creators of the fact that agriculture, viticulture and the Christian faith were woven into the European identity,"" he said. ""Even today, our rapprochement with the European Union should not be a matter of blindly following instructions, but should be a two-way path – a path of mutual learning, mutual respect, mutual acceptance, [and] not merger and losing [identity].""

Natural News,Firefighters union REFUSES TO ENDORSE Kamala Harris – NaturalNews.com,"Earlier this October, the IAFF's leaders – who represent over 350,000 firefighters, emergency medical personnel, rescue workers and other related emergency services workers across the United States and Canada – narrowly voted against endorsing a presidential candidate by a margin of 1.2 percent. (Related: Mayor of Muslim-majority city in Michigan endorses DONALD TRUMP for president.)
""Today, the IAFF Executive Board, by a margin of 1.2 percent, voted to not endorse a candidate in the 2024 presidential election,"" said IAFF General President Edward Kelly in an official statement on Oct. 3 following the executive board's vote. ""Over the past year, the IAFF took unprecedented steps to hear our members’ views on the candidates and the policy issues that matter most to them.""
""As we have over our 106-year history, the IAFF Executive Board determined that we are better able to advocate for our members and make progress on the issues that matter to them if we, as a union, are standing shoulder-to-shoulder,"" continued the statement. ""This decision, which we took very seriously, is the best way to preserve and strengthen our unity. We encourage our members – and all eligible voters – to get out and make their voices heard in the upcoming election.""
Both vice presidential candidates, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance, made personal appeals to the IAFF during a convention in Boston in August. Harris, whose campaign strategy involves seeking support from unions, also addressed IAFF members at a conference in Washington, D.C. However, these appeals failed to secure the union's endorsement.
This recent decision contradicts the union's choice in 2020 when it endorsed President Joe Biden's candidacy.
This non-endorsement from the IAFF came after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters – representing truck drivers, freight workers and other workers – did the same in September.
""The Teamsters thank all candidates for meeting with members face-to-face during our unprecedented roundtables,"" Teamsters President Sean O’Brien said. ""Unfortunately, neither major candidate was able to make serious commitments to our union to ensure the interests of working people are always put before Big Business. We sought commitments from both Trump and Harris not to interfere in critical union campaigns or core Teamsters industries – and to honor our members’ right to strike – but were unable to secure those pledges.
""This year, no candidate for President has earned the endorsement of the Teamsters' International Union.""
The decision came after an internal poll found that 60 percent of members believed the union should endorse former President Donald Trump compared to 34 percent for Harris and six percent who said they would support another candidate.
""It's a great honor. They're not going to endorse the Democrats. That's a big thing,"" Trump said during a campaign stop in New York City in September. ""Democrats automatically have the Teamsters. They took a vote, and I guess I was at 60 percent or more, and that’s a great honor.""

Natural News,EXECUTION SQUADS: Update to DoD directive expands military authority to use lethal force against American citizens – NaturalNews.com,"DoD Directive 5240.01 is not new, but it did just get an update last month that is rather convenient for those in charge – and deeply upsetting to those who value their constitutional rights. It expands the list of circumstances in which the DoD is allowed to use deadly force while helping civilian law enforcement, potentially paving the way for using such force under a very vague definition of “national security” conditions.
Although directives issued by the DoD tend to pertain to internal policy, in this case, the ramifications could affect every American and potentially even infringe on their constitutional rights under certain circumstances.
This new iteration replaces the 2016 version of the directive, which was largely concerned with collecting intelligence and protecting civil liberties. In the updated version, lethal force can be used where there are imminent threats as long as it follows proper legal frameworks and gains approval from the Secretary of Defense.
Perhaps one of the most worrying aspects of the update is its proximity to the election. With Americans headed to the polls in just six weeks, concerns about election integrity are ramping up, and history has shown us that these concerns are more than justified.
Many wonder if the adjustments to the directive were made with potential civil unrest surrounding any voter manipulation in mind and whether it could result in military intervention should something happen with the election that upsets the masses.
There is also the fact that the Department of Homeland Security has recently broadened its definition of domestic terrorism, with the list of potential threats now including individuals who question election integrity as well as vaccine efficacy and the origins of the pandemic.
In other words, natural health advocates who question the safety of COVID-19 vaccines or future interventions created for other health emergencies could find themselves subjected to potentially lethal force interventions on the pretense of protecting national security due to their classification as potential domestic extremists.
There are a lot of ways this could impact American civil liberties. Will the new definition of national security threats cause some people to be targeted because of their political beliefs? Could the higher degree of military involvement in collecting domestic intelligence violate Americans' privacy? Might the expanded authorities granted by the new directive affect our right to carry out legitimate protests? What impact could it have on civilian oversight of the military?
There are a lot of questions about the huge legal shift seen in this directive and what it may mean for Americans. Unfortunately, we probably won't get answers to them because this directive update has not been covered by the mainstream media and the public is mostly unaware that Americans are slowly losing some of their individual rights in favor of “national security”.

You will notice that Clinton also indirectly shot down Kamala's work as ""border czar"" under Biden by mentioning all the ""chaos"" that has erupted because of America's wide-open southern border.
It is not included in the above clip, but another portion of the same speech from Clinton included references to the illegal alien murder of Lakyn Riley, a young nursing student from Georgia who was brutally slaughtered by one of Kamala's invaders.
(Related: Did you know that Bill's wife Hillary violated federal campaign finance laws but was only ""punished"" with an inconsequential slap on the wrist?)
Clinton's words only affirm that the Great Replacement Theory is real, despite establishment claims that it is ""misinformation."" And Kamala's campaign is suffering the more these ugly truths get out – truths that President Biden is also letting slip.
In many ways, Biden's actions and words in support of Kamala are actually undermining her campaign in much the same way Clinton's words. There is so little good that can be said about Kamala that even when these guys try to praise her, they end up making her look like a blathering fool.
The day after Kamala's ""debate"" with President Trump, Biden was seen wearing a Make America Great Again (MAGA) hat. Biden also told the White House press corps that he and Kamala are ""singing from the same song sheet,"" this after the Kamala campaign tried to distance the candidate from Biden's failures over the past four years, of which she was also a part as vice president.

Natural News,Trump to begin final 2024 campaign push with a historic rally at Madison Square Garden in deep blue New York City – NaturalNews.com,"MSG has been the site of several key Republican conventions, including the Republican National Convention of 2004.
Trump is not new to the idea of a rally at this well-known arena. During an interview in February, he mentioned the possibility, citing changes in New York's political landscape as a motivating factor. Trump expressed confidence that he could garner votes from a broader spectrum of New Yorkers, indicating a focused effort in the state for the upcoming election. In April, he again suggested that a rally at MSG was imminent.
Trump, who recently addressed an observance in Florida commemorating the anniversary of the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel, has attracted substantial crowds whenever he holds rallies in New York.
Last month, approximately 16,000 supporters attended his rally at Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, Long Island. Earlier in the summer, up to 10,000 people congregated at Crotona Park in the Bronx, surpassing the venue's permit limit of 3,500 attendees. Approximately 20,000 Trump supporters are expected to attend the rally at MSG.
The corporate media has expressed alarm at the level of support for Donald Trump at a rally in the Democratic stronghold of the Bronx. They were particularly worried about the ""more diverse crowd"" that turned out to see him. The New York Times noted that many Black and Hispanic voters were spotted at Trump's rally.
The newspaper observed that the ""approving reception for such anti-immigrant messaging was particularly striking in New York, a sanctuary city.""
CNN also reported the shocking appeal Trump had in the Bronx, with one reporter noting that there was ""certainly a bigger crowd than I think Democrats would like to see, particularly given this is one of the bluest counties in the entire country.""
Trump himself was unsure how well he would be received.
""I woke up, I said, 'I wonder, will it be hostile or will it be friendly?'"" he said. ""It was beyond friendly. It was a love fest.""
The Bodega and Small Business Group (BSBG), which represents thousands of bodegas in New York City, has issued a statement backing Trump, slamming Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and hitting out at New York politicians who have ignored the widespread criminality occurring in the city.
""The Bodega and Small Business Group (BSBG)… is honored to host President Donald J. Trump at the Blue Moon bodega in Manhattan where Jose Alba was arrested for simply defending himself and his business against a convicted felon,"" the statement began.

Natural News,Local police in Appalachia say DON’T DONATE TO FEMA: “They are hindering what a lot of people are trying to accomplish” – NaturalNews.com,"""Please do not donate to FEMA,"" Mikey, as he calls himself, says in the video below.

Mikey suggests that people who want to donate send their hard-earned cash to local churches and nonprofit groups instead because they know better how to spend it on people in need.
""Try to find a nonprofit to donate to: a church, a local PD,"" Mikey says. ""A lot of those are taking donations, sheriff's departments.""

The department where Mikey works is one of the local police departments that is ""running a bunch of stuff to the western part of the state,"" he suggests that do-gooders seek out something similar.
""FEMA doesn't understand that these Appalachian people are built differently,"" Mikey says. ""I'm very familiar with them. They are not gonna stand by idly and have government officials tell them what to do.""
""FEMA's playing a game of FAFO because free men don't ask for permission. Again, please donate and help these people out. They need us now more than ever.""
Since FEMA is a federal agency, everyone who pays taxes inadvertently donates via their tax returns. What Mikey is referring to are donations made in excess of what is forced by law – he says to send that money to local sources instead.

Natural News,Whistleblower tells Sen. Josh Hawley that Secret Service is attempting to conceal lapses in Trump protection – NaturalNews.com,"The inability of auditors to review how Secret Service agents were working to protect major presidential candidates – let alone one who was a former president himself – may have prevented the agency from fixing cracks in Trump's security detail, like the one that led to the assassination attempt against him in Butler, Pennsylvania.
Hawley expressed in his letters addressed to Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe and DHS Inspector General Joseph Cuffari his serious concerns about the allegations.
""You have publicly stated that former President Trump is receiving 'the highest level of Secret Service protection' and that 'he's getting everything.' This new whistleblower information troublingly contradicts your public statements,"" Hawley wrote in his letter to Rowe.
Based on the whistleblower's account, Secret Service headquarters allegedly prevented auditors from attending several Trump campaign events.
The intention, as implied by the whistleblower, was to conceal inconsistencies in the level of security given to Trump across different engagements.
""The Secret Service whistleblower alleges that the denial was in order to hide the fact that the former president is not receiving a consistent level of protective assets for all of his engagements,"" Hawley wrote in a letter to Cuffari, stressing the need for transparency and oversight.
The Secret Service has not yet offered a reply to these allegations.
The accusations come in the wake of the July 13 assassination attempt on Trump during a Republican Party presidential campaign event in Butler, Pennsylvania.
In that incident, a 20-year-old gunman named Thomas Crooks managed to shoot Trump in the ear, narrowly missing a fatal shot.
The shooting left one rallygoer, Corey Comperatore, dead and critically injured two other people, James Copenhaver and David Dutch.
Since the Butler incident, Hawley has been collecting whistleblower accounts and investigating probable shortcomings in the Secret Service's handling of security for Trump.
After the attack, Hawley issued a report describing a ""compounding pattern of negligence, sloppiness, and gross incompetence"" that he claims goes back years and ended in the life-threatening incident in July. (Related: Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) releases whistleblower report on first assassination attempt on Trump in Butler: HAVE A LOOK.)
Hawley's concerns have resulted in legislative action, with the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee recently approving his bill which orders the DHS to release all appropriate information regarding both the July 13 assassination attempt and an ensuing incident on Sept. 15.
The Senate Homeland Security Committee last month issued a bipartisan report on its findings after investigating the initial incident.
The report showed that the agent responsible for managing the Counter Unmanned Aircraft Systems (C-UAS) drones called a toll free 888 tech support hotline ""to start troubleshooting with the company"" and there were no backups.
It took many hours to get the drones working with the agent responsible for the drone operations only having three months of experience with the equipment.
The whistleblower's revelations increase pressure on the Secret Service to deal with questions about the competence of its protection for Trump, particularly in the intensified atmosphere of the 2024 presidential campaign.
""You should be aware of these allegations, which indicate that the Secret Service is not in fact cooperating with your auditors and is instead painting a false picture,"" Hawley said, highlighting the need for a complete investigation into the allegations.

Natural News,Preparing for WWIII? Thousands of French soldiers to join military exercise in Romania next year for simulated war with Russia – NaturalNews.com,"According to a report in Politico, the purpose of the exercise is to evaluate how fast they can reach NATO's eastern flank if required, which is essential if Russian President Vladimir Putin launches an attack on an allied NATO country.
""Paris is preparing for a world war. The pro-war French president has already come up with alarming plans in recent months, which could clearly lead to a war between NATO and Russia. As reported earlier, Emmanuel Macron did not rule out sending troops to Ukraine either,"" reported the Hungarian news outlet Magyar Nemzet.
Despite the probable threats of an open conflict with Russia, NATO appears to be getting ready for that probability.
""We used to play war. Now, there's a designated enemy, and we train with people with whom we'd actually go to war,"" said General Bertrand Toujouse, who is in charge of the French army's newly created land command for Europe.
Toujouse added that such military exercises ""are a strategic signal.""
French ground troops in the past few years have undertaken a ""profound transformation"" to prepare for a conflict as fierce as the war in Ukraine. (Related: French official: Paris not ruling out SENDING TROOPS to Ukraine.)
The French army also has fresh marching orders from NATO. It indicated that by 2027, it should be able to deploy a war-ready division within 30 days along with ammunition and supplies.
Top officers explained that moving toward that goal is central to next year's Dacian Spring exercise. The French army will train to send a war-ready brigade to Romania in 10 days which is an intermediary action that, if successful, will confirm France's reliability with NATO allies and set the stage to attain the 2027 objective.
A brigade has between 3,000 and 5,000 soldiers, while a division has from 10,000 to 25,000 combatants. The major challenge is for French troops to reach Romania in such a short time.
""There is still no military Schengen and we need to decisively improve military mobility in Europe,"" General Pierre-Eric Guillot, Toujouse's deputy, said.
The first troop deployment in Romania in 2022 has been hindered by bureaucratic procedures, border control policies and defective trains for transporting military equipment. The affected nations have since worked to remove these problems.
""We may still be hampered by a few customs measures, but we've made a lot of progress in diversifying our routes,"" Guillot said in an interview with media.
Toujouse stated he is confident French troops will pass next year's test.
However, French Army Chief General Pierre Schill warned that to meet the 2027 goal, defense spending needs to maintain the non-binding, seven-year military planning law in France. The defense budget is in a tight spot as France's new government attempts to control the country's deficit.
""I expect the planned resources to be there in full. If there are major changes, at some point we may delay [the 2027 objective], saying that there aren't enough stocks to take them into combat. But that's fiction. That's only a hypothesis,"" Schill said.

Natural News,At least 20 people KILLED in an Israeli airstrike targeting a café packed with civilians – NaturalNews.com,"The airstrike killed two prominent Palestinian militants: Ghaith Radwan, a commander in the Quds Brigades, and Zahi al-Aoufi, a member of Hamas' Qassam Brigades.
Al-Aoufi was reportedly the head of Hamas' organizational structure in Tulkarem and was accused of supplying weapons to terrorist operatives and planning attacks on Israeli settlements, according to Israeli media outlet Yedioth Ahronoth. The Israeli army and the Shin Bet security service claimed in a joint statement that key operatives involved in terrorist activities in Tulkarem were ""eliminated"" in the strike. (Related: Palestinians mutilated, tossed off rooftop by Israeli forces in West Bank’s Qabatiya.)
The Israeli military confirmed launching the airstrike, firing at least one missile at the café in the densely populated Hamam neighborhood of Tulkarem. At the time of the attack, the café was packed with civilians.
According to reports from the WAFA news agency, the scene was one of chaos as civil defense teams and ambulances rushed to Thabet Thabet Government Hospital to treat the casualties.
This assault marks the first time in over two decades that Israeli fighter jets have been used to bomb a city in the West Bank. The last time such a scale of bombardment occurred was during the Second Intifada, a major Palestinian uprising in the early 2000s.
The Palestinian Health Ministry confirmed that among the dead were members of the Abu Zahra family, including Mohamed Abu Zahra, his wife Saja Karoush and their two young children. Eyewitnesses described scenes of devastation, with bodies scattered amid the debris. One survivor, café owner Nimr Fayed, who lost his brother in the attack, recounted the destruction, saying: ""There were bodies strewn on the fences, the utility poles, the roads and under the rubble.""
The strike is part of a broader Israeli military campaign across the West Bank that began on Aug. 28, targeting several cities with airstrikes, raids and assassinations. These operations have left hundreds of Palestinians dead in 2023, including more than 100 children. Tulkarem alone has seen nearly 100 casualties this year, according to United Nations figures.
The Palestinian Authority and other Palestinian groups have condemned the attack, calling it a ""massacre.""
In a statement, the Palestinian Authority held Israel fully responsible for the attack's repercussions. Many Palestinians in Tulkarem remain resolute despite the grief and destruction, with residents vowing to carry on despite the heavy losses. One resident declared: ""We will replace each martyr with 10 new babies. May God give us victory. This occupation's end is certain.""
The attack came hours after a U.S. State Department warning that Israel's escalating military actions in Lebanon could provoke tensions in the West Bank.
Since early October 2023, Israeli forces have intensified their assaults across Gaza, the West Bank and Lebanon, resulting in widespread destruction and the deaths of over 42,500 Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank and nearly 2,000 Lebanese, according to reports.
The Israeli army has increased the use of airstrikes and ground raids in the West Bank over the past two years. Combat helicopters, drones and other military assets have frequently been deployed in densely populated refugee camps, which have been repeatedly raided.
However, the use of fighter jets in the Oct. 3 attack marks a significant escalation. The sheer scale of the bombardment shocked many, including survivors who described scenes of panic as they tried to rescue the wounded from the rubble.
As tensions escalate across the region, international observers and human rights groups have raised concerns about the increasing loss of civilian life and the ongoing violence between Israeli forces and Palestinian militants.

Natural News,Kamala Harris admits she WON’T DO ANYTHING DIFFERENT from Biden – NaturalNews.com,"During an appearance on ABC's ""The View"" on Oct. 8, Harris wanted to present herself as the candidate of change. But unfortunately, she struggled to articulate her answers when she faced repeated questions on a key campaign issue: ""What sets her apart from President Joe Biden?""
In her guesting on ""The View,"" host Sunny Hostin asked the Democratic presidential nominee for the ""biggest specific difference"" between a Harris and Biden presidency.
""Well, we're obviously two different people, and we have a lot of shared life experiences,"" Harris said, sidestepping the question. ""For example, the way we feel about our family and or parents and so on. But we're also different people, and I will bring those sensibilities to how I lead."" (Related: Kamala Harris supported a total handgun ban when she was San Francisco DA.)
However, Hostin pressed further and asked if there were any actions or policies of the Biden administration that she would have handled differently.
""There is not a thing that comes to mind,"" Harris said. ""And I've been part of most of the decisions that have had an impact.""
She then continues to highlight her alignment with the achievements of the Biden administration, pointing to investments in American manufacturing and the capping of insulin costs for seniors at $35 a month. She added that she would expand these policies if elected.
Then later, Harris added that the only thing she would change from anything that Biden has done in the last four years is having a Republican in her cabinet.
""Listen, I plan on having a Republican in my cabinet,"" Harris said. ""You asked me, what's the difference between Joe Biden and me? Well, that will be one of the differences. I'm going to have a Republican in my cabinet because I don't – I don't feel burdened by letting pride get in the way of a good idea.""
These answers were immediately criticized by former President Donald Trump and his vice presidential running mate, Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH).
In a social media post on X, Trump listed issues like the border crisis, the Afghanistan withdrawal, inflation, the war in Ukraine and the recent Hamas attack on Israel as matters Harris should have addressed in the interview.
""Lyin' Kamala, who is being exposed as a 'dummy' every time she does a show, just stated to the degenerates on 'The View' that she would have done nothing different than Crooked Joe Biden, the worst president in the history of the United States,"" said Trump. ""The Lamestream Media doesn't want to pick up the story, the dumb women on the show wish they never asked her the question that led to that election-defying answer, but the internet is going wild.""
Vance also weighed in and stated that Harris' lack of a quick response suggested she had not given enough thought to the policies of the Biden administration.
""You'd think after all this time, all this time of thinking about how she would do things differently from Joe Biden, she would have a well-prepared answer for the interviewers on ""The View."" Well, they ask her one thing you would do differently from Joe Biden, you know what she says, 'I can't really think of anything off the top of my head,'"" Vance said. ""Now, in her defense, I'm not sure she could think of anything off the top of her head, whether about Joe Biden's policies or anything else.""

Natural News,Elon Musk says nobody will bother to try to assassinate Kamala Harris because she’s just another “puppet” of the “machine” – NaturalNews.com,"According to Musk, ""nobody tries to assassinate a puppet,"" the suggestion being that Donald Trump is the real deal because of what happened at his July rally in Butler, Penn.
""She's safe,"" Musk told Carlson. ""Like, they tried to kill Trump twice with actual guns and bullets.""
Musk loves Trump because he has the ""constitution of an ox,"" in his opinion, this despite gorging on ""cheeseburgers and Diet Coke and stuff.""
""I think he [Trump] just inherently has a strong constitution,"" Musk continued, adding that he thinks Trump is of ""sound mind and body and strong backbone"" despite two assassination attempts.
Musk then raised a shocking and disturbing revelation that there has been a 700% surge in illegal immigration to some key swing states over the past 3 years, saying that this election is the ""last election"" if Democrats win.

(Related: Neither Biden nor Kamala has so much as lifted a finger to try to help Hurricane Helene victims – ""There is no government aid. None. Zero,"" say victims.)
After appearing on stage with Trump at the latter's most recent rally in Butler, an image of Musk strangely jumping and hopping around on stage started circulating the internet as a meme. Musk told Carlson that it is ""pretty fun"" for him to be able to be ""all in"" for Trump like this.
Musk also praised himself for speaking at the Butler rally with Trump on stage, all without a teleprompter.
""Wow, amazing,"" Musk said. ""I can talk without a teleprompter. That's crazy.""
Musk fully admits that he is now ""all in the deep end [on Trump]."" Even ""in the hopefully unlikely event that he [Trump] loses,"" Musk has a plan for that too: ""There may be some vengeance on me,"" he told Carlson.
Over the past three years, illegal immigration in several key swing states has surged by 700 percent, according to Musk, who warned that the 2024 election is the ""last election"" if Democrats win.
""These swing state margins are sometimes 10, 20,000 votes,"" Musk said. ""So what happens if you put hundreds of thousands of people into each swing state?""
""When somebody is granted asylum, they are fast-tracked. They can get a green card, and then five years after the green card, they can get citizenship, and they can fully, legally vote. And when they do so, they vote overwhelmingly Democrat.""
By the time 2028 rolls around, there is a pretty good chance that every swing state will have turned completely ""blue,"" creating a permanent Democrat supermajority in America.
Musk would like to see mandatory voter IDs moving forward, which he says will help to address ""fraud in elections.""
""The same people that demanded vaccine IDs if you want to travel or do anything are the same ones who say no voter ID is required,"" Musk said, adding that it is ""literally impossible"" to prove voter fraud if no voter ID is required.
""So, yeah, the purpose of no voter ID is obviously to conduct fraud in elections, obviously,"" Musk said. ""There can be no other explanation.""
Towards the end of his interview with Carlson, Musk said that he might have to purchase ""a significant security team"" for himself in the event that Trump starts slashing federal agencies like he has promised to do.

Natural News,Roger Stone warns Biden executive order could allow Democrats to BLOCK a Trump election win – NaturalNews.com,"The Biden administration recently renewed Executive Order 13848. Initially issued by Trump in 2018, Stone warned that the EO could be used as a possible tool to challenge election results.
Biden extended the order, officially titled the ""National Emergency with Respect to Foreign Interference in or Undermining Public Confidence in United States Elections,"" on Sept. 9.
The White House claims this is a means of tackling continuing threats of foreign interference in the American electoral system.
Biden in his press statement repeated that although no foreign power has directly changed vote counts, the risk of foreign influence remains a serious concern because of the spread of digital and internet-based communication.
""The ability of persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States to interfere in or undermine public confidence in United States elections… continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to national security and foreign policy,"" Biden said in the statement.
Stone argues that the order could be employed as an instrument for the Democrats to challenge or nullify Trump's victory under the claim that ""foreign interference"" has muddied the results of the election, and thus certification needs to be stopped. (Related: HYPOCRISY ALERT: Democrats say they won’t certify election if Trump wins because he’s “dangerous to democracy.”)
Under EO 13848, the president is given wider powers to enforce sanctions on people or entities discovered to be involved in foreign election interference.
While the focus has historically been on foreign actors, Stone's comments indicate that the order could be applied more widely to question domestic outcomes under the pretense of election integrity.
Stone's remarks have triggered debate among Trump supporters, some of whom are worried that the renewal of the order could lead to disputed election results.
Furthermore, many Democrats have already indicated that they may not be willing to certify the election results in the event that Trump wins.
House Oversight Committee Ranking Member Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) has indicated that he would only accept a Trump victory if he believes Trump ""won a free, fair and honest election."" He added that he ""definitely"" does not believe Trump would use ""free, fair and honest means"" to secure victory.
""[Trump] is doing whatever he can to try to interfere with the process, whether we're talking about manipulating electoral college counts in Nebraska or manipulating the vote count in Georgia or imposing other kinds of impediments,"" said Raskin. In 2017, he was one of a handful of Democrats who objected to Trump electors.
""Democrats don't engage in election fraud and election fabrication,"" claimed Raskin.
Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL), who voted to object electors to former President George W. Bush in 2005, said she believes Trump is ""planning"" some ""shenanigans"" to unfairly secure victory in November.
""We would have to, in any election … make sure that all the rules have been followed,"" she said.
House Rules Committee Ranking Member Rep. Jim McGovern (D-MA), who also objected to Trump electors in 2017, said Democrats would only certify a Trump victory ""assuming everything goes the way we expect it to.""
""We have to see how it all happens,"" he added.

Natural News,Trump says NO to federal abortion ban: States should decide the issue for themselves – NaturalNews.com,"""Everyone knows I would not support a federal abortion ban, under any circumstances, and would, in fact, veto it, because it is up to the states to decide based on the will of their voters (the will of the people!),"" Trump wrote on X. ""Like Ronald Reagan before me, I fully support the three [abortion] exceptions for rape, incest and [to protect] the life of the mother.""
""I do not support the Democrats' radical position of late-term abortion like, as an example, in the seventh, eighth or ninth month or, in case there is any question, the possibility of execution of the baby after birth. Thank you for your attention to this matter,"" concluded Trump.
This is in line with Trump's efforts since 2023 to distance himself from the main Republican Party stance regarding abortion. Now, Trump has made it very clear that he opposes any additional federal actions that would either further restrict or liberalize abortion regulations on a national level. (Related: Trump says he’ll VOTE NO on Florida’s pro-abortion amendment.)
Furthermore, Trump has previously stated that he supports allowing women to order abortifacient drugs through the mail, causing dismay among many conservatives.
Trump has also stated that he wants to make the GOP's position on abortion ""less radical"" so as to attract more moderate and independent voters, as well as his desire for the Republican Party's national platform to be rewritten to reflect his desire for the issue to be redirected to individual states.
""I'm not in favor of an abortion ban, but it doesn't matter, because this issue has now been taken over by the states,"" said Trump during his debate last month with Vice President Kamala Harris. ""I wouldn't have to [answer the question].""
While Trump himself has stated his desire to move on from discussing abortion, his wife Melania has joined with more liberal Republicans and come out in support of more rights for women who want abortion.
In a short video promoting her autobiography, Melania expressed her support for the ""individual freedom"" of women, describing it as an ""essential right that all women possess from birth.""
""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body?"" wrote Melania in her book. ""A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.""
While Melania has now become outspoken on the issue of abortion, the former president has reiterated his desire to no longer speak about abortion and to let states handle the matter themselves.
""Women will be happy, healthy, confident and free,"" Trump recently posted on Truth Social. ""You will no longer be thinking about abortion, because it is now where it always had to be, with the states.""

Natural News,"Over 1,300 asylum seekers in the U.K. are pretending to be unaccompanied minors to exploit British migration law – NaturalNews.com","According to the official figures, for the first half of 2024 alone, 1,317 migrants who arrived at the U.K. border disguised themselves as children. This eclipses the combined totals for similar cases from 2017, 2018 and 2019. (Related: Hungary pushes through with plan to bus illegal immigrants to Brussels.)
Among the asylum seekers found falsely claiming their age, 283 came from Afghanistan, 282 from Sudan, 236 from Vietnam and 140 from Eritrea. As unaccompanied minors are far less likely to be deported, age-dispute cases have surged, with 2,122 age-related challenges launched this year alone.
Officials believe human traffickers are encouraging adult men, often without proper documentation, to claim they are underage to increase their chances of receiving asylum, better housing, leniency in legal proceedings and avoiding deportation.
Labour Party Member of Parliament Dame Angela Eagle, serving as Minister of State for Border Security and Asylum, confirmed in a statement that 20 percent of new arrivals in the U.K. falsely claim to be underage to ""get a better deal.""
""There is an issue about identifying correctly those who are children,"" she said in a Labour Party conference in Liverpool on Sept. 30. ""About 20 percent of the people that come across in boats at the moment are claiming they're children. Not all of them are. And so clearly the signal has gone out that if you claim you're a child, then you're going to get a better deal. There are safeguarding issues one way or the other, if you let adults in the children's system, or children in the adults system, that we've got to try to sort out.""
The inability of immigration officials to detect these deceptions has led to deadly consequences. One such case involves Lawangeen Abdulrahimzai, a 22-year-old Afghan national who had already committed two murders in Serbia before arriving in the United Kingdom.
Abdulrahimzai entered Britain in December 2019 by falsely claiming to be a 14-year-old orphan. He was placed in foster care and school in Bournemouth, Dorset, where he proceeded to harass young girls into sending him explicit images of themselves.
Abdulrahimzai was later convicted of fatally stabbing 21-year-old aspiring Royal Marine Thomas Roberts during an altercation outside a restaurant in Bournemouth in 2022.
Other high-profile examples include Parsons Green bomber Ahmed Hassan, who posed as a 16-year-old before detonating a bomb on a London Tube train in 2017, which injured 23 people. His true age remains uncertain, but the judge concluded that he was likely between 18 to 21 years old at the time of the attack.
In another notable incident, Iranian asylum seeker Siavash Shah was found attending a Year 11 class at Stock High School in Ipswich despite being significantly older than other people in his class. A student exposed Shah's age by sharing a photo of him online with the caption: ""How's there a 30-year-old man in our maths class?""
In 2010, Iraqi asylum seeker Rabar Hamad attended secondary school and studied for his General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) despite being 20 years old, four years older than his stated age.

(Related: POLL: American voters trust Donald Trump more than Kamala Harris on firearms issues.)
In line with this, the survey reveals the importance of immigration as a key issue for the 2024 election, with 75 percent of respondents indicating it will be an important factor in casting their votes. Among those surveyed, 51 percent believe immigration policy will be ""very important"" in casting their votes compared to the 23 percent who believe immigration is a less critical issue. Among those who see immigration as very important, 80 percent trust Trump over Harris to handle the issue.
The poll also reveals sharp divisions along party lines. About 77 percent of Democrats back Harris on immigration, compared to the 84 percent of Republicans who trust Trump on the same issue.
Trump also has a significant lead among independents, with 53 percent trusting him more compared to 39 percent for Harris. Additionally, the poll found that 33 percent of Democrats, 71 percent of Republicans and 50 percent of independents view immigration policy as a critical election issue.
Meanwhile, a majority of respondents among racial demographics consider immigration and border security as important factors. Among these groups, 78 percent of white voters, 71 percent of Black voters, 71 percent of Hispanic voters and 69 percent of non-Black minorities indicate that immigration would influence their vote in 2024. The issue also appears to resonate with voters across income levels, with higher-income earners generally leaning toward Harris, while those earning between $50,000 and $100,000 favor Trump.
This result has been evident in other polls. For instance, a Yahoo News/YouGov poll, conducted from Oct. 2 to 4 among 1,714 U.S. adults, revealed that 51 percent of voters generally trust Trump on handling immigration better than Harris, who only garnered 38 percent of support.
Another poll from Marquette University Law School in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, released in the same week also revealed that Trump dominates Harris when it comes to immigration and border security – 49 percent favor Trump, while only 37 percent favor Harris, with eight percent saying they would be the same and six percent saying neither would be good on the issue.
A Fox News survey, conducted from Sept. 20 to 24 among 1,021 Arizona registered voters, also revealed the same: Trump leads Harris by 15 points among Arizona voters when it comes to handling immigration.
These results backed the belief of Trump that voters likely care more about immigration than the economy.
""I really don't agree,"" Trump told the Wisconsin crowd on Oct. 6 in response to polls claiming that the economy will decide the election. ""I know they do all these polls, and the polls say it's the economy, and the polls say very strongly it's inflation, and I can understand it a little bit. To me, it's the horrible people that we're allowing into our country that are destroying our country. And it's the hardest problem to solve too.""

Natural News,Hungary to block $50 billion EU loan to Ukraine until after U.S. election – NaturalNews.com,"The loan, first agreed upon by the leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) during their recent summit in June in Italy, was designed to support Ukraine through profits generated by the billions of dollars worth of Russian assets held by the EU that were frozen in February 2022.
The G7 plan proposed using the interest accumulated over time to cover the loan, which would be repaid to donor countries as profits continue to accrue, rather than seizing the assets directly.
This $50 billion loan plan was crafted to support Ukraine without directly accessing or seizing the $300 billion in Russian assets frozen by Western nations, mostly held in European banks. Instead, the plan relies on the estimated $3.2 billion annual profits generated from these assets.
However, Hungary decided to block the plan due to the conditions of the U.S. for contributing to the loan.
According to EU officials, Washington has stipulated that, for the U.S. to contribute approximately $20 billion to help support Ukraine and fund the loan, the EU must extend its sanctions renewal timeline from six months to three years. If accepted, this change would halve the EU's own contribution to the loan, while the remaining $10 billion would come from other G7 members, including Canada, the United Kingdom and Japan.
Moreover, Varga stated that Europe should delay any sanctions modifications until after the 2024 U.S. presidential election because the two leading candidates, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris hold differing views on Ukraine.
""We believe that this issue, the prolongation of the Russian sanctions, should be decided after the U.S. elections. We have to see in which direction the future U.S. administration is going with this issue,"" the minister said. (Related: Hungary hops off ""NATO Train,"" calls West's escalation of war in Ukraine ""hopeless."")
The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has become a point of contention between Harris and Trump.
Harris, who has been a vocal supporter of Ukraine's sovereignty, is set to continue providing military aid and strengthening alliances between North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) nations, much like what the current administration of President Joe Biden has been doing. Harris even criticized Trump during the presidential debate in September, claiming that if Trump were still in office, Russian President Vladimir Putin ""would be sitting in Kyiv right now.""
""Understand why the European allies and our NATO allies are so thankful that you are no longer president and that we understand the importance of the greatest military alliance the world has ever known,"" Harris said to Trump. ""And what we have done to preserve the ability of [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelensky and the Ukrainians to fight for their independence.""
She also told Trump that Putin is ""a dictator who would eat you for lunch.""
On the other hand, Trump claimed that if he had been in office in late 2021 and early 2022, Russia would not have invaded Ukraine to begin with. Thus, if reelected, he believes he could resolve the conflict quickly.
""I want the war to stop,"" Trump said. ""What I'll do is I'll speak to one, I'll speak to the other, I'll get them together.""

Natural News,‘Spliced’? 60 Minutes under fire for deceptively editing Kamala Harris interview; Trump demands full release – NaturalNews.com,"(Article by Tyler Durden republished from ZeroHedge.com)
When asked by host Bill Whitaker why it seemed like Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn't listening to the United States, Harris originally replied:
""Well Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of, many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region.""
The clip received the standard reaction to Harris feigning intellect:
But in the version that aired, Harris' answer was: ""We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.""

Wow. Here’s what happened. 60Minutes released a preview of the Kamala interview before it aired. Netanyahu word salad clip got dunked on relentlessly.

The Trump campaign has demanded that the network release the full interview.
""On Sunday, 60 Minutes teased Kamala’s highly-anticipated sit-down interview with one of her worst word salads to date, which received significant criticism on social media,"" said Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign's national press secretary. ""During the full interview on Monday evening, the word salad was deceptively edited to lessen Kamala’s idiotic response.""
""Why did 60 Minutes choose not to air Kamala’s full word salad, and what else did they choose not to air?” she asked. “The American people deserve the full, unedited transcript from Kamala’s sit-down interview. We call upon 60 Minutes and CBS to release it.""
Trump also posted about it on Truth Social, writing ""I’ve never seen this before, but the producers of 60 Minutes sliced and diced (“cut and pasted”) Lyin’ Kamala’s answers to questions, which were virtually incoherent, over and over again, some by as many as four times in a single sentence or thought..."" Trump suggested that the network helping Harris may have been a ""major Campaign Finance Violation,"" and is a ""stain on the reputation of 60 minutes that is not recoverable.""
Trump also called for an investigation.
Several have called out the network over the propaganda. Investor Bill Ackman took to X, where he said:
And how could @60Minutes’ manipulation occur without the consent of @KamalaHarris? Let’s not forget she is the Vice President of the United States and she is being asked about our foreign policy in the Middle East and our relationship with the leader of our principal ally in the region.
Thinking about this more, the only plausible explanation is that the Vice President herself and/or her administration found that her original answer, which implied that Israel’s actions in the region were a direct result of the Biden/Harris policy, would harm her campaign and would therefore need to be expurgated from the public record.
In order to execute such a violation of journalistic ethics, I would expect that CBS News CEO Wendy McMahon and possibly Shari Redstone herself would have had to approve the manipulated video.
This is a story worthy of investigative journalism from real journalists. Where are they? Where are the whistleblowers? Or are all of them so ideologically compromised that they are prepared to sacrifice the truth and their integrity in an effort to elect their favored candidate?
Amazing...
This should be the end of 60 Minutes. Literal election interference.
Nor was this the only time. Remember that 60 Minutes (Lesley Stahl) also lied about Hunter's Laptop in October 2020 to help get Biden elected.

Natural News,"Jerusalem Post publishes, then removes, article claiming Israel has biblical mandate to “conquer” Lebanon – NaturalNews.com","Israel's biblical mandate under the Torah, according to the Post between September 25-29, could involve blowing Lebanon to smithereens because the country's borders may not be correct.
""The recent conflict in Lebanon raises the age-old question regarding the northern borders of biblical Eretz Yisrael,"" the now-deleted article reads. ""Where exactly did Hashem define the boundaries, and are we obligated to conquer those areas? Do the mitzvot of terumah and ma'aser apply to those lands as part of Eretz Yisrael, or are they considered outside the borders?""
""The Torah provides clear guidelines regarding the areas we were commanded to conquer when taking possession of the land.""
Last fall, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu used similar language when speaking about how Israel has a mandate, in his view, to ""go and smite Amalek,"" this referring to the people of Gaza who are now under attack by Israel Defense Forces (IDF) – watch the video below:
Netanyahu declaring invasion: ""You must remember what Amalek has done to you, says our Holy Bible""

Since most Christians and religious Jews alike seem to recognize that we are now in the last generation, also known as the end times, talk about ""Greater Israel"" is appearing more and more in the media. The now-deleted Post article is no exception, describing the term in the following way:
""[Greater Israel] is sometimes used in political or religious discussions about the ideal or future borders of Israel, often in the context of messianic or Zionist aspirations. Some interpret it as a call for the re-establishment of Israel's biblical borders. However, the concept varies in meaning, ranging from symbolic or spiritual interpretations to literal geographical claims.""
In short, Greater Israel refers to the biblical boundaries of the Land of Israel as was promised to the Jewish people ""in various parts of the Torah."" It stretches from the ""River of Egypt,"" which some interpret as the Nile or a smaller river in Sinai, all through modern-day Israel, the West Bank, Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Iraq.
""On that day, Hashem made a covenant with Avram, saying: To your descendants, I have given this land – from the river of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates,"" reads a portion of the Torah about the boundaries of Israel.
There is debate about whether or not the mandate is still biblical since the Jews were driven out of the land by God way back when. In this last generation, many Jews have returned to modern-day Israel, which under Netanyahu's leadership seems to be forging on towards achieving Greater Israel.
Everything Netanyahu is doing right now seems to be aimed at bringing about Greater Israel. As the world knows, Israel's neighbors are not going to just give up the land, so more fighting and more war is on the horizon, all funded in part by U.S. taxpayers.
Since the U.S. operates, in many ways, as Israel's military arm, it is expected that soon Israel will expect the U.S. military to help it defeat Lebanon and eventually Iran to bring about Greater Israel.

Natural News,Former Democratic lawmaker Peter Deutsch endorses Trump – NaturalNews.com,"In a press call organized by the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee on Monday, Oct. 7, the anniversary of the Hamas attack, Deutsch officially announced his support for the former president. Deutsch represented South Florida's 20th Congressional District from 1993-2005,
""I feel very comfortable today publicly announcing that I'm endorsing Donald Trump to be reelected as president and I'm planning on voting for him on Nov. 5,"" he said on Monday.
Deutsch, a Jew who divides his time between Florida and Israel, stated that Trump's tough stance on Iran, along with his recent comments advocating for Israel to take action against the nuclear facilities of Iran, contradicts the lenient policies of the Biden-Harris administration.
""Their policies toward Iran make the world a dramatically less safe place,"" Deutsch said during the call. ""It's not just about what is happening in the Middle East. It's literally about the homeland. It's about Israel. Iran, their enemy is not just Israel – their enemy remains the United States. They still want to destroy the United States.""
The former lawmaker argued that the lenient approach of the Biden-Harris administration toward Iran has weakened global security, particularly for Israel and the United States. He also claimed these policies have emboldened Iran. He then compared the current administration and its approach to that of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's appeasement policies before World War II.
Deutsch revealed that he would endorse Trump because of his desire for ""world peace"" and so, he called on Americans to make the same choice.
""For what I believe is the most important job of the president of the United States, which is trying to retain peace in the world, there is an extraordinarily clear choice that I think every American, hopefully, will come to the same conclusion that I have, that President Trump should become the next president the United States,"" Deutsch said. ""I take this decision very, very seriously. I also feel 100 percent comfortable with the decision.""
Deutsch adds to the list of the Democratic Party members who endorsed Trump.
In September, Amer Ghalib, the Democratic and Arab American mayor of Hamtramck, Michigan, endorsed Trump for reelection, thanks to the former president's opposition to more taxpayer funding for new wars.
""President Trump and I may not agree on everything, but I know he is a man of principles,"" he stated, claiming that Trump promised him that he would end the escalating wars in the Middle East if elected as president in November. ""Though it's looking good, he may or may not win the election and be the 47th president of the United States, but I believe he is the right choice for this critical time. I'll not regret my decision no matter what the outcome would be, and I'm ready to face the consequences.""
""For this, and for many other reasons, I announce my support and endorsement for the former, and hopefully, the next president of the United States, Donald Trump,"" Ghalib posted on Facebook on Sept. 22 to officially endorse Trump.
Then-independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also withdrew his campaign and endorsed Trump in a press conference in August. Kennedy explained that polls showed his candidacy would hurt Trump and boost Harris' campaign, so he decided to drop out. Additionally, he claimed that other reasons such as free speech, the conflict in Ukraine and ""a war on our children"" affected his decision.
""These are the principal causes that persuaded me to leave the Democratic Party and run as an independent, and now to throw my support to President Trump,"" said Kennedy at a Trump rally in Phoenix, Arizona, where he joined the former president in front of a cheering crowd.

Natural News,Candidates expected to spend $16 BILLION in 2024 election cycle – NaturalNews.com,"""Spending on the 2024 election cycle started slowly but ramped up significantly when Vice President [Kamala] Harris took over the Democratic nomination,"" said OpenSecrets Research and Strategy Director Sarah Bryner. (Related: Dem strategist: “I’m scared to death” over Kamala’s election chances.)
The total cost of the 2024 federal election is expected to hit $15.9 billion, making it the most expensive in history, according to OpenSecrets.
Adjusted for inflation, this figure will fall short of the amount spent during the 2020 election, but this is largely due to reduced spending on presidential primaries this cycle – as President Joe Biden faced no serious competition in the Democratic race before being replaced by Harris in July following the catastrophic reaction to his performance in the first presidential debate with former President Donald Trump.
Former President Donald Trump also dominated the Republican Party's race, so much so that most of his competition crashed out early on.
""While it may be true that after inflation adjustments, 2024 doesn't exceed the 2020 records, we must also remember that 2020 itself smashed previous records,"" Bryner noted.
So far, outside groups, including super PACs, have spent approximately $2.6 billion on the 2024 federal elections. If current trends continue, OpenSecrets projects outside spending could exceed $5 billion by Election Day.
The top 10 individual donors have contributed $599 million, accounting for just about seven percent of the total federal election fundraising. With less than a month until Election Day, spending is expected to surge further.
""There may be a saturation point where elections can no longer get more expensive, but we haven't reached it yet,"" remarked OpenSecrets Deputy Research Director Brendan Glavin.
The report's release comes amid a tight race between Harris and Trump and will be decided by results coming in from seven key swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
In these top battleground states, Trump leads Harris by 0.2 percentage points, while Harris leads the former president by two points nationally, according to a RealClearPolitics polling average.
Harris and the Democratic Party are projected to raise roughly $1 billion from July through September. The Harris campaign reported having $404 million cash on hand at the end of August, while Trump reported having $283 million at the end of September, federal records show.
The report also found that outside spending is favoring Republicans over Democrats, a change from the 2020 elections when left-leaning groups worked to thwart and outspend Trump's run for a second term. The GOP-aligned super PAC Make America Great Again Inc. has spent over $239 million, while Democratic-aligned super PAC Future Forward has spent over $212 million, federal records show.

Natural News,"More than 200 U.S. hospitals, healthcare facilities perform irreversible transgender procedures on CHILDREN – NaturalNews.com","The latest figures show that more than 200 hospitals and healthcare facilities across the United States offer irreversible transgender procedures to underage kids, defying the leftist claim that minors are not being experimented on by the LGBT body butchers.
The Do No Harm medical nonprofit watchdog group launched a database this week that tracks which hospitals and healthcare facilities offer sex-change surgeries, hormone therapies, and puberty blockers to children. As of this writing, there are 225 facilities on the list.
Do No Harm did the heavy lifting of putting together the database by pairing gender-related transition codes within the medical system to gender-related procedures and prescription codes at the various facilities.
""The database provides conclusive proof that these interventions are happening on children across the country, both hormonal interventions and surgeries,"" commented Beth Serio, a registered nurse who works as Do No Harm's external relations manager.
""We used bulletproof data from insurance claims databases to show that these procedures have been done on children.""
(Related: Speaking of children who are being sexually abused, did you know that the Buzbee law firm out of Texas has identified dozens of child victims of rapper Sean ""Diddy"" Combs?)
After analyzing thousands of insurance claims at hospitals and pediatric facilities across the country, Do No Harm learned that a shocking 14,000 American children had their bodies butchered by the LGBT industry between 2019 and 2023.
""It's a common lie in the trans industry in America that these procedures are very highly reversible, that there's no long-term effects,"" Serio added about the mass deception that influenced these children to destroy their bodies.
""We know that's simply not the case, especially for children who are taking the hormones for a longer period of time. Some of them can have a sterilizing effect on children, especially when taken for a lengthy period of time.""
Of those 14,000 children catalogued, nearly 6,000 of them underwent extreme transgender surgeries while 8,579 were given hormone drugs and puberty blockers that damage the endocrine system, potentially for life.
""We only included data that we could stand behind 100 percent, based on [Do No Harm's] analysis of insurance claims data,"" Serio further explained about how her group put together the database.
""We cannot account for things such as cash or self-pay patients, or a couple of insurance companies who don't report to these databases. As staggering as these numbers are, we're pretty confident that there are even more children that have been impacted by these barbaric treatments.""
Transgender body butchery seems to be a rich people thing, especially when it involves children. American families spent more than $119 million during that same timeframe to ""transition"" their children into LGBT abominations.
At the top of the list for worst-offending facilities is the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, also known as CHOP – the infamous vaccine pusher Paul Offit is an attending physician at CHOP's Division of Infectious Disease, by the way.
CHOP saw 122 child sex-change patients during those years. Five of the children underwent extreme surgeries while 117 are taking hormone-replacement regimens and puberty blockers to try to become another gender.
All in all, CHOP wrote 768 ""gender-affirming care"" prescriptions during that timeframe, all of which totaled nearly $231,000 in submitted charges that ultimately benefit Big Pharma and the sickness-for-profit industry.

Natural News,Israel’s forever wars in the Middle East will pave the way for its demise – NaturalNews.com,"(Article by David Hearst republished from MiddleEastEye.net)
""The Terror of War"" became the iconic image of the Vietnam War.
Today in Gaza and Lebanon, there are so many pictures of burning people, burning tents, bodies piled up on the streets of the Jabalia refugee camp, and dust-encrusted survivors staggering out of the rubble with the lifeless bodies of their tiny children in their hands, but no one even bothers to publish them.
Images of ""The Terror of War"" being committed by Israel in Gaza or Lebanon are not entered for Pulitzer Prizes. Nor do they elicit statements of condemnation or disgust from US presidents or British prime ministers.
Editors are too frightened.
To suggest that Israel is deliberately killing children in Gaza is a ""blood libel"" that reminds British novelist Howard Jacobson of the pogroms of Jews in 13th century England, sparked by rumours that they were eating the remains of Christian children in Matzah bread.
But Israeli forces are deliberately killing women and children in Gaza and Lebanon and domestic opinion in Israel is urging their soldiers on.
There are no taboos in the debate in Israel about the final solution for north Gaza or south Lebanon. No hang-ups about using words like ""extermination''.
This is what Uzi Raby, one of Israel’s most sought-after experts on the Middle East, does. The senior lecturer at the department of Middle Eastern and African studies at Tel Aviv University said in a TV interview last month: ""Anyone who stays there (north Gaza) will be judged by law as a terrorist and will go through either a process of starvation or a process of extermination.""
Historians in Israel are not a brake on genocidal talk. They are an inciter of it.
Raby said that Israel should not try to solve problems in the region with western kid gloves, adding that Israel’s actions would be flavoured with a ""Middle Eastern spice"".
Benny Morris, who in times long gone was one of the ""new historians"" who uncovered the massacres Israel committed in 1948, now wants to nuke Iran.
The plan these historians are debating has been hatched by former army general, Giora Eiland. Eiland acknowledges that Israel’s tactics in Gaza have failed. He notes that every time they clear an area of Hamas fighters and retreat, Hamas re-appears.
Eiland, however, is no dove.
His solution is not to negotiate. It is to force 400,000 inhabitants in northern Gaza out by giving them the option of starving or dying. This, Eiland says, is the only way to achieve Israel’s war goals.
This plan has received widespread support in the army, the Knesset and the media. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he is studying it.
The Eiland plan is far from blue-sky thinking. Netanyahu tasked his chief aid Ron Dermer last December to consider ways of ""thinning out Gaza"".
Many today believe the army is already implementing parts of it. The army has issued expulsion orders named in the plan as the first stage.
The key to Eiland’s siege tactics, the Netzarim corridor which bisects the strip south of Gaza City, has already been built and armed with its own garrison.
At the time of its construction last February, Shimon Orkabi, the lieutenant colonel responsible for paving the road, said one of the goals of the road was to ""prevent passage from south to north and to control it very precisely"".
Three soldiers serving in Gaza told Haaretz this week that the plan is being implemented.
""The goal is to give the residents who live north of the Netzarim area a deadline to move to the south of the strip. After this date, whoever will remain in the north will be considered an enemy and will be killed,"" a soldier stationed in the Netzarim corridor was quoted as saying.
Indiscriminate killing is also already happening. Into the deadly cocktail of non-stop shelling, quadcopters and dropping 2000-pound bombs on tents, the Israelis have introduced the latest killing machine: exploding robots capable of demolishing six houses in a row.
The residents of north Gaza have already experienced ""explosive demolitions"" of an intensity that is foreign even to them, after surviving a year of all-out war.
A journalist who lives in this hell hole told MEE: ""The bombing has been different than what we previously experienced. The sound of explosive demolition is very loud, like we’ve never experienced before.
""Despite this, the people, particularly in Jabalia, are not budging from their homes. People are saying we would sooner die in the streets than leave to the south because even people in the south have been saying, 'better to die in Gaza City than die in the south', because while death is the same, life in the south is unbearable and much harder than in the north. People are living in tents and humiliation.""
The carnage going on daily is enthusiastically encouraged. The more Palestinians refuse to move, the more voices in Israel, like popular commentator Eliahu Yusian, proclaim there are ""no innocent"" civilians in Gaza.
Professor Avi Bareli, a lecturer on Israel and the history of Zionism at Ben-Gurion University, wrote last October that the Palestinians are ""a society that worships death and raises the banner of murder"".
Raby, Bareli, Morris, and all generals and soldiers committing war crimes against civilians are quite safe.
They do not, and should not, fear arrest the next time they pop over to London’s Oxford Street for their Christmas shopping or check out the latest West End musical, because there is a complete absence of condemnation or pressure from the dwindling number of countries that still support Israel.
The media are silent or complicit. Sky News initially described the soldiers killed in a Hezbollah rocket strike on an army base as ""teenage victims"" in the same headline that referenced the 23 dead in a school struck by Israel in numbers only.
The BBC routinely refers to the civilian death toll as claimed by Hamas, not even by a ""Hamas-run"" health authority. In similar fashion, the BBC’s Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen interviewed Eiland, with studied neutrality, as if his plan was a legitimate view.
Bowen did not suggest, reference or report the fact that there are two major court cases going on about war crimes and genocide at two of the highest courts of international justice, for which the Eiland plan is evidence in chief.
Perhaps Bowen thinks these cases are irrelevant or that the Geneva and Genocide Conventions are dead letters.
Eiland himself devotes energy and time to claiming everything he suggests is legal, but Bowen as a reporter did not challenge him or seek to verify his claims.
Would they have reported the Sabra and Shatila massacre in this way? Exactly the same thing is happening now in Jabalia refugee camp.
Perhaps our public service broadcaster does not think their public service duty obliges them to reference in their reports the enormous, some might say overwhelming, body of international legal opinion which now exists on this subject.
Both the BBC and Sky News routinely blur the distinction between armed combatants and unarmed civilians, which is Israel’s purpose.
Silence buys time. Time buys death.
Biden’s latest attempt to constrain the siege and starvation of northern Gaza follows in the footsteps of his patently failed attempt to stop Netanyahu from occupying Rafah. He threatened then to stop the delivery of heavy bombs.
His threat did not halt arms supplied nor prevent the complete occupation of the border with daily massacres.
The World Food Programme has said that all aid has stopped going into northern Gaza for 16 days, but US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the defence secretary have given them 30 more days before they will begin a ""reassessment"" of military aid.
""From a humanitarian perspective, a 30-day deadline is basically a death sentence, especially for those in northern Gaza that are facing famine,"" Natasha Hall, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), told Middle East Eye.
If Israel’s plan for north Gaza succeeds, south Lebanon will be next. Meir Ben Shabbat, a former national security advisor and chief of staff for national security, said Israel had three options in its current operation in Lebanon: to create a security zone under Israeli military control, to offer a political settlement that would allow Israel to enforce a new regime at the border, or to empty the land along the entire border.
Shabbat favours the last alternative: ""Enforcement in the buffer zone will be carried out by Israel through a combination of intelligence and fire. The advantage of this alternative is the relatively low costs of enforcement and the fact that it can be made possible on a routine basis without serious dilemmas. Another advantage of it is in the message it conveys: the terrorism against Israel caused a loss of territory.""
Attack little Israel and you get Greater Israel.
Just as the early leaders of Israel, Ben Gurion, Levi Eshkol and Yitzhak Rabin used conquest of territory as a means of punishing those who attacked Israel, and defeat and loss of land led to peace deals with Egypt and Jordan, so Israel should now use the same tactic in Lebanon and Syria, it is being urged.
After all, the religious Zionists claim Jerusalem extends all the way to Damascus.
The only response that these plans will elicit is a permanent war on all fronts by every people in the Arab world. Those who stay on the sidelines today, will not do so tomorrow. They will be shamed into action.
It is only a matter of time before this war and these tactics involve every country threatened by Israel’s punishment raids and its ever-expanding borders.
Jordan will in time tear up its peace treaty with Israel. Iran and Hezbollah will fight for their lives.
It took a matter of weeks for the Americans to topple the Taliban in 2001 and 20 more years for the Taliban to force them to leave.
It took three weeks to bring down Saddam Hussein’s statue in Baghdad in April 2003 and eight more years for the US combat role in Iraq to end in ignominy and defeat.
These are not happy precedents for a war, which will involve much more than the toppling of unpopular and repressive regimes in Afghanistan and Iraq. This war will involve the very identity of the Sunni and Shia of Syria, Jordan, Iraq, and Iran.
This war will be existential for everyone involved.
This will be a war to the end. Will it finish in conquest or retreat? I am not sure Israel has the capacity any more to recalculate, to stop and rethink, as it marches blindly towards its own demise.

Natural News,Canada passes controversial bill providing FREE contraception and abortion pills to all – NaturalNews.com,"In February, Canadian Minister of Health Mark Holland introduced Bill C-64, known as ""An Act Respecting Pharmacare.""
In February, Health Minister Mark Holland passed the Bill C-64, also known as an ""Act respecting Pharmacare. The legislation, which passed its second reading in the Senate without any amendments on Oct. 3, seeks to provide universal, single-payer coverage to publicly-funded contraceptives and abortion pills to all Canadians. These contraception drugs and devices, includes oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices (IUDs), hormonal implants, injections and emergency contraception
""Cost can discourage people both from accessing contraception, and from choosing more effective methods of contraception with a higher upfront cost. For example, oral contraceptives have a typical use failure rate of nine percent compared to 0.20 percent for IUDs. Not having affordable access to effective contraception can increase the risk of unintended pregnancies, which can impact life plans such as going to school and advancing in one's career,"" Holland wrote about Bill C-64. The bill eventually received royal assent and became law on Thursday, Oct. 10.
""Everyone in Canada deserves access to the care they need, including to prescription medications,"" Holland said, in response to the decision. ""Our plan for universal access to contraception means reproductive freedom and choice and access to diabetes medication is a transformational step towards improving health outcomes and health equity in Canada. I thank all partners for their contributions to making this happen."" (Related: REPORT: FDA used flawed studies, bad data to justify allowing abortion pills to be sent through the mail by pharmacists.)
Bill C-64 was heavily criticized by various sectors of Canadian society.
In May, Campaign Life Coalition Director of Communications Pete Baklinski accused the government of promoting a ""big lie"" that women cannot control their fertility without contraceptives.
""There's a BIG LIE behind the Trudeau Liberal's free contraception pharmacare plan. PM Trudeau believes that women won't have 'control' over their bodies until they're popping man-made pills every day to suppress their God-given fertility,"" Baklinski wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. ""But women don't need a daily dose of synthetic, cancer-causing hormones to have control over their lives. God has already built into the woman's body an amazing natural cycle of fertility.""
Canadian Chamber of Commerce echoed this statement when it passed the Senate and warned that the bill could impact private insurance coverage.
""The legislation itself, which is only two pages long, raises more questions than answers,"" said Kathy Megyery, who serves as the senior vice president and general manager of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Quebec. ""And this is only the first step of national pharmacare, which will eventually be expanded to cover all categories of drugs. With the valued workplace insurance of 27 million Canadians at risk, not to mention the risk of federal creep into provincial areas, we cannot accept this level of ambiguity from policymakers.""

Natural News,Iranian professor sets the record straight about Israel with speechless Sky News reporter – NaturalNews.com,"Marandi, who is the head of North American Studies at the University of Tehran, has been doing the rounds on TV news channels and making his opinion very clear about the situation in the Middle East. He didn’t mince any words when speaking to Sky News’ Mark Austin about the missile barrage, which was Iran’s biggest-ever attack on Israel and saw them launching nearly 200 ballistic missiles at Israeli missile targets.
When Austin said that Iran’s missile attack was “a humiliation for Iran” because few of their missiles got through, Marandi was quick to go on the offensive, calling Israel a “racist regime.”
“That's a lot of wishful thinking on behalf of you and your colleagues at Sky News. It was a massive blow to the Israeli regime, and the history of this conflict doesn't go back to last year; it is 76 years of ethno supremacism, ethnic cleansing, and this is a racist regime that you support.”
He also said that should Israel be bold enough to strike back, the world will see what Iran is capable of.
“If they dare strike back in Iran, we will hit them much harder next time. We will beat them into submission,” he promised.
A stunned Austin was quick to cut him off at this point, saying Israel will certainly hit back, as any sovereign nation would after being subjected to 180 missiles.
There are plenty of indications that Israel is poised to strike back soon. Israel’s ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, told the media that Israel's war cabinet is already weighing its options and “will not sit idly by.”
“We have shown our capabilities when we fought Hamas in Gaza, and we are fighting Hezbollah in Lebanon. They better look at what happened in Beirut and in Gaza before they start a war with us,” Danon warned.
Marandi pointed out that Iran has numerous underground missile sites that are set up for these situations but added that he thinks Iran will only go after military targets.
“We've hit their bases, and unlike the Israeli regime, which constantly carries out slaughter and genocide and is carrying out a holocaust in Gaza, we struck their military targets because unlike you, we actually care about human rights.”
When asked what would happen if the latest back-and-forth attacks end up leading to a full-on war and Iran were to lose it, Marandi reiterated that Iran is going to hit back much harder next time around and does not think they will lose.
“The head of the Iranian forces says Iran will destroy – target and destroy – all of the Israeli regime’s infrastructure. This was the tip of the iceberg. Iran will lose no war. The Israeli regime will,” he stated.
According to Marandi, the only wild card here is the U.S. response. He believes that if the U.S. gets involved, the Iraqi resistance will fight back against us and destroy our assets in the Persian Gulf.
“U.S. bases will be destroyed, and the oil and gas markets will cause a situation where the global economy will collapse and millions of people will be on the move. So be careful about making stupid mistakes, and the West should stop with its arrogance and get real for once.”
Not surprisingly, Austin didn’t have a response for that and ended the interview.
Although the Biden-Harris administration has been highly supportive of Israel defending itself until now, Biden has been advising Israel to take a proportional response and made it clear that the U.S. opposes a potential strike on Iran’s nuclear sites.
However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at the start of his recent security cabinet meeting: “Iran made a big mistake, and it will pay for it.”

Natural News,"Western North Carolina has world’s richest lithium, purest quartz deposits: Is Hurricane Helene a land grab by DOD to steal these valuable resources? – NaturalNews.com","Some analysts say there was unusual atmospheric activity during Helene's track that appears to have produced such a high voltage that something was able to ""push"" it towards the areas that got hit the hardest. The reason could have to do with all those valuable minerals.
""We have the richest deposit of lithium in North Carolina,"" reported 100percentfedup.com.
""We have a top producer of lithium, Albemarle, getting a $90 million contract from the Department of Defense to create a lithium mine. Guess who has 12 million shares of Albemarle? BlackRock.""
Keep in mind that before Helene hit, many local residents were protesting against the creation of lithium mines in their area. Now, many of those same people's homes and livelihoods are destroyed and Albemarle and competitors like Piedmont Lithium, presumably, now have access to exactly what they want without the citizen protests.
Albemarle, by the way, received a $90 million grant from the DOD to advance its domestic mining operations – operations that locals throughout western North Carolina do not want in their now-destroyed backyards.
""Something doesn't smell right,"" 100percentfedup.com noted. ""Are we seeing a similar tactic that was used in Hawaii for a land grab? Lahaina, Maui 2.0?""

(Related: Much of western North Carolina is now isolated from the rest of the world due to blocked and destroyed roads and damaged energy infrastructure.)
Another valuable mineral that is only found in the mountains of western North Carolina – and specifically in Spruce Pine – is high-purity quartz, a mineral that is critical for the manufacture of semiconductors, solar panels and fiber-optic cables.
According to reports, two facilities that mine and produce high-purity quartz, Sibelco and The Quartz Corp, are both closed indefinitely due to extensive damage caused by Hurricane Helene.
Just last year, Sibelco announced a $200 million investment to double the capacity of its high-purity quartz mining and production operation. That investment is now on the rocks because of what Hurricane Helene did to the area.
All of the company's employees are safe and accounted for, according to a statement. Previously, some of them were ""unreachable due to ongoing power outages and communication challenges.""
""Please rest assured that Sibelco is actively collaborating with government agencies and third-party rescue and recovery operations to mitigate the impact of this event and to resume operations as soon as possible,"" the company said.
Between the loss of high-purity quartz production and these issues with lithium companies trying to barge their way into communities of western North Carolina that do not want them, it sure does appear as though there is much more than meets the eye pertaining to Hurricane Helene.
It is nothing short of strange, to say the least, that the Biden regime has really been ramping up its efforts to create a battery supply chain here in the U.S. to support its electric vehicle (EV) pipe dreams.
""October surprise,"" one person wrote about the devastation.

Natural News,"Biden-Harris regime has “better things to do” than help victims of Helene, the deadliest hurricane since Katrina – NaturalNews.com","Americans from Florida to North Carolina continue to deal with the devastating consequences of Helene, which is considered the deadliest hurricane to hit the U.S. since Katrina. Unlike Hurricane Katrina, which received non-stop coverage on cable news for weeks, with primetime anchors like Anderson Cooper visiting on location covering stories of human tragedy and government incompetence, Helene's aftermath has received far less coverage.
According to analysts, news about the horrifying damage of Helene has just proliferated on social media. What makes it worse is that there was a lack of government assistance and private efforts from private individuals were more evident.
An account on X even exposed FEMA's instruction to Mission Hospital, a private medical institution, to recover the bodies who were killed because of Hurricane Helene, and even expand the number of fatalities. FEMA people said that this is because they could no longer assist in this operation as their officials are too busy helping illegal migrants at the border. (Related: Too busy helping illegals: FEMA passes responsibility to a private hospital for body recovery post-Helene.)
""Picked up a flight of pediatric medical supplies that were brought in and are going to North Asheville,"" the woman said. ""We were sitting in the private portion of the airport and we got to overhear an awful lot. There was a lot of chatter among the army pilots, the navy pilots, hospital representatives.""
According to the woman, a FEMA executive told people from the hospital that ""it is going to be the morgue center for body recovery of all the fatalities of Helene.""
""So, they told Mission Hospital they are not sending refrigerated trucks,"" she said. ""Whatever fatality numbers you are hearing, add a couple of zeros.""

Meanwhile, critics are calling for the scrutiny of the allocation of emergency resources.
""The victims of this tragedy, like all Americans, have their wealth extracted by Washington to fill the coffers of large federal agencies like FEMA. This same agency, whose nominal priority is to assist Americans in the case of emergency, are already pleading poverty,"" Mises Institute or the Ludwig von Mises Institute for Austrian Economics, a nonprofit think tank headquartered in Alabama, said in an article.
""Of course, these same agencies oversaw the redirection of over a billion dollars in recent years to subsidize migration into the country. The priorities are clear, emergency funds take a back seat to a regime that cares more about new arrivals than the families who lived in this country for generations,"" it lamented.
Senior Advisor to the President and Communications Director Ben LaBolt and Director of Digital Strategy Christian Tom released a White House statement ""debunking the falsehoods"" of news about their Helene recovery efforts.
According to them, several scam artists, bad-faith actors and others who want to sow chaos because they think it helps their political interests, are promoting disinformation about the recovery effort, including ways to access critical and life-saving resources.
They claimed under President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris’s direction, the administration has mobilized ""a robust, intensive and whole-of-government effort to respond to the impacts of Hurricane Helene.""
""This includes extensive pre-landfall preparations, as well as an immediate surge of additional resources and personnel to impacted communities. More than 6,400 Federal personnel are on the ground, and more than $110 million in Federal assistance has been given to survivors, with more to come. We are sparing no resource as we work to ensure communities across the Southeast have prompt access to Federal resources that will enable them to both purchase essential items and begin their road to recovery and rebuilding,"" the Oct. 5 press statement explained.
The release also cited various mainstream and independent news sites that it claimed to be providing false information on the recovery efforts and diverting of disaster funds, including CNN, HuffPost, The Hill, Washington Post, NBC News and WVLT.
""The Biden-Harris administration continues to work via the official White House digital channels to inform the public of the response and recovery efforts to dispel the misinformation being shared, with higher volume on X than other platforms. Updates will continue to be shared about the volume and scope of federal aid being delivered,"" it further claimed.
Meanwhile, Biden said previously that he may ask Congress for a supplemental bill to fund Hurricane Helene relief efforts, suggesting lawmakers may have to return from their lengthy election recess to pass it.

Natural News,WAR CRIMES: UN report accuses Israel of destroying Gaza’s healthcare system – NaturalNews.com,"This is according to the UN Human Rights Council's Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, which emphasized how Israel is ""committing war crimes and crimes against humanity, including extermination, through relentless and targeted attacks on medical personnel and facilities.""
Established by the UN Human Rights Council in May 2021, this three-member commission is releasing its second report since the onset of the current conflict, which was ignited by Hamas's attack on October 7 of last year.
The report also addressed the treatment of Palestinian detainees in Israel, highlighting abuses and allegations of torture and sexual violence perpetrated by both Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups.
Israel has accused the commission of exhibiting ""systematic anti-Israeli bias"" and has outright rejected the findings.
Commission Chair Navi Pillay of South Africa, former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, stated: ""Israel must immediately cease its unprecedented wanton destruction of healthcare facilities in Gaza."" She underscored that such actions threaten the fundamental right to health and have severe long-term consequences for the civilian population.
The report asserts that Israeli security forces have ""deliberately killed, detained and tortured medical personnel while targeting medical vehicles"" and have restricted access for those seeking medical treatment outside Gaza. These actions are characterized as war crimes and as contributing to ""the crime against humanity of extermination."" (Related: Palestinian health ministry shares names of nearly 1,000 health workers killed by IDF in Gaza.)
The commission condemned Israel's actions as having caused ""incalculable suffering"" among child patients, warning that this could lead to the destruction of generations of Palestinian children and, potentially, the Palestinian people as a whole.
Among the incidents highlighted in the report is the killing of Hind Rajab in Jan. 29, 2024, described as ""one of the most egregious cases"" of Israel committing crimes against humanity in Gaza.
Rajab, who was five years old when she was killed, called the Palestinian Red Crescent to plead for help after her family's vehicle came under fire in Gaza City while they were fleeing Israel's assault. Rajab was killed along with six of her family members and two Red Crescent rescue workers sent to find them.
The commission determined that the Israeli Defense Forces' 162nd Division was responsible for these deaths, classifying them as war crimes.
The report also investigated the treatment of Palestinians held in Israeli military detention facilities, finding that thousands, including children, have been subjected to ""widespread and systematic abuse, physical and psychological violence, and sexual and gender-based violence."" This treatment constitutes ""the war crime and crime against humanity of torture, as well as the war crime of rape and other forms of sexual violence.""
Male detainees, in particular, faced severe abuse, including rape and attacks on their sexual organs. Detainee deaths resulting from abuse or neglect are also categorized as war crimes. The report stated that this ""institutionalized mistreatment"" of Palestinian detainees occurred ""under direct orders"" from National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir, fueled by government rhetoric inciting violence and retribution.
Pillay called for accountability and reparations for the ""appalling acts of abuse"" against detainees.

As of this writing, there are more than one million households throughout the Southeast that are still without power due to Hurricane Helene. Nearly 300,000 of those are located in western North Carolina and upstate South Carolina where authorities expect there to be infrastructure problems well into the coming months.
Edwards notified his constituents that 360 power substations in western North Carolina alone ""are out.""
""Many of these substations were completely flooded and Duke Energy is unable to assess the damage until the flooding has lowered, the water has been pumped out, and the equipment is thoroughly dried,"" he said.
There actually would have been backup transformers available to fix all these broken substations had President Biden not just sent off the nation's strategic stockpile of them to Ukraine so Volodymyr Zelensky can use them to advance his interests.
The ballooning artificial intelligence (AI) industry is also snatching up transformers and other similar equipment to build data centers, not to mention all the electric vehicle (EV) nonsense that is similarly funneling much-needed supplies away from the damaged energy grid.
""Distribution transformers are a bedrock component of our energy infrastructure,"" commented National Renewable Energy Laboratory researcher Killian McKenna to PV Magazine about how Big Tech is gobbling up the supplies needed to properly maintain America's energy grid.
""But utilities needing to add or replace them are currently facing high prices and long wait times due to supply chain shortages. This has the potential to affect energy accessibility, reliability, affordability – everything.""

Biden's Lebanon envoy Amos Hochstein, a former Israeli soldier born in Jerusalem, reportedly gave the ""green light"" to Israel to expand its war with Lebanon.""
Hochstein and presidential Middle East advisor Brett McGurk ""privately told Israel that the U.S. would support its decision to ramp up military pressure against Hezbollah.""
In other words, Biden is just a figurehead or puppet, if you will, while Hochstein and others pull the strings behind the curtain, at least on the war front in the Middle East – or as Information Liberation's Chris Menahan puts it:

Ever since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, the world has been served up a much different narrative concerning Israel and its influence over world affairs than the one that was widely accepted before the events of Oct. 7, which in many ways was Israel's 9/11 transition moment.
What was previously an untouchable institution is now at the forefront of the public conversation over the deep state swamp and who is responsible for deepening and widening it to the point that America is a mere shell of what it once was.
For the first time, Americans are beginning to see who really pulls the strings of their government. Hint: It isn't necessarily the people in office who get ""elected"" through the ""voting"" process.
Hochstein is unequivocally an Israeli citizen with an ""Israel First"" mentality. And he is Biden's top dog who calls the shots while the ""president"" lays out for the umpteenth time on the beaches of Delaware tanning and sleeping.
When asked if Hochstein holds dual citizenship with Israel and the U.S., Biden's State Department directed the inquiry to the White House, which would only say that Hochstein is not a dual citizen, though no further elaboration or explanation as to why he is calling the shots for Biden was given.

Natural News,Acting Hezbollah leader warns that more Israelis will be displaced if the IDF pursues its invasion of Lebanon – NaturalNews.com,"Acting leader Sheikh Naim Kassem, assigned to the position following the IDF's assassination of former longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah during an airstrike on Sept. 27, announced in a televised statement on Tuesday, Oct. 8, that Hezbollah would continue to fire rockets deeper into Israel in a bid to displace even more Israelis and deter any further aggression against Lebanon.
Kassem also claimed that Hezbollah's military capabilities were still intact despite the serious damage caused by Israel's indiscriminate airstrikes against southern Lebanon and Beirut.
""We are firing hundreds of rockets and dozens of drones. A large number of settlements and cities are under the fire of the resistance. Our capabilities are fine, and our fighters are deployed along the front lines,"" Kassem said.
Kassem further stated that Hezbollah's top leaders are still leading the conflict, and that the commanders recently assassinated by Israel have all been replaced. ""We have no vacant posts,"" he claimed.
He added that Hezbollah will name a new leader to replace Nasrallah, who was killed while hiding out from Israeli airstrikes in an underground base in Beirut last month. ""But the circumstances are difficult because of the war,"" he said. (Related: Hezbollah's next projected leader is reportedly a hardliner with deep religious, political and familial ties to Iran.)
Hezbollah recently announced the launch of a ""large salvo"" of nearly 100 rockets at major Israeli settlements, including Tel Aviv and the northern city of Haifa. The IDF later confirmed that it detected missiles crossing the border and claimed that it had intercepted most of them.
Meanwhile, the IDF claimed to have killed another senior Hezbollah commander, Suhail Hussein Husseini, in a recent strike on Beirut. Husseini was responsible for managing Hezbollah's headquarters and its logistics and budgetary needs, and allegedly handled weapons transfers between Iran and Hezbollah. Hezbollah has not confirmed Husseini's death.
In addition to the airstrikes, Israel has been carrying out ground attacks on Lebanese territory. The Israeli military said a fourth division – the 146th ""Ha-Mapatz"" Division – is now participating in the invasion.
The Ha-Mapatz Division is composed entirely of reservists and has entered southern Lebanon, increasing the number of Israeli soldiers attempting to occupy Lebanon to over 14,000.
The conflict, which intensified in mid-September, has displaced over one million people in Lebanon and killed more than 1,300, the vast majority of whom are civilians.
Hezbollah began attacking Israeli military outposts along its border with Lebanon in support of Palestinians as the IDF was invading the Gaza Strip. Hezbollah continues to launch dozens or even hundreds of rockets into Israel per day.
In Gaza, where Israel is still operating an intense military campaign, no less than 30 people, along with six children and two women, were killed on Monday, Oct. 7. Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, where the bodies were taken, gave an updated death toll the following day as more bodies were recovered from the rubble.

The Health Ranger also confirmed that the first 10 pallets from his own supplies are now on the ground as well – watch below:
So far, the Savage Operations Center has raised more than $180,000 in a GoFundMe, this as the federal government is simply too busy sending aid to Ukraine, Israel and illegal aliens to care about American citizens who lost their homes and livelihoods.
There is growing speculation that the timing of this disaster is suspicious, especially so close to Election Day and in an area that generally leans ""red"" politically, save for Asheville. Is there a conspiracy afoot or is it all just a coincidence?
""Where is Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Jeff Bezos, Larry Ellison, and the Walmart family?"" one commenter asked. ""Each could donate $1 billion easily.""
""That is a great point but they are not here to help people – they are here to prey on people,"" responded another.
Many people are also furious that the federal government is actually turning private citizens who want to help away from Asheville. The claim is that private rescue operations are ""interfering"" with the work of the government, but people on the ground say the government is not doing much of anything to try to help.
In an official statement, President Biden claimed that 500 troops with ""advanced technological assets"" have been deployed to North Carolina to ""assist with the response and recovery efforts.""
""Fifteen-hundred troops will now support thousands of National Guardsman and federal personnel on the ground,"" Biden said. ""My administration will continue to stand with all impacted by these storms.""
As of this writing, the official death toll exceeds 230 people, making Helene the deadliest hurricane since Katrina in 2005, which killed 1,850 people. And do not forget that Milton is just days away from striking Florida, which will create even more devastation this close to Election Day.

According to Macron, they have created a complex and overly rigid regulatory framework that stifles innovation and hampers growth, especially in the artificial intelligence and defense sectors.
He emphasized how the EU's economic model is already outdated and needs to be revamped. He added that they could no longer depend on the United States to handle the bloc's defense needs. (Related: Hungarian PM Viktor Orban says anti-Russia sanctions will kill EU economy.)
Moreover, he pointed out how the EU's extensive social welfare system has created an unsustainable financial burden.
According to Eurostat, the bloc's main statistical agency, EU governments spent the equivalent of around $3.4 trillion, or 19.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), on various social programs in 2022, with the largest portion allocated to pensions, unemployment benefits and other social transfers. Also, 78 percent of EU citizens believe that public spending on key social policies should increase, with half supporting higher taxes to pay for it.
""It's not sustainable with the social model that we have,"" Macron said.
To compare, the U.S. spent around $3.5 trillion on various social programs in 2023, or about 14- 15 percent of GDP, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.
Macron's latest warning mirrors the recent report by former European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, which described the EU's current economic strategy as an ""existential challenge.""
The European Commission asked the former Italian prime minister a year ago to write a report on how the EU should keep its greening and more digital economy competitive at a time of increased global friction.
According to the nearly 400-page report, the EU needs far more coordinated industrial policy, more rapid decisions and massive investment if it wants to keep up, in terms of economy, with its rivals.
""The situation at the moment is really worrisome,"" Draghi told a news conference in Brussels. ""Growth has been slowing down for a long time in Europe, but we've ignored (it)... Now we cannot ignore it any longer. Now conditions have changed.""
Draghi also said in the report that the bloc needed investment of 750 to 800 billion euros ($829 to $884 billion) per year – about five percent of GDP. This is way higher even than the one to two percent of EU GDP in the Marshall Plan for rebuilding Europe after World War Two.

Natural News,"There are an estimated 745,000 illegals in the U.K. – more than any other country in Europe – NaturalNews.com","This is according to a study by academics from the University of Oxford, who found that more than one in 100 people in the U.K. are living in the country illegally – more than double the 300,000 people believed to be living in France illegally and even more than the approximately 700,000 undocumented migrants residing in Germany.
Senior Researcher on Nationhood Guy Dampier of the London-based think tank the Legatum Institute noted that since Britain is an island nation, it should be harder to get there than anywhere else in the continent. Instead, it has achieved the title of ""illegal migration capital of Europe"" because of, according to Dampier, the country's ""permissive job market and the failure of the authorities to guard our borders.""
Before the new study was released, nearly 1,000 migrants crossed the English Channel on small boats in just one day – a record high for this year. There was an average of 57 illegals on each of the 17 boats that crossed, and four migrants lost their lives attempting the perilous journey. (Related: UK government doubles down on threats to those involved in immigration protests.)
And on the same day these figures were released, it was revealed that an Albanian migrant who was deported from the U.K. after being freed from a two-and-a-half-year jail sentence later snuck back into the country and was able to win the right to stay – thanks to the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which the U.K. is a party of.
The recent arrivals bring the total undocumented arrivals this year to 26,612 compared to 25,330 by the same date last year and 33,611 in 2022, according to figures from the U.K. Home Office.
The Conservative Party has warned that migrants will likely continue coming to the U.K. under the belief that they will be more welcomed, now that the Labour Party is in control of the government.
Furthermore, members of the Conservative Party have warned that scrapping the Rwanda asylum plan removed a key deterrent to migrants thinking that it may be worth it to make the dangerous English Channel crossing into the United Kingdom.
Leaders of the Labour Party said they will invest more in border control to ""smash"" the human smuggling gangs who organize the crossings. Conservative leadership contenders Shadow Home Secretary James Cleverly and Member of Parliament Robert Jenrick both have called for the Labour government of Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to address the issue.
Cleverly said: ""We need to deter people from coming here illegally and to root them out of our economy when they are here."" Jenrick, a former immigration minister, said: ""This is the highest number crossing the Channel in a single day for years.""
Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has pledged an immediate 75 million British pound ($98 million) investment in border security, with funding made available to the National Crime Agency to pay for covert operation equipment to disrupt people smugglers.

Natural News,"White House claims FEMA is NOT funding resettlement of illegal aliens, but agency website says otherwise – NaturalNews.com","Jean-Pierre was asked at a press briefing if former President Donald Trump's claim that the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) agency is spending for the shelter of undocumented migrants is true. She replied: ""It is categorically false. It is not true. It is a false statement. The fact of the matter is the Washington Post fact checker did a piece and the headline was 'No, Biden did not take FEMA relief money to use on migrants.'""
She even tried to blame the former president instead, saying ""Trump did.""
However, the FEMA website openly states that its funding has been used to house illegal immigrants who have entered the United States during the administration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.
""The Shelter and Services Program (SSP) is administered by the FEMA in partnership with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). SSP provides financial support to non-federal entities to provide humanitarian services to noncitizen migrants following their release from DHS. The intent is to support CBP in the safe, orderly and humane release of noncitizen migrants from short-term holding facilities,"" the website states.
It also published the breakdown of expenses for the years 2023 ($363.8 million) and 2024 ($300 million).
Critics point out how the White House and its federal agencies are not ""comparing notes"" as DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas recently admitted that they have spent for the migrants and that the agency now lacked adequate funds for the remainder of the hurricane season. The organization has enough funds to deal with the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, which killed 160 people, but would not have enough to ""make it through the season,"" he admitted.
FEMA, which says that its mission is ""helping people before, during and after disasters,"" explained in 2023 that it was preparing to spend over $360 million in taxpayer dollars in fiscal year 2023 alone to house illegal immigrants through its SSP. That figure increased to $650 million in fiscal year 2024.
A report to Congress detailing the program explained that the funds could be allocated to ""hotel/motel service provided for 45 days per individual or family"" and ""transportation from DHS release to shelter and services provider location,"" including airfare.
The agency argued that the use of its funds to support illegal immigrants is necessary because ""the present-day irregular migration of noncitizens is unprecedented,"" leaving states and localities unable to handle the surge.
In response to the recent controversy, Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) has introduced a new bill aimed at terminating FEMA's SSP so the unspent funds can be redirected to help Americans recover from natural disasters.
Mace said the bill addresses concerns about financial resources being allocated to illegal immigrants instead of disaster relief. The bill would transfer the remaining funds from the SSP to the Disaster Relief Fund, which supports emergency response and recovery efforts under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act.
FEMA clarified on its website that no disaster relief funds have been diverted, stating: ""FEMA's disaster response efforts and individual assistance are funded through the Disaster Relief Fund. Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster-related efforts."" (Related: FEMA under Biden now CONFISCATING donations made to Hurricane Helene survivors.)

Natural News,Iran warns Israel not to respond to ballistic missile attack: “Any miscalculation will lead to your sudden collapse” – NaturalNews.com,"In an October 2 statement, the Iranian Defense Ministry warned Israel that Iran's retaliatory missile attack, which struck multiple Israeli military targets in occupied territories, is ""only a small portion of Iran's defense capabilities.""
""Any miscalculation by the criminal Zionist regime and its sponsors will definitely result in Iran employing equipment and weapons that will blow harsher and more painful blows to the worn and rotting body of the Zionist regime in the next responses,"" the Defense Ministry added.
Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf, the Speaker of the Iranian Shura Council, issued his own warning to Tel Aviv as well that Iran's military forces are fully prepared for ""all the crazy possibilities expected.""
""Our armed forces have devised a surprise plan for the enemies, and our next response will be on a completely different level,"" Qalibaf said. ""If the Zionist entity tries to attack Iran, it will quickly disappear and collapse.""
Qalibaf also urged Washington, which behaves as if it works on behalf of Israel rather than the United States, to ""tighten the collar of its rabid dog [Israel] so that it does not harm itself and cause trouble for its owner.""
(Related: In case you missed it, here is our earlier report with further details about Iran's 180-missile response attack on Israel.)
No further attacks by Iran will occur if Israel stops attacking and assassinating its neighbors, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told his counterparts from the United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands on a joint call this week.
""Iran's operation against Israel is over, unless the Zionist regime plans retaliation, in which case Tehran's response will be stronger,"" the Tasnin news agency reported.
Iran is fully within its right to self-defense, Araqchi added, citing Article 51 of the United Nations charter. Israel keeps talking as if it is the victim in all this, but do not forget that Israel attacked first and Iran simply responded with a counterattack.
""The next response will be harsher,"" Araqchi further promised in the event that Israel continues its campaign of aggression against its neighbors.
""We sent a message to the U.S. via Switzerland after the missile operation, warning it against any third party's interference,"" he added.
""Before the attack, there was no exchange of messages ... We have ... warned the U.S. forces to withdraw from this matter and not to intervene ... Any country that allows Israel to use its airspace against us will bear responsibility.""
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian joined the chorus with his own warning against Israel that it and its allies had better not ""clash with Iran"" or else they will pay an even bigger price in the coming days.
Tehran's 180-missile counter-response attack on Israel resulted in the Hatzarim, Nevatim and Ramon military bases of the IDF having to be put out of service due to severe damage, according to Hezbollah sources who spoke with the media.
Dubbed ""True Promise 2,"" the attack by Iran was in response to the Israeli assassination of Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran earlier this year, as well as the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut this past week.
""We have made clear that there will be consequences – severe consequences – for this attack, and we will work with Israel to make that the case,"" commented U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan immediately following Iran's counter-attack.

Natural News,Top Iranian commander reportedly disappears in Beirut amid rumors he may have betrayed his country and collaborated with Israel – NaturalNews.com,"Qaani, 67, took control of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps' (IRGC) elite unit after former leader Qassem Soleimani was assassinated by a drone strike ordered by the United States in early 2020. He has not been heard from since an airstrike on Oct. 4 targeted a bunker in Beirut where he was said to be meeting with Hezbollah top leaders, including the projected next leader Hashem Safieddine.
Initially, Qaani was presumed to have perished in the attack, but new reports have surfaced suggesting that he was not at the meeting, raising suspicions about his role in recent Israeli operations.
Sources from Lebanon, Iraq and Iran have claimed that Qaani had avoided the bunker blast, as well as another deadly airstrike a week earlier that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.
His repeated absences from such high-level meetings have stoked rumors that he may have turned against the Iranian regime and is now under house arrest, facing interrogation by Iranian authorities. These suspicions are further fueled by the fact that Qaani has not been seen or heard from, even by his family, since the strike.
Adding to the intrigue is Israel's stunning success in recent months at eliminating top commanders in the region, including Hezbollah and Iranian military officials, through precision airstrikes and intelligence-led operations. (Recent: Iranian professor sets the record straight about Israel with speechless Sky News reporter.)
Israel’s use of advanced technology, including pager and walkie-talkie bombs, has enabled them to target key figures with remarkable accuracy. Many within the IRGC believe that these operations have been facilitated by a high-level mole, and Qaani's unexplained absence has made him a prime suspect.
Reports coming out of Iran claim that Qaani is currently being held under lockdown as investigators from the IRGC and Iranian intelligence services probe his involvement. If these rumors are true, Qaani would be the highest-ranking Iranian official ever accused of espionage for Israel, a move that could have far-reaching implications for Iran’s military and its relationship with Hezbollah.
Qaani was responsible for overseeing Iran's overseas military operations, particularly in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq. Under his leadership, the Quds Force has continued its efforts to support Hezbollah and other militant groups in their fight against Israel and Western forces.
However, his sudden disappearance has raised questions about whether he has been working for Israel all along, undermining Iran's military operations from within.
The speculation surrounding Qaani has created a wave of panic within Iran's military, with many fearing that Israeli intelligence has infiltrated the highest levels of the IRGC.
Some sources have even suggested that Qaani may have played a role in Nasrallah's assassination, which immediately led to a frantic search for an Israeli mole within Hezbollah who could have helped direct Israeli planes to Nasrallah's bunker. Iranian investigators are now focusing on Qaani's movements in the days leading up to the strike.

Natural News,"BOMBSHELL: Welcome to the SWING STATE STORMS of 2024, brought to you by HAARP and the DoD – NaturalNews.com","The U.S. government confirmed they flew weather weapon planes in Hurricane Helene that magically GAINED strength over land like no hurricane before. U.S. lawmakers were literally briefed on Department of Defense-linked weather modification technology after Helene struck Georgia and North Carolina, two of the seven swing states the Left must win to pull off the biggest election upset in history.
It is becoming more and more evident that weather modification weapons are being used for election interference. Since we don’t have a plandemic happening right now, where tens of millions of (falsified) mail-in ballots are justifiably utilized, the Democrats need to create another reason to “win” the election AFTER November 5th, when all the Republicans come out in droves to vote to save America from a total and permanent communist takeover by the Left.
The Helene Mod-Storm changed directions in North Carolina seven times, demolishing counties that voted heavily for Trump in 2020, and land that is rich with lithium, that the Left desperately wants and needs for electric cars as part of the Green New Scam. Remember, these storms don’t get stronger over land, they get weaker. In other words, weather weapon technology is being used to kill two birds with one stone here, and do not be surprised to see similar machine-crafted disasters hit other swing states before and on November 5th.
We knew that climate alarmists and the global warming cult was one huge scam, but nobody thought the weather could help the Left cheat themselves into another election victory, but here we all are, witnessing the systemic carnage and methodical destruction of the most important election states in the union. The Milton DoD-HAARP storm is ripping through Florida, where over 20 million people could have their homes and businesses wrecked to the extent that mail-in ballots will be their only choice for the election. Coincidence?
Which swing states will suffer a DoD-HAARP-manipulated storm in the next 3 weeks? Will it be Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Wisconsin or Pennsylvania? Will some massive category 5 hurricane suddenly originate over a land-locked state and gain strength out of nowhere? Will it rain in the desert for a week straight and flood Arizona so nobody can get to the polls? Both Helene and Milton had to be modified by machinery to have their mysterious effects of location origination, immediate strength and awkward directional movement.
No wonder the U.S. government does not help storm victims, if they are using weather machines to help create and manipulate the storms. It’s starting to make sense now, why FEMA is not helping North Carolinians survive or recover. Why would FEMA fund recovery for people and businesses that the insidious government destroyed on purpose?
Former President Lyndon B. Johnson predicted all of this in 1962, when he was VP, saying, “He who controls the weather will control the world. It calls for us taking the steps now that will make us no longer second in space and science. It lays the predicate and the foundation for a space communication satellite that will permit the people of the world to see one television program at the same time throughout the world. Think about that kind of communication and think about the opportunity that will provide. It lays the predicate and the foundation for the development of a weather satellite that will permit man to determine the world’s cloud layer, and ultimately to control the weather, and he who controls the weather will control the world.”
Add Hurricane Otis and Hurricane John to the list of DoD-HAARP crafted and manipulated “climate change” storms. Watch this intriguing and mind-blowing interview featuring Mike Adams and Dane Wigington for more insight.

Natural News,HYPOCRISY ALERT: Democrats say they won’t certify election if Trump wins because he’s “dangerous to democracy” – NaturalNews.com,"Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), speaking for the Democrat Party at large, told the media that unless Trump uses ""free, fair, and honest means to secure a victory,"" leftist politicians have no plans to certify his expected election win.
""[Trump] is doing whatever he can to try to interfere with the process, whether we're talking about manipulating electoral college counts in Nebraska or manipulating the vote count in Georgia or imposing other kinds of impediments,"" Raskin is quoted as saying to Axios.
Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.) said much the same to the media outlet about how she feels as though there is no way Trump will win the election fair and square. Who knows, she questioned, ""what kind of shenanigans he is planning.""
(Related: Did you know that upwards of 530,000 registered voters in Hurricane Helene-ravaged western North Carolina might not be able to participate in 2024 election, according to the concerned Trump campaign?)
These are some of the same people, by the way, who have been whining and complaining about the so-called ""insurrection"" that occurred when Joe Biden was installed as ""president"" in spite of profuse evidence showing fraud in the 2020 election.
The Democrats have been railing on for years now about how Republicans are the ones who are a threat to ""democracy"" because of how many responded to the Biden steal. And now these same Democrats are planning their own insurrection in response to a potential Trump win this fall.
""I've been told this type of rhetoric is 'dangerous to our democracy' or something,"" tweeted someone on X / Twitter in response to the Axios report about how many top House Democrats are planning to not certify a Trump win.
""The 'democracy defenders' won't commit to certifying an election?"" tweeted Trending Politics co-owner Colin Rugg, also mocking Democrats.
Considering the fact that Democrats broke their own primary rules, and probably the law as well, by replacing Biden with Kamala Harris on the 2024 ticket at the last minute, it only makes sense that these same Democrats are now threatening to steal another election to keep Trump out of office.
""No surprise there,"" an anonymous conservative X / Twitter account wrote. ""They threw democracy out the window when they put Kamala in w/o a single vote. Why wouldn't they pull some more shenanigans? We'll get SCOTUS involved if we have to, but they need to do their job or GTFO.""
Raskin, by the way, is on record as promising to never allow Trump back into the White House, even if Americans overwhelmingly vote for him this November – check out the video below:

It looks like the plan is to so divide the American people before Election Day that no matter what happens, one side will feel disenfranchised and rebel, possibly leading to another civil war.
""I knew we couldn't vote our way out of this,"" someone lamented on X / Twitter about how America is in for a rocky ride.

Natural News,Dozens of states SUING TIKTOK for damaging children’s mental health – NaturalNews.com,"Since banning TikTok outright did not work as planned, America's political class is attempting to play the but think of the children! card to try to stop TikTok from being functional in the United States.
The joint lawsuit, filed by the District of Columbia attorney general, accuses TikTok of deceiving its users by claiming the app is safe for children. TikTok is also accused of operating an illegal money transmission business.
The timing of the suit is glaringly obvious as to what spurred it. TikTok's lawyers just got finished successfully appealing in federal court a new law that would have banned TikTok after Jan. 19, 2025, unless ByteDance sells it to a non-Chinese buyer. The courts ruled that this ban is unconstitutional, so now state AGs are attempting to sue TikTok using the children's mental health excuse.
All in all, 13 states, including New York and California, as well as Washington, D.C., are trying to argue that Tikok is filled with ""addictive"" features that make it unsafe for young people.
""Our lawsuit is seeking to hold TikTok accountable for harming D.C. children,"" said D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb with a straight face.
Schwalb says there are ""profound"" mental health risks associated with TikTok use, including depression, anxiety, sleep loss, and body dysmorphia. None of those symptoms could possibly have anything to do with the way politicians run America on behalf of the wealthy and powerful at the expense of everyone else – no, it's all TikTok's fault, according to these AGs.
(Related: TikTok is under a lot of pressure to ban all truth and only allow official government narratives to spread across the platform.)
To emphasize his dislike of TikTok, Schwalb even went so far as to call the platform ""digital nicotine,"" the implication being that its owners are ""intentionally trying to addict young people to its platform.""
Interestingly, Schwalb has no problem with Facebook, X / Twitter and the rest of social media, all of which offer the same features. Only TikTok is on the chopping block, which makes you wonder who is really behind this push to outlaw it.
Schwalb says that TikTok ""inflicts immense damage on an entire generation of young people,"" and thus must be eliminated through any means possible.
""In addition to prioritizing its profits over the health of children, TikTok's unregulated and illegal virtual economy allows the darkest, most depraved corners of society to prey upon vulnerable victims,"" Schwalb further said.
""The company knows what is happening and has chosen to ignore it. This lawsuit seeks to put an end to its illegal, deceptive, and predatory behavior.""
Besides D.C., New York and California, the other states that are joining the suit against TikTok include:
• Illinois
• Kentucky
• Louisiana
• Massachusetts
• Mississippi
• New Jersey
• North Carolina
• Oregon
• South Carolina
• Vermont
• Washington
In a statement, a TikTok spokesperson responded that the company ""strongly"" disagrees with allegations that the platform's very existence is destroying children's brains.
""We strongly disagree with these claims, many of which we believe to be inaccurate and misleading,"" the spokesperson said.
""We're proud of an remain deeply committed to the work we've done to protect teens and we will continue to update and improve our product. We provide robust safeguards, proactively remove suspected underage users, and have voluntarily launched safety features such as default screentime limits, family pairing, and privacy by default for minors under 16.""
The government could not care less about children's mental health. In this case, they only care about silencing free speech. Learn more at Censorship.news.

Natural News,"Trump vows to revoke legal status and DEPORT Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio if reelected in November – NaturalNews.com","Temporary Protected Status (TPS), granted to Haitian immigrants after the 2010 earthquake, has allowed many to live and work legally in the United States, despite their initial unauthorized entry. The designation has been extended multiple times due to continued instability in Haiti, including under the administration of President Joe Biden, which extended it until Feb. 3, 2026.
In turn, Haitian immigrants, fleeing violence and insecurity, have made up a massive part of the recent influx of migrants to the United States. A recent report from the U.S. Census Bureau reports that 852,000 Haitian immigrants live in the country, with Springfield housing at least 15,000 of them.
In an interview with NewsNation on Oct. 2, Trump argued that the TPS protections are not legally valid, so he intends to reverse the policy if reelected.
""It has nothing to do with Haiti or anything else. It doesn't work. You have to remove the people, and you have to bring them back to their own country,"" Trump said during the interview. ""Springfield is such a beautiful place. Have you seen what’s happened to it? It’s been overrun. You can’t do that to people. They have to be removed. Absolutely, I’d revoke [the status]. I’d bring them back to their country."" (Related: Sylacauga City Council abruptly ends meeting after residents question the influx of Haitian immigrants.)
Trump has consistently taken a hardline stance on immigration since his first term as president.
However, the majority of his anti-illegal immigrant policies have been reversed by President Joe Biden since he took office. So, when Trump began his campaign for the 2024 presidential election, he vowed to make up for the lost progress by implementing ""the largest domestic deportation operation in American history"" if reelected.
""Upon my inauguration, I will immediately terminate every Open Borders policy of the Biden administration. Following the Eisenhower Model, we will carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American History,"" Trump said during a speech in Iowa in September 2023. ""I'll also invoke immediately the Alien Enemies Act to remove all known or suspected gang members.""
And now that Springfield has become a flashpoint in the immigrant debate, fueled by allegations that Haitian immigrants were abducting and consuming pets, Trump reiterated his stance during the NewsNation interview.
This interview came after Trump acknowledged social media posts, including a story shared in a Facebook crime group, accusing Haitian immigrants of eating dogs and cats during the presidential debate in September.
""They're eating the dogs, the people that came in, they're eating the cats,"" Trump said during an answer to a question about immigration. ""They're eating the pets of the people that live there, and this is what's happening in our country, and it's a shame.""

Natural News,"U.S. to send $567M in military aid to Taiwan, ignoring China’s “red lines” related to the island nation – NaturalNews.com","The administration of President Joe Biden plans to send $567 in military aid to Taiwan as the United States continues to ignore China's so-called ""red lines"" related to America's relationship with the democratically governed island nation.
The weapons package is in the final stages and will be provided through the Presidential Drawdown Authority (PDA). The PDA allows the U.S. to ship weapons to other countries directly from its own military stockpiles. The military aid will be the largest PDA package that Taiwan has received from the United States.
Since Washington ceased formal diplomatic relations with Taipei in 1979 because of a normalization deal with Beijing, America has always sold weapons to Taiwan. However, the U.S. never financed the purchases or provided the arms free of charge until 2023.
Last year, the U.S. gave Taiwan a $345 million arms package using the PDA. It provided $80 million in Foreign Military Financing (FMF), which is a State Department program that gives foreign governments money to purchase U.S. arms.
Congress has authorized the provision of $1 billion in PDA for Taiwan each year. The $95 billion foreign military aid bill Biden previously signed in April included $1.9 billion that could be used to replenish the weapons sent to Taiwan.
The new form of U.S. support for Taiwan has angered Chinese officials, who often advise the U.S. that the issue is the ""first red line"" in U.S.-China relations that must not be crossed.
When Biden signed the foreign military aid bill in April, Beijing advised that new military aid for Taiwan could trigger more conflict.
""Getting closer militarily between the United States and the Taiwan region will not make the latter safer or save 'Taiwan independence' from doom. It will only heighten tensions and the risk of conflict and confrontation in the Taiwan Strait, and will eventually backfire,"" said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin. (Related: U.S. would prevail over China in a war over Taiwan, high-ranking U.S. military official claims.)
Taiwan remains the most sensitive issue in America’s relationship with China. To date, Beijing insists that Taiwan is part of its rightful territory and won't rule out military force to one day unite with the democratically governed island.
On the other hand, the U.S. remains Taiwan’s oldest and largest supplier of military aid.
The stalemate has often resulted in public displays of frustration. At the 2024 Shangri-La Dialogue, Asia's largest defense summit, China's Minister of National Defense Admiral Dong Jun warned that supporters of Taiwanese ""separatists"" would be ""punished.""
Jun's warning came shortly after China’s military held large drills around Taiwan.
In a recent briefing, a spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs criticized U.S. military support for the island, claiming that it ""sends a wrong message to 'Taiwan independence' separatist forces.""
At a September defense conference hosted in Beijing, which was attended by a top Pentagon official for China, members of the People's Liberation Army weren't as irritated. In October, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan also traveled to China, where he met with senior members of the government to help schedule a long-sought call between America's top military leader in the region and his Chinese counterpart.
The security assistance for Taiwan will be used to fund training, stockpiles, anti-armor weapons, air defense and multi-domain awareness, explained a U.S. official, who did not reveal specific details. The military aid will also be used for drones, which are crucial to the U.S. and Taiwan's ""asymmetric"" strategy to defend the island against China’s larger military force.

Natural News,Unearthed clip proves once and for all that FEMA has been hopelessly castrated by the left – NaturalNews.com,"(Article republished from Revolver.news)
Not only has FEMA blown all their funds on illegals, leaving just a measly $750 for each desperate American, but Joe Biden—the so-called “president”—doesn’t even know which storm disaster he flew over to gawk at recently. While Americans are suffering and scrambling for help, Biden insists everyone’s as happy as pigs in you-know-what. Do you believe that? Of course not. It’s a cruel game of political smoke and mirrors.

And let’s not forget Kamala’s recent post on X, where she proudly announced $157 million going to “help” suffering foreigners.
The people of Lebanon are facing an increasingly dire humanitarian situation. I am concerned about the security and well-being of civilians suffering in Lebanon and will continue working to help meet the needs of all civilians there.
To that end, the United States will provide nearly $157 million in additional assistance to the people of Lebanon for essential needs such as food, shelter, water, protection, and sanitation to help those who have been displaced by the recent conflict. This additional support brings total U.S. assistance to Lebanon over the last year to over $385 million.

Either Kamala is the most tone-deaf, out-of-touch person on the planet, or she just doesn’t care that you see her globalist agenda. Maybe it’s a bit of both. But it’s not just Kamala—the entire left-wing apparatus is running under the same dangerous globalist playbook. And if you think FEMA hasn’t been weaponized, think again. This unearthed clip is all the proof you need to see how yet another once-sacred institution has become a total slave to the progressive DEI agenda, which isn’t just sweeping the nation—it’s destroying it.
As you can see, FEMA is no longer focused on helping suffering Americans. Their priority now is pushing diversity and propping up the LGBTQ agenda.

Here’s the truth: Being gay is a lifestyle choice. But being trapped on a mountain or wading through waist-high hurricane floodwaters isn’t. But this type of total and complete FEMA failure is what happens when every three-or-four-letter government agency embraces DEI. This “diversity” nonsense isn’t some unbiased “humanity movement,” folks—it’s hardcore, radical and divisive left-wing politics, and it has infiltrated nearly every corner of our country and our lives. If we don’t root it out, this nation will implode from within, no matter who’s in the White House.

Natural News,Fact or fiction? Media claims FEMA isn’t in Helene-ravaged western N.C. because “armed militias” are hunting down federal aid workers – NaturalNews.com,"Newsweek, citing The Washington Post, published an article about a message that the U.S. Forest Service sent to numerous federal agencies explaining that FEMA is advising all federal responders in Rutherford County to ""stand down and evacuate the county immediately"" because of the alleged militia threat.
The National Guard says it came across two trucks full of ""armed militia saying there [sic] were out hunting FEMA,"" according to the Forest Service message, which was sent via email.
""The IMTs [incident management teams] have been notified and are coordinating the evacuation of all assigned personnel in that county,"" the email further reads.
Two federal officials confirmed the authenticity of the email but it remains unknown just how serious the threat was determined to be. We do know that several federal employees were taken to a ""safe area,"" which resulted in relief work being put on hold. Those employees were reportedly redeployed several days later.
(Related: Did you catch our story about the military-style Blackhawk helicopter that caused ""rotor wash"" destruction on a Cajun Navy supply staging area in western North Carolina?)
The Post's Brianna Sacks, who bylined the story, shared a message on X / Twitter after its publishing claiming that an entire firefighting crew had been told to avoid certain areas of Appalachia on the border between North Carolina and Tennessee ""due to communities being governed by armed militias.""
Concerning claims that FEMA never even bothered to try to help Helene-ravaged communities, even going so far as to sabotage local relief efforts, the federal government insists that this is all just ""misinformation and rumors"" that ""have made the recovery effort more difficult.""
In short, local relief efforts are clashing with federal relief efforts, or so it seems. There is obviously a conflict of interests at play with how the government is helping those whose property and lives were destroyed by Helene to the point that relief efforts are being politicized.
""It's terrible because a lot of these folks who need assistance are refusing it because they believe the stuff people are saying about FEMA and the government,"" commented Forest Service official Riva Duncan. ""And it's sad because they are probably the ones who need the help the most.""
It is nothing new for Appalachia to not exactly be supportive of the federal government. The region tends more towards poverty than affluence, though there has been an influx of people from other states who have moved there in recent years to retire or get away from the bigger cities.
On the flip side, the federal government has a nasty habit of lying about things, hence why social media is being flooded with eyewitness and video evidence showing that the feds are not exactly supportive of local relief efforts.
President Biden is on the side of the feds, of course, having denounced what he described as the ""reckless, irresponsible, and relentless disinformation and outright lies"" that are supposedly causing many in Appalachia to reject federal assistance and drive out federal workers.
""After the response to the Hawaiian fires, yeah, it puts you on edge,"" one commenter wrote about the completely understandable reluctance that many people have to allowing FEMA into their neighborhoods, even after a major disaster.
""What you call militias are locals protecting their territory. The local sheriffs have stepped up for the most part and put FEMA on notice: you aren't taking over and running things.""

Natural News,U.S. healthcare volunteers in Gaza call for end to U.S. military support for Israel – NaturalNews.com,"The letter released on Oct. 3 emphasized that the true death toll in Gaza is likely far higher than reported figures. The healthcare workers, who have witnessed the devastation firsthand in Gaza's remaining health centers, estimated the Palestinian casualties to be at least 118,908.
""This letter and its appendix present evidence that the human toll in Gaza since October is much higher than is recognized in the U.S.,"" the letter stated, pointing out that the death toll likely exceeds 5.4 percent of Gaza's population.
Official figures from Gaza’s Health Ministry report 41,788 Palestinians killed by Israeli forces since the start of hostilities on Oct. 7, 2023. However, the ministry only counts deaths if it can recover bodies from hospitals and morgues, omitting those still missing beneath the rubble or otherwise lost. (Related: Gaza faces critical shortages of medicine and supplies amid severe aid blockage.)
The healthcare workers assert that nearly everyone in Gaza is suffering from illness, injury, or both, painting a grim picture of the humanitarian crisis in the besieged territory.
""With few exceptions, everyone in Gaza is sick, injured, or both. This includes national aid workers, international volunteers, and likely Israeli hostages: Every man, woman and child,"" the letter read.
The volunteers further noted that nearly every child under five they treated had both respiratory and gastrointestinal ailments, and they reported seeing children with injuries that suggested they were being deliberately targeted by Israeli forces.
""Every one of us who worked in emergency, intensive care, or surgical settings treated pre-teen children shot in the head or chest regularly,"" the healthcare workers wrote. ""It is impossible that such widespread shooting of young children could be accidental or unknown to the highest Israeli civilian and military authorities.""
One particularly harrowing account came from Dr. Mark Perlmutter, an orthopedic surgeon, who described the horror he encountered in Gaza: ""Gaza was the first time I held a baby’s brains in my hand. The first of many.""
The healthcare workers further detailed how newborns were dying from conditions created by the Israeli siege and attacks on hospitals.
Asma Taha, a pediatric nurse practitioner, said: ""Every day, I saw babies die. They had been born healthy, but their malnourished mothers couldn’t breastfeed, and we lacked formula or clean water to feed them, so they starved.""
The letter also noted that Palestinian healthcare workers were specifically targeted and captured by Israeli forces during raids on hospitals. ""Many of these colleagues of ours were taken by Israel during the attacks. They all told us a similar story: in captivity, they were barely fed, continuously abused, and eventually dumped naked on the roadside. Many reported mock executions and other forms of torture.""
The letter follows a growing movement in the U.S. demanding an end to military aid to Israel. Two months ago, seven major labor unions wrote a letter to Biden ahead of a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, calling for the immediate halt of military support.
These seven labor unions represent over six million American workers and likely voters. They are the Association of Flight Attendants, the American Postal Workers Union (APWU), the International Union of Painters, the National Education Association, the Service Employees International Union, the United Auto Workers and the United Electrical Workers.
These unions voiced concerns about the ongoing violence in Gaza, the deaths of civilians, and the destruction of essential infrastructure.
""Large numbers of Palestinian civilians, many of them children, continue to be killed, reportedly often with U.S.-manufactured bombs. Rising tensions in the region threaten to ensnare even more innocent civilians in a wider war,"" wrote the unions in the letter. ""And the humanitarian crisis deepens by the day, with famine, mass displacement and destruction of basic infrastructure including schools and hospitals.
""We have spoken directly to leaders of Palestinian trade unions who told us heart-wrenching stories of the conditions faced by working people in Gaza. The time to act decisively to end this war is now. Stopping U.S. military aid to Israel is the quickest and most sure way to do so, it is what U.S. law demands, and it will show your commitment to securing a lasting peace in the region.""
""Our unions are hearing the cries of humanity as this vicious war continues,"" said APWU President Mark Dimondstein. ""Working people and our unions are horrified that our tax dollars are financing this ongoing tragedy. We need a ceasefire now, and the best way to secure that is to shut off U.S. military aid to Israel.""

Natural News,Surveys find Korean Americans are now turning away from Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party – NaturalNews.com,"One survey, known as the 2024 Asian American Voter Survey, included 409 registered Korean American voters. The poll found that only 38 percent of respondents identified themselves being Democrats. This marks a substantial decrease from the same survey conducted in 2020, which found that 51 percent of this demographic identified with the Democratic Party. (Related: Poll finds Democrats' advantage among Hispanic voters continues to SHRINK.)
This shift highlights a growing sentiment among Korean Americans that inflation and economic issues are paramount to historical loyalties to the Democrats.
In fact, 57 percent of respondents labeled jobs and the economy as ""extremely important"" in casting their vote, with another 33 percent describing these issues as ""very important"" and nine percent as ""somewhat important."" Meanwhile, 58 percent consider inflation as a major concern, with 32 percent describing it as a ""very important"" issue and eight percent as ""somewhat important.""
Housing costs also weigh heavily, with 51 percent deeming the issue ""extremely important"" to their voting decision, with 35 percent labeling it as ""very important,"" 10 percent as ""somewhat important"" and three percent as ""not that important.""
These results support the claims of Catherine Kim, an assistant editor at POLITICO Magazine, that ""the economy has always been a top priority for Korean Americans,"" especially in Gwinnett County, a suburb where inflation severely impacted the Korean American community. This community, according to Kim, poorly evaluated the performance of the current administration.
The surveys also reveal increasing support for former President Donald Trump as Korean Americans turn away from the Democratic Party.
One survey conducted from April to May found that only 27 percent of Korean Americans support Trump. However, another survey conducted in early September found that 35 percent of Korean Americans are now supporting Trump due to their belief that he is more capable of dealing with inflation and other economic issues.
Lee Sung Yong, a traditional KBBQ and noodle restaurant owner in Georgia, pointed to the rising costs as a critical factor influencing his vote.
""The price of ingredients has just risen so much — almost 80 percent for certain items,"" Lee said in an interview with Kim, confirming he will vote for Trump.
""The yearly costs of my operation have been so different under the two administrations. Eating out has become such a financial burden these days,"" he said. ""That first and foremost needs to be fixed for us to survive.""
For Lee, a return of the Trump administration represents a potential return to better times for his restaurant.
""I was disappointed with the economy under Biden,"" he said. He admitted that the economic policies of Harris as a presidential candidate remains unclear to him, so he is worried that these might as well just continue to exacerbate rising prices and higher taxes. ""I don't know Harris' economic policies, but won't the same pattern of rising prices and higher taxes repeat under her, since she was the vice president?""

Natural News,Netflix subscribers cancelling subscriptions en masse after co-founder endorses Kamala for president – NaturalNews.com,"According to reports, Hastings is so thrilled with the idea of Kamala cackling her way into the White House that he donated a whopping $7 million to her already over-bloated war chest.
On July 23, Hastings went on X to publicly announce how much he loves Kamala. This prompted the worst business day ever for Netflix, which lost 2.8 percent of its subscriber based in July alone.
Another part of the reason for this mass exodus was Netflix's decision to phase out its basic tier and force all subscribers into a more costly one. Many Americans are sick and tired of the ""woke"" virus that infects modern programming as it is, and having to pay even more for it was enough to cause tens of thousands of Netflix subscribers to cancel.
Bloomberg admits that, all things considered, it was ""unusual"" for Netflix to lose so many subscribers in the five-day period following Hastings' Kamala endorsement. Clearly there are many Americans who are also tired of Democrat leadership and want to give Donald Trump another try.
(Related: Did you know that Bill Gates is launching a new series on Netflix that suggests mass suicide as a viable plan for global human depopulation?)
A longtime Democrat donor, Hastings failed to read the room when he decided to enter the fray of politics, especially in 2024. People on the left and on the right seem solidly placed within their respective camps, and corporations err greatly whenever their executives start picking sides publicly.
Shareholders take note: If your investments are in companies led by people with strong political leanings, expect dramatic movements like what is now happening to Netflix as a result of its CEO choosing Kamala in this very contentious political cycle.
In the information age, all it takes is a tweet to spark a nationwide boycott, which is exactly what is happening to Netflix as the #CancelNetflix hashtag went viral following Hastings' Kamala endorsement.
""Shortly after Hastings' endorsement, fans of Donald Trump began urging people to drop the service,"" reported Bloomberg.
""Some posted photos showing they had closed their accounts alongside the hashtag #CancelNetflix. Three days later after the donation became public, July 26, was the single worst day for Netflix cancellations this year.""
The boycott lasted just three days, at least noticeably, fizzling out faster even than the great Netflix boycott of 2020, which stemmed from the subscription service's streaming of the French movie Cuties.
""The long-term effect of these incidents can be hard to gauge,"" Bloomberg further reported.
""Advertisers and companies were eager to speak out on social issues following the murder of George Floyd. Many companies raced to show their support for the Black community and started new programs or initiatives to promote diversity, equity and inclusion (or DEI). Netflix shifted cash to Black-owned banks while Hastings donated to historically black universities.""
Anheuser-Busch faced a similar fate after the company advertised its Bud Light brand using a mentally deranged ""transwoman"" (a biological male who thinks he is female). The move prompted massive backlash as Bud Light drinkers, disgusted by the transwoman, dropped the brand for other beers.
For Netflix, the company has been trying for years to keep Hastings' political obsessions separate from its business operations to avoid these kinds of boycotts. This one with Kamala was apparently too extreme to contain, and now Netflix and its shareholders are paying the price.

Natural News,"CANCEL CULTURE: Trump’s youngest son Barron rejected by bank when he attempted to open a new account, Melania reveals in new memoir – NaturalNews.com","Barron's mother, former First Lady Melania, said she believes her family is being targeted, raising significant concerns about potential civil rights violations.
""I was shocked and dismayed to learn that my long-time bank decided to terminate my account and deny my son the opportunity to open a new one,"" Melania wrote in her new memoir, ""Melania,"" published on Tuesday, Oct. 8.
According to her, the said incident was an example of politically motivated bias. Despite the gravity of the accusations, she chose not to reveal the name of the financial institution involved.
She further argued that this was a part of the broader culture of exclusion and suppression her family has endured, a backlash that intensified because of the Jan. 6 Capitol ""riot.""
""The 'cancel mob' now includes corporations, traditional media, influential social media figures, and cultural institutions,"" she added in the book, warning of the dangerous precedent this sets in modern society. She also highlighted how businesses, be they larger or smaller, join this ""disheartening trend.""
The revelation about her son's bank account came after the former first lady told Fox News on Tuesday, Oct. 8, that Barron has been ""doing great"" since starting at New York University this fall. ""He loves his classes and his professors,"" Melania said. ""He's doing well, he's thriving and he's enjoying being in New York City again.""
Donald and Melania's only son together is expected to commute from Trump Tower in Midtown to attend classes in Greenwich Village, the New York Post reported. (Related: Trump's youngest son declines to be RNC delegate due to prior commitments.)
Debanking, the practice of denying individuals or organizations access to financial services based on their political, ideological or social positions, has emerged as a controversial trend within the broader phenomenon of cancel culture.
""It represents a significant escalation in the methods used to isolate or punish those whose views or actions fall outside mainstream acceptability, raising critical concerns about freedom of expression, civil rights and the role of private corporations in regulating societal behavior,"" Reclaim the Net explained.
The practice is a potent tool because access to financial services is essential for participation in society, it added that without access to a bank account, credit or other financial tools, individuals and organizations can be effectively excluded from basic economic functions, making this tactic materially damaging.
""Barron's experience of being bullied both online and in real life is a clear indication of the irreparable damage caused,"" Melanie said of her son being tagged ""autistic"" by cyber bullies.
While she made it clear that there is nothing shameful about autism, Melania said ""Barron is not autistic.""
In her book, the former first lady said that his son was absolutely hurt by the rumors that had actually begun, thanks to Trump's former friend turned enemy celebrity Rosie O'Donnell.
Back in 2016, O'Donnell posted a tweet that Barron was autistic without providing any evidence that he was at the time. The kid was only ten years old at the time and according to his mother, it took a lot of time to repair the damage to his self-confidence. She also accused O'Donnell of ""sheer malice.""
""I was appalled by such cruelty. It was clear to me that she was not interested in raising awareness about autism. I felt that she was attacking my son because she didn’t like my husband,"" Melania said.
She continued: ""Someone had painstakingly compiled the footage and added captions like, 'His hands are moving erratically and aren't touching each other. Then he was spotted making strange movements in his seat, typical of children with autism.”
O'Donnell eventually apologized for the social media post and said that it had nothing to do with her disdain for Barron's father.

Natural News,"Iran calls ballistic missile attack response on Israel “legal, rational and legitimate” – NaturalNews.com","Firing the missiles was a ""legal"" attack in response to Israel's ""terror attacks"" in recent months that left numerous senior Hamas, Hezbollah and Iranian officials dead, the Iranian government said about its self-defense efforts.
The missile attack struck various targets throughout central Israel, including at a site located near the Mossad headquarters on the northern outskirts of Tel Aviv. It remains unknown if there was any substantial damage from the attack as Israel is staying tight-lipped about the incident.
According to Iranian state television, 80 percent of the missiles launched at Israel hit their intended targets. However, the Israeli military (IDF) has banned all local and independent media outlets operating in Israel from publishing details about the exact locations of the missile hits.
Only two people were lightly wounded by shrapnel in Tel Aviv, Israel claims, downplaying the attack. One man, a 38-year-old Palestinian, is said to have died from shrapnel wounds in Jericho, located in the occupied West Bank.
(Related: Be sure to check out our earlier coverage to learn more about these latest tensions between Israel and Iran.)
Iran is insistent that the decision to fire these roughly 180 rockets was a ""legal, rational, and legitimate response to the terrorist attacks of the Zionist regime, which involved the targeting of Iranian nationals and interests and infringing on the national sovereignty of Iran.""
Should Israel ""dare to respond or commit further acts of malevolence, a subsequent and crushing response will ensue,"" added the Iranian mission at the United Nations.
""Regional states and the Zionists' supporters are advised to part ways with the regime.""
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, praised Iran's attack on Israel, calling it a blessing from above.
""With God's help, the blows of the uprising front will become stronger and more painful on the worn and rotting body of the Zionist regime,"" he said.
The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) says Iran fired the missiles in response to Israel's killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh earlier this year, as well as the killings of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah and IRGC commander Abbas Nilforoushan.
""In response to the martyrdom of Ismail Haniyeh, Hassan Nasrallah and Nilforoushan, we targeted the heart of the occupied territories,"" the IRGC said in a statement, adding that if Israel retaliates, Tehran's response will be ""more crushing and ruinous.""
Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian likewise celebrated the Iranian attack on Israel, calling it ""a decisive response to the aggression of the Zionist regime.""
""Let Netanyahu know that Iran is not a belligerent, but it stands firmly against any threat,"" Pezeshkian added. ""Do not enter into a conflict with Iran.""
Many in Iran feel as though their leaders made a strategic mistake by not responding sooner with an attack following Israel's killing of Haniyeh back in July. Haniyeh, after all, had played a key role in ceasefire talks for Gaza before Israel offed him as part of its killing crusade.
Amir Hossein Sabeti of the Iranian parliament says Pezeshkian was ""deceived by America"" in how he responded to Haniyeh's killing. Sabeti also blamed Pezeshkian for facilitating Nasrallah's assassination by disobeying the supreme leader's orders concerning retaliation following Haniyeh's killing.
""If Iran is to respond to Israel, it must consider pursuing an atomic bomb,"" said a former conservative Iranian MP to the media, adding that Israel is a ""rabid dog"" that ""must be controlled.""
""If Iran and Israel wish to ignite the region, then Iran should work towards developing nuclear capabilities.""

Natural News,Former UK prime minister claims he found a listening device in his bathroom after Netanyahu used it – NaturalNews.com,"In his new memoir, Unleashed, Johnson claimed that when Netanyahu visited him at the Foreign Office in 2017, the Israeli Prime Minister used his personal bathroom – and his security team later found bugging devices in the toilets.
“Thither Bibi repaired for a while, and it may or may not be a coincidence but I am told that later, when they were doing a regular sweep for bugs, they found a listening device in the thunderbox,” he wrote.
He also recounted how he gave Netanyahu a tour of the foreign office and showed him a desk that he claimed a previous foreign secretary, Arthur Balfour, used to draft the historic Balfour Declaration that supported establishing a Jewish homeland in Palestine. He said that Netanyahu seemed “genuinely awestruck” until he realized that Johnson was joking around after claiming he had the same pen Balfour used to sign the agreement and then pulled an everyday pen out of his drawer.
This excerpt was shared with The Telegraph, but when the publication asked Johnson follow-up questions about it, he replied: ""I think everything you need to know about that episode is in the book.""
Although Johnson did not state whether the UK made a formal complaint to Israel over the incident, it does seem plausible that they were behind it when you consider the fact that American officials also accused the Jewish state of bugging the White House around the same time.
In 2018, the Mossad was accused of planting listening devices near the White House so they could listen in on Donald Trump. Several former American officials told Politico that the FBI had identified Israel as the culprit of an operation that entailed placing miniature devices known as international mobile subscriber identity catchers with the aim of spying on Trump, who was president at the time. These gadgets trick devices into thinking that they are mobile phone signal towers so that they can capture their contents and locations.
A spokesperson for the Israeli embassy in Washington, D.C. at the time denied involvement, while Netanyahu himself said: “We have a directive, I have a directive: No intelligence work in the United States, no spies.”
Despite his insistence, it is not a stretch to believe that the Mossad would have a vested interest in planting listening devices around world leaders like Johnson and Trump to gather intelligence for blackmailing them. After all, many of the spy agency's endeavors are controversial, and Israel desperately wants to hold onto its Western allies even when it makes unpopular moves that earn global scorn.
The Mossad is known for carrying out many bold espionage operations over its eight-decade history, and while some have been impressive, others have been an embarrassment, and some have even caused rifts with allies.
They provided vital intelligence for the famous raid on Entebbe that freed hijacked Jewish airplane passengers (and resulted in the death of Netanyahu’s brother), and they famously captured key Holocaust organizer Adolf Eichmann in 1960 in Argentina.
However, some of their operations have been very sloppy. The agency is believed to be behind the recent simultaneous explosions of thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies in Lebanon used by Hezbollah operatives that caused 3,000 injuries, 37 deaths and plenty of concern from governments around the world for its carelessness.
Numerous civilians, children and healthcare workers were among the injured and dead, leading to condemnation from the UN and accusations of violating international law.

Natural News,"Georgia reports record turnout on first day of early voting, with over 328,000 people casting votes or requesting absentee ballots – NaturalNews.com","The residents of Georgia are still grappling with the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, which struck the Southeastern U.S. in late September. But despite the damages, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger confirmed that absentee ballots have been distributed on schedule. (Related: Trump campaign launches initiative encouraging Republicans to embrace early voting and mail-in, absentee ballot options.)
""So far, we have seen just over 250,000 voters request absentee ballots. Perhaps in the next week or so, we'll see that rise up to 300,000 – and that we think will probably look like around five to six percent of all voters will be voting absentee this cycle,"" Raffensperger said on Tuesday, Oct. 15, the first day of early voting in Georgia.
Raffensperger also disclosed new state laws that restrict absentee voting and reduce the availability of drop boxes may be a factor driving more voters to cast their ballots early and in person.
Georgia law previously allowed drop boxes to be available at all hours of the day. But this year, Georgia amended the rule and now drop boxes are only accessible during business hours and at select locations.
However, Georgia did expand early voting hours, including mandatory Saturday voting and optional Sunday voting, which may have helped offset the changes made to absentee ballot rules by providing more flexibility for voters.
In line with this, Gabe Sterling, chief operating officer for Raffensperger's office, disclosed that the state far surpassed its previous first-day voting record of 136,000 in 2020.
""So with the record-breaking first day of early voting and accepted absentees we have had over 328,000 total votes cast so far,"" he posted on X on Wednesday, Oct. 16.
As one of the seven key battleground states that Republicans and Democrats are vigorously fighting for, Georgia is expected to play a very critical role in determining the outcome of the election.
In line with this, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney has handed down a ruling temporarily halting a rule that required election officials to hand-count the number of ballots cast at each polling site. McBurney argued that implementing this rule so close to Election Day could lead to confusion and delay.
""No training has been administered (let alone developed), no protocols for handling write-in ballots have been issued, and no allowances have been made in any county's election budget for additional personnel and other expenses required to implement the Hand Count Rule,"" McBurney wrote in his order on Tuesday. ""The administrative chaos that will – not may – ensue is entirely inconsistent with the obligations of our boards of elections (and the SEB) to ensure that our elections are fair, legal and orderly.""
Moreover, McBurney is also weighing the implications of a separate regulation approved by the board in August. This rule mandates that local election officials carry out a ""reasonable inquiry"" into election results before certifying them.
However, Democrats argue that this could give officials too much leeway to delay certification or even decline to certify election results based on suspected irregularities, which could undermine the electoral process.

Natural News,Constitutional lawyer: New York pro-abortion ballot measure would also establish voting rights of non-citizens – NaturalNews.com,"Proposition 1, known as the Equal Rights Amendment, seeks to enshrine abortion rights by ensuring that ""no person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws of this state."" The amendment would protect individuals based on factors such as race, color, ethnicity, national origin, sex and sexual orientation among others.
However, Bobbi Anne Cox, a constitutional lawyer from Westchester County, argued that the inclusion of ""national origin"" in the language of the amendment could open the door to non-citizens, including undocumented immigrants. Cox, who is leading an opposition to Proposition 1, claimed that non-citizens could receive legal rights equivalent to those of U.S. citizens, which could theoretically extend to voting rights. (Related: Nebraska Supreme Court greenlights hearing of a pro-abortion ballot initiative.)
""It covers anybody. That includes people who came here illegally and broke our laws,"" she said, suggesting it is a ""Trojan horse of epic proportions.""
Cox warned that this amendment could further strain the state and local budgets as taxpayers may be required to fund additional services for undocumented immigrants.
An article from the New York Post in August echoed Cox's sentiment.
According to the news outlet, Proposition 1 would not only protect abortion rights but also mandate extreme ""trans rights"" in New York, legalize rank discrimination and give up parental rights over medical decisions for minors.
""Democrats are selling this 'Equal Rights Amendment' as protecting abortion rights, which are in no way under threat in New York and aren't really what it's about anyway. It's without question the greatest bait-and-switch in Empire State history. New York's Constitution bans discrimination based on race, color, creed or religion; Prop 1 would add new protected categories: ethnicity, national origin, age, disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes and reproductive health care,"" it said.
""Meanwhile, the scrum of other protections adds up to, among other things, stripping parents of their rights over allowing minors to go on puberty blockers and undergo transgender surgery. Worse, the measure also legalizes reverse discrimination to 'prevent or dismantle' the banned forms of discrimination. That is, New York's left-leaning politicians and judges could mandate discrimination based on race, age, gender, religion, etc. as long as they claim to be fighting other such discrimination.""
Proposition 1 is just a ploy to energize Democrat voters in the state, painting it as a cynical attempt to use a progressive agenda to drive election turnout, the New York Post article concluded.

Natural News,INSTITUTIONAL RACISM: Oregon official fired for hiring employees based on merit rather than non-white skin color – NaturalNews.com,"Shaw reportedly disobeyed the decree of forestry DEI chief, Megan Donecker, a rather large, purple-haired woman who commanded him and all other state forestry employees to hire more people whose ancestors suffered historical oppression – but only if they have dark skin. Whites with difficult backgrounds need not apply.
Donecker, a white woman, punished Shaw for hiring people based on merit rather than race by putting him on administrative leave. However, now that news about Shaw's firing has spread, Donecker reportedly slithered away from the situation by resigning from her post, though with specious excuses.
According to Donecker, she did not resign because she did anything wrong to Shaw. No, instead she claims that the environment in which she worked was unsafe because six ""queer"" employees were upset about a lack of departmental concern regarding their choice of personal gender pronouns.
Donecker blamed Shaw for the upset feelings of these six ""queer"" employees, further claiming that Shaw failed to notify her about important meetings in order to circumvent her efforts to change the department's hiring practices to focus more on skin color rather than skillset.
(Related: It is starting to look like woke America is running out of steam as the anti-white DEI industry collapses under the weight of its own vicious racism.)
A self-proclaimed ""accomplice to marginalized communities,"" Donecker had nothing but negative things to say about Shaw, dismissing his hiring approach by comparing it to ""a speeding car on an icy road."" Shaw responded to Donecker's icy road metaphor by stating the following:
""We don't go 60 [mph] out of the gate or we're gonna crash the car.""
There is currently an investigation underway to determine the merits of Shaw's complaint. Donecker, meanwhile, has moved on to work with Oregon's Department of Early Learning and Care as its ""Equity Trainer"" and ""Education Coordinator,"" which means Oregon children will be bombarded with anti-white DEI propaganda as part of their ""learning.""
Donecker will eventually come to realize that she is on the wrong side of history, especially as corporate America is drastically scaling back on DEI. Many large corporations have abandoned their DEI programs in recent days, in part due to investor backlash and a dramatic plunge in productivity among DEI hires.
Even Clackamas County is scaling back its $830,000-per-year DEI office, calling it an ""unnecessary expense"" that ""only foments friction.""
""How can this possibly be legal?"" one confused commenter asked about the situation. ""If you haven't noticed, DEI has worked its way into every aspect of our lives from law enforcement at both the local and federal level to doctors, lawyers, teachers, engineers, the military, corporations, and all other fields.""
""It defies imagination that someone can lose his job because he wanted the public to have the most qualified person for the job, regardless of race, gender, or religion,"" wrote another.
""He sounds like a good administrator. However, this good man got on the 'bad side' of a DEI zealot. He will recover his job and back pay. The deluded and brainwashed pink-haired bovine will lose hers. Unfortunately, this will have to play out many times as people see the true nature of the woke mind virus.""
""She is exactly what I pictured,"" expressed another. ""People like her should not be taken seriously.""

Natural News,New York high schoolers to stage WALKOUTS in protest of ballot measure that will allow trans athletes to participate in girls’ sports – NaturalNews.com,"New York's Proposal 1, also known as the ""Equal Rights Amendment,"" would add language to the New York Bill of Rights to provide that people can't be denied rights based on their ""ethnicity, national origin, age and disability"" as well as due to their ""sex, including sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes and reproductive healthcare and autonomy.""
Campaigners in favor of Proposal 1 are marketing the ballot measure as a pro-abortion measure that would enshrine abortion rights into state law. However, the Coalition to Protect Kids, the main organization that has organized the statewide walkouts, argue that Proposal 1 would not only protect abortion rights but also mandate extreme ""trans rights"" in New York, including the participation of transgender athletes in girls sports.
The statewide demonstration, dubbed ""Walk Off for Fairness Day,"" is organized by the Coalition to Protect Kids with support from the Catholic Church, the New York Republican State Committee and the Conservative Party of New York State. (Related: World Athletics bans transgender athletes from competing in female category at international events.)
""Girls are being systematically canceled in this state, and 'Walk Off for Fairness Day' will give them a safe opportunity to make their voices heard,"" said Coalition spokeswoman Ayesha Kreutz. ""So many of these young women are afraid of speaking out, so they're forced to watch as 50 years of female athletic progress gets washed away by destructive ideologues. Girls are not second-class citizens, so why are they being treated that way?""
Many high school students across New York have spoken out in support of the walkout.
""It's not right for boys to compete against girls in sports. It's a huge disadvantage for girls,"" said Hannah Pompeo, a 16-year soccer player at Eden High School near Buffalo.
Similarly, Millie McCormack, a dancer from Somers High School, stated that she and her sister would join the protest because they believe transgender athletes threaten the fairness of girls' sports. ""I don’t think it’s right for men to be in our safe spaces. We worked hard for places on our teams. Boys have physical advantages we don't have.""
The issue and the event have ignited strong reactions from both sides of the political aisle.
Proposal 1 supporters, like Sasha Ahuja of New Yorkers for Equal Rights, accuse the coalition of misrepresenting the amendment to scare voters.
""There's no bigger bully than the Coalition to Protect Kids – lying to students and parents to scare them into turning on each other,"" said Ahuja. ""Prop 1 is about protecting abortion permanently and preventing government discrimination, full stop — and they know it. In their desperation to make this amendment about anything else, the Coalition to Protect Kids is doing anything but.""
However, State Republican Party Chairman Ed Cox warned that Proposal 1 could undermine Title IX protections for female athletes.
""The Prop 1 ballot amendment would roll back the protections guaranteed to women and girls under Title IX of the Education Amendments signed into law by President Nixon over 50 years ago by giving biological males a constitutional right to compete on girls' teams and taking away the scholarships and playing time these young women have worked so hard for,"" said state Republican Party Chairman Ed Cox.
Meanwhile, Conservative Party Chairman Gerry Kassar argued that girls' sports should remain exclusive to girls. ""It's hard to believe we're even having the conversation that girls' sports would be for anyone other than girls. We fully support 'Walk Off for Fairness Day' in New York, reminding young people that there is safety in numbers. Girls Sports must remain Girls Sports, and there should be nothing controversial in that statement,"" Kassar said.

Natural News,Israel laying claim to southern Lebanon as IDF plants Israeli flags on non-Israeli territory – NaturalNews.com,"?????: ???? ???? ??? ????? ?????? ?-??? ???????@ItayBlumental
(?????: ???? ???? 91 ?????? ????""?) https://t.co/6oJHmUx0lA pic.twitter.com/98B7VLiAKI
— ??? ????? (@kann_news) October 8, 2024
The ""Israel Breaking"" (@IsraelBreaking) X / Twitter account also confirmed the location of the flag at coordinates 33.0986566, 35.4511964.
This move by Israel is hardly a surprise considering what the Benjamin Netanyahu regime has been saying ever since the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack about fighting ""Amalek"" and taking back all the land so Greater Israel can be finalized.
By laying claim to southern Lebanon, Israel is letting the world know that this is not just about fighting in ""self-defense"" so Israel can simply ""exist"" – it is about Israel invading and taking over entire countries as its own.
(Related: The other day, the Jerusalem Post published an article, but then removed it a few days later, claiming that Israel has a biblical mandate to ""conquer"" Lebanon and turn it into Greater Israel.)
This latest round of invasion and conquest started in the Gaza Strip after October 7 and has since expanded to include Lebanon and eventually Iran. Israel is committed to seizing control of land that its government feels belongs to them, regardless of what anyone else thinks about it.
Israel failed to fully capture Maroun al-Ras back in 2006 during the last skirmish, so now its military is showing the world with this flag stunt that it has returned to take what it could not take nearly 20 years ago.
One X / Twitter user pointed out that technically the flag was placed to the south of Maroun al-Rasmuch on the outskirts much closer to Lebanon's border with Israel.
The IDF invasion of southern Lebanon that began on Monday was led by Division 98, which is headed by Brig. Gen. Guy Levi who also led the commando unit, the Egoz special forces unit, the paratroopers and Brigade 7 of the Tank Corp.
From December 2023 through March 2024, Division 98 toppled Hamas in Khan Yunis, its strongest fighting brigade.
""We have a great honor to write history in the North just like we did in Gaza,"" commented Egoz Commander Lt. Col. ""A,"" as they are calling him.
""We started with lower-grade operations, but today, we are starting a more substantial invasion in order to return the northern residents to their homes. This is a substantial matter because we have not invaded Lebanon since 2006. I trust you and am very proud of you and know we will continue to write history.""
According to the IDF, it launched a series of ""limited, localized, and targeted ground raids based on precise intelligence against Hezbollah terrorist targets and infrastructure in southern Lebanon,"" which resulted in the Israeli flag stunt. IDF will now carry out ""a methodical plan set out by the General Staff and the Northern Command, which soldiers have trained and prepared for in recent months.""
U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller told the press on Monday that Israel informed Washington about these ""limited operations targeting Hezbollah infrastructure near the border.""
IDF spokesperson Avichay Adraee also issued a statement in Arabic warning residents of Beirut's suburbs to evacuate for their own safety, while fellow IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari came forward to urge the media not to ""share reports about the forces' activities, due to the security of our forces.""
""Stick to the official reports only and do not spread irresponsible rumors,"" Hagari commanded the media.

Natural News,FEMA runs out of funds for the hurricane season following DHS’s promise to allocate $454M to secure Jewish institutions – NaturalNews.com,"According to him, FEMA is already being stretched in assessing damage from Hurricane Helene, which struck Florida last week, plowing through several states in the Southeast, flooding towns and killing more than 160 people.
""We are meeting the immediate needs with the money that we have. We are expecting another hurricane hitting,"" Mayorkas said. ""FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season."" Hurricane season runs June 1 to Nov. 30, but most hurricanes typically occur in September and October.
He suggested to President Joe Biden and some lawmakers that Congress may need to pass a supplemental spending bill this fall to help states with recovery efforts.
President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris fanned out across the Southeast to witness the damage from the hurricane and claimed to demonstrate commitment and competence in helping devastated communities. Biden is heading to North and South Carolina, while Harris is going to Georgia.
Meanwhile, Congress recently replenished a key source of FEMA's response efforts, providing $20 billion for the agency's disaster relief fund as part of a short-term government spending bill to fund the government through Dec. 20. The bill also gave FEMA flexibility to draw on the money more quickly, as needed.
Incidentally, critics are pointing out that it has just been a month since Mayorkas announced that the U.S. will spend a record $454 million to secure mostly Jewish institutions.
The Times of Israel reported back in August that the federal government will spend nearly $150 million more this year than it did in 2023 ($305 million) to secure religious organizations. DHS said that the money will be spent on the Nonprofit Security Grant Program, which funds security enhancements at houses of worship and religious organizations. Analysts emphasize that this has been the largest sum ever allocated toward the program.
""The funds announced today will provide communities across the country with vital resources necessary to strengthen their security and guard against terrorism and other threats,"" Mayorkas, who is Jewish, said in a statement back then. ""The impact of these grants will be measured in lives saved and tragedies averted.""
Most of the funding has historically gone to Jewish institutions such as synagogues, day schools and other religious organizations.
""The funds are available to all denominations facing credible threats, and in recent years Muslim and Black Christian institutions have applied for funds, often with the guidance of Jewish groups more experienced in the application process,"" the Israeli multi-language online newspaper reported.
Amid the controversy of FEMA losing funds to even conduct operations to recover bodies of those Hurricane Helene left dead, DHS just allocated over $640 million to assist with the arrival of noncitizen migrants. (Related: FEMA doesn't have enough money to get through hurricane season after spending $640 million on MIGRANTS.)
Of the said amount, $300 million will be distributed through the State and Local Assistance Program (SSP-A), while $340.9 million is set aside for competitive funding.
With Helene having already caused catastrophic damage across multiple states, the agency claims to be struggling to keep up with recovery efforts. More than 150,000 households have registered for help. It is expected that over time, the numbers will still increase, said Frank Matranga, an agency representative.
Observers also point out that there's no clear sign that Congress will reconvene ahead of schedule to address this shortfall, especially since most of them are busy campaigning for the election.
Even House Speaker Mike Johnson has shown little interest in changing the legislative calendar, even as some lawmakers push for a supplemental spending bill to keep FEMA afloat.
Hurricane Helene's victims might just be left waiting for help that won't arrive in time. Worse, another hurricane is coming. People are worried that if something doesn't change soon, many Americans could find themselves stranded without the assistance they so desperately need.

Natural News,Trump vows to implement new tax incentives that would boost U.S. auto-manufacturing industry – NaturalNews.com,"In the gathering of about 500 business leaders at the Detroit Economic Club on Oct. 10, Trump proposed the expansion of research and development credits, increased equipment costs for small businesses and consumer tax deductions on car loan interest to appeal to Michigan voters.
The package of incentives also includes a 100 percent tax write-off for heavy equipment in the first year and full expensing for new manufacturing investments. He also proposed doubling the equipment deduction limit for small businesses from $500,000 to $1 million. Additionally, consumers could deduct car loan interest, similar to deductions on home loan interest.
""This will stimulate massive domestic auto production and make car ownership dramatically more affordable for millions and millions of working American families,"" he said, noting that many people in the audience work in the auto industry. (Related: Michigan auto workers blame Biden-Harris EV mandates for industry job cuts.)
Trump also reiterated his commitment to revisiting the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and promised to address perceived imbalances, particularly the growing trade deficits with Mexico and China upon taking office. The U.S. goods trade deficit with Mexico increased by 23.7 percent ($130.5 billion) in 2022, while the deficit with China rose by 8.3 percent ($382.3 billion) during the same period. The USMCA, signed into law in 2020, replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The former president presented his proposals as a ""detailed plan to save the American auto industry."" In turn, he guaranteed voters that his policies would reverse job losses, claiming: ""You vote for Trump, and you will see a mass exodus of manufacturing jobs, but from Mexico to Michigan, from Shanghai to Sterling Heights.""
On Oct. 3, Trump made similar claims about the U.S. auto-manufacturing industry, announcing his plans to encourage manufacturers to produce goods in the United States by lowering corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 15 percent for U.S.-based manufacturers and proposing a 100 percent tariff on imported automobiles. Trump also pledged to cut gasoline prices by 50 percent within one year of taking office by boosting domestic oil production and doubling electricity production, which he believes will further attract manufacturers.
Moreover, Trump pledged to enhance protections for industries essential to national interests, such as steel and automotive sectors by implementing higher tariffs, a measure that Harris has consistently criticized as a tax on the American public.
""I want tariffs, but there has to be reciprocity,"" Trump said, meaning an equal trade footing between the United States and other countries. ""Without that tariff, every single one of the Detroit Big Three could right now be out of business.""
When asked about Chinese automakers locating plants in Mexico in an attempt to sell electric vehicles in the U.S., Trump said: ""I will impose whatever tariffs are required ... 100 percent, 200 percent, whatever is necessary.""

Natural News,I resigned from Canada’s largest broadcasting corporation over its complicity in Israel’s genocide – NaturalNews.com,"(Article by Arfa Rana republished from Mondoweiss.net)
Days after October 7, 2023, I sat across from a CBC executive who appeared uneasy yet curious about my concerns over CBC’s coverage of Hamas’ attack on Israel. I was appalled by CBC’s lack of historical context between Israel and Palestine and the language used to defend Israel’s massacre of Palestinians.
The executive appeared empathetic but then quoted CBC’s stance on impartiality and the importance of “balanced coverage”. But, I argued, when crimes against humanity are being committed, there is no such thing as both sides to a story. There is only the truth.
After sharing my concerns with the executive, I was strategically dismissed from daily pitch meetings for a few weeks. But as the war amplified and I returned to my seat at the table, I continuously brought up to my peers and editors that labeling genocide as the “Israel-Hamas war” falsely portrays that both Palestinians and Israelis are on even-playing fields. This narrative ignores that for 76 years, Palestinians have been forcibly ousted from their homes, confined to the barbed wires of the Gaza Strip, and have been under constant surveillance of Israeli settlers.
Instead of being receptive, senior journalists in the newsroom parroted CBC’s Language Guide, which highlights the language CBC uses.
The CBC Language Guide on the Middle East is a catastrophic oxymoron. The guide prohibits using the term “colonization” but encourages journalists to provide context by saying Palestinians “fled or were forced from their homes”. The targeted killings of Palestinians are referred to as “collective punishment” and the term “occupied” is “OK to use…if an adjective is needed”. “Apartheid”, a policy in which people are separated based on racial or ethnic criteria, is discouraged when describing the barrier between West Bank and Israel that separates Israelis from Palestinians. Finally, a senior producer told me that acknowledging Palestine is like referring to Persia – an outdated term that refers to a historical region – despite Palestine being recognized by the United Nations.
In January, The Breach reported that CBC acknowledged to a reader’s complaint that they reserve terms such as “massacre”, “brutal” and “slaughter” in reference to Hamas’ October 7 attacks but attribute neutral language around Israeli attacks because they are “carried out remotely”. The complainant, retired professor Jeff Winch, argued CBC’s biased language skews “the reader’s empathy towards Israel and away from Palestinians—a further dehumanizing of an already downtrodden people.”
I wondered then, was impartiality an excuse for complicity?
In formerly colonized countries, journalism is used as a decolonization tool to grant a voice to those silenced by authoritarian governments and institutions. In contrast, the CBC’s goal to report “impartially” by calling the invasion of Lebanon and growing death toll in Gaza the “Israel-Hamas war” reflects their own subjectivity and moral failure to side with justice.
Israel is undoubtedly a settler colonial force and Charles Mills explains in The Racial Contract that settler colonialism has various tools it uses to achieve the upper hand over colonized peoples – one being institutions that act as their right arm to justify their actions.
CBC’s journalistic practices are an offense to dozens of journalists like Shireen Abu Akleh, a Palestinian journalist targeted and killed by the IDF, and Arshad Sharif, a Pakistani journalist killed after vocalizing his stance against the Pakistani army. Both put their lives at the forefront of their work to stand for the greater good of humanity.
Instead, Canadian journalists who voice their moral duty to stand on the right side of history are silenced under the banner of objectivity—a concept that, although great in theory, is still man-made and injected with the biases of the master who leads the institution.
By the time I resigned, I had become a shell of myself. The constant tug-of-war between my conscience and CBC’s Language guide was an uphill battle that I could no longer fight. The language used at CBC to describe the atrocities in Gaza was hammered into my subconscious and fogged my critical thinking. I began to believe that, perhaps, Israel may not be in the wrong. CBC is the truth-teller and it is I, the trouble-maker, who deserved the dismissive demeanor of my peers to whom I consistently pitched stories with Palestinian voices.
It took months to clear my mind and when it did, I understood that impartiality was a concept that was used to avoid confrontation from state actors, politicians, and Israeli lobbyists. By doing so, journalists working for mainstream Canadian media had cowered into the role of stenographers, leaving Palestinians defenseless in the face of genocide. But lying low to avoid backlash only empowers the wrongdoers to continue inflicting injustices on the oppressed, the language not only minimizes the brutality of the oppressor but justifies it.
Now is the time for journalists to use their power to change the opinions of the masses through the stories they write. After all, truth-telling is not only a moral human obligation, but for journalists, it is also a revolutionary act.

Natural News,Trump campaign asks for heightened security due to increasing threats attributed to Iran – NaturalNews.com,"The calls for enhanced security arrive amid increasing concerns over threats from Iran, which American officials have stated are still active in plotting to harm the former president. Trump campaign advisers have even advised the former president that they have received intelligence updates warning of the ongoing threat posed by Iran.
Reports strongly suggest that Iranian elements are planning to launch drones or missiles to take down Trump.
Trump's campaign has asked for military vehicles to be used to transport the former president following at least two assassination attempts in the past four months. The campaign has also asked for widened flight restrictions over Trump's properties and rally venues, as well as the pre-positioning of ballistic glass in rally sites at seven key battleground states.
A report mentioned that Susie Wiles, the campaign manager for Trump, directly contacted Secret Service Acting Director Ronald Rowe Jr. concerning security flaws.
Wiles stated that a recent public event had to be canceled at the last moment because of the lack of Secret Service personnel, requiring Trump to meet with reporters in a closed setting instead.
The Trump campaign has shown frustration over the allegedly insufficient protections it is receiving, claiming that the lack of security is affecting the planning of future events.
Meanwhile, Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi released a statement assuring that the former president is receiving ""the highest levels of protection.""
""The former president is receiving the highest level of technical security assets, which include unmanned aerial vehicles, counter unmanned aerial surveillance systems, ballistics and other advanced technology systems,"" Guglielmi said.
He also stated that the Department of Defense regularly assists in Trump's protection along with explosive ordnance disposal, canine units and airlift transportation.
Guglielmi added the Secret Service has been limiting air traffic over the former president's residence and when he travels.
The Trump campaign has been lobbying the Secret Service for extra protections for the former president since the first attempt against his life in July at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, where a bullet scraped Trump's ear.
After this incident, the campaign has asked to travel with additional planes and to use aircraft that do not have Trump's name displayed, in an effort to reduce his profile.
On the ground, Trump's motorcades are also occasionally divided as an additional security measure.
In light of perceived attempts by the federal government to prevent additional security resources from being diverted to Trump's campaign, the administration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris has been accused of election interference.
The Biden-Harris administration said it is examining what additional supplementary measures can be given to meet the Trump campaign's requests for extra protection. (Related: Trump accuses Biden-Harris admin of committing ELECTION INTERFERENCE by depriving him of security.)

Natural News,Too busy helping illegals: FEMA passes responsibility to a private hospital for body recovery post-Helene – NaturalNews.com,"This was revealed in a video of a woman exposing what they heard from FEMA executives at the airport. The said footage was shared on X, formerly Twitter, by the handle Wall Street Apes.
""Picked up a flight of pediatric medical supplies that were brought in and are going to North Asheville,"" the woman said. ""We were sitting in the private portion of the airport and we got to overhear an awful lot. The army pilots, the navy pilots, hospital representatives, there was a lot of chatter.""
According to the woman, Mission Hospital was told that ""it is going to be the morgue center for body recovery of all the fatalities of Helene."" She added that the Army Chinook helicopters that can be seen flying are already doing body recovery.
""So, they told Mission Hospital they are not sending refrigerated trucks,"" she said. ""Whatever fatality numbers you are hearing, go ahead and add a couple of zeros.""
The woman noted that FEMA was too busy helping illegal immigrants that it passed the responsibility to a private hospital and the army to take over body recovery post-Helene. She also revealed in the clip how private individuals, with their private helicopters and private planes, are the ones who are flying in supplies. (Related: FEMA under Biden now CONFISCATING donations made to Hurricane Helene survivors.)
""I was at Hangar 10. I was picking up supplies. There was a stack for the Cajun Navy. There was a stack that looked like it was [ American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals] ASPCA. These are all being sent by private individuals. FEMA is doing nothing,"" she said.
This development contradicts what DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters in July.
""FEMA is tremendously prepared. This is what we do, this is what they do, and the key here … is to also make sure the communities who are potentially impacted are prepared as well,"" Mayorkas said at the time. ""And it's not just hurricanes and wildfires – also extreme heat, which certainly some parts of the United States are experiencing.""
His previous statement is now haunting Mayorkas as Hurricane Helene exposed the agency's shortcomings. According to Mayorkas, FEMA is running out of funds as hurricane season continued to slam the southeastern United States. The organization has enough funds to deal with the aftermath of Helene but ""would not have enough to make it through the season,"" he admitted.
Mayorkas argued that FEMA's disaster relief fund remained in a precarious position and needed fresh funding from Congress ahead of an expected heavy hurricane season. He stressed the need to be ready for the ""consequences"" of increasingly severe weather events.

Natural News,TREASON: Newsom signs new bill STOPPING local governments from requiring ID to vote in California – NaturalNews.com,"The move appears to be pushback against a controversial ballot measure that voters approved earlier this year in the city of Huntington Beach requiring people to present photo ID when they show up at the polls. The measure passed with 53.4% of the votes and would also increase the number of in-person voting sites and monitor the ballot dropboxes used for local elections.
As a charter city, the Republican-led city says that it has home rule over administering elections. However, California Secretary of State Shirley Weber and Attorney General Rob Bonta sued the city to invalidate the law on the grounds that it interferes with the state's voting rights protections.
In a statement about Huntington Beach’s measure, Bonta claimed: “State election law already contains robust voter ID requirements with strong protections to prevent voter fraud, while ensuring that every eligible voter can cast their ballot without hardship. Imposing unnecessary obstacles to voter participation disproportionately burdens low-income voters, voters of color, young or elderly voters, and people with disabilities.”
In other words, he’s afraid it would make it harder for those groups who traditionally vote for Democrats to cast their ballot – but the unspoken part here is that it would also make it harder to rig the vote.
Huntington Beach never responded to the lawsuit, but it’s a moot point with the new state-wide law going into effect.
The new legislation prompted immediate backlash from Elon Musk, who referred to Newsom as “The Joker.”
He wrote on X: ""Wow, it is now illegal to require voter ID in California! They just made PREVENTING voter fraud against the law. The Joker is in charge.""
Right now, California is just one of 14 states that does not have an identification requirement for voting. Some of the other states on this list include Nevada, Oregon, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, Maine and New York.
Meanwhile, 24 states require voters to present photo identification. For example, in Florida, voters must present both a photo and signature ID. Eleven states allow people to vote using forms of identification that do not have a photo, such as a utility bill or bank statement with the voter’s name and address.
With Election Day fast approaching, many people who remember what happened in 2020 are rightfully concerned about how easy it would be to manipulate the vote. There is no question that voter ID laws can do a lot to prevent many of the most common types of fraud, such as impersonating registered voters at the polls, preventing people who are not citizens from casting their ballots, and preventing people from registering in multiple jurisdictions.
While liberals love to claim that this prevents certain groups of people from voting, the truth is that Americans across all backgrounds and political views overwhelmingly support the idea of requiring identification to vote.
In fact, a poll carried out by the Honest Elections Project found that 77% of all Americans are in favor of requiring photo ID to cast a ballot and just 14% are opposed. They also found that 76% of low-income voters, 77% of Hispanic voters, and 64% of black voters support voter ID laws.

Natural News,Iran says Israel faces “crushing defeat” if it responds to ballistic missile counterattack with more force – NaturalNews.com,"After Iran rained down hundreds of missiles on Israel for assassinating top Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah this past week, Israel started talking about a response that Iran says should be avoided unless Israel wants to incur more damages.
The media is reporting that Iran's counterattack against Israel is the largest to have ever occurred. Some of the missiles were intercepted by Israel and its best friend the United States, while others struck their intended targets, including in heavily populated Tel Aviv.
With the exception of one Palestinian civilian in the West Bank, no other civilian deaths were reported inside Israeli territory. An Israeli official did confirm that ""several hits were identified and the damage is being assessed.""
(Related: Ever since the U.S. illegally invaded Iraq in 2003 under George W. Bush, the U.S. has maintained full control over Iraq's oil revenues – talk about a scam deal for the Iraqis.)
U.S. officials were quick to downplay the Iranian attack. President Biden and national security adviser Jake Sullivan both described what Iran did as ""defeated and ineffective,"" reiterating that they and their regime stand with Israel no matter what.
The two-wave attack involved about 180 missiles – some sources are claiming closer to 200 missiles – that saw mixed success. Some were intercepted by U.S. Navy destroyers and Israel's air defense systems working in tandem.
Iran says it is done responding to Israel, assuming there are no further Israeli attacks on Iran. Should Israel proceed to poke the hornets' nest again, Iran is planning to respond with ""a crushing defeat.""
""We will protect the citizens of Israel,"" proclaimed Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari. ""This attack will have consequences. We have plans. We will act at the time and place of our choosing.""
Sullivan also commented to suggest that Iran's counterattack on Israel ""is a significant escalation on the part of Iran."" Once again, instead of noting that Iran was responding to what Israel did first, Sullivan painted a picture of Israel being the victim against Iran, the aggressor.
""There will be severe consequences for this Iranian attack and we will work with Israel to make sure that is the case,"" Sullivan continued.
Rather than focus on U.S. citizens, and especially those whose lives were destroyed by Hurricane Helene, the Biden regime is busy doing Israel's bidding just the same as U.S. regimes before it, including both Democrat and Republican regimes.
Instead of focusing on the Americans they were voted into office to represent, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have been busy watching the situation in Israel from the Situation Room. The Israeli Security Cabinet was simultaneously watching from its own bunker near Jerusalem.
What this all means is that Israel is now at war with two of Iran's allied militias at the same time: Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Iran has said it wants to avoid a full-scale regional war, but Israel seems hellbent on creating one in order to achieve Netanyahu's goals.
Iran's first-ever direct attack on Israeli territory occurred back in April when it sent drones and missiles Israel's way. This latest attack by Iran using ballistic missiles represents a serious escalation since Israel has a lot harder time deterring these kinds of missiles.
""Ballistic missiles can reach Israel within 12 minutes, while drones and cruise missiles leave more time to defend against,"" Axios reported about the differences.
Will all this back and forth between Israel and its neighbors result in a full-scale war? Find out more at Prophecy.news.

Natural News,Judge grants preliminary injunction blocking California’s new election deepfake ban: “The law likely violates First Amendment” – NaturalNews.com,"The law – Assembly Bill 2839 – allowed any person to sue distributors of artificial intelligence-generated deepfakes within 120 days of an election and up to 60 days after if the perpetrator's post resembled a political candidate.
United States District Judge John A. Mendez said AI and deepfakes pose significant risks, but he ruled that the law likely violates the First Amendment.
""Most of A.B. 2839 acts as a hammer instead of a scalpel, serving as a blunt tool that hinders humorous expression and unconstitutionally stifles the free and unfettered exchange of ideas which is so vital to American democratic debate,"" Mendez wrote. (Related: AI-generated deepfakes are beginning to sway public opinion all over the world.)
The law took effect immediately after California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed it. The Democrat signed two other bills at the time aimed at cracking down on the use of AI to create false images or videos in political ads ahead of the 2024 election. They are among the toughest laws of their kind in the nation.
The decision comes from a case involving Christopher Kohls, known as ""Mr Reagan"" on X. He created a controversial AI-altered campaign video back in July mocking Vice President Kamala Harris. This video went viral and was even shared by X owner Elon Musk.
A lawyer representing Kohls filed a lawsuit against California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Secretary of State Shirley N. Weber to block the new law a day after Newsom signed it into law.
Existing laws only prohibit the distribution of materially deceptive audio or visual media of a candidate within 60 days of an election. The new law expands the ban to 120 days before an election in California and, in some cases, 60 days after an election is held.
Newsom also signed two other laws aimed at taking down political AI deepfakes on the same day, though they won't be in effect until January. The law allows California judges to order distributors of AI deepfakes to take them down or potentially face monetary penalties.
Mendez said Kohls is ""likely to succeed on his state constitutional claim"" and granted the motion for a preliminary injunction on Oct. 2. Mendez agreed with Kohls' lawyer that the AI deepfake of Harris was merely ""satire"" that should be protected by the First Amendment.
""While a well-founded fear of a digitally manipulated media landscape may be justified, this fear does not give legislators unbridled license to bulldoze over the longstanding tradition of critique, parody and satire protected by the First Amendment,"" said Mendez
Izzy Gardon, a spokesperson for Newsom, said the laws protect democracy and preserve free speech.
""We're confident the courts will uphold the state's ability to regulate these types of dangerous and misleading deepfakes,"" he said in a statement. ""Satire remains alive and well in California – even for those who miss the punchline.""

Natural News,Top 7 SCAPEGOATS of the LEFT and the most popular forms of disinformation on the planet – NaturalNews.com,"This has never been more commonplace than what the extreme Leftists, who are currently in control of many government organizations, mainstream media and most social media, are doing right now to mislead, misinform and cast blame on others for their own atrocities. It’s called scapegoating, and we’re identifying the top 7 popular scapegoats that the Democrats, Globalists, Big Tech, Big Media and Big Pharma use right now.
#1. Russia, Russia, Russia – why not blame those pesky Russians and Putin for every crisis America creates overseas?
#2. Climate Change – every heat wave, tornado, hurricane, earthquake, tsunami, flood, drought, and even mass migration is blamed on global warming, now renamed as “climate change.”
#3. White people (and straight people) – if you’re not “colored” or “gay” then you were born a racist, bigoted, privileged, white supremacist who must now forfeit all money, land and children to the “less fortunate” non-white, pan-genders and illegal immigrants.
#4. Trump – Orange Man Bad! The Left blames Trump for all Democrat-owned and operated mistakes, mishaps and failures.
#5. Guns – The Left always blames guns, not people or SSRI drugs, for mass shootings.
#6. Misinformation and Disinformation – The kings of fake news always label truth media and whistleblowers as spreaders of misinformation.
#7. The Unvaccinated – Supposedly, every person who ever contracted a virus, bacteria, pathogens or parasites only got sick because an unvaccinated person spread it to a vaccinated person, even though the sole purpose of “vaccines” is to prevent this from happening.
It’s the 8-year scapegoat with no end in sight. Besides the insane, radical Democrat politicians in Washington DC, who else wants to start a nuclear war with Russia and wind up dying from radiation, chemical poisoning, starvation and domestic rioting? Who else wants American taxpayer money, by the trillions, to go directly into the pockets of millionaire and billionaire war mongers who feed and fuel the military industrial complex, while blaming Russia for being “aggressive” and trying to “take over the world” one nation at a time?
Isn’t it ironic that the most radical, insane, Marxist, Communist, Socialist freaks of the Democrat Party blame Russia for being “aggressive” and trying to control other countries? America is currently involved in multiple proxy wars, bombing innocent civilians, putting our own military on the front lines, all while lying to the American public about it, claiming we’re not at war and there are no boots on the ground.
These same lying American politicians claimed Trump colluded with Russia to win the 2016 election, with no proof at all, still. Still, MSM runs the headlines “Russia” and “Putin” … and just fill in the rest with any name or blame that should be cast on the DC cabal of communists known as “Democrats.”
Ever seen a hurricane develop in the middle of a U.S. state and get stronger over land? That’s the new “climate change” narrative and cover story for extreme weather modification and manipulation technology, that creates rain, wind and even starts fires (usually where mainly conservatives own land).
Ever seen a hurricane originate in the Gulf of Mexico and move directly east? That’s the new “climate change” style storm that has nothing to do with all the patents for weather modification tools and technology listed by NOAA, DoD and FEMA.

Natural News,University of Kansas lecturer suspended after suggesting men who don’t want to vote for Kamala Harris should be shot – NaturalNews.com,"Phillip Lowcock, a lecturer in KU's Department of Health, Sport and Exercise Sciences, was placed on administrative leave after a video surfaced of him calling for violence against men in the United States.
""[If you think] guys are smarter than girls, you've got some serious problems,"" he said in the now-viral clip. ""That's what frustrates me. There are going to be some males in our society that will refuse to vote for a potential female president because they don't think females are smart enough to be president.""
""We could line all those guys up and shoot them. They clearly don't understand the way the world works,"" Lowcock continued. ""Did I say that? Scratch that from the recording. I don't want the deans hearing that I said that.""
Lowcock does not mention Harris by name, and the clip shows him commenting rhetorically on the concept that men will only refuse to vote for her and other female candidates because they are women. (Related: Unhinged and more dangerous than they were in 2016, liberal Democrats will become even more violent after eight years of Trump Derangement Syndrome eating away at their brains.)
It should also be noted that the other major candidate in the election, former President Donald Trump, has never claimed that Harris is ineligible for the presidency because she is a woman, but has instead referred to her as incapable of wielding the powers of the presidency because of her character and her policies.
Lowcock's remarks were immediately condemned for the violent rhetoric targeting men – both conservatives and liberals who prefer Trump over Harris. Kansas Sens. Roger Marshall and Jerry Moran, both Republicans, took to social media to air their disagreements.
""This is disturbing and inappropriate,"" wrote Moran. ""There should never be a call for violence anytime or anywhere in the classroom. We must cool down the political rhetoric and be respectful and civil to each other, and that is especially true for someone charged with teaching our young people.""
""This guy shouldn't be within 100 yards of a university and I am calling for his swift termination,"" said Marshall. ""The University of Kansas must fire this professor immediately. Anyone who says that people who don't vote for Kamala Harris should be 'lined up and shot' is completely deranged and shouldn't be around students nor in academia. This promotion of political violence should be met with quick action.""
In two statements, KU confirmed that it is aware of the video of Lowcock and that he has been placed on administrative leave, pending further investigation.
""The instructor offers his sincerest apologies and deeply regrets the situation,"" said KU Director of News and Media Relations Erinn Barcomb-Peterson. ""His intent was to emphasize his advocacy for women's rights and equality, and he recognizes he did a very poor job of doing so. The university has an established process for situations like this and will follow that process.""
The university noted that it has a process for working through these kinds of situations based on the school's Ethical Code of Conduct.
""It is equally important that we, as a government entity [public research university], not stifle the lawful dissemination of ideas, even if some members of our community find those ideas abhorrent. We must always be a place where all members can meaningfully connect, discuss challenging issues, develop well-considered opinions and perspectives and, as is so often necessary, agree to disagree,"" KU's Ethical Code of Conduct states.
""The University recognizes that the free exchange of ideas is fundamental to the scholarly process. The professionalism of our discourse is an individual and collective responsibility of all University employees.""

Natural News,Rasmussen predicting Trump will win Pennsylvania – NaturalNews.com,"Mitchell’s latest polling data from this pivotal swing state shows that Trump went from a virtual tie with Kamala to gaining a three-point advantage, this according to Rasmussen's September survey.
""When I polled Pennsylvania in September, I had a tie,"" Mitchel said during a recent interview with Benny Johnson.
""But that really was – you know – some of these major events they get a lot of press coverage on, they do get a juice for about two or three weeks. I think it is more what pollsters call a response bias than anybody actually changing their mind.""
Mitchell emphasized that he believes this phenomenon reflects what pollsters refer to as response bias rather than a genuine shift in public opinion. Apparently, there was an overrepresentation of Democrats in that month's poll, while the most recent figures for October show that Trump now leads over Kamala in Pennsylvania.
""When we conducted our fieldwork, we found Trump up by three in Pennsylvania,"" Mitchell stated.
?MASSIVE
Rasmussen Head Pollster Mark Mitchell confirms Kamala’s cataclysmic polling collapse— puts Pennsylvania in Trump’s column:
“It’s done. Trump's winning Pennsylvania."" pic.twitter.com/unNr3pdW0F
— Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) October 14, 2024
(Related: Have you checked out our report about how Wisconsin rigged the vote in 2020 and plans to do the same thing again this fall?)
The pollster further pointed out that, despite some surveys featured in polling aggregates like the RealClearPolitics (RCP) average still suggesting a slight tilt towards Kamala in Pennsylvania, many of these same surveys presented inflated expectations for Joe Biden during the 2020 election as well.
One such poll that Mitchell specifically referenced, the New York Times / Sienna poll, ""oversampled supporters of Biden in 2020 by eight points,"" he revealed. Once this oversampling was adjusted for, the same poll ended up showing that Pennsylvania is actually in favor of ""Trump plus four.""
RCP, by the way, has said that Trump could actually be headed towards an Electoral College landslide, this at a time when mere weeks remain until Election Day. The polling aggregate forecasts that Trump currently leads over Kamala in five out of the seven most crucial battle ground states.
As promising as this seems for Trump, some of his supporters are still concerned that voters will become complacent and not even bother to show up at the polls.
""Do not get complacent,"" one of them wrote on X / Twitter. ""Take five people with you to vote for Trump. Get every last possible vote for Trump in Pennsylvania!""
Another noted that the last day to register to vote in Pennsylvania is October 21.
""Fight like we are 10 points down,"" wrote another Trump fan. ""Because with the cheating machine and the illegal vote, we are.""
Someone else blasted Rasmussen polls as a ""fraud"" and a ""joke,"" warning people not to believe anything the polling source states.
""Pennsylvania is direct entry into the White House,"" said another, writing that the state is ""a make or break for Trump or Harris.""
""A great deal of Kamala's support at the Hollywood / elite level is from compromised individuals who are afraid of being exposed once Trump is in office,"" expressed another.
""Have we forgotten about the millions of migrants they've allowed in through the border in battleground states?"" asked another. ""There have already been reports of these people in certain places admitting to being registered to vote or having already voted.""

Natural News,"Biden administration approves $2.2 billion weapons sale to Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates – NaturalNews.com","The Department of Defense declared that the Department of State has approved the sale of weapons and ammunition to the two Middle East nations which was estimated at over $2.2 billion.
""The proposed sale will improve Saudi Arabia's capability to meet current and future threats and improve interoperability with systems operated by U.S. Forces and other Gulf countries. Saudi Arabia's continued investment in its defensive capabilities is crucial to protecting its borders, energy infrastructure, and its residents,"" the Pentagon said.
The move is seen as a renewed show of support to two allies that are critical to the United States' response against Iran and its proxies as conflict intensifies in the Middle East. (Related: Biden administration approves $583M arms sale to Saudi Arabia and $85M sale to the U.A.E.)
The State Department informed Congress it approved the sale of Hellfire and Sidewinder missiles, in addition to artillery, tank and machine gun ammunition to Saudi Arabia in a deal worth more than $1 billion. Unless Congress moves to stop the proposed sales, the contractors and receiving nations can start negotiations on contracts.
As stated by separate press releases issued by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, Saudi Arabia has been authorized to buy Hellfire II missiles for $655 million; ammunition for artillery systems, machine guns and tanks priced at roughly $139 million; and missiles and support programs worth $252 million.
The U.A.E. has also been approved for a possible sale of munitions worth $1.2 billion. The details of the U.A.E. deal involve the purchase of 259 Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS), 1,554 M31A1 rockets and 203 Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS). The deal also incorporates training programs, software development, and engineering and logistics support services.
For Saudi Arabia, the initial deal included approval for the sale of 220 AIM-9X Block II Sidewinder missiles worth $252 million, along with training and technical and logistical support programs. The second deal consists of artillery systems, machine guns, tanks and other equipment worth $139 million, together with 10,000 M456 105mm anti-tank rounds, in addition to various ammunition for tanks, howitzers, machine guns and hand grenades. The third deal involves the sale of 2,503 AGM-114R3 Hellfire II missiles, as well as technical and logistical support programs.
The statement suggested that these deals will advance U.S. foreign policy and national security goals by supporting the security of major regional partners, contributing to political stability and economic progress in the Middle East. It will also improve the capabilities of Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. to confront present and future threats by modernizing their armed forces.
The statements confirmed that these deals and the accompanying support ""will not alter the basic military balance in the region.""

Natural News,"Texas AG Ken Paxton SUING Big Pharma for illegal scheme that jacked up insulin prices by 1,000% – NaturalNews.com","In a statement, Paxton revealed that Big Pharma is attempting to take full advantage of diabetes patients by driving up insulin prices as high as they possibly can, money and lots of it being the ""cure"" for the pharmaceutical industry's insatiable greed problem.
""This is a disturbing conspiracy by which pharmaceutical companies were intentionally and artificially inflating the price of insulin,"" Paxton tweeted. ""Big Pharma insulin manufacturers and PBMs worked together to take advantage of diabetes patients and drive prices as high as they could.""
""These companies acted illegally and unethically to enrich themselves, and we will hold them accountable.""
(Related: Did you know that insulin injections more than double the risk of death in type 2 diabetics?)
Paxton specifically called out pharmacy benefit managers, including Eli Lilly, Express Scripts and CVS Pharmacy, as the co-conspirators in this insulin racket, which will price many diabetics out of their medicine.
""Through this conspiracy, the manufacturers artificially and willingly raised the prices of insulin then [sic] paid a significant, undisclosed portion back to the PBMs as a quid pro quo for inclusion in the PBMs' standard offerings,"" he says.
""The PBMs then granted preferred status to the manufacturer whose drug has the highest list price while excluding lower priced drugs. These synthetic insulin drugs, which today cost the manufacturers less than $2 to produce and were originally priced at $20 when released in the late 1990s, now range between $300 and $700.""
According to Paxton, what these pharmaceutical giants are doing violates the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act, constitutes unjust enrichment, and represents an unlawful civil conspiracy.
""While the PBM Defendants represent that they perform their services on behalf of their clients (including Texas payors) and diabetics to lower drug prices, increase access to affordable drugs, and promote diabetic health, these representations are false,"" the defendants in Paxton's case argue in their defense.
""Rather, the PBM Defendants have worked in coordination with the Manufacturer Defendants to distort the market for diabetic treatments to their benefit at the expense of Texas diabetics and payors.""
Paxton remains painfully silent about the damage the pharmaceutical industry caused to humanity with its Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) ""vaccines."" Some are wondering if he plans to go after them, too, once he gets done with this lawsuit.
""When you have time, sue the hell out of Moderna for their one hit wonder myocarditis epidemic gene therapy vaccine,"" wrote one person on X / Twitter. ""7.7% of the recipients of the gift that keeps on giving have had their lives changed forever thanks to false assertions of safe and effective.""
Another called on Paxton to take a closer look at the root causes of diabetes and address those rather than just make a big deal about the cost of treating the symptoms.
""Now look towards the question as to why we have the health problem to begin with,"" this user said. ""We can't keep slapping bandaids on everything.""
The Health Ranger gave a shoutout to Paxton calling what he is doing to fight insulin price gouging ""Outstanding!""
""All of these companies need to be held accountable for their corruption,"" wrote another.
""We recently paid about $12 for a topical rosacea skin medicine in eastern Europe,"" told another about how much cheaper drugs are overseas compared to here in the U.S.
""Identical med brand formula and manufacturer costs well over $110 here in the U.S. No generic available in U.S. Medicare only covers this in a foam, not the gel. Will be buying several more next time we visit the in-laws.""

Natural News,Judge strikes down New York law mandating moving local elections to even-numbered years as UNCONSTITUTIONAL – NaturalNews.com,"The ruling by NYSC Justice Gerard Neri was celebrated by state Republicans who claimed that the move violated local autonomy and was a clearly partisan effort by state Democrats who wanted this law passed to gain an electoral edge.
Republican lawmakers accused the bill's sponsors of playing politics by moving local elections to higher-turnout federal election years. Local races in even years would be overshadowed by larger and more heavily-funded state and federal elections, they warned.
The Democratic sponsors of the law claimed that moving local elections for town supervisor, county executive and some other local posts away from odd-numbered years would increase voter turnout, as New York voters are more interested in participating in state and federal elections. (Related: Constitutional lawyer: New York pro-abortion ballot measure would also establish voting rights of non-citizens.)
""This is also to help with trying to just get the average voter to be able to breathe a little bit in between having to go out and run to the polls,"" said Democratic State Sen. James Skoufis, noting that his fellow Democrat lawmakers will appeal the ruling.
""This case was always going to be appealed and I fully expect a more objective panel of judges to rule in favor of the law’s constitutionality. In the meantime, the plaintiffs continue to waste local tax dollars on their senseless crusade to preserve lower turnout in elections.""
In response to the law, state Republicans sued the New York state government, leading to Neri's 26-page ruling arguing that the state constitution says the New York State Legislature can act only in relation to ""the property, affairs or government"" of the state ""only by general law.""
Even if legislators acted through a special law, they did not promote a substantial state interest or concern, according to Neri. The magistrate argued that it is more important for state officials to promote voter education programs as a means of increasing turnout rather than mandating that all elections outside of New York City be held on even-numbered years.
The law does not affect New York City elections, which are held on odd-numbered years, since there are specific provisions under the state constitution guaranteeing that the city can keep holding elections on odd-numbered years.
Neri said the law raises questions over the federal requirement that governments provide equal protection to people under the law.
""Are the urbane voters of New York City less likely to be confused by odd-year elections than the rubes living in Upstate and Long Island?"" Neri asked. He also argued that aligning local and federal elections would cause the size of the ballot to balloon, supporting concerns from plaintiffs that keeping the law in place would stoke confusion and cause some voters to stay home.
The issue is exacerbated by not all elections being consolidated to even years. Under the law, some races outside of New York City, including those for sheriff and district attorney, can still be held during odd years.
""While the Even Year Election Law would impact virtually every county outside of New York City, certain county offices and the entirety of New York City remain exempt. The proffered reason for this is that it would take a constitutional amendment to change elections for those offices. As we have seen with Article IX, the fact is it would take a constitutional amendment to change the elections for any local offices,"" the judge wrote.
""The purported state interest does not pass the smell test. Voters participate when they are aware, informed, and believe their vote matters. Timing, as evidenced by the above, is a secondary or tertiary concern. Further distinguishing state from local concern is the fact that none of the affected offices are state offices. There is simply no state interest in the timing and changing of terms of local offices.""

Natural News,Pro-life organization condemns Trudeau government for making it “easier” to kill babies with online abortion portal – NaturalNews.com,"""Abortion in Canada,"" which was activated on Sept. 26, provides users with guidance and resources, including information on types of abortion, available support systems and government initiatives related to reproductive health and abortion services. The portal, accessible through the Canada.ca website under the Health-Healthy-Living-Sexual-Reproductive Health section, easily directs women to abortion facilities and attacks life-saving crisis pregnancy centers.
Pete Baklinski, the director of communications for the Campaign Life Coalition (CLC), said the portal makes it ""easier for Canadians to kill their unborn babies.""
""The Trudeau Liberals just launched a new'‘abortion services portal' to make it easier for Canadians to kill their preborn children,"" Baklinski posted on X. (Related: Texas AG Ken Paxton sues Biden HHS over proposed rule that would hide abortion info from criminal investigations.)
Baklinski also argued that the federal government and the online abortion portal misrepresent abortion as healthcare through misleading information.
""The government portal falsely calls abortion 'healthcare.' Abortion has nothing to do with ‘health’ or care for others. It has everything to do with destroying lives, relationships, and undermining the nation,"" he wrote. Baklinski also added that the site ""outright lies by stating that women have a 'fundamental right' to choose abortion,"" when in fact there is no ""right"" to abortion in Canada.
""It’s not in the Charter. It didn't come from the 1988 Morgentaler decision. It's nowhere. Just plain government lies.""
Moreover, Baklinski defended crisis pregnancy centers as the abortion portal warned the public about it with a yellow warning sign.
""Predictably, the portal warns users about 'crisis pregnancy centers,' using an orange caution sign. The portal states that these centers 'often look like clinics or support centers, but they are designed to discourage people from getting an abortion,'"" Baklinski said. He then claimed that in reality, pregnancy crisis centers ""save countless lives"" and ""should be supported by our government, not denigrated for the amazing work that they do in helping mothers and children.""
In line with this, Baklinski argued in September that Canada urgently needs legislation that would protect unborn babies from their mothers' wombs.
He pointed out that in contrast to the claims of Conservative Party of Canada (CPC) leader Pierre Poilievre, Canada has been without abortion laws since the R. v. Morgentaler Supreme Court decision in 1988. The decision removed federal restrictions on abortion, and the Parliament has not passed new legislation since. This, in turn, led to unrestricted access to abortion at any stage of pregnancy.
""Yes, Canada needs a law. It needs a just law the protects children from being killed in their mothers’ wombs,"" Baklinski wrote on X, in response to the heated argument between Trudeau and Poilievre during the Sept. 25 parliamentary session.
""It has been said that a nation will be judged by how it treats its most vulnerable members. Preborn human children are the most vulnerable among us. These smallest members of the human family are waiting for a day of justice.""

Natural News,"Kamala Harris caught plagiarizing in her 2009 book, copying passages directly from Wikipedia – NaturalNews.com","This is according to a new report from a plagiarism researcher who scrutinized her work in her book, ""Smart On Crime: A Career Prosecutor's Plan To Make Us Safer."" The 2009 book used the political slogan she used in her district attorney campaign as the starting point for a plan for reforming the U.S. criminal justice system at large, and it is considered to have helped drive her political career forward and boost her credibility on criminal justice.
Austrian “plagiarism hunter” Stefan Weber pointed to more than a dozen fragments that Harris plagiarized, and she apparently didn't bother to get her information from reputable sources as some of the paragraphs were straight copies from Wikipedia. In all of the matches identified, the sources had been published well ahead of Harris’s book, making it clear that she was the one doing the plagiarizing and not the other way around.
One section of text in her book was taken from a story published by the Associated Press about low graduation rates in 2008, while another had extensive sections that were copied almost verbatim from a press release by the John Jay College of Criminal Justice without providing any attribution.
In another incident, wording was copied directly from a report on West Palm Beach crime statistics by the Bureau of Justice Assistance.
Author and activist Christopher Rufo shared these details on Substack and X, where he compared her passages to the sources side by side to demonstrate the extent of the plagiarism. The parts that were copied were highlighted, and it is clear with a simple glance that the bulk of the material is direct plagiarism that Harris tried to pass off as her own writing.
Rufo called on Harris to own up to her dishonesty, writing: “On that point, one might recall the title of her book: Smart on Crime. There is nothing smart about plagiarism, which is the equivalent of an academic crime. The publisher, as well as the sitting vice president, should retract the plagiarized passages and issue a correction.”
Compare this to Donald Trump's running mate, Senator JD Vance, who is hoping to take over Harris’s job. His own book, Hillbilly Elegy, was well-received across the political spectrum at the time of its release and explored topics affecting poor white communities such as addiction and poverty.
Acknowledging Harris’s plagiarism controversy on X, Vance wrote: “Lmao Kamala didn't even write her own book!” and shared a link to Rufo’s story.
Donald Trump Jr. also weighed in on X, posting: “Yikes! More evidence that Kamala Harris is a fraud!!!”
It’s a serious accusation that has prompted multiple media outlets to request comments from her campaign, but so far, they have largely been shut down. Her publisher is also being cagey; Rufo shared screenshots of leaked internal emails in which representatives from Chronicle Books ordered publicity reps not to respond to inquiries from the press about the matter. The inquiries are being described as “very sensitive” and are being redirected to the highest levels of the publisher.
Rufo posted on X that they are “in damage control mode,” adding: “They know Kamala lied. They know that we know Kamala lied. In America, plagiarism has become a moral pillar of the regime — and they will slander anyone who notices.”

Natural News,Biden-Harris regime updates Bush-era DOD directive allowing government to ASSASSINATE American citizens – NaturalNews.com,"According to the @amuse (@amuse) X / Twitter account, the Biden-Harris regime just updated the George W. Bush-era 2007 Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5240.01 to remove provisions that protect American citizens against government-sanctioned assassinations.
The original directive contained an explicit prohibition on government-sanctioned assassination:
""Under no circumstances shall any DoD Component or DoD employee engage in, or conspire to engage in, assassination,"" the original document stated. The Biden-Harris regime explicitly removed this language, which means American citizens can now be targeted for elimination by their own government.
With that language now removed, Washington is now free to target both foreign nationals and American citizens both abroad and on domestic soil just so long as certain vaguely ominous ""special circumstances"" are met.
""With just months left in office the Biden-Harris regime decided to update the 17 year old Bush-era directive against assassin@tion of Americans,"" @amuse asked. ""Why would the regime feel the need to legalize killing Americans who threaten the foundations of our democracy?""
(Related: Speaking of the Department of Defense, did you know that its agents post-Helene have taken control of western North Carolina, where the world's richest lithium and purest quartz deposits are located?)
The Democrat Party sure has come a long way from the days of chanting ""no blood for oil"" and protesting government intrusion into people's private lives. Now, the party of the people wants to have the freedom to kill its political opponents.
""The notion that the government can now potentially authorize the assassination of Americans under the guise of national security is nothing short of a constitutional crisis,"" @amus warns.
""It opens a Pandora's box where the executive branch could circumvent legal processes and judicial oversight, allowing for a chilling expansion of government power and an alarming erosion of individual rights.""
It is no secret that the left pays little regard to human life. Between their love for abortion and their support for reducing the global population in order to stop ""climate change,"" it only makes sense that the next step is to allow the government to murder certain people for upsetting the regime.
""The Biden-Harris regime's willingness to authorize assassin@tion reflects a profound disregard for the sanctity of American lives and the rule of law,"" @amuse says. ""It exemplifies a troubling trend toward authoritarianism, where the state's interests are prioritized over the rights of individuals.""
""By enabling the targeting of U.S. citizens – often without the checks and balances that judicial oversight provides – the regime is setting a dangerous precedent that could lead to abuses of power reminiscent of the darkest chapters in our nation's history.""
Another thing this updated DoD directive does is signal a fundamental shift in the relationship between We the People and our government. It used to be that the government worked on behalf of We the People, but today's government has morphed into something where the government controls and rules with an iron fist over We the People.
""This new directive does not merely modify existing procedures; it fundamentally alters the landscape of governmental authority and individual rights in America. As we stand at this critical juncture, we must remain vigilant and resolute in our defense of civil liberties. The implications of the Biden-Harris regime’s actions demand serious reflection and urgent action from all who cherish the freedoms granted to us by our Constitution.""

Natural News,Musk claims billionaires backing Harris fear Trump will reveal Epstein client list – NaturalNews.com,"Musk's comments come at a time when the Epstein saga continues to loom large in public discourse, especially following his conviction and subsequent mysterious death in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019. He questioned the apparent lack of prosecution for anyone associated with the alleged Epstein client list, suggesting that the elite's support for Harris could be driven by fear of what might come to light if Trump were to regain power.
""Some of those billionaires behind Kamala are terrified of that outcome,"" Musk declared, highlighting prominent figures like LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and Microsoft founder Bill Gates as among those likely feeling ""uncomfortable"" with the idea of the list being disclosed. Hoffman has been reported to have visited Epstein's private island, while Gates met Epstein multiple times.
Musk further fueled the narrative by alluding to the extensive surveillance operations allegedly employed by Epstein. ""Between Diddy and Epstein, there's probably thousands of hours of footage here,"" he said, referencing the claims that Epstein's private island, Little St. James, and his New Mexico ranch were rigged with cameras. This notion adds a layer of intrigue to an already scandal-ridden saga, as the implication of hidden footage raises questions about the extent of Epstein's operations and the potential involvement of powerful individuals. (Related: Lawsuit: Jeffrey Epstein once boasted of being a MOSSAD AGENT.)
The mention of Sean Combs, known as Diddy, comes in the wake of his recent arrest on serious charges, including sex trafficking and sexual abuse, with one victim reportedly as young as nine.
""If Trump wins, we can do some housecleaning,"" Musk warned, emphasizing that the future of democracy is at stake in the upcoming presidential election. This statement is significant, given Musk's recent public support for Trump, culminating in his appearance at a rally in Pennsylvania over the weekend. The rally marked Trump's return to the area since an attempted assassination earlier in July, further heightening the stakes as the election approaches.
In a related development, Trump expressed on ""The Lex Fridman Podcast"" his willingness to unseal additional documents related to Epstein, including the long-sought client list, should he return to the presidency. ""I never went to his island, fortunately, but a lot of people did,"" Trump asserted, emphasizing his distance from Epstein while implying that many prominent figures may not share the same alibi.
""I'd be inclined to do the Epstein. I'd have no problem with it,"" Trump said, signaling a potential shift in the narrative surrounding Epstein and his connections to the elite.
The former president's comments also touched upon the secrecy that has shrouded the complete list of Epstein's alleged clients. Trump remarked, ""It's very interesting, isn't it?"" in response to Fridman pointing out the oddity that the list has not yet been made public.
He hinted at the possibility that it might eventually be revealed, saying: ""It probably will be, by the way... I'd certainly take a look at it."" This statement not only fuels public curiosity but also raises questions about the motivations behind keeping such information under wraps.
Moreover, Trump expressed interest in releasing documents related to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy if elected, suggesting that transparency regarding sensitive historical events could be part of his agenda. The Epstein case remains a focal point for many, underscoring the involvement of numerous high-profile individuals in Epstein's illicit activities and the public's ongoing quest for accountability and transparency.

Natural News,"Trump campaign says 530,000-plus voters in Helene-ravaged North Carolina might not be able to participate in election: 26 of 28 hardest-hit counties voted Trump in 2020 – NaturalNews.com","More than half a million voters in western North Carolina alone, around 530,000 people, could be impeded from casting their votes for Donald Trump now that the Appalachian region has been annihilated and largely cut off from the rest of the world.
Some of those roughly 530,000 voters are dead and many more are injured, which could tip North Carolina to Kamala Harris instead. The same could happen in Florida as well depending on how quickly the state recovers from Hurricane Milton.
""Trump campaign fears >530k Trump voters in western NC cd be disenfranchised by Helene,"" tweeted veteran journalist Paul Sperry, quoting a ""Trump insider.""
""In fact, 26 of 28 counties hit by flooding voted for Trump in '20. 'There's a 4-to-1 disparity (vs Biden / Harris voters). We're very concerned,' a Trump insider said. NC = 16 electoral votes.""
(Related: Did you hear about the Mexican man in Phoenix who was caught registering illegal aliens to vote?)
Politico seems to be equally as concerned about the political participation fallout of these major storms. Research the media outlet conducted found that natural disasters do, in fact, influence both voter turnout and preference.
A person whose house gets destroyed by a storm may decide to choose another candidate based on who is currently in charge and how the disaster relief efforts are handled. Another person who dies from a storm simply cannot vote at all unless his or her name is used to commit voter fraud.
""With Helene's impact stretching across Republican-leaning areas in North Carolina and Georgia, the storm poses a unique challenge for the Trump campaign,"" an independent media report explains.
""In the counties declared disaster zones in North Carolina, Trump secured 61% of the vote in 2020, while winning 54% in the affected areas of Georgia.""
Another concern of the Trump campaign following Helene's devastation throughout Appalachia is the fact that registered Democrats in North Carolina have taken an early lead based on the return rate of mail-in ballots.
VoteHub.us found that 22,910 mail-in ballots have been submitted so far. Of these, 9,075 are from Democrats, 5,595 are from Republicans, and 8,240 are from unaffiliated voters.
""Of the outstanding 261,335 mail-in ballots, over 93,000 belong to registered Democrats compared to approximately 65,000 from Republicans,"" reports indicate.
In an attempt to tip the scales in the other direction, the Trump campaign has devised a scheme called the ""Team Trump Bus Tour"" that will travel around North Carolina trying to energize the state's conservative base. The tour will feature several high-profile Republican politicians including:
• Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds
• Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.)
• Former Trump administration officials Hogan Gidley and Kash Patel
The Team Trump Bus Tour will visit the following cities on the following days at the following locations:
Wednesday, October 9, 2024:
• Wilmington - New Hanover County GOP / Trump Force 47 Office
• Fayetteville - Cumberland County GOP HQ
• Rocky Mount - Rocky Mount Trump Force 47 Office

Natural News,"HUD ANNUAL STUDY: Homelessness on the rise due to rising housing costs, poverty and the expiration of pandemic relief measures – NaturalNews.com","According to the HUD annual study, homelessness has been on an upward trajectory for six consecutive years, with significant growth observed since 2019. However, the 2023 numbers (653,104 people) are particularly alarming as they exceeded the 2007 to 2022 average by 10 percent. The HUD report reveals that 60 percent of these individuals were accommodated in shelters, safe haven programs or transitional housing, while the remaining 40 percent lived in unsheltered conditions.
This trend has been evident among specific demographics. For instance, Black Americans comprised 37 percent of all homeless individuals, despite being only 13 percent of the U.S. population. Similarly, Hispanic and Latino individuals saw a 28 percent increase in homelessness, accounting for more than half of the rise from 2022 to 2023. Among racial groups, Asians and Asian Americans experienced a staggering 40 percent overall rise, with even more severe increases among those unsheltered.
Moreover, families with children and veterans were among the hardest hit, with family homelessness increasing by 16 percent and veteran homelessness reaching over 35,500. Black Americans also represented half of all homeless families in this demographic. (Related: America's HOMELESS population surges to record-high 653,000 as IMMIGRATION CRISIS worsens under Biden.)
Unaccompanied youth also joined the trend, representing 22 percent of all homeless individuals under age 25, with California reporting the largest number at 10,173. New York (13 percent of the national total), Washington (six percent), Oregon (four percent), Texas (four percent) and Florida (four percent) also joined California in this trend.
Chronic homelessness, characterized by prolonged or repeated episodes of homelessness, affects one-third of the total homeless population. This category also saw record numbers in 2023, with nearly 93,000 individuals living in unsheltered conditions.
The rise has been attributed to various factors, including the end of the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) shelter restrictions, which had limited capacity during the pandemic and the increased financial strain on households nationwide. These measures had previously helped many Americans stay in stable housing. In other words, their expiration, alongside the phase-out of Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act funding for shelter beds, left people unable to afford housing.
These results reveal the serious implications of a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling from June, which allows municipalities to impose fines and jail sentences on individuals living in unsheltered conditions. The 6-3 decision in Grants Pass v. Johnson upheld an Oregon town's ban on sleeping or camping in public spaces, even with insufficient shelter space.
Supporters of the ruling argue that prohibiting camping or sleeping in public areas protects public health and safety.
""Under the city's laws, it makes no difference whether the charged defendant is homeless, a backpacker on vacation passing through town, or a student who abandons his dorm room to camp out in protest on the lawn of a municipal building,"" Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the majority.
Opponents, however, see the ruling as a troubling step toward criminalizing the very condition of being homeless.
""For some people, sleeping outside is their only option. The City of Grants Pass jails and fines those people for sleeping anywhere in public at any time, including in their cars, if they use as little as a blanket to keep warm or a rolled-up shirt as a pillow,"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in dissent.

Natural News,BUSTED: Kamala Harris uses teleprompter in a supposedly “IMPROMPTU” speaking engagement in Las Vegas – NaturalNews.com,"The nature of the Town Hall event that was live broadcasted by the Spanish-language network Univision in Las Vegas is that candidates will have to speak without a script or guide while in a ""question and answer"" forum with an audience. They are undecided Latino voters.
A copy of the video clip that was broadcast was shared on X by the handle Trump War Room. A camera angle initially showed her speaking in front of the people and then it was cut to a moving camera shot from her back, showing her audience and a teleprompter.
She was saying: ""Are you a Republican, are you a Democrat? The only question I ever ask is are you okay? And sadly we have seen over the last two weeks since Hurricane Helene…""
Viewers were quick to spot that as the shot grew closer to Harris' back, the teleprompter with text moving and which seemed like feeding her information, immediately shut down.
Kamala has a teleprompter for this ""unscripted"" town hall....
They forgot to hide it by turning it off until it comes into plain view. pic.twitter.com/5cRYhc2IFH
— Tim Young (@TimRunsHisMouth) October 11, 2024
Former President Donald Trump's supporters turn to X to accuse Harris of being fraud and Univison of committing malpractice.
""BUSTED!!"" political activist Charlie Kirk proclaimed. ""Kamala was just caught using a teleprompter at her Univision town hall! Producers panic and turn off the prompter midway through her answer. Why did Univision allow this?! This is egregious journalistic malpractice.""
""Univision accidentally broadcast proof that Kamala used a teleprompter at her town hall,"" commented YouTuber Benny Johnson. ""Watch them panic when they realized they were showing the prompter live on-air.""
""Kamala has a teleprompter for this 'unscripted' town hall… They forgot to hide it by turning it off until it comes into plain view,"" remarked host and comedian Tim Young.
""How in the hell do you use a teleprompter at a Town Hall?"" asked Anita Broaddrick. ""A Town Hall is supposed to be impromptu. Kamala is the biggest fraud to ever run for office. It's absolutely laughable.""
In response, Enrique Acevedo, the Spanish moderator of the said Town Hall dodged the accusations, claiming that the teleprompter feed was actually for him.
""The prompter displayed my introduction (in Spanish) and then it switched to a timer. Any claim to the contrary is simply untrue,"" he said on X.
The show producer, Daniel Coronell, supported Acevedo's claim. ""That's not true. The teleprompter that displays a text written in Spanish was a support element for the town hall moderator,"" he tweeted. ""I can tell you this with first-hand knowledge because I was in charge of the television program.""
According to a New York Times/Sienna, Trump is leading 51 percent to Harris' 46 percent in the Arizona state poll. Arizona is one of the most contested battlegrounds of the 2024 election and reports indicate that both campaigns are spending considerable resources in the Grand Canyon State.
That is why in First Lady Jill Biden's first-ever campaign stop, she chose Arizona as she touted Harris' candidacy in two days' worth of events.
She slammed Trump and dodged the ""lies"" about the vice president.
""You're probably already hearing all sorts of lies about Kamala,"" she told an event in Yuma. Trump has accused Harris of lying about working at McDonalds as a teenager and has misrepresented the role she played in the Biden administration's work on border security.
But Jill lauded Harris for her work in fighting crime as an attorney general and how she helped a friend in high school who lived in an abused situation.
""That's the Kamala Harris I know, a quick, tough, compassionate, decisive leader and that's the kind of president you deserve, Arizona,"" she said. (Related: Kamala Harris admits she WON'T DO ANYTHING DIFFERENT from Biden.)
Meanwhile, she repeatedly attacked Trump for his role in appointing Supreme Court justices who voted to overturn Roe vs. Wade, accusing the former POTUS’ abortion ban of taking away the ability for women to make their own health care decisions.
""No one has to abandon their faith or their deeply held beliefs to agree that the government should not be telling women what to do with their bodies,"" she lamented.
She also repeated some lines about Trump she used when she campaigned for President Joe Biden, switching them to work for Harris.
""As President, Kamala Harris is going to fight for you. Donald Trump still wakes up every day thinking about one person: himself,"" she said, adding that if Trump wins again, he would lead the country into more chaos, greed and division. She also accused him of wanting to lower taxes for ""rich guys like him, while costs are going up for everyone else.""
Early in the Biden administration, there were reports of hard feelings between Jill and Harris, indicating that the former was known to hold a grudge against the vice president. Jill was upset at Harris for an attack line in one of the early primary debates, targeting Joe Biden for his record on school busing in the 1960s as part of desegregation efforts. But those feelings appear to have been set aside for the Democrats' goal of winning the election.

Natural News,Boris Johnson claims a SPY DEVICE was found in his bathroom after Netanyahu’s 2017 visit – NaturalNews.com,"Johnson alleged that a bugging device was discovered in his personal bathroom after Netanyahu used it. This revelation came to light when Johnson's security team conducted a routine sweep of the area after Netanyahu's visit, uncovering the hidden surveillance equipment.
Johnson recalled Netanyahu excusing himself during their meeting to use the bathroom, which the former prime minister humorously describes as being reminiscent of ""the gents in a posh London club.""
The bathroom, located within a ""secret annex"" of Johnson's office, was seemingly secure. However, the discovery of the bugging device raises serious questions about potential espionage.
In ""Unleashed,"" Johnson wrote: ""Thither Bibi repaired for a while and it may or may not be a coincidence, but I am told that later, when they were doing a regular sweep for bugs, they found a listening device in the thunderbox.""
This offhand remark highlights Johnson's surprise at the discovery, though he stops short of directly accusing Netanyahu of planting the device himself.
Nevertheless, the implication of surveillance, especially during a diplomatic visit, adds intrigue to the ongoing discussion of international espionage practices, especially where state actors are concerned.
While this revelation might seem shocking, it fits into a larger pattern of alleged Israeli spying operations against its allies. (Related: Netanyahu backtracks on agreement with Biden to support Lebanon ceasefire proposal.)
In 2019, Politico reported that U.S. officials had determined Israel was likely responsible for placing surveillance devices near sensitive government locations in Washington, including around the White House.
These devices, known as ""StingRays,"" mimic cellphone towers and are capable of intercepting cellphone communications, including calls and data transfers.
Formally known as International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) catchers, they allow the collection of personal information from mobile phones, including real-time location data and potentially the contents of calls and messages.
According to former U.S. officials familiar with the situation, the devices were likely aimed at collecting intelligence on President Donald Trump and his closest aides.
Despite the gravity of this revelation, the Trump administration did not take any official action against Israel, a departure from the standard diplomatic response to such incidents. One former U.S. official explained that although the Israeli government was not publicly rebuked, the evidence strongly pointed to their involvement.
The lack of formal consequences highlights the complex nature of U.S.-Israeli relations, where intelligence-sharing and mutual geopolitical interests often overshadow individual incidents.
This is not the first time allegations of Israeli spying have targeted high-profile political figures. A similar case emerged in the late 1990s involving Netanyahu and then-U.S. President Bill Clinton.
According to various sources, including author Daniel Halper in his book ""Clinton Inc: The Audacious Rebuilding of a Political Machine,"" Netanyahu allegedly attempted to use tapes of Clinton's intimate conversations with White House intern Monica Lewinsky to pressure Clinton into releasing Jonathan Pollard, an Israeli spy who had been imprisoned in the U.S. since the 1980s.
Halper claimed that during peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority in 1998, held at the Wye Plantation in Maryland, Netanyahu privately approached Clinton to push for Pollard's release. The Israeli delegation allegedly possessed recordings of Clinton's steamy conversations with Lewinsky, which they used as a bargaining chip.
While Netanyahu reportedly told Clinton the tapes had been destroyed, the mere mention of their existence was enough to apply pressure. Clinton ultimately considered Pollard's release, though he was dissuaded by CIA Director George Tenet, who threatened to resign if Pollard was freed.
These allegations of Israeli eavesdropping and potential blackmail have been consistently denied by Israeli officials. However, multiple reports over the years have pointed to sophisticated Israeli surveillance operations targeting allies, including the United States.

Natural News,Survey finds 8 out of 10 Americans fear outbreak of WORLD WAR III – NaturalNews.com,"Conducted by Talker Research, the survey highlights a nation on edge as international tensions rise and an uncertain election year approaches, affecting both personal fears and political preferences. The survey, which polled 1,000 Americans across various political affiliations, indicates that worries about a global conflict cut across party lines.
A significant 84 percent of Republicans and 83 percent of third-party voters expressed anxiety over a potential world war, while 74 percent of Democrats also shared these concerns. This overwhelming consensus underscores a pervasive sense of unease among the American public regarding international stability. (Related: World War III is now inevitable – here’s why it can’t be avoided.)
Gender differences were pronounced in the survey findings, with 85 percent of women expressing fears about a new global conflict compared to just 71 percent of men. The sense of impending danger seems particularly acute for women, reflecting broader societal concerns about safety and security in a tumultuous world.
The ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict emerged as the primary concern for 55 percent of respondents, overshadowing worries about the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which troubled only 28 percent. This indicates that specific regional conflicts can significantly shape public sentiment and anxiety about broader geopolitical issues.
If a crisis occurs, Americans are divided on leadership preferences during wartime.
When asked who they would prefer to lead them in the event of a global conflict, 50 percent of respondents believed former President Donald Trump would be a better choice compared to Vice President Kamala Harris, who received 41 percent support.
Notably, 14 percent of third-party voters expressed confidence in neither candidate. This division suggests that perceptions of leadership effectiveness are closely tied to individual political beliefs, reflecting the complex dynamics of American politics in times of crisis.
The survey further explored hypothetical leadership scenarios, revealing a tight race between Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH) and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for potential presidential successors.
Among respondents, 44 percent favored Vance, while 43 percent preferred Walz. Regionally, support for Vance was strongest in the Southeastern United States (52 percent), while Walz garnered 56 percent of support in the West. Interestingly, the gender divide persisted here, with women showing a slight preference for Walz over Vance by 45 percent versus 40 percent.
As international tensions simmer and domestic politics remain unstable, this survey underscores the widespread anxiety gripping the American public. With 80 percent fearing the prospect of World War III, the threat of global conflict looms large in the American consciousness, shaping both personal fears and political preferences during these uncertain times. The implications of this anxiety extend beyond individual sentiments, influencing the national discourse and potentially impacting voter behavior in the upcoming elections.
Compounding these concerns, a recent report from the Commission on the National Defense Strategy warns that the U.S. must bolster its defense spending to Cold War levels to effectively address growing threats from China, Iran, Russia, and North Korea.
Former Rep. Jane Harman (D-CA), chair of the bipartisan group, emphasized that the U.S. faces its ""most serious and challenging"" threats since the end of World War II, including a tangible risk of ""near-term major war."" This call for increased military readiness reflects the urgent need for the U.S. to navigate the complexities of modern warfare and international relations.
In recent remarks, Trump highlighted the world's proximity to World War III, citing China's aggression toward Taiwan, Iran's nuclear ambitions and Russia's invasion of Ukraine as critical factors. Tensions in the Middle East are also escalating, particularly between Israel and Hezbollah, raising concerns about the potential for an all-out conflict.

Natural News,U.S. Supreme Court rebuffs Biden administration’s appeal challenging Texas abortion law – NaturalNews.com,"In July 2022, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a lawsuit against the Department of Human and Health Services (HHS) guidelines regarding the 1986 federal law, dubbed as Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA). Under EMTALA, the HHS requires hospitals that receive Medicare funding to provide necessary treatment for pregnant women in an emergency condition. The HHS defines emergency medical care in such situations as ectopic pregnancies, severe complications from miscarriages and severe pre-eclampsia.
However, Paxton argued that the new abortion-related requirements would only turn emergency rooms in hospitals into ""walk-in abortion clinics.""
Initially, the district court and the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Texas. The courts ruled that the Texas Human Life Protection Act, which bans abortions except in cases where the mother's life is at risk, was not preempted by EMTALA. However, the HHS filed an appeal to the Supreme Court, pointing to a similar case in Idaho where a court ruled that doctors could perform emergency abortions as litigation continued.
Fortunately, the Supreme Court upheld the ruling from the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
In September, Paxton also filed a lawsuit against the HSS, HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra and other officials of the Biden regime in the Federal District Court in Lubbock, Texas to block a newly proposed rule.
The rule, which restricts access to medical reproductive health records from criminal investigations on women who cross state lines to seek abortion, was modified by the HHS under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) earlier this year. In the past, HIPAA allowed the sharing of personal health information (PHI) in specific cases, such as public health investigations or law enforcement investigations. But the new rule would limit the disclosure of PHI if it would be about medical reproductive health records.
HHS claimed that the rule would safeguard the privacy of women's reproductive health. However, Paxton argued that the rule would only obstruct the ability of the state to investigate potential criminal activities related to abortion, such as illegal procedures or malpractice
""This new rule actively undermines Congress' clear statutory meaning when HIPAA was passed, and it reflects the Biden administration's disrespect for the law. The federal government is attempting to undermine Texas' law enforcement capabilities and I will not allow this to happen,"" Paxton said.

Natural News,REPORT: About 70% of counties in battleground states now depend on government aid programs – NaturalNews.com,"The EIG study, which examined Social Security, Medicaid, unemployment insurance and food stamps, found that on average, the federal government shoulders about 70 percent of the costs, with states covering the remainder. Notably, spending on military bases and farm subsidies was excluded from the analysis.
According to the findings, many counties in Michigan, Georgia and North Carolina rely on government aid. In Pennsylvania, nearly 60 percent of counties fall into this category and in Arizona, 13 out of 15 counties rely significantly on government support. Overall, more than a third of residents in these states live in areas where government assistance forms a substantial part of the economy.
This increase in government dependence is closely linked to demographic shifts, particularly the aging population. With more Americans entering retirement and healthcare costs rising, programs like Social Security and Medicare have become indispensable for many. (Related: More and more retired Americans returning to work to cope with rising cost of living under Biden’s failing economy.)
For instance, Cambria County, Pennsylvania, which once thrived as a steel manufacturing hub, has seen a prolonged economic downturn with a 10 percent decrease in workforce and businesses since 2000. In turn, 35 percent of residents' income now comes from government programs.
EIG concluded: ""Spending on these programs has outpaced the income people earn from other sources. Meanwhile, pressure from a graying population won’t let up: By 2060, nearly a quarter of the U.S. will be at least 65, the Census Bureau projects.""
The findings shed light on why former President Donald Trump has been resonating with voters in economically challenged regions.
Many of these voters view his promises to protect Social Security and Medicare as essential and counties relying heavily on government support have shifted increasingly Republican in recent elections. Trump, who won 68 percent of the vote in Cambria County in 2020, has vowed to eliminate taxes on overtime wages and Social Security benefits if elected in November.
""Today, I'm also announcing that as part of our additional tax cuts, we will end all taxes on overtime. You know what that means? Think of that,"" Trump said during a campaign rally in Tucson, Arizona. ""That gives people more of an incentive to work, it gives the companies a lot, it's a lot easier to get the people."" Trump argued that removing taxes on overtime pay would create a ""whole new workforce.""
Trump also reiterated his commitment to eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits during the Tucson rally.

Natural News,Iran warns Israel: Nuclear doctrine may shift if its nuclear facilities are attacked – NaturalNews.com,"In an interview with Iran's Fars News Agency on October 9, Brig. Gen. Rasoul Sanaei-Rad warned Israel against targeting these facilities.
""These days, there is talk of approaching zero hour and the reaction of the Zionists,"" he said, emphasizing that even officials in the United States have been advising Israel to avoid such escalatory actions, indicating that the potential repercussions of striking Iran's nuclear sites must be carefully considered.
Sanaei-Rad articulated that an attack on Iran's nuclear centers could significantly alter the strategic landscape and lead to changes in Iran's nuclear policies. He declared that targeting these facilities would cross ""regional and global red lines"" and reminded that there are established protocols regarding nuclear facilities that must be respected during wartime.
Iran's primary nuclear facility is located in Natanz, a central city in Isfahan Province. The facility has previously been a target of cyberattacks attributed to Israel.
In April 2021, Iran accused Israel of carrying out a devastating cyberattack at Natanz that damaged its centrifuges. Later that month, Iran announced that it had enriched uranium to 60 percent, a level closer to weapons-grade material. Additionally, Iran attributed a drone strike on a military facility in Isfahan to Israel in April.
Sanaei-Rad cautioned that Israel must ""reflect on Iran’s possible reaction,"" warning that any attack on Iran’s oil and gas infrastructure could impact global fuel prices and energy security.
""The rational advice is not to take any action that will lead to the development of tension. If they want to take action, they should consider these issues,"" Sanaei-Rad said.
He highlighted that Israel's infrastructure is densely concentrated in a relatively small area, making it more vulnerable to a potential Iranian response. (Related: Iran warns Israel not to respond to ballistic missile attack: “Any miscalculation will lead to your sudden collapse.”)
While Sanaei-Rad did not explicitly mention any plans to strike Israeli nuclear facilities, he affirmed that the Iranian armed forces are prepared for a response if Israel were to attack.
""Yes. Before they announced that they intended to take countermeasures, this possibility was given by the armed forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran,"" he said, adding that it is assumed Israel may take ""a risky action,"" and preparations are already in place for a possible response.
He was also asked about Operation Sadeq (True Promise) 2, the Iranian missile attack on Israel that occurred on Oct. 1. Sanaei-Rad accused Israel of censoring information to downplay the damage inflicted on its military bases.
""The real picture was never reflected,"" said Sanaei-Rad. ""They show the point where a missile hit at a distance from the target several times, but they don't tend to show the damage done to the hangar."" He emphasized that the ""political and psychological repercussions"" of the Oct. 1 attacks were much greater than those from a previous Iranian missile attack on Israel on April 13.
After the Oct. 1 attacks, Iran's chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, stated that if Israel retaliates against Iranian targets, Iran would be ""ready to destroy their infrastructure.""

Natural News,Gary Heavin carried out Hurricane Helene rescue missions in western North Carolina with his own helicopter – NaturalNews.com,"Operation Airdrop says it exists outside the realm of government ""to respond swiftly and effectively in times of crisis"" and to ensure ""that essential supplies reach those in need when traditional ground support is compromised.""
In lieu of FEMA and other government rescue operations that seem to be few and far between due to politics, Heavin is using his Bell 505 helicopter to traverse otherwise unwelcoming and inaccessible terrain to help stranded victims.
At each deployment, Heavin is given a set of coordinates along with a mission that beyond rescues also involves dropping much-needed supplies like food, water and medicine in areas that are now completely cut off from the rest of the world.
When this all started, there were more than 50 private helicopters, Heavin's included, that were operating out of the Hickory home base. All of them were run by volunteers who made trips to various community fire stations to distribute supplies to those in need, all without pay.
""It was a thing of beauty,"" Heavin told the media. ""People were able to communicate and get out where they needed to be, rescuing those who were trapped.""
(Related: Tampa, Fla., mayor Jane Castor issued a dire warning to residents this week that they had better flee the area or else they will die once Hurricane Milton arrives.)
Every day, each helicopter would run about four missions each, altogether totaling around 10 hours in length, seven of those being time spent flying in the helicopter. Heavin says he has never done anything like this, but seeing Helene's devastation and the lack of government aid caused him to take an interest in being a good Samaritan.
Heavin has helped with hurricane relief efforts in the past, though. He helped out with Hurricane Matthew in 2016, and a few years after that he was helping with Haiti's earthquake relief efforts in 2021.
Hurricane Helene seems to be his biggest challenge yet as it caused catastrophic damage to an area that many people overlooked because of its inland, mountainous geography. All in all, Helene dumped 40 trillion gallons of water in a matter of about six days, not to mention wind speeds that reached as high as 140 mph.
According to Heavin, there are thousands of stories he has heard about with people needing everything from insulin for their diabetes treatments to EpiPens (epinephrine) that ward off an anaphylactic shock reaction caused by bee and wasp stings.
In one instance, Heavin was able to rescue a heart patient in desperate need of medical care, along with her dog, by landing in the woman's backyard. Would FEMA ever do something like that?
In another case, Heavin rescued a cancer patient who was undergoing chemotherapy at the time when Helene struck. Thanks to the diligent efforts of Heavin and other private volunteers, the woman was safely brought back to an airport where a hanger had been specially outfit as a temporary medical clinic.
While we certainly need public services, emergency and otherwise, it sure is nice that western North Carolinians have people like Heavin on the ground to provide additional assistance.
""It's a reminder that the government is a bureaucracy,"" Heavin said, gracefully, about the troubles with government aid for Helene victims. ""It's slow, inefficient, and broke.""

Natural News,Leaked documents reveal secret U.S.-led coalition plotting regime change in Iran – NaturalNews.com,"These documents, obtained by The Grayzone, expose how Gershman sought to channel U.S. government resources into a regime change initiative targeting Iran. Central to this plot was the creation of an ""Iran Freedom Coalition,"" aimed at uniting pro-Western Iranian activists with U.S. neoconservative figures advocating for military intervention against the Islamic Republic.
Gershman, who had helmed NED for nearly four decades, oversaw its long history of meddling in foreign nations' affairs. NED, initially conceived during the Reagan administration as an extension of Central Intelligence Agency operations, has been involved in regime change efforts worldwide, from Nicaragua to Venezuela to Hong Kong. (Related: Intelligence officials brief Trump about ""real and specific"" assassination threats they say are linked to Iran, but many Trump supporters are skeptical of origins.)
The leaked documents illustrate how, even in retirement, Gershman continued to use his vast connections within the U.S. foreign policy establishment to drive his agenda in Iran. His Iran Freedom Coalition, which he described in private communications, was designed to impose an exiled, U.S.-backed leadership over the grassroots Iranian protest movements, particularly the Women, Life, Freedom movement.
Protests in Iran erupted in September 2022 after the death of Mahsa Amini, a young woman who died after being detained by Iran's morality police for allegedly violating the country's mandatory hijab laws. These protests, initially driven by organic public outrage, were soon co-opted by external forces, including U.S.-backed exiles.
Figures like Reza Pahlavi, the son of the late Shah of Iran, and Masih Alinejad, a vocal anti-regime activist, became the public faces of the movement in the West. The protests, while briefly intense, ultimately fizzled out within Iran after a few weeks. However, Western governments, NGOs and media outlets continued to rally behind the movement, casting it as a vehicle for regime change.
According to the leaks, Gershman viewed the movement as a tool for his broader objective of overthrowing the Iranian government. In an email to Rep. Mario Díaz-Balart, a powerful Cuban-American Republican who chairs the House Subcommittee on the Department of State, Gershman outlined his vision for the Iran Freedom Coalition.
He sought to divert funds from the U.S. State Department's Iran Democracy Fund, which allocated $55 million to support civil society engagement in Iran, toward more aggressive regime change efforts. In his email, Gershman expressed concern that the State Department's fund was focused on electoral processes, which he argued were irrelevant to movements like Women, Life, Freedom, which ""doesn't recognize the legitimacy of the regime.""
Gershman proposed that Díaz-Balart use his influence to channel about 10 percent of the fund to NED, allowing the organization to expand its Iran-focused operations. He also suggested creating ""solidarity working groups"" composed of women's rights activists, trade unionists and civil society leaders – groups that could give the impression of grassroots Iranian support for the regime change effort.
The leaks further reveal that Gershman handpicked key figures to lead the Iran Freedom Coalition. Among them was William Kristol, a prominent neoconservative strategist who has long lobbied for a U.S. military intervention in Iran. Kristol is notorious for promoting U.S. invasions in the Middle East, which he has misleadingly referred to as ""liberations.""
Also involved was Joshua Muravchik, another neoconservative who has repeatedly argued that war with Iran is the only viable solution. Muravchik's hawkish positions align with Gershman's overarching goal of pushing the U.S. into direct conflict with Iran.
The coalition's Iranian members are mostly individuals with close ties to Western governments and think tanks, such as the Tony Blair Institute, which has a history of supporting interventionist policies. Despite being presented in Western media as the leaders of Iran's ""freedom struggle,"" their association with Gershman's coalition reveals that many of these individuals are simply figureheads for U.S. regime change operations.
By promoting these exiles as the legitimate voice of the Iranian people, Gershman and his allies aimed to impose a new leadership on the Iranian opposition, one that aligns with U.S. interests rather than with the aspirations of ordinary Iranians.

Natural News,Harris-Walz campaign is trying to win male voters by pushing pornography and abortion – NaturalNews.com,"In an op-ed article written by Jonathon Van Maren for LifeSiteNews, he revealed how the Democratic ticket has been desperately trying to fix its problems with male voters as polls on key battleground states hit razor-thin margins.
The Harris-Walz campaign first presented Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff as a model of ""new masculinity"" as he advocated for abortion rights as essential for men's family planning. ""This is an issue of fairness to women. Women are dying,"" Emhoff said in an exclusive interview with NBC News. ""It's affecting man's ability to plan their lives. And it's also an issue of what's next, what other freedoms are at risk. And these freedoms are affecting all Americans, not just women.""
It is no wonder Emhoff supports abortion because his first marriage ended after he had an affair with a teacher at his children's school in 2009, reports indicated. Emhoff allegedly impregnated the teacher but never gave birth. He acknowledged his past in a recent interview with Jen Psaki, former press secretary for President Joe Biden, but never mentioned the murdered baby.
Aside from this, the Harris-Walz campaign also enlisted celebrities like Jennifer Garner, an actress and ex-wife of Ben Affleck, to promote the idea that men who support Harris are ""sexy."" They also released an ad, created by a former writer for ""Jimmy Kimmel Live,"" featuring stereotypical masculine figures endorsing Harris and abortion rights. The ad implies that ""real men support Harris,"" but several male actors in the ad are actually gay.
And now, in their latest move, the Harris-Walz campaign has teamed up with the ""Hands Off My Porn"" campaign. The porn industry had already spent $100,000 on ads targeting young men on pornography websites to vote for Harris to protect their access to adult websites.
The Harris-Walz campaign is facing backlash and mockery for launching such awful ads.
""All Harris has to offer men when it comes down to it, is the agenda of the sexual revolution,"" Van Maren wrote in his article. ""'Vote for me, because the women you love may need to have their babies suctioned out of them by Planned Parenthood. Vote for me, because your sex life depends on it. Vote for me, because our revolution depends on it.' That's all her ad offers, when you cut through the weird theater kid version of Country Guy Sits On Truck Tailgate stuff.""
Van Maren concluded: ""What is the Harris-Walz ticket-selling young men? Abortion, pornography, and an assurance that masculinity means sex with whoever you want, whenever you want, however you want – with the government there to ensure that the consequences are taken care of. It's a bold play. The gloves are off. So are the masks.

Natural News,Hurricane Milton reached CAT 5 status – the last time there was a hurricane this strong barreling towards Florida was pre-Civil War – NaturalNews.com,"According to the latest reports, Milton is now a sustained Category 5 storm that at its current rate of explosive growth could end up breaking all world records for major hurricanes once it reaches the shores of the Sunshine State.
If there was another category beyond Category 5 such as Category 6, in other words, Milton might end up becoming the worst hurricane to strike the United States since pre-Civil War days.
""It's the 12th Category 5 hurricane on record in the Gulf of Mexico and strongest so late in the year,"" tweeted FOX Weather about what is fast shaping up to be one of the worst ever natural disasters to impact the United States.
7pm CDT Oct 7th -- #Hurricane #Milton remains an extremely dangerous Category 5 hurricane with winds of 180 mph.

Meteorologist Mike Masco announced that Milton is on track to make landfall somewhere in the Tampa and St. Petersburg area of western Florida on Wednesday evening.
""This type of 'direct hit' as well as intensity based on the going forecast has not been seen since the 1848, that hurricane was believe to be a category 4,"" Masco tweeted.

Tampa Bay's National Weather Service (NWS) division echoed this sentiment by warning people in the Tampa Bay area to complete all preparations before Tuesday night and to evacuate, if possible, as soon as possible.
""If the storm stays on the current track, it will be the worst storm to impact the Tampa area in over 100 years,"" NWS Tampa Bay ominously wrote on X / Twitter.
The 1848 storm in question, called the ""Tampa Bay Hurricane,"" formed in a similar location as Milton in the Bay of Campeche. It then tracked eastward, just like Milton is doing, before hitting Tampa with a maximum sustained wind speed of 130 mph and a MSLP of 948 hPa.
Milton is already much worse than the Tampa Bay Hurricane in that its wind speeds are clocking in upwards of 180 mph with the minimum center pressure measured by the NOAA's Hurr Hunter at around 897 mb, though Milton could weaken some before making landfall depending on water temperatures, wind shear and other volatile factors.
""It's on its way to beat Wilma at 882,"" wrote another about the frightening trajectory of Milton.
""This is the second-strongest hurricane by pressure ever recorded here,"" someone wrote on X / Twitter about this impending disaster. ""Truly astonishing and terrifying.""
""Andrew's highest winds in '92 were 175 mph,"" wrote another, comparing Milton to Andrew, one of the worst hurricanes to ever hit the U.S.
""This is the fifth strongest hurricane ever in the Atlantic basin with both pressure and wind rating,"" said someone else.

Natural News,‘Anti-hate’ art exhibit in LA featured participants kicking around Donald Trump’s head – NaturalNews.com,"(Article by Paul Joseph Watson republished from Modernity.news)
Yes, really.
A rubber or latex object made to look like Trump’s dome was booted around by players during an indoor game at Superchief Gallery in Los Angeles last weekend.
The art installation was created by a group called INDECLINE and first debuted the Trump soccer ball four years ago when they invited people at the Mexican border to kick it around.
Laughably, the art collective claimed the point of the display was to demonstrate against Trump “spreading hate.”
“Political civility on full display I guess,” commented Mario Nawfal.

Because there’s nothing kinder and more appropriate in opposing ‘hate’ than to make a facsimile of someone’s decapitated head and treat it with total disrespect.
“Freedom Kick is an appeal to the American sense of justice as a match between two opposing teams,” said the group.
“The rules are meant to protect us from cheaters. We believe it is time to reset the game, before we have to spend another four years watching a cheeseburger-scarfing, bloviating mess hobble up and down the pitch spreading hate.”
Meanwhile, at another art exhibit in Los Angeles, a statue of a naked Trump with his genitals mutilated is on display at Subliminal Projects Gallery.
All this after two deranged leftists tried to assassination Trump in the last three months alone.

Natural News,Hillary Clinton says more internet censorship is needed to keep establishment from losing “total control” – NaturalNews.com,"Unless the establishment wants to lose ""total control"" of everything, social media companies need to do a whole lot more to silence users who depart from the official narratives, Clinton told the fake news giant's Michael Smerconish.
Clinton took aim specifically at X, formerly Twitter, which changed pretty substantially after electric vehicle (EV) guru Elon Musk bought the platform and took it private in 2022. Since that time, X has become a lot more right-wing whereas previously it leaned more to the left.
This dramatic shift in content moderation has not gone unnoticed by Clinton and others like her who feel as though the messages gaining the most traction on social media these days constitute ""misinformation.""
""We should be, in my view, repealing something called Section 230, which gave platforms on the internet immunity because they were thought to be just pass-throughs, that they shouldn't be judged for the content that is posted,"" Clinton rattled to Smerconish, referring to the Communications Decency Act.
""If they don't moderate and monitor the content, we lose total control.""
(Related: Hillary Clinton is back on the media circuit calling for Americans who speak against NATO and the U.S.-led military-industrial complex to be arrested and charged with crimes.)
Many on X are discussing the strange impacts of Hurricane Helene that suggest weather modification may have been at play. Clinton and others find this speculation to be dangerous, along with social media claims that FEMA is mishandling the crisis and even confiscating people's donations to those in need.
Americans and people in general need someone to tell them what to say and what to think, Clinton says. Without this outside brain, i.e., the government and its tentacles, controlling everything that people see, the establishment could lose its stranglehold on society, which worries Clinton.
Clinton would like to see a much stronger censorship apparatus in place to handle not just X but also Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, all of which are allowing people to post and share content that Clinton finds upsetting.
Globalist climate lunatic John Kerry agrees with Clinton. At a recent World Economic Forum (WEF) ""sustainability"" conference, Kerry complained that the First Amendment is standing in the way of the establishment's agenda.
""The dislike of and anguish over social media is just growing and growing,"" Kerry complained. ""It is part of our problem, particularly in democracies, in terms of building consensus around any issue.""
""It's really hard to govern today. You can't – the referees we used to have to determine what is a fact and what isn't a fact have kind of been eviscerated, to a certain degree. And people go and self-select where they go for their news, for their information. And then you get into a vicious cycle.""
First of all, nobody asked political fossil John Kerry to govern them, despite his obvious delusions of grandeur. Secondly, ""self-selecting"" which news sources to trust is called using one's brain in the way God intended.
Between Hillary Clinton's frantic calls for Americans to think of the children! by allowing more censorship and John Kerry's frustration about not having as much control over the masses these days, it is obvious that the powers that be (TPTB) are scared to death of losing control over everything, which appears to be happening with each passing day.
Hillary Clinton is an establishment tool who lacks the self-awareness to realize that nobody takes anything she says seriously anymore. Learn more at Censorship.news.

Natural News,Regime insiders reveal Biden-Harris administration is considering directly joining Israel in attacking Iran – NaturalNews.com,"The system to be sent is the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), which usually requires about 100 troops to operate. It would include six truck-mounted launchers, with eight interceptors on each launcher, as well as a powerful radar. It is capable of intercepting ballistic missiles at ranges of 100 to 125.
On ""Liberty Report"" with former Texas Rep. Ron Paul and Daniel McAdams, it was also brought up how the current regime is seriously considering directly participating in Israel's plan to bomb Iran.
""According to an NBC News article that came out, the unnamed administration sources are considering the possibility of the U.S. directly fighting, bombing Iran,"" McAdams said. ""But Iran is no Iraq. It is a massive country with a massive population, a very high-tech country. Starting the war with Iran is basically like starting a war with Iraq and Afghanistan times 100.""
McAdams added that the U.S. has currently 40,000 troops in the region with most of them in reach of any Iranian retaliatory strike. ""Does the U.S. government want these men and women be held hostage so that we can continue to backstop Israel's rampage throughout the region?"" he further inquired.
In response to the possible deployment of an anti-missile system, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi warned that the U.S. is putting the lives of its troops ""at risk"" by deploying them to operate missile systems in Israel, confirming McAdams' sentiment. (Related: Iran warns Israel not to respond to ballistic missile attack: ""Any miscalculation will lead to your sudden collapse."")
""While we have made tremendous efforts in recent days to contain an all-out war in our region, I say it clearly that we have no red lines in defending our people and interests,"" Araqchi posted on X.
Fawaz Gerges, a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics, told NBC News that President Joe Biden was sending a message to Iran that the U.S. will do ""whatever it takes to protect Israel,"" further risking a bigger escalation in the regional conflict.
""This risky strategy risks an all-out wider regional war,"" he said. ""This is the exact opposite of what the Biden administration has been trying to do.""
Three Gulf sources told Reuters that Gulf states are urging the United States government to stop Israel from attacking Iran's oil sites because they are concerned their own oil facilities could come under fire from Tehran's proxies if the conflict escalates.
Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, are also refusing to let Israel fly over their airspace. They are concerned that any attack on Iran could happen that would put them all at risk.
During meetings last week, Iran warned Saudi Arabia it could not guarantee the safety of the kingdom's oil facilities if Israel were given any assistance in carrying out an attack. Ali Shihabi, a Saudi analyst close to the Saudi royal court, said: ""The Iranians have stated: 'If the Gulf states open up their airspace to Israel, that would be an act of war.'""
Someone familiar with the discussions from the White House confirmed that Gulf officials had been in touch with U.S. counterparts to express concern about the potential scope of Israel's expected retaliation.
Biden and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke on Oct. 9 about the Israeli retaliation in a call both sides described as positive.
Jonathan Panikoff, former deputy U.S. national intelligence officer on the Middle East, said that the ""Gulf states' anxiety is likely to be a key talking point with Israeli counterparts in trying to convince Israel to undertake a carefully calibrated response.""

Natural News,"Fulton County judge defies Georgia Supreme Court, strikes down state’s six-week abortion ban – NaturalNews.com","The LIFE Act, which had been signed into law by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in 2019, had restricted abortion procedures after six weeks, once a fetal heartbeat could be detected, with limited exceptions for pregnancies deemed ""medically futile,"" and for pregnancies that are the result of rape or incest.
In November 2022, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ruled the law was ""unequivocally unconstitutional"" because it was enacted in 2019 before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and abortions were still federally protected. However, in October 2023, the Georgia Supreme Court rejected McBurney's ruling.
""When the United States Supreme Court overrules its own precedent interpreting the United States Constitution, we are then obligated to apply the Court’s new interpretation of the Constitution’s meaning on matters of federal constitutional law,"" Justice Verda Colvin wrote for the majority at the time.
However, McBurney defied the state's highest court by reaffirming his decision and declaring that the LIFE ACT violated the state constitution on Sept. 30.
McBurney argued that only women should have the authority to make decisions about their pregnancies before fetal viability. He stressed that legislators, judges or other external parties should not dictate such choices.
""For these women, the liberty of privacy means that they alone should choose whether they serve as human incubators for the five months leading up to viability. It is not for a legislator, a judge, or a Commander from The Handmaid’s Tale to tell these women what to do with their bodies during this period when the fetus cannot survive outside the womb any more so than society could – or should – force them to serve as a human tissue bank or to give up a kidney for the benefit of another,"" McBurney wrote in the ruling.
This, in turn, reopens access to abortion in Georgia up to 20 weeks of pregnancy. It also potentially sets up another legal battle as the state government may seek to appeal the decision in a higher court. For now, Georgia joins the ranks of states where abortion remains accessible beyond the six-week mark, though the debate is far from over.
The National Right to Life Committee (NRLC), the oldest and largest national anti-abortion organization in the United States, strongly criticized the decision and called McBurney an ""activist judge"" for ignoring previous rulings from both federal and state courts. (Related: Trump faces backlash after criticizing DeSantis’ 6-week abortion ban.)
""In an act that defies reason, this activist judge has decided to ignore the 2023 decision of the Georgia Supreme Court that declared the Living Infants Fairness and Equality Act constitutional,"" said Carol Tobias, the president of NRLC. ""This judge has chosen to make rulings based on his own beliefs rather than the law and higher court judgments.""
Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr said his office would immediately appeal the ruling to the state supreme court.

Natural News,Elon Musk campaigning for Donald Trump in crucial swing state of Pennsylvania – NaturalNews.com,"This comes after the Big Tech entrepreneur made a high-profile appearance with the former president at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. (Related: Elon Musk says nobody will bother to try to assassinate Kamala Harris because she’s just another “puppet” of the “machine.”)
""This will be the last election [if Trump doesn't win],"" said Musk during an appearance with Trump in Butler.
It was the first time that Musk, CEO of Tesla and owner of social media platform X, appeared at a Trump campaign event since he endorsed him back in July after the first attempt on his life.
""The truest test of someone's character is how they behave under fire,"" said Musk in his speech in Butler. ""We had one president who couldn't climb a flight of stairs, and another who was fist-pumping after getting shot.""
Pennsylvania is considered a crucial state for both Trump and his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, in the race for the Nov. 5 election. Both campaigns have been pouring campaign money and spending inordinate amounts of time rallying in the state.
Musk said his efforts on the campaign trail will focus on participating in campaign rallies for Trump in the four weeks leading up to Nov. 5. His appearances will have the backing of America PAC, but he is expected to make other appearances in the state independent of his super PAC, including a recent appearance at Pittsburgh Steelers game where he wore a MAGA hat and was greeted by Steelers owner Art Rooney II.
Musk's America PAC has also launched a get-out-the-vote initiative encouraging between 800,000 to one million voters in Pennsylvania and other battleground states to cast ballots for Trump.
America PAC has already spent about $80 million to help Trump. America PAC has already signed up about 2,500 organizers in the field, and the group has effectively set up effective election infrastructure in Wisconsin and are reportedly using statements from Musk as morale boosters for their efforts.
The scale of financial commitments Musk is personally fielding to help reelect Trump will not be made clear until mid-October, at the earliest. Estimates suggest America PAC is spending between $140 to $180 million, almost all of it from Musk's own vast wealth.
In private statements to associates, Trump has claimed that Musk's super PAC has provided his campaign with $500 million in donations. Trump in private conversations with Musk has stated that he appreciates the tech giant's aid and has promised to appoint him to a team that will oversee government efficiency if he is reelected.
""Unless Trump wins and we get rid of the mountain of smothering regulations (that have nothing to do with safety!), humanity will never reach Mars,"" said Musk in a post on X. ""This [election] is existential.""

Other than a handful of civilians, some of them working out of small government offices, there is nobody trying to help the many victims of Hurricane Helene who, like the above woman's aunt, are stuck in locations that are no longer accessible by car.
(Related: Parts of Asheville and western North Carolina are in ruins following Hurricane Helene, which unleashed a Mad Max-type scenario on the region.)
Besides not helping victims, the government that is on the ground in Appalachia is actually turning away volunteers and threatening them with punishment if they disobey.
""They are threatening to arrest those people,"" the woman in the video above explains. ""They are threatening to arrest people who are trying to ... help people survive. My aunt is 70 years old with mobility issues. Anyone know what the government ... doing? Jack ****.""
""There is no power, there is no water, they have no supplies, and the government is currently trying to arrest people who are delivering supplies via helicopter.""
As sad as it is to say this, it seems like North Carolina and Tennessee are getting the Lahaina treatment. Just like in Hawaii, disaster struck and the government took over – not to help the victims, mind you, but to seize control of the region for ulterior purposes.
In this case, it seems like the rich and powerful want western North Carolina's rich lithium and ultra-pure quartz reserves, which could explain why instead of helping the victims there, the government is turning people away and doing something else that we cannot yet see.
""Joe Biden said we're doing all that we can for North Carolina. Kamala Harris is currently having a fundraiser for her campaign in LA and Las Vegas, not for the people in North Carolina or Tennessee.""

Another noted that Biden just gave America's strategic stockpile of backup generators and transformers to Ukraine, but because of the port shutdown these critical items are still on U.S. soil and can still be intercepted and delivered to Appalachia where they truly belong.
""Confiscate it all and send it to western North Carolina where they're needed,"" this person wrote. ""We need to do this. Truckers idle from port strike could come to aid delivering tons of resources. Government turning away thousands trying to deliver aid and help could be the start of a needed peaceful revolution.""

Natural News,Kamala Harris hopes to use marijuana to appeal to black voters – NaturalNews.com,"Democrats typically fare well with black voters, but Harris is failing to inspire them and is poised to register the worst presidential election performance among this group in more than six decades.
The difference between Harris and Obama in this regard is dramatic. While Obama attracted the black vote by a margin of 85 points, Harris is up by only 54 points. When you look only at black men aged 18 to 45, the difference is even more apparent; Obama won this group by 81 points, while Harris is on track to take it by just a 41-point margin. This means that Harris could end up taking the lowest share of black votes sine the 1960 presidential election, when voters chose between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon.
What is Harris doing to try to reverse this embarrassing situation? The latest part of her plan appears to focus on marijuana. It’s been a topic she’s faced multiple times throughout the years, perhaps most notably during the second Democratic presidential primary debate in 2019 when then-Rep. Tulsi Gabbard attacked her while discussing the problems with America’s criminal justice system and how it disproportionately affects black and brown people.
“Now, Sen. Harris says she’s proud of her record as a prosecutor and that she’ll be a prosecutor president. But I’m deeply concerned about this record. There are too many examples to cite, but she put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana,” Gabbard said.
This diatribe was considered by many to be the final nail in her fledgling campaign’s coffin that time around, and it is clear she’s now hoping the country will forget about her reputation as “Kamala the Cop.” To that end, she has promised to put an end to the federal prohibition on marijuana use and even help black men get ahead in the marijuana business.
According to her campaign, ""[Harris] will also fight to ensure that as the national cannabis industry takes shape, Black men—who have, for years, been overpoliced for marijuana use—are able to access wealth and jobs in this new market.""
This is apparently being extended to cryptocurrency legislation as well. Despite attacking crypto for facilitating drug trafficking over the years, she has now decided that positioning it as a method for black men to build wealth is the way to go. She announced this week that she’ll support cryptocurrency regulations that protect black men who invest and own cryptocurrency.
She has also announced that she’ll be providing a million loans of up to $20,000 to black entrepreneurs who want to start a business, and they will be fully forgivable. Of course, the campaign has not provided much insight into how one might go about proving they are black enough to qualify.
Her plan also includes job training programs and a health program that emphasizes diseases that are known to “disproportionately impact Black men.” Obama lauded the plan on X, saying it “will lift up Black men and their families.”
Republican pollster Frank Luntz explained to CNN why many black voters seem to favor Trump, noting: “They feel victimized by the federal government, they feel like they’re attacked or even persecuted for being Black men, and they believe that Donald Trump understands their plight more than Harris does.”

Natural News,Disinformation isn’t the problem. Government coverups and censorship are the problem – NaturalNews.com,"(Article by John & Nisha Whitehead republished from Rutherford.org)
Clinton is not alone in her distaste for unregulated, free speech online.
A bipartisan chorus that includes both presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump has long clamored to weaken or do away with Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which essentially acts as a bulwark against online censorship.
It’s a complicated legal issue that involves debates over immunity, liability, net neutrality and whether or not internet sites are publishers with editorial responsibility for the content posted to their sites, but really, it comes down to the tug-of-war over where censorship (corporate and government) begins and free speech ends.
As Elizabeth Nolan Brown writes for Reason, “What both the right and left attacks on the provision share is a willingness to use whatever excuses resonate—saving children, stopping bias, preventing terrorism, misogyny, and religious intolerance—to ensure more centralized control of online speech. They may couch these in partisan terms that play well with their respective bases, but their aim is essentially the same.”
In other words, the government will use any excuse to suppress dissent and control the narrative.
The internet may well be the final frontier where free speech still flourishes, especially for politically incorrect speech and disinformation, which test the limits of our so-called egalitarian commitment to the First Amendment’s broad-minded principles.
On the internet, falsehoods and lies abound, misdirection and misinformation dominate, and conspiracy theories go viral.
This is to be expected, and the response should be more speech, not less.
As Justice Brandeis wrote nearly a century ago: “If there be time to expose through discussion, the falsehoods and fallacies, to avert the evil by the processes of education, the remedy to be applied is more speech, not enforced silence.”
Yet to the government, these forms of “disinformation” rank right up there with terrorism, drugs, violence, and disease: societal evils so threatening that “we the people” should be willing to relinquish a little of our freedoms for the sake of national security.
Of course, it never works out that way.
The war on terror, the war on drugs, the war on illegal immigration, the war on COVID-19: all of these programs started out as legitimate responses to pressing concerns only to become weapons of compliance and control in the government’s hands.
Indeed, in the face of the government’s own authoritarian power-grabs, coverups, and conspiracies, a relatively unfettered internet may be our sole hope of speaking truth to power.
The right to criticize the government and speak out against government wrongdoing is the quintessential freedom.
You see, disinformation isn’t the problem. Government coverups and censorship are the problem.
Unfortunately, the government has become increasingly intolerant of speech that challenges its power, reveals its corruption, exposes its lies, and encourages the citizenry to push back against the government’s many injustices. Every day in this country, those who dare to speak their truth to the powers-that-be find themselves censored, silenced or fired.
While there are all kinds of labels being put on so-called “unacceptable” speech today, the real message being conveyed by those in power is that Americans don’t have a right to express themselves if what they are saying is unpopular, controversial or at odds with what the government determines to be acceptable.
Where the problem arises is when you put the power to determine who is a potential danger in the hands of government agencies, the courts and the police.
Remember, this is the same government that uses the words “anti-government,” “extremist” and “terrorist” interchangeably.
This is the same government whose agents are spinning a sticky spider-web of threat assessments, behavioral sensing warnings, flagged “words,” and “suspicious” activity reports using automated eyes and ears, social media, behavior sensing software, and citizen spies to identify potential threats.
This is the same government that keeps re-upping the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which allows the military to detain American citizens with no access to friends, family or the courts if the government believes them to be a threat.
This is the same government that has a growing list—shared with fusion centers and law enforcement agencies—of ideologies, behaviors, affiliations and other characteristics that could flag someone as suspicious and result in their being labeled potential enemies of the state.
For instance, if you believe in and exercise your rights under the Constitution (namely, your right to speak freely, worship freely, associate with like-minded individuals who share your political views, criticize the government, own a weapon, demand a warrant before being questioned or searched, or any other activity viewed as potentially anti-government, racist, bigoted, anarchic or sovereign), you could be at the top of the government’s terrorism watch list.
Thus, no matter how well-meaning the politicians make these encroachments on our rights appear, in the right (or wrong) hands, benevolent plans can easily be put to malevolent purposes.
Even the most well-intentioned government law or program can be—and has been—perverted, corrupted and used to advance illegitimate purposes once profit and power are added to the equation. For instance, the very same mass surveillance technologies that were supposedly so necessary to fight the spread of COVID-19 are now being used to stifle dissent, persecute activists, harass marginalized communities, and link people’s health information to other surveillance and law enforcement tools.
We are moving fast down that slippery slope to an authoritarian society in which the only opinions, ideas and speech expressed are the ones permitted by the government and its corporate cohorts.
The next phase of the government’s war on anti-government speech and so-called thought crimes could well be mental health round-ups and involuntary detentions.
Under the guise of public health and safety, the government could use mental health care as a pretext for targeting and locking up dissidents, activists and anyone unfortunate enough to be placed on a government watch list.
This is how it begins.
In communities across the nation, police are already being empowered to forcibly detain individuals they believe might be mentally ill, based solely on their own judgment, even if those individuals pose no danger to others.
In New York City, for example, you could find yourself forcibly hospitalized for suspected mental illness if you carry “firmly held beliefs not congruent with cultural ideas,” exhibit a “willingness to engage in meaningful discussion,” have “excessive fears of specific stimuli,” or refuse “voluntary treatment recommendations.”
While these programs are ostensibly aimed at getting the homeless off the streets, when combined with advances in mass surveillance technologies, artificial intelligence-powered programs that can track people by their biometrics and behavior, mental health sensor data (tracked by wearable data and monitored by government agencies such as HARPA), threat assessments, behavioral sensing warnings, precrime initiatives, red flag gun laws, and mental health first-aid programs aimed at training gatekeepers to identify who might pose a threat to public safety, they could well signal a tipping point in the government’s efforts to penalize those engaging in so-called “thought crimes.”
As the Associated Press reports, federal officials are already looking into how to add “‘identifiable patient data,’ such as mental health, substance use and behavioral health information from group homes, shelters, jails, detox facilities and schools,” to its surveillance toolkit.
Make no mistake: these are the building blocks for an American gulag no less sinister than that of the gulags of the Cold War-era Soviet Union.
The word “gulag” refers to a labor or concentration camp where prisoners (oftentimes political prisoners or so-called “enemies of the state,” real or imagined) were imprisoned as punishment for their crimes against the state.
The gulag, according to historian Anne Applebaum, used as a form of “administrative exile—which required no trial and no sentencing procedure—was an ideal punishment not only for troublemakers as such, but also for political opponents of the regime.”
This age-old practice by which despotic regimes eliminate their critics or potential adversaries by making them disappear—or forcing them to flee—or exiling them literally or figuratively or virtually from their fellow citizens—is happening with increasing frequency in America.
Now, through the use of red flag laws, behavioral threat assessments, and pre-crime policing prevention programs, the groundwork is being laid that would allow the government to weaponize the label of mental illness as a means of exiling those whistleblowers, dissidents and freedom fighters who refuse to march in lockstep with its dictates.
Each state has its own set of civil, or involuntary, commitment laws. These laws are extensions of two legal principles: parens patriae Parens patriae (Latin for “parent of the country”), which allows the government to intervene on behalf of citizens who cannot act in their own best interest, and police power, which requires a state to protect the interests of its citizens.
The fusion of these two principles, coupled with a shift towards a dangerousness standard, has resulted in a Nanny State mindset carried out with the militant force of the Police State.
The problem, of course, is that the diagnosis of mental illness, while a legitimate concern for some Americans, has over time become a convenient means by which the government and its corporate partners can penalize certain “unacceptable” social behaviors.
In fact, in recent years, we have witnessed the pathologizing of individuals who resist authority as suffering from oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), defined as “a pattern of disobedient, hostile, and defiant behavior toward authority figures.”
Under such a definition, every activist of note throughout our history—from Mahatma Gandhi to Martin Luther King Jr. to John Lennon—could be classified as suffering from an ODD mental disorder.
Of course, this is all part of a larger trend in American governance whereby dissent is criminalized and pathologized, and dissenters are censored, silenced, declared unfit for society, labelled dangerous or extremist, or turned into outcasts and exiled.
As I make clear in my book Battlefield America: The War on the American People and in its fictional counterpart The Erik Blair Diaries, this is how you subdue a populace.
The ensuing silence in the face of government-sponsored tyranny, terror, brutality and injustice is deafening.

Natural News,Civil War scenario: Blockade & airstrike – NaturalNews.com,"(Article republished from Anarchonomicon.com)
I’m not as aggressive as Whatifalthist, I think there’s a lot of scenarios where a major regional war in the Middle-East occurs, or WW3 begins with Russia (we’ve gotten very close to Nuke launches during the war with Ukraine) as factions in the deep state push for an October surprise if they think Trump might win.
Likewise I think there’s numerous ways where a crisis could happen that results in a minor war or last minute corrupt compromise that lets America limp on to 2028? Maybe 2032?
If you look at the Russian revolution, there was the Russo-Japanese war that was supposed to resolve the Russian Empire’s geopolitical and internal problems, then Russia lost, then the revolution of 1905 occured which left the Tzar in charge with a nominal “Not a Constitution” and a sort-of democratically elected duma… Then it limped on sort-of on and off in a state of low level almost civil war (the Prime minister Stolypin was assassinated right in front of the Tzar and his family at the opera in the period by radical leftists)… And then ww1 happened, and then the february revolution of 1917 happened, and then the October revolution that brought the Bolsheviks to power… THEN they had their full on civil war.
So a lot of crazy stuff can happen between even a great war or a Trump assassination and civil war… or We could go zero to civil war in 6 months like in 1860-61… it wouldn’t be the states doing it, but if something suddenly motivated 0.01% of armed Americans to each kill 1 government/or rival political group’s official or burn down 1 government or rival political group’s building in a six month period… That alone would cause a breakdown in government authority across the country and probably a massive streisand effect whereby partisan actors are pressured to condemn and demand insane policies or police responses as a result, and then the “pre-mature” rebellion against tyranny or “tyranny” creates the unambiguous Tyranny that justifies the rebellion and allows the early rebels to start recruiting and conscripting to their movement.
Repeat that on both sides with enough rounds fired and bombs detonated, and you have northern Ireland or South Vietnam… but in a country with more guns than people.
However I want to emphasize: a US civil war is virtually inevitable in the next 10 years… no matter what is done at the federal level or who gains the reigns… The US government’s budgetary situation, the insane and death spiraling levels of dependence on Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans benefits, Welfare, Public housing, and food stamps, and the declining US Geopolitical situation and its impact on the world dollar demand (look up “petrodollar”) ensures that the inevitable budget crisis will immediately be felt either in hyper-inflation, hyper-taxation (Read: property confiscation. why do you think they’re pushing “unrealized capital gains”? they’re preparing to take your retirement fund and house in a budget crisis), and cut spending resulting in loss of service, rioting, and collapse.
You can read my deep dive into the budget problems:
BUT that is not what this piece is about… A Second US civil war would be an event bigger than world war 2. Civil Conflicts would almost immediately spill over into Europe, Canada, the Cartels would get involved from Mexico, the Migrant madness would take on a newer more insane dimension (as one or the other faction tries, and probably fails to employ the dregs of the third world against their rivals) any impact on global supply chains would probably cause mass famines and apocalyptic wars throughout Africa, the Middle-East, and Southeast Asia.
But that is also NOT what this piece is about… These are just the basics I feel the need to share every time I talk about the matter to show WHY any of these scenarios result in global cascades of unpredictability, instability, and apocalyptic consequences.
The point of this piece, what I hope will be the first in a series of Civil War Scenarios, is to wargame out different possible dynamics that could play out in the event of a second civil war, or the equivalent consequent wars that would probably affect your country.
Unlike the Rationalist community or the wider prediction world, the point of these scenarios will NOT be to assign probability likelihoods to given events… but to create detailed hypothetical that will hopefully illustrate dynamic or uncover concerns.
Any given event has a relatively small likelihood of occuring, and even several VERY likely events events with a likelihood of 50%… When stacked, collapse in probability.
Even if you think it’s a 50% chance civil war occurs, and 50% the faction that forms in DC will occupy Virginia, and that having done so it’d be 50% they’d have to patrol the Appalachian Highlands there, and that having done so it’s 50% likely they’d get bogged down in mountain warfare there… then in this hypothetical just taking those probabilities credulously, the odds, from the perspective of today) that mountain warfare erupt there would be only 6.25% likelihood (50% x 50% x 50% x 50%).
From a probabilistic perspective it’s very hard to say ANYTHING definite about the future once you get in the garden of forking paths. Is the crisis of the 2020s going to be Civil War in the US? WW3 against Russia in Europe? A regional war in the Middle-East and America marching on Tehran? A budget crisis and mass civil unrest/weimar style financial social collapse? Or might we get 2 or more of these in a bizarre unpredictable order with odd time delays? (the last one)
Who predicted Hurricane Helene and the abysmal response? Yet if you asked anyone who followed previous events and responses closely, and had some mild subject matter knowledge WHAT would have happened IF a once in 100 year rainfall hit the upper-south/Apalachia… they probably could have predicted how it would play out with a shocking amount of detail.
For that reason in this series I’d like to wargame out some scenarios, focusing less on their likelihood than the dynamics that they reveal.
That hopefully if enough detailed pictures are painted in advance and enough dynamic described, that we’ll guess at some of the details and dynamics that actually occur.
The thing about the famous Joe Biden quote above is… In a hypothetical US civil War, the Government might not really have F-16s (or F-18s, F-22s and F-35s… Whatever the state of the phaseout is (looks like never)).
Aside from the possibility of maintenance supply chains, ground crews, and pilots being potential on the ground targets in a hypothetical frontless insurgency/guerilla conflict as many have suggested, which could seriously degrade the tempo and feasibility of operating much of the US air force… In Between arms shipments Ukraine and Israel the US arsenal is currently incredibly depleted, and a majority of that arsenal must be retained in strategic reserve against the possibility of near peer enemies like Russia and China launching high intensity wars against the US empire.
If we look at Gaza, the population there has endured what might just be the largest aerial bombing campaign in history. 70,000 ton of conventional bombs, more than the ww2 bombing campaigns against Dresden, Hamburg, and London combined, have been dropped on an area 25 miles long by 3.5-7.5 miles wide. 141 square miles.
I don’t have the stats but per square mile this might be the largest conventional bombing campaign in history… potentially beating out, in one year, even the US bombing of the Iron Triangle in the Cu Chi district of Vietnam across 10 years 1965-’75.
And yet even taking the Lancet’s all cause casualty estimates of 189,000 dead (8.5% of the pre-war population of 2.2 million) ~90% of the people of Gaza are still alive, and Hamas basically has the same, or a SLIGHTLY INCREASED fighting force from 40k pre-war to 30-50k today (they’ve had a lot of volunteers in light of 1 in 10 husbands losing their wife and 1 in 10 fathers losing their child).
Simply put aerial bombardment has NEVER broken the will of a populace to fight, people are driven by MARGINAL incentives… if an old lady is just as likely to be bombed as a bloodthirsty young radical, there’s no incentive not to be a young radical… And a lot to be one (you might get to avenge your grandma, and it’s not like you being a pacifist loser faggot in the eyes of your friends and family will actually grant you any protection from falling explosives).
So if Hamas and Gaza haven’t been broken after 500 TONS of explosive have been dropped PER SQUARE MILE on perhaps the most densely populated areas in the world (more than 15,000 people per square mile, 33 pounds per person, or 780lbs per acre)… What could the US do against say… Dallas-Fort Worth. With conventional weapons.

Natural News,"Israeli attack on Hezbollah leading Tel Aviv down dead-end path as Netanyahu has no victory, exit plan – NaturalNews.com","Back then, it was Hezbollah that had the upper hand, resulting in Israel being overtaken by Hezbollah forces. Now, Israel has the upper hand since Hezbollah did not expect the attack. The problem is, will Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu be able to come up with a plan for victory or is this all a dead end?
""Nonetheless, after the technically impressive (if humanly questionable) opener, with the land invasion, Tel Aviv finds itself heading down the path that could well prove a repetition of Hezbollah’s mistake,"" reports Free West Media's Marko Marjanovi?. ""It is now Israel that is launching a war that doesn’t come with victory conditions or an exit plan.""
""Other than to deliver an October surprise and supercharge swing-state Evangelicals for Trump, what is the land offensive supposed to accomplish, and how may the success of such an enterprise be distinguished from failure? As in Gaza, the IDF will go forward, inflict some losses, sustain some losses, capture some ground, then sooner or later vacate it. Okay, great. So what's the point? What does it accomplish?""
(Related: Major retaliation is underway after Israel took out Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah's top chief, in a recent air attack.)
What many people do not realize is that Hezbollah fought against Western-led forces in the Middle East that sought to expel Shiites, Allawites and Christians from Syria, and turn the area into an Islamic state.
The names of these various groups can get confusing, especially since allegiances are always changing – remember ISIS and Al-Qaeda? It is complicated to say the least, but Hezbollah has actually functioned as a deterrent against Western-led regime changes in that particular corner of the Middle East.
In 2013, Hezbollah stepped in to stop the Western-led assault on Syria's then-secular government. Lebanese Hezbollah not only provided what Marjanovi? describes as ""the most cohesive units of the war, but also helped arm, train, and organize self-defense units for vulnerable Shiite, but also Christian, enclaves.""
""That today there remain Christians, Allawites, and Shiites in Syria is in part thanks to Hezbollah,"" she says.
""Thus, while there are Muslims in Al-Qaeda-held Idlib who detested Nasrallah, there are also Christians in the same country who regarded him as a friend and benefactor in the greatest hour of need. Indeed, it would be interesting to know of the people celebrating in Idlib how many are upset with Hezbollah chiefly for getting in the way of their sectarian cleansing of the country.""
Hezbollah's apparent plan in the face of Israel's newfound aggression was simply to play along ""in a performative manner,"" according to Marjanovi?, ""seeking no more than a half-phony, symbolic war."" The assumption was that there would be an eventual ceasefire, which has not yet materialized.
The fighting is likely to continue in the coming weeks and months with a lot of back-and-forth. There is also the possibility that a much larger war erupts not just in the Middle East but worldwide, culminating with World War III.
In 2024, the only remaining serious militia in Lebanon is Shia Hezbollah. The West wants everyone to believe that this group is a ""terrorist"" group, but the truth is that it is a Shia ethnic militia in Lebanon that has about 50,000 Hezbollah fighters in its ranks, which pales in comparison to the size of Israel's army.

“We are not afraid to entrust the American people with unpleasant facts, foreign ideas, alien philosophies, and competitive values. For a nation that is afraid to let its people judge the truth and falsehood in an open market is a nation that is afraid of its people.” — President John F. Kennedy.
Hillary Says the First Amendment means “We Lose Total Control”
Clinton Continues Her Censorship Campaign on CNN, and the presstitute media supports their own demise.
Jonathan Turley notes that Hillary and the Democrats want free speech only for their ideological agendas. Everyone else has to shut up.
Watch tens of millions of dumbshit Americans vote for this tyranny on November 4.
If Empire Of Lies Crumbles, Hillary Clinton Warns: “We’ll Lose Total Control”
Hillary Clinton told CNN host Michael Smerconish that unless social media companies are censored “we lose total control.” Only censorship and the First Amendment’s destruction can save the Elites’ Empire of Lies.
Wall Street Journal Editor Emma Tucker said: “We owned the news. We were the gatekeepers, and we very much owned the facts as well.”
She added that people are learning that they cannot trust the whore media and that, consequently, the presstitutes are having a difficult time protecting the official narratives, which are lies that permit a handful of corrupt elites to impose their agendas.
The First Amendment is under full scale attack by Democrats. They openly admit that it is a major block to their ability to gain power by manipulating the information that people receive.
Read The Empire of Lies by Paul Craig Roberts:
“Paul Craig Roberts is one of the best and most-informed political commentators today. I urge everybody to read his indispensable book The Empire of Lies, ” Llewellyn H. Rockwell.
PCR is a national treasure
This is the best of several books by PCR I’ve read. I like the layout, with topics grouped in such a way that you can inform yourself about them by category.
PCR is careful with his prose. He doesn’t assert certainty unless he really is certain, and he uses conditional language wherever that’s appropriate.
If you want to get up to speed on current events and recent, relevant history with one book, this is the one to buy.
Unbiased Potential Truth in a World of Lies
In a nutshell, this collection of essays is an exposé of major deceptions in five critical areas. In addition to a detailed chapter on deception vis-à-vis economics, which was PCR’s formal profession as a professor at US universities and as the chief of economic policy under President Ronald Reagan, he also tackles US foreign policy, notably the War in Ukraine, September 11, COVID-19 vaccines, and the unreliability of the corporate media. While I don’t agree with everything in the book, it is intellectually honest and unhindered by political correctness, which is a rarity in the current age of self-censorship. The book represents a refreshing novel account of current and past events that shaped the 21th century from the perspective of a highly critical and analytical Washington insider.
What is particular refreshing about the book is that the author is clearly not representing nor defending the left or the right. This is not a political manifest; the author’s stated intention is to get to the truth wherever it leads.

Natural News,"U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003 because of Zionist interests that controlled George W. Bush, new book reveals – NaturalNews.com","Deadly Betrayal: The Truth of Why We Invaded Iraq tells the ugly story of how the United States came to become a warmongering police state controlled by foreign interests that use and abuse our brave men and women in the military for their own private gain.
In 2003 when then-President George W. Bush launched the war in Iraq following the controlled demolition of the World Trade Center towers in New York City, the lie that ""weapons of mass destruction"" were hiding in Iraq was used as the excuse to mislead the American public into supporting military intervention against the regime of Saddam Hussein.
Fritz says the WMD narrative was a cover story, and that the actual reason for the war in Iraq was to benefit Zionist Israel and its lobby.
""We invaded Iraq ... to start a proxy war on behalf of Israel by eliminating its enemies – Hamas and Hezbollah,"" Fritz says.
(Related: Did you catch our other recent story about how the U.S. still controls all of Iraq's oil revenues more than 20 years after the war started?)
It is also a general misconception that the war in Iraq was all about oil. Those opposed to the war at the time could be heard chanting things like ""no blood for oil!"" as this is what the controlled opposition was saying at the time about what the war was supposedly aimed at getting.
""The common perception that the Iraq war was fought for oil is not borne out by the facts,"" writes Frank Wright for LifeSiteNews. ""In the latest round of bids for oil licenses, no major U.S. corporation was represented. Instead, the Chinese dominated.""
""Fritz dismisses the oil pretext, saying instead that the Iraq war was launched by a neoconservative faction, to serve the interests of Israel, with the pretext of 'spreading democracy.'""
Fritz provides so much conclusive evidence to support his book's claims that the Eisenhower Media Network issued a glowing summary of them to support their legitimacy.
Fritz's book, EMN says, contains a ""detailed and first-hand account of how the Pentagon cabal strategized to manipulate intelligence, pressure the United Nations, force a Congressional authorization for the use of force through political threats, and scare the American people after 9/11 into supporting an attack on Iraq.""
The EMN, by the way, is an ""organization of expert former military, intelligence, and civilian national security officials"" that exists to counter the misleading claims and lies of the military-industrial complex, which President Eisenhower famously warned is an existential threat to America in his 1961 valedictory speech.
Wright, who already read the book, says he is fully convinced the military-industrial complex is real and that it is powerful enough to start wars based on lies and misdirection in order to achieve its ends.
Sen. J.D. Vance (R-Ohio) has spoken out as well about the military-industrial complex, which he says ""led to the genocide of a million historic Christians.""
The Zionist Israel lobby dismisses this kind of rhetoric as ""antisemitic,"" but the facts speak for themselves – and Fritz's book is full of them.
""And the same unelected people are orchestrating the war in the Middle East and the Ukraine,"" a commenter added.
""While countless innocent people get killed and injured, and the few will reap the spoils of war. They are the real enemy of peace, stability and democracy.""
This government ""by the people"" and ""for the people"" sure seems to work for Israel above all else. Learn more at Corruption.news.

Natural News,THE FINAL ELECTION? Elon Musk says illegal immigration into swing states is a blatant Democrat “voter importation scam” and the BIGGEST threat to democracy – NaturalNews.com,"Phase one began four years ago when the U.S. southern border was left wide open for all illegal immigrants from around the world to enter, where they receive funding, medical care and transportation deep into the United States. Phase two involves bussing and flying these illegal aliens into the key seven “swing” states, where there are usually very close races between top politicians running for Congress and the Presidency. Phase three entails making sure all these illegals can vote, whether that means providing them with identification cards, falsified ballots or fast-tracking their citizenship (faster than ever before in history).
The voter importation scam is almost complete. Anyone remember what happened in California in 1986 when all the illegal immigrants were granted amnesty? Elon Musk, who is pouring his wealth into support for a MAGA win, has pointed out what many of us are witnessing as a wave of blue taking over the swing states, illegally.
Now, since the Biden/Harris regime has run the country for nearly four years, with the border wide open, we’re all witnessing the population of the key 7 swing states turn from American to migrant-dominated, and most of these folks are likely to vote for free “stuff” and to not get deported by the next President.
Since 2021, in Georgia, unauthorized migrants total nearly 50,000, and that’s over a 400 percent increase. Is that enough to illegally flip the state blue for good? That’s 16 electoral college votes. We will find out next month.
Since 2021, in North Carolina, nearly 30,000 migrants have taken nest, and that’s more than a 445 percent increase. Coincidence they ended up in that swing state, where the Democrats desperately need those 15 electoral college votes to secure the win?
Since 2021, in Pennsylvania, over 25,000 illegal aliens have dug in, increasing that statistic by nearly 250 percent. That’s a whopping 20 electoral college votes. Another coincidence for the Democrats? We think not.
In Arizona, about 25,000 illegals have nested in the desert and suburbs, increasing that immigration statistic by over 730 percent. Will the crooked Dems chalk up those 11 electoral college votes thanks to illegals who are likely to vote for amnesty and more free government handouts?
In Nevada, at least 16,000 unauthorized migrants have squatted, bringing that statistic up over 560 percent in just four years. That’s 6 more electoral college votes likely to swing to the demonic Dems.
Then there’s Michigan, where over 13,000 undocumented migrants have found a “new home.” That’s a 775 percent increase under the Dem-Commie regime. That swing state carries 16 electoral college votes. Will the illegals help the Dems secure those also?
Lastly, there’s Wisconsin, another vital swing state leaning towards a Democrat win, with over 10,700 illegal migrants bussed and flown in by the Biden regime. That’s about 11,000 unauthorized migrants converting the population with over a 465 percent influx in the past four years. Wisconsin carries 10 electoral college votes.
That’s 94 swing state electoral college votes that Kommie Kamala most likely has no chance at winning without garnering thousands of illegal votes from illegal aliens.

Natural News,Polls and pollsters all agree that J.D. Vance is more likable than Tim Walz – NaturalNews.com,"Some of this data is a reaction to the vice presidential debate, during which most pollsters and political analysts willingly admitted that Vance won the debate. However, these same pollsters and analysts are still trying to convince the world that Vance and Walz have fought to a statistical draw, and that independents are actually siding with Walz more. (Related: J.D. Vance promises higher wages for middle-class and working-class Americans under a second Trump administration.)
Polling from Rasmussen Reports finds that 33 percent of voters view Vance very favorably and 17 percent view him somewhat favorably, while Walz is viewed very favorably or somewhat favorably by 28 percent and 14 percent, respectively. This puts the Ohio Republican's overall favorability at 50 percent, eight points clear of the Minnesota Democrat.
Walz is also viewed unfavorably by slightly more likely voters than Vance, at 44 versus 42 percent.
Introduced to the national electorate as a Midwestern dad and longtime National Guard veteran, details of the fraud and mismanagement in Walz’s state, his lies about his military service, and his LGBT indoctrination in schools, among other revelations, have tarnished the Minnesota Democrat's once relatively inoffensive image.
Following the debate, media outlets noted that Walz came off as nervous, stumbling over his words and failing to fend off pointed questions regarding the questionable parts of his career, including, for instance, his many trips to China and when they took place.
The Times of London New York correspondent Will Pavia described Walz as looking ""staggered,"" ""distinctly uncomfortable"" and highlighted how he ""confused Israel and Iran"" out of the gate.
""He kept halting mid-sentence. I wondered if the television was frozen. There was enough time to check, before he started talking again,"" Pavia wrote.
The Times of London United States assistant editor David Charter described Walz as ""visibly nervous"" and Vance, by contrast, came off as ""self-assured.""
""Despite being vilified by Democrats as a misogynistic opportunist after his comments on 'childless cat ladies' running the country, Vance gave a slick performance promoting Trumpism with civility, empathy and focus,"" he admitted.
Walz, in contrast, was again dinged for having ""muddled up Iran and Israel"" and for having ""bumbled through a non-answer that involved admitting he was 'a knucklehead at times'"" when pressed on the fact he lied about being in China during the Tiananmen Square massacre.
Meanwhile, The Telegraph said its experts were ""unanimous"" in believing that Vance triumphed over Walz. They observed: ""He was not, in the words of Walz in an earlier rally, 'weird.' His answers on policy issues were detailed, and he spoke repeatedly about children and families in a way that was designed to appeal to the female voters who are driving Kamala Harris' poll lead.""
Instead, ""It was Walz, the man picked by Harris for his folksy Midwestern charm, who came unstuck in front of the cameras,"" the newspaper observed. ""Stuttering over his words, getting agitated and failing to pick up on some of the most obvious attack lines to use against Vance, he looked out of his depth on the stage.""

Natural News,UN under fire in Lebanon: Israeli tank fired at peacekeepers’ watchtower – NaturalNews.com,"The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) announced that peacekeepers near Kfar Kila witnessed an Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) Merkava main battle tank firing at their watchtower, destroying two surveillance cameras and causing structural damage to the tower.
This incident is only the latest in a troubling pattern of deliberate Israeli actions targeting UN peacekeepers amid the country's intensified military operations in southern Lebanon that have led to at least 20 UNIFIL peacekeepers being injured by Israeli attacks.
Prior to this incident, UNIFIL reported on Sunday, Oct. 13, that Israeli troops ""forcibly entered"" a UNIFIL position near the southern Lebanese village of Ramyah and crossed the UN-mandated Blue Line, which serves as the de facto border between Israel and Lebanon.
Following this, Israeli forces fired smoke rounds in the vicinity of peacekeepers, causing skin irritation and gastrointestinal issues for 15 personnel.
UNIFIL also highlighted that Israeli troops obstructed critical logistical movements near Meiss el-Jabal on Saturday, Oct. 12, further complicating humanitarian efforts.
In a statement, UNIFIL reminded the IDF and other actors of their obligations to protect UN personnel and property and to respect the inviolability of UN premises.
Meanwhile, the IDF has continued its operations in southern Lebanon. Reports indicate that at least 16 individuals were killed in an Israeli strike on a municipal building in Nabatieh on Wednesday, Oct. 16, including several local officials. The Lebanese Health Ministry reported that since Oct. 8, Israel has killed 2,367 people and injured 11,109. (Related: Israel laying claim to southern Lebanon as IDF plants Israeli flags on non-Israeli territory.)
The UN Security Council has urged Israel to safeguard peacekeepers amid rising international condemnation of the violence.
On Oct. 9, a coalition of 16 European Union nations contributing to UNIFIL called for revised rules of engagement, asserting the need for more effective measures in light of recent attacks.
Italian Defense Minister Guido Crosetto emphasized that the message to Israel is clear. If military operations cease, UN forces could adjust their approach to achieve peaceful outcomes without violence.
The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) expressed ""particularly grave concerns"" regarding Israel's recent attacks on UN peacekeepers, affirming its support for the Lebanese people and condemning the escalation of violence.
Concerns for the safety of UN peacekeeping forces are escalating. UN Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations Jean-Pierre Lacroix warned that ongoing hostilities between Israeli forces and Hezbollah pose increasingly serious risks to peacekeepers. He described the situation as ""alarming"" and stressed that the safety and security of peacekeepers are now in jeopardy.
In its defense, the IDF has claimed, without evidence, that Hezbollah is deliberately operating in proximity to UNIFIL positions to use them as human shields, and stated that it had communicated with UN forces to remain in protected spaces during Israeli operations.

Natural News,Hurricane response proves volunteerism is better than authoritarianism – NaturalNews.com,"(Article republished from RonPaulInstitute.org)
For example, one private helicopter pilot rescued an individual stranded by Helene. Unfortunately, he was threatened with arrest if he flew his helicopter back into the impacted area to save someone left behind on the earlier flight.
In a video shared by comedian and political commentator Jimmy Dore, Jonathan Howard, a member of the Florida State Guard and volunteer for the nonprofit group Aerial Recovery, discussed how the government took credit for the rescue of an 11-day-old baby even though the rescue was done totally by volunteers. Mr. Howard stated that when he goes on a search and rescue mission he sees around forty other private helicopters and just two military helicopters.
One reason the federal government is unable to provide adequate aid to those impacted by Helene (and now Milton) is the government is sending military aid worth billions of dollars to Ukraine and Israel. In fact, over 700 members of the Tennessee National Guard are deploying to the Middle East as people in the state deal with damage from Hurricane Helene!
When questioned on Fox News about Helene’s impact, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham made an impassioned plea …. for more aid to Israel. Senator Graham is far from the only member of Congress to put the needs of foreign countries and the military-industrial complex ahead of Americans.
Congress will likely consider a multi-billion-dollar disaster relief bill in the post-election “lame duck” session. Conservative Republicans will (properly) demand the spending be offset by cuts in other spending. The problem is most of these “fiscal conservatives” will vote to increase the national debt to fund the military-industrial-complex.
When I served in Congress, I voted against federal disaster aid even when the disaster impacted my district. Inevitably my office would receive complaints from outraged constituents. After a few months of jumping through the federal government’s bureaucratic hoops in seeking to recover from the disaster, many constituents would call my office to say that they now agree that they would be better off if the government would stop trying to “help” the victims of natural disasters.
One of the helicopter pilots who voluntarily flew into the areas impacted by Helene was Curves fitness chain founder Gary Heavin. Mr. Heavin, in addition to being a successful businessman, is a passionate advocate for liberty who serves on the advisory board of my Institute for Peace and Prosperity. It is not surprising that someone who believes in liberty would be willing to help those in need rather than rely on the government to provide assistance.
Contrary to the lies spread by authoritarians, libertarianism does not require selfishness. Libertarians welcome voluntary action to help those in need. Libertarians object to government assistance because it is based on force. Authoritarianism leads to poverty, war, chaos in the streets, and a lack of compassion for the less fortunate. Liberty leads to prosperity, peace, and a flourishing of private charities.

Natural News,U.S. Postal Service refusing to disclose who paid for nine trucks that transferred up to 1.5 million counterfeit election ballots in 2020 – NaturalNews.com,"Rasmussen Reports shared the following video update from Patrick Byrne who shared a quick walk-through of USPS corruption in the 2020 election, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) case surrounding it, and the emergency injunction that was just filed this week against the USPS:

(Related: Be sure to also check out our other report detailing how Wisconsin rigged the 2020 vote for Joe Biden and plans to do the same thing again in 2024 for Kamala Harris.)
On Friday of last week, a complaint was filed before the U.S. District Court in Maryland bearing evidence that the USPS acted illegally by shipping at least one million mail-in ballots from a facility in Bethpage, N.Y., to Pennsylvania on Oct. 21, 2020. Brian Della Rocca filed the suit and John Moynihan and Larry Doyle provided the critical evidence for it.
Owen Gregorian (@OwenGregorian on X / Twitter), a close friend of Moynihan and Doyle, tweeted that he has known Moynihan since 1998 when they were partners at BERG Associates, LLC, praising him for being one of the world's best financial and forensic investigators ""hands down.""
""Here is the bottom-line – the truck driver, Jesse Morgan, picked up a container filled with 20 Gaylord boxes,"" Gregorian explains. ""There were mail-in ballots in each of the Gaylords. A Gaylord can hold from 50,000 up to 100,000 ballots. Do the math – Mr. Morgan was transporting at least one million mail-in ballots (already filled in with signatures on the envelopes). So, what you say?""
""The mail-in ballots are First Class mail. Every piece of First Class mail is supposed to be imaged per USPS regulations. The facility where Morgan picked up the load of ballots is ONLY certified for handling packages and Express Mail. There is no legal justification to account for those ballots to have passed through that warehouse.""
All of this has been known by Gregorian and the others since the time it happened. We, too, reported on the mysterious truck delivery from New York to Pennsylvania that the USPS facilitated under the cover of darkness. And, finally, we are now seeing some action on a case aiming to hold the USPS accountable for potential election tampering.
Rasmussen further reported that there were actually nine trucks involved in the heist. The USPS as of now is refusing to disclose who paid for these trucks to make the counterfeit ballot deliveries that ultimately threw the election for Biden and Kamala, the latter of whom is about to be handed another phony ""win"" this November.
Former attorney general William Barr reportedly told investigators to ""stand down on this"" in December of 2020, urging them in an ""irate"" manner not to look any further into allegations of election fraud. This makes Barr an obvious co-conspirator in the election heist.
""The election was rigged 100%,"" tweeted Shaun Humphrey (@ShaunHumphrey65) on X / Twitter. ""No modern-day president has ever lost re-election when winning Florida, Ohio, and Iowa. If you rig an election, it should be treason.""

Natural News,Biden-Harris administration could make a last-minute power grab by declaring a “climate emergency” – NaturalNews.com,"It's an option that has been on the table for quite some time. The administration previously considered making a similar emergency declaration when clean energy legislation negotiations stalled. And just days after Biden’s inauguration, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called on him to declare a climate emergency. More recently, Bloomberg reported in April that White House officials had been talking about declaring a national climate emergency to coincide with Earth Day.
Rather than doing anything to actually help the environment, the aim of declaring this type of emergency would be appealing to the Democratic Party's climate extremist donor base and voters who say they are concerned about the environment.
The declaration would allow them to suspend offshore drilling and oil exports on the pretense of decreasing carbon dioxide emissions, but the amount of power that they stand to gain from such an emergency is the real draw here.
This type of move would be unprecedented, and most experts believe that they would face substantial legal challenges if they attempted to do so. However, as environmental activists demand increasingly bolder moves to address the dangers they perceive from global warming, this could represent a last-ditch effort to appeal to this segment of the voter base.
On Earth Day, several environmental groups carried out protests pushing for such a declaration ahead of summer and its extreme temperatures. Now, as the southeastern U.S. gets hit with two major hurricanes in quick succession, many people are taking the opportunity to blame the major storms on climate change, and the administration could take advantage of the emotions surrounding the aftermath of the hurricanes to justify making such a declaration.
ClimateDepot.com Executive Editor Marc Morano told Fox Business: “NBC News has reported that if Joe Biden declared a national climate emergency, he would have COVID-like powers under that emergency and NBC also compared the climate emergency powers to the 911 emergency powers.”
He pointed out that the Center for Biological Diversity estimated that this type of declaration would give Biden around 130 “wartime-like powers"" that would allow him to go around normal legislative procedures to enforce the Green New Deal on our country without having to pass it through Congress. It essentially allows the administration to avoid the checks and balances built into our country's legislative branch and can even give the president access to funds from the Treasury to deal with the so-called emergency.
This could also pave the way for providing even more subsidies and mandates related to ""green” industries such as electric vehicles, solar and wind, which is pretty concerning when you consider that subsidies for renewable energy producers more than doubled in the years from 2016 to 2022. It's hard to say how much all of this would cost taxpayers, but it certainly won't be cheap.
Forbes media chairman Steve Forbes said that such a declaration would essentially “wreck” the American economy, adding: “You’re going to pay for it with an even more troubled economy.” Rising energy prices would only be the start of our worries; once liberals seize more power, there is no telling how far they will take it.

Natural News,Russia pledges military support to North Korea amid rising tensions – NaturalNews.com,"""If an act of aggression is committed against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, all necessary measures will be taken in accordance with our legislation and that of the DPRK [North Korea],"" Rudenko told Russia's TASS news agency. This declaration underscores the growing military collaboration between the two nations.
In June, Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un signed a strategic partnership pact aimed at bolstering military ties. This treaty includes a mutual defense clause, stating that both countries ""shall immediately provide military and other assistance"" if one faces armed invasion from other states.
This assistance is being framed as legal within the context of Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, which grants member states the right to ""individual or collective self-defense"" in the event of an attack. (Related: North Korean operatives being deployed to help Russia in war against Ukraine.)
""The treaty is signed and public,"" Rudenko emphasized. ""It has Article 4, which specifically addresses mutual assistance in case of aggression against one of the parties.""
Rudenko's remarks come amid heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula, as North Korea has issued threats of war against South Korea over alleged drone flights near Pyongyang. In response, South Korea has declared it is ""fully ready"" to counter any so-called aggression from the North.
Additionally, Rudenko's comments follow claims by Ukrainian intelligence that North Korean troops are actively fighting in Ukraine.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky alleged that North Korea is sending its citizens to support Russia's military efforts. ""We see an increasing alliance between Russia and regimes like North Korea,"" he stated, noting that this collaboration extends beyond mere weapons transfers to include personnel.
Zelensky's assertions are set against the backdrop of the quickly warming relationship between Moscow and Pyongyang, highlighted by Putin's visit to the communist nation back in June that resulted in the military alliance and raised concerns among Western analysts regarding North Korea's potential role in bolstering Russia's military operations in Ukraine.
A source in Ukrainian intelligence, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, reported that a small number of North Koreans have been working alongside the Russian military, primarily in engineering roles and providing expertise on North Korean munitions. Some of these personnel have reportedly been killed in eastern Ukraine.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the allegations of North Korean personnel aiding Russia as ""another hoax."" However, South Korea's National Intelligence Service is closely monitoring developments and has indicated that claims of North Korean casualties in Ukraine may hold merit.
South Korean Minister of National Defense Kim Yong Hyun expressed concerns, stating: ""It is highly likely that the reported casualties of North Korean officers and soldiers in Ukraine are true,"" and added that the potential for further deployments of North Korean regular troops is significant due to the evolving military alliance between Russia and North Korea.
""We will also be well-prepared for this possibility,"" he noted.
Multiple governments have accused Pyongyang of supplying arms to Moscow for its ongoing conflict in Ukraine, a claim that both countries have denied despite considerable evidence pointing to arms transfers.

Natural News,Resurfaced video of Kamala Harris threatening to WEAPONIZE DOJ against social media sparks free speech debate – NaturalNews.com,"The speech, delivered at the 2019 National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in Detroit, Michigan, focused on Harris' vision for combatting ""online extremism"" after a series of alleged white supremacist shooters used social media platforms to strengthen their messages before attacking places of worship. At the time, she pledged to ""double"" the civil rights division at the DOJ to monitor social media platforms that did not censor ""hate"" and ""misinformation.""
""We'll put the Department of Justice of the United States back in the business of justice. We will double the Civil Rights Division and direct law enforcement to counter this extremism. We will hold social media platforms accountable for the hate infiltrating their platforms because they have a responsibility to help fight against this threat to our democracy,"" said then-2020 presidential candidate and Senator Harris. (Related: Kamala Harris admits she WON'T DO ANYTHING DIFFERENT from Biden.)
""[The year] 2018 was the deadliest year on record for domestic terrorism since the Oklahoma City bombing more than 20 years ago, and I'm telling you, we can't feed it, I'm telling you I won't ignore it, I won't tolerate it,"" Harris added, talking about the synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh, the mosque bombing in Minnesota and the three black churches set on fire in Louisiana. ""If you profit off of hate, if you act as a megaphone for misinformation or cyber warfare, if you don't police your platforms, we are going to hold you accountable.""
This, in turn, has sparked debate online now that she's running again for president.
Critics argue that such a move would infringe on the First Amendment rights of Americans as terms like ""hate"" and ""misinformation"" are inherently subjective. Detractors have also cited past instances where accurate information, such as content regarding Hunter Biden's laptop and vaccine side effects, was labeled as misinformation.
""If implemented, these measures could have a significant impact on how speech is regulated both online and offline. It could also set a precedent for government intervention in the digital realm, raising questions about the balance between free speech and public safety,"" Country Local News wrote.
In 2019, then-Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey held internal meetings with its executives, wherein one noted that immediately banning ""racist"" rhetoric could remove many Republican users from the platform.
A series of tweets from then-President Donald Trump suggested that social media was doing exactly that. ""The wonderful Diamond and Silk have been treated so horribly by Facebook. They work so hard and what has been done to them is very sad – and we're looking into it. It's getting worse and worse for Conservatives on social media!"" Trump posted on May 4, 2019.
""How can it be possible that James Woods (and many others), a strong but responsible conservative voice, is banned from Twitter? Social media and fake news media, together with their partner, the Democrat Party, have no idea the problems they are causing for themselves. VERY UNFAIR!"" Trump posted again the next day.
In other words, this censorship of ""hate"" and ""misinformation"" on social media platforms is primarily targeting Republicans and conservatives.

Natural News,"Netanyahu will strike military sites within Iran before U.S. elections, source tells WaPo – NaturalNews.com","According to WaPo, the source said that Israel's waiting could be perceived as a weakness and that the planned strike ""will be one in a series of responses"" to the Iranian ballistic missile barrage that was fired at Israel on Oct. 1, which was also a response to a series of Israeli attacks.
It was also revealed that the Israeli leader said it wouldn't wait for a green light from the United States. ""The person who will decide on the Israeli response to Iran will be [Netanyahu],"" the official said.
However, the strike will target military sites rather than oil or nuclear facilities in Iran, according to the officials familiar with the matter, suggesting a more limited counterstrike aimed at preventing a full-scale war. (Related: Iran warns Israel: Nuclear doctrine may shift if its nuclear facilities are attacked.)
In the two weeks since Iran's latest missile barrage on Israel, its second direct attack in six months, the Middle East has braced for Israel's promised response, fearing the two countries' decades-long shadow war could explode into a head-on military confrontation.
When Biden and Netanyahu spoke, their first call in more than two months of rising tensions between them, something in the conversation made Biden decide to deploy a Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile battery to Israel.
On Sunday, Oct. 13, the U.S. Department of Defense announced that it was deploying the THAAD battery system to Israel, along with around 100 U.S. military personnel. The system, which officials say is expected to arrive in the coming days, ""underscores the United States' ironclad commitment to the defense of Israel,"" the Pentagon statement said.
Meanwhile, Israel is fighting on multiple fronts. Late last month, thousands of Israeli troops invaded southern Lebanon for the first time in nearly two decades, and last week, the military unleashed yet another punishing offensive in northern Gaza. When it comes to Tehran, figures close to Netanyahu's team have signaled strategic patience.
The Post noted how the Biden administration has been fully supportive of Israel's invasion of Lebanon and its escalation of airstrikes against the country. A former Israeli official said the U.S. was ""giving Israel and the Netanyahu government a bear hug, but for Hezbollah.""
""It is sending THAAD and promising all kinds of weapons that we need to finish off Hezbollah, saying that we can deal with Iran later,"" the former official added.
Netanyahu's office recently claimed that Israel will listen to the U.S. but make final decisions based on its national interest.
The statement came in response to the WaPo story and is seemingly contrary to the unnamed sources' information.
The overnight Israeli statement indicated that Israel ""listens to the American government's thoughts, but will make our final decisions based on Israel's national security needs.""
Iran launched almost 200 ballistic missiles towards Israel on the first of October. Most of the projectiles were intercepted, Israel's military said. At the time, Netanyahu said Iran had made a ""big mistake"" and would ""pay for it.""
According to an anonymous official quoted in the Post, Israel's retaliatory strike would be designed to avoid the appearance of ""political interference"" in the upcoming U.S. presidential election, which is less than a month away.
According to analysts, targeting Iranian oil facilities could push up oil prices and affect the polls. The price of crude oil shot up five percent at the beginning of the month, immediately after President Joe Biden spoke about the possibility of an Israeli strike on Iran's oil infrastructure.
Biden previously said the U.S. does not support any potential strike on Iranian nuclear sites. On Oct. 4, Biden went further, signaling the U.S. would also oppose an Israeli strike on Iran's oil facilities.
""If I were in their shoes, I would be thinking about other alternatives than striking Iranian oil fields,"" he said during a news conference.
Israel has not officially declared how it intends to respond to Iran's missile attack but Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said last week its reaction would be ""deadly, precise and above all surprising.""
""They will not understand what happened and how it happened, they will see the results,"" Gallant said.
Meanwhile, Iran responded that it would not let any attack by Israel go unanswered.
Israel and Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militant group, had been trading cross-border fire on a near daily basis since last October, when Hezbollah began firing into Israel which it said was a show of support for Palestinians in Gaza. It claimed that it would stop firing if a ceasefire were implemented in the enclave.

Natural News,Christopher Columbus statue torn down by Black Lives Matter rioters in Virginia restored and relocated to New York – NaturalNews.com,"Weighing about a ton, the statue was initially erected in Richmond, Virginia, in 1925 by the Italian American community. The Italian American Cultural Association of Virginia (IACAVA) fought to take custody of the statue from Richmond officials after the far-left protesters toppled it during the BLM riot four years ago. It remained submerged in Richmond's Fountain Lake for two years until the IACAVA won a legal battle to salvage it.
However, the move to resurrect the Italian navigator's statue isn't without controversy.
""Columbus never discovered America,"" said Cliff Mathias, cultural director of the Red Hawk Native American Arts Council. ""He never set foot in the mainland of what we call today the United States, the Americas.""
According to historians, the navigator first made landfall in the Bahamas and set foot along the Caribbean – but is not believed to have ever landed on the coast of what is now North America.
But it doesn't justify what the BLM rioters did to the statue.
The statue was stored in a farmhouse nearby until the Rockland Lodge of the Sons of Italy organization in Blauvelt reached out to the IACAVA. Now, the statue now stands outside the Rockland Lodge of the Blauvelt Sons of Italy.
Lodge President Michael Pizzi described the statue as a symbol of discovery, adventure, perseverance and the spirit of Italian culture. ""The statue represents Italian heritage and culture and everything that we're proud of,"" said Pizzi.
The rededication ceremony was attended by over 100 people and features a plaque describing the statue's history.
""This Statue, gifted by the Italian immigrant community of Richmond, VA to the City of Richmond in 1927, stood as a testament to exploration and resilience for nearly 100 years. Sadly, it was defaced and toppled during the 2020 riots. In 2023, the Italian American Cultural Association of VA restored it. Efforts to keep the Statue in Richmond were undermined by the fear of violence against its guardians,"" reads the plaque.
""We are grateful to the Sons of Italy Rockland Lodge 2176 for offering this symbol a new home. May the Stateu of Chirstopher Columbus inspire us to embrace the spirit of discovery and foster a community that learns from history and champions tolerance.""
During the rededication ceremony, the statue was blessed by Father Joseph Pavone of the Saint Elizabeth of Hungary Parish in Wyckoff, New Jersey. Pavone praised Columbus as a ""brave, courageous figure"" who ""in many ways is responsible for bringing our faith to the New World."" (Related: Black Lives Matter now actively targeting Christian statues and churches.)
Fellow Order member Paul Borghese told News12 that the move was meant to pay tribute to history. ""As Italian-Americans, we're all very proud of Christopher Columbus, and we're here to preserve the history of Christopher Columbus finding and discovering America,"" Borghese said.

Natural News,South Korea agrees to spend more to continue hosting U.S. troops – NaturalNews.com,"The new Special Measures Agreement (SMA), the 12th of its kind since 1991, will raise South Korea's contribution to maintaining United States Armed Forces personnel and equipment stationed in the Korean Peninsula by 8.3 percent, with extra increases for the succeeding four years connected to the country's consumer price index rather than its defense budget.
The bilateral agreement, set to come into effect in 2026, will run through 2030. South Korea's National Assembly, which is presently controlled by parties in opposition to sitting President Yoon Suk-Yeol, has to agree to the SMA. The U.S. Congress does not need to approve the SMA.
Under the latest plan, South Korea's contribution will begin at 1.52 trillion won ($1.1 billion) in 2026.
If inflation stays at around two percent annually, the total contribution is anticipated to reach 1.64 trillion won ($1.2 billion) by 2030, marking a 17.2 percent growth from 2026 levels, with an average annual increase of 3.2 percent.
The current SMA, signed in 2021 under former President Moon Jae-in, linked South Korea's yearly contribution increases to the country's defense budget growth.
This formula led to sharper increases over the deal's term, with contributions growing from 1.04 trillion won ($780 million) in 2020 to 1.4 trillion won ($1.05 billion) by 2025, averaging a 6.2 percent annual increase.
As stated by Matthew Miller, a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of State, it took eight rounds of negotiations to reach the latest agreement.
""The agreement will be a significant accomplishment for both sides and will strengthen our alliance and our shared defense,"" Miller said.
The latest deal was led by South Korea's chief negotiator, Lee Tae-woo, and his American counterpart, Linda Specht, with the involvement of officials from the foreign, defense and economy ministries of both nations.
The two countries had an initial signing ceremony in Seoul on Thursday, Oct. 3, with a formal signing by senior officials at the vice-ministerial or ministerial level to follow, pending Cabinet approval and presidential confirmation.
""Korea and the U.S. have reached a conclusion in a relatively swift manner based on mutual understanding and the spirit of alliance. This will contribute to our shared goal of ensuring the stable stationing of USFK troops and maintaining a united defense posture,"" a foreign ministry official told the media.
America deploys more than 28,000 troops in South Korea, mainly U.S. Army personnel.
Their presence is essential for South Korea's defense against the aggression of North Korea, as both nations remain in a conflict that never officially ended but was stopped by a ceasefire in 1953. (Related: Gearing up for WWIII? Putin suggests sending missiles to North Korea.)

The Irving Police Department first arrested Hernandez-Hernandez on Sept. 30 through surveillance footage and fingerprints found on a box at the crime scene. Hernandez-Hernandez told the police in the arrest affidavit that he had received an invitation from someone known as ""Cuma"" at an apartment in Irving. He got into a black SUV with four other men, believing they were headed to collect money from a prostitute who owed the gang. However, the group drove to the victim's home in Northwest Dallas.
Hernandez-Hernandez claimed he did not know his fellow gang members, but the authorities did not believe him.
Several days after, the police also caught Torralba, Silva and Gonzales on Oct. 3. The Irving PD first arrested Torralba and Silva that day when they surrounded an apartment complex on the 400 block of Block Drive. However, the Irving PD and the Irving PD Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) team took an 8-hour tense standoff against Gonzales because he barricaded himself inside the apartment complex. Fortunately, Gonzales was arrested after the incident began at around 12:15 p.m.
The suspects now face multiple charges related to the aggravated robbery while authorities continue their investigation into the incident.
The TdA is believed to have entered the U.S. in 2022. Now, the gang has expanded its illegal activities across various regions, thanks to the lax border policies of the Biden-Harris administration.
For instance, another four Venezuelan nationals and members of the TdA were arrested in Aurora, Colorado, after a surveillance footage that circulated online captured them forcing their way into an apartment. The suspects, aged 19 to 24, were identified as Jhonnarty Dejesus Pacheco-Chirinos, Jhonardy Jose Pacheco-Chirinos, Nixon Jose Azuaje Perez and Dixon Jose Azuaje Perez. (Related: U.S. Border Patrol arrests 10 members of notorious Tren de Aragua, the largest criminal organization in Venezuela.)
The Pacheco-Chirinos brothers illegally crossed the border via Texas in October 2022, while the Azuaje-Perez brothers were arrested at Eagle Pass, Texas, in August 2023.
""Thanks to the failure of the Biden administration to secure the border, the people of Aurora and other Americans have suffered at the hands of the Tren de Aragua gang,"" said Aurora City Council member Danielle Jurinsky.

Natural News,Sermon 20: Mike Adams calls out the HYPOCRISY of churches supporting GENOCIDE – NaturalNews.com,"When people believe in principles, those principles must be universal. Such is not the case with some people who call themselves servants of God. Adams noted that those people, including ministers, pastors and priests of traditional churches, promote pro-life principles. But they don't practice what they preach.
""Defending life is one of the most noble callings that people can participate during their lifetimes on earth,"" said Adams. ""Life is an expression of God, the one and true God, the Creator of all. He even speaks about this in many parts of Scripture.""
Adams believes mainstream churches today lack a key principle rooted in Christian teachings, and that is: all lives matter. ""Every living being has some purpose here on the earth, and people are going to know God increasingly throughout their entire lives.""
Sadly, some people who claim to value life are now supporting genocide. According to Adams, there is an effort from mainstream Christian churches in America – particularly Zionist Christian churches – to recruit everybody who reads the Bible into supporting the mass killing of the Palestinian people. (Related: Christian churches that advocate for Israel’s mass killing of Palestinian civilians are serving SATAN, not Christ.)
""This is a systematic extermination of an entire people to remove them from the Gaza Strip to take over that land by displacing or killing every living Gazan,"" the Bible nutrition educator continued.
It is evil in every sense of the word. ""There is no justification for the mass extermination of an entire ethnicity of people. And for those who claim that you are anti-Semitic if you don't hop on the genocide bandwagon that is bearing false witness, that is verbal thievery, deception in the eyes of God,"" said Adams, adding that people who support genocide are an agent of Satan.
""It is Luciferian. It is satanic to run around the church and condemn people and call them anti-Semitic unless they get on board with genocide and ethnic cleansing. And all those who claim to be pastors, priests, ministers and church leaders, all those who are complicit in supporting or advocating the mass genocide of the Palestinian people, are themselves agents of Satan.""
Adams said a serpent within the church has twisted the other pastors to bring them in line with an agenda of genocide and ethnic cleansing, which he said is an act of evil and wickedness. ""A church that promotes genocide is disqualifying itself from being a church in the eyes of God,"" he noted. ""Any church promoting genocide, ethnic cleansing, mass killing and claiming to be justified in those acts by the commandment of God is truly satanic.""
Righteous and God-fearing people who follow the teachings of Christ would never support murder, much less genocide. ""And none of us can be part of that. We must not only reject it – we must call it out. We are spiritually required. We are morally mandated to call that out, to say no to violence especially violence targeting a specific ethnic group,"" Adams said.

Natural News,UN resolution demands end to Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories as global condemnation grows amid escalating conflict – NaturalNews.com,"In September, the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly adopted a resolution demanding that Israel end its occupation of Palestine within a year. The vote was significant, with 124 countries supporting the measure, 43 abstaining, and only 14 voting against it.
Among those opposing were the United States, Israel, Hungary, and Argentina. The resolution reflects growing international frustration with Israel’s continued occupation and the ongoing conflict. (Related: Israel's entire occupation of Palestine since 1948 ruled illegal by the UN.)
This latest move by the UN comes as tensions have sharply escalated in the region, with Hezbollah in Lebanon launching missile, drone and artillery strikes at northern Israel in solidarity with Palestinians.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has responded with a series of military actions, further intensifying the conflict. In Lebanon, Israeli forces have reportedly fired on UN peacekeepers on multiple occasions, raising concerns about a broader regional war even further.
The humanitarian crisis in Gaza has worsened as the death toll continues to rise. Moderate estimates place the number of fatalities at more than 41,000, with the majority of those killed being women and children.
Human rights organizations have increasingly referred to the situation as a form of genocide, citing the scale of destruction and the indiscriminate nature of many Israeli strikes. Israel, however, insists that it is targeting Hezbollah operatives, who it claims are operating in civilian areas to deter strikes. The Israeli government argues that its military actions are necessary to ensure its survival and protect its citizens from future attacks.
The conflict has also drawn attention to Israel’s long-standing occupation of Palestinian territories. In July, the UN’s International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled that Israel’s occupation is illegal under international law.
The ICJ cited Israel’s illegal construction of settlements in the Palestinian West Bank, moves that have displaced thousands of Palestinians and has received major condemnation from the international community.
The ICJ also highlighted Israel's discriminatory policies against not just Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank but also against its own Israeli citizens with Arab or Palestinian descent, describing them as ""apartheid-like"" measures. The July ruling laid the groundwork for the September resolution, which formalized the international demand for Israel to end its occupation within 12 months.
This resolution is the latest in a series of UN measures aimed at addressing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. That resolution explicitly labeled Israel as an ""occupying power"" and reminded member states that previous Security Council resolutions, such as Resolution 242 from 1967, are binding under international law. Resolution 242 called for Israel to withdraw from the territories it had occupied during the June 1967 war, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza.
Despite these efforts, Israel has shown little willingness to comply. Netanyahu’s government has been unyielding, even in the face of mounting international criticism. This defiance in the face of growing international pressure for a ceasefire has further isolated Israel diplomatically, as its actions are increasingly seen as counterproductive to achieving peace.

Natural News,Kamala unwinding – NaturalNews.com,"(Article republished from JamesHowardKunstler.Substack.com)
It’s obvious she has been played for a chump, that she was sandbagged into play-acting “the candidate” by an odd coalition of the distraught and the desperate — that is, the many agency blobsters who fear prison and the perfidious politicians such as Pelosi, Schumer, Mitch the Turtle, the Clintons, and Obama, paid to cover for the blob, often doing it badly, who fear the judgment of history, as well as the loss of their fortunes. Distraught and desperate characters make foolish decisions.
About thirty seconds after “Joe Biden” vowed to stay in the 2024 race, a delegation of these panicked pols paid him a call and passed him the black spot, knowing he could not credibly front for the massive election cheat underway. He was barely able to front for the previous one in 2020, when every lever of power got pulled to-the-max to conceal the truth about the steal, and to severely punish those who dared to murmur doubts about the election’s freeness and fairness.
How did they decide that Kamala would do any better? I assure you we will find out when the party explodes in recriminations sometime after November 5. It will probably turn out to look like the 2017 movie, The Death of Stalin, a frantic vaudeville of scheming buffoons oblivious to mundane doings of the suffering nation they pretend to serve. Unlike Nikita Khrushchev in 1953, Kamala did not prevail among this gang of squabbling clowns by force of personality or guile. She was merely a default setting as veep, arrived at to present the illusion of continuity and solidarity where none existed. She was not even involved in the backstage action. I doubt that anyone even asked her if she wanted the assignment — she was only notified after-the-fact. Thus, all the drinking.
The outstanding question: will the Democratic Party actually go ahead and attempt to execute an election steal despite growing evidence of a developing Trump landslide that might obviate it? The works are already in motion. The mail-in ballots went out long ago and early votes are getting cast by the day. The overseas ballots that require no US address or voter verification are flooding in by the millions and four years of open borders has 10-million illegal aliens (at a minimum) dispersed around the nation, great gobs of them planted in swing states, processed through the DMVs and social services — with the requisite automatic voter registration — their ballots already pre-bundled for harvest.
It could go a few ways. One is, just let’er rip, harvest all those fake votes, stuff the drop-boxes, flood the zone, and do it all right in America’s face as if to say: we can do whatever we want. . . to get whatever we want. . . and you can’t stop us. That is probably the point where blue America finds out exactly what the Second Amendment was designed for. You might also expect a whole lot of state-organized resistance, especially in the populous red ones, Texas, Florida, real court cases over fraud this time, contested certification.
Or, the election could come out a hopeless unresolvable muddle. There’s no precedent for this and no provision in the Constitution, but you can imagine the Supreme Court having to decide a necessary do-over minus all recent gimmicks, paper ballots only, voters with proof of citizenship only, all voting on one re-scheduled election day before January 1. This novelty would be something apart from the clunky Congressional machinery established for settling electoral college disputes, since it is predicated on various states’ inability to determine their electoral college vote in the first place, based on patent irregularity and fraud.
You could also imagine a period of disorder so deep and grave that the regime behind “Joe Biden” declares martial law. . . or, alternately the military — the martial institution — has to take matters into its own hands, shoving aside even “Joe Biden” and his filthy retinue. Appalling to consider, I’m sure, but these things happen in history, and the Party of Chaos has set enough mischief in motion to wreck the election and wreck the country. Call it catastrophizing, if you will. There it is.
But to step back from that abyss, it appears that Mr. Trump’s momentum accelerates by the day, that he is becoming, at last, an implacable, irresistible juggernaut who will, perforce, overcome all the gimmicks, traps, and frauds arrayed against him. Kamala seems to think so. Have you ever seen such resignation, such loserdom-in-action as her recent performance on CBS’s 60-Minutes, or her pitiful admission on ABC’s The View that she couldn’t think of anything she would do differently beyond the excellent management of national affairs under “Joe Biden” (and herself as veep). Surely that said it all. She has nothing, brings nothing.
Long ago, she was a pretty girl with a law degree and an infectious laugh on the fringes of local politics in San Francisco. The winds of fortune blew her this way and that way until she ended up way over her head, used by the reprobates around her as a mere device to stay out of jail. She ends as an historical prank on her own country. It must be deeply demoralizing to be used like that in front of the whole world.

Natural News,"Harvard LIED: Data shows nearly 14,000 U.S. minors were “transitioned” (i.e. mutilated) to LGBT between 2019 and 2023 – NaturalNews.com","Debunking a Harvard University study from back in June that claims there is ""little to no utilization of gender-affirming surgeries by transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) minors in the U.S.,"" Do No Harm's research proves once and for all that LGBT perversion has reached the bottom of the barrel in terms of the innocence being targeted by its doctrines.
Millions of American children these days are being bombarded day in and day out with LGBT perversion at school, in media and online. Many of these kids end up believing the lies they are told by their teachers, politicians and Hollywood actors about the gender ""spectrum,"" prompting them to lob off body parts and take hormone-destroying pharmaceuticals in order to become their ""true selves.""
After analyzing insurance claims filed nationwide, Do No Harm found that 5,747 unique patients received gender-affirming surgery, which includes things like mastectomies and genital reassignment. A whopping 8,519 minors were prescribed puberty blockers and / or hormone replacement therapy during this same time period, which all in all saw more than 60,000 total prescriptions written for LGBT transitioning drugs.
The total amount of all insurance claims filed between 2019 and 2023 for ""gender-affirming care"" was found to be $119 million. Do No Harm put together a searchable database that parents can use to see what more than 225 hospitals across the country have been doing to underage youth in recent years.
(Related: Did you know that Kamala Harris is a proud supporter and promoter of transgender child mutilation and degenerate LGBT perversion?)
The worst states where the most child body butchery is taking place include California, Colorado, Connecticut, Ohio, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Washington, as well as Washington, D.C. The following states also allow for minors to receive ""gender-affirming care:""
Alaska
Hawaii
Oregon
Nevada
Montana
Kansas

Texas
Oklahoma
Nebraska
South Dakota
North Dakota
Iowa
Missouri
Louisiana
Mississippi
Alabama
Georgia
South Carolina
North Carolina
Tennessee
Kentucky
Indiana
West Virginia
Rhode Island
New Hampshire
Keep in mind that Do No Harm's researchers were extremely conservative in their estimates. Chances are that there are many more children out there whose bodies have been destroyed by LGBT transitioning procedures and drugging that were not captured in the research.
""We've really been meticulous in trying to make sure that the data are as clear as possible and are as accurate as possible,"" said Dr. Stanley Goldfarb, Do No Harm's chairman.
Many of them may not feel this way now, but LGBT mutilation is something that the vast majority of transgenders will come to regret, especially if they ""transitioned"" while underage.
""The eugenicists, neo-Malthusians, nihilists, and ecofreaks are jumping up and down as they achieve their mission to eliminate the human race and stop people from reproducing,"" one commenter wrote about this modern-day horror show.
""Those who push this on children should be jailed,"" wrote another. ""It's even worse than grooming alone and people like Pete Buttigieg and his 'husband' would likely do such things to their two adopted children / victims. Those children never had a chance at a normal life.""

Natural News,Bill Kristol: My fellow White Americans are ‘the enemy’ – NaturalNews.com,"(Article by Chris Menahan republished from InformationLiberation.com)
In a piece for The Bulwark, Kristol praised Barack Obama for his comments encouraging ""the brothers"" to support Kamala Harris for president before putting out a statement of his own echoing the former president's remarks.
""If Trump wins on November 5, it will be because of his support from a majority of white America. As a white American, and a white American man to boot, I’ve got to say, in the immortal words of Pogo: We have met the enemy and he is us.""https://t.co/eL41x5f3LO

""If you believe it's important to defeat Trump, it's not Obama's 'brothers' who are the problem. It's my 'brothers' who are the problem: white voters,"" Kristol wrote, self-identifying as a fellow white person.
Kristol continued:
You want to know why Trump has a decent chance to win the presidency again? Because most white Americans support him. In the latest New York Times/Siena poll, Trump wins white voters by 52 percent to 44 percent.
[...] If Trump wins on November 5, it will be because of his support from a majority of white America. As a white American, and a white American man to boot, I've got to say, in the immortal words of Pogo: We have met the enemy and he is us.
Bill Kristol, a Jewish Zionist who helped push America into the war in Iraq, in 2017 called for the ""lazy, spoiled"" white working class to be replaced by ""new Americans.""
""Look, to be totally honest, if things are so bad as you say with the white working class, don't you want to get new Americans in?"" Kristol said. ""Seriously, you can make the case -- this is going on too long and this is too crazy, probably, and I hope this thing isn't being videotaped or ever shown anywhere. Whatever tiny, pathetic future I have is going to totally collapse.""
Kristol continued: ""You can make a case that America has been great because every -- I think John Adams said this -- basically if you're a free society, a capitalist society, after two or three generations of hard work everyone becomes kind of decadent, lazy, spoiled -- whatever.""
""Then, luckily, you have these waves of people coming in from Italy, Ireland, Russia, and now Mexico, who really want to work hard and really want to succeed and really want their kids to live better lives than them and aren't sort of clipping coupons or hoping that they can hang on and meanwhile grew up as spoiled kids and so forth. In that respect, I don't know how this moment is that different from the early 20th century.""

Natural News,Mexican man in Phoenix caught registering illegal DACA aliens to vote in 2024 election – NaturalNews.com,"In Phoenix, Ariz., a Mexican man was spotted at a local grocery store offering to knowingly register a non-citizen illegal alien under the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) program to vote in the upcoming election.
Keep in mind that in the 2020 race, Arizona was called for Joe Biden with a margin of less than 11,000 votes.
""If you'd like, we can get in touch,"" the Mexican man tells the illegal DACA alien in the video below. ""I can bring you a form to register to vote. Are you a state resident?""
The illegal alien responded to the Mexican man by stating that he is ""here right now thanks to DACA, but now I'm looking into how to apply for citizenship.""
""Oh, do you have a driver's license in Arizona?"" the Mexican man then asked. ""You just need that and your residency.""
""Well, we'll get in touch whenever you want,"" the illegal DACA alien responded.

(Related: Have you checked out the leaked audio of Arizona Gov. Katie Hobbs admitting that several hundred thousand illegal aliens without U.S. citizenship are registered to vote in her state in the 2024 election?)
The exchange proceeded from there with the Mexican man telling the illegal DACA alien to bring all his illegal DACA alien friends so they can all be registered to vote in time for the 2024 election.
""I register all of you,"" he said to the alien. ""I will bring pens, forms, all that.""
The Oversight Project, which has been keeping a close eye on these latest developments, wants election integrity activists in Arizona to advise the group about how to proceed.
""We are making the careful decision not to refer the matter to Governor Hobbs and Arizona AG Kris Mayes,"" the group tweeted. ""Their official actions and policies demonstrate support for non-citizens voting.""
In other words, Arizona's leaders know full well what is going on with illegal aliens being registered to vote, and they fully support it. What can be done when lawlessness in charge of the vote?
Undercover video footage captured and posted by the Oversight Project just last month shows non-citizens and illegal aliens living at the Los Vecinos apartment complex in Phoenix admitting on camera that they are getting registered to vote, presumably for Kamala Harris and other Democrats on the ticket.

Natural News,Forbes wants Americans to pay $10 a gallon for gas to stop imaginary “global warming” – NaturalNews.com,"Whatever Rokke is fearful about constitutes ""a present-day emergency"" in his mind, which means that ""we must use every tool at our disposal to combat it,"" including by forcing Americans to spend $10 per gallon of gas just to live.
Like the rest of the climate lunatics, Rokke is convinced that carbon, the basis of all life on earth, is evil and must be eradicated. This includes carbon dioxide (CO2), an element that plants need in order to live.
In Rokke's mind, the ""social cost of carbon"" is simply too high to allow Americans to continue spending any less than $10 per gallon of gas. Higher gas prices, according to Rokke, will cure global warming.
(Related: Oil prices are already surging due to insiders overhearing Joe Biden the other day ""discussing"" military attacks on Iranian oil facilities.)
As part of his argument, Rokke cited some bogus study that claims, without any evidence, that a ""1°C warming reduces world GDP by 12%."" Since Rokke believes that carbon contributes to warming, he wants everyone who drives a car to be punished.
Rokke says that the ""real social cost"" of carbon is ""approximately $9 per U.S. gallon."" To implement that cost ""would more than double current prices,"" he admits.
""This would be deeply unpopular, yet it's a sobering reality: fuel taxation is the only area where we're even close to covering the full social cost of carbon emissions,"" Rokke writes.
As usual, Rokke also threw in a few tidbits about how the ""vulnerable"" and people with the ""least resources"" will be most punished by $10 per gallon gas while the rich will not even notice the change except that perhaps there will be a lot fewer poor people on America's roadways, leaving plenty of room for the rich and famous to rule everything.
""The reality is that paying the full social cost of carbon seems unfeasible, but mounting evidence shows that the costs of inaction are even higher,"" Rokke claims.
In other words, making driving too expensive for most Americans to continue doing, which will effectively reward the rich by clearing the roadways and airways of all the unwashed masses, is how Rokke plans to solve climate change.
""The time to act is now – before we reach the tipping point where recovery is no longer possible,"" Rokke concludes his fearmongering piece in promotion of a climate-driven class war centered around depriving most people of their freedom to drive.
In the comments, someone wrote that Rokke and all others like him should just hold their breath until they die ""to stop CO2 emissions and pay the social cost of breathing.""
""A personal CO2 reclamation device should work,"" joked another. ""Also known as a plastic bag.""
""Big Business used to be seen as greedy but sane. Now, they have fully surrendered,"" wrote another about the rot that has destroyed every element of what made America at least a decent place to live. ""They are on board with the pedo-Marxist globalist agenda.""
""They are worse than the psychopaths of the American Left. They know better, but they are greedy, unprincipled, cowardly and short-sighted. The enablers of psychopaths will face a harsher judgement than the psychopaths themselves.""
""Nils Rokke is Greta Thunberg in a business suit,"" wrote another. ""A corrupt, brainwashed Scandinavian and nothing more.""

Natural News,"Tampa mayor warns Floridians about Hurricane Milton: “If you stay, you’ll die” – NaturalNews.com","In a statement to CNN, Castor specifically warned residents of Tampa and surrounding areas that if they choose to ""stay in one of those evacuation areas, you're gonna die.""
The ""once in a lifetime"" storm started out small only to rapidly intensify from a Category 1 to a Category 5 hurricane on Monday with sustained winds surpassing 180 mph. Since that time, winds have slowed ever so slightly to bring Milton down to a Category 4, but there is still a lot more warm, open water to go before the storm reaches Tampa.
The National Hurricane Center says Milton could regain its strength while growing in size. This would pose ""even more danger"" for the people of Tampa Bay, which has not seen a storm anywhere close to this size in over 100 years.
What happened with Hurricane Helene should have been a ""wake-up call,"" Castor says, because now Milton is on its way with an impact that could be ""literally catastrophic,"" she says.
(Related: Hurricane Helene victims are reporting that neither Joe Biden nor Kamala Harris have so much as lifted a finger to provide support: ""There is no government aid. None. Zero."")
To avoid the public relations nightmare that came with Helene, President Biden is getting ahead of Milton by approving an emergency declaration while pledging ""life-saving resources in advance of the storm.""
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has reportedly stocked up his state with millions of gallons of fuel and truckloads of food, water and medical supplies. There are also flood protection systems and Starlink modules being distributed to help safeguard ""critical infrastructure.""
DeSantis warned in a morning news conference ahead of the storm that Milton could leave an ""indelible mark"" on the communities it hits.
""There are some hurricanes where it stinks, we have to deal with it, but we pick up and move forward,"" DeSantis said, but Milton with its wind speeds topping 180 mph could be a game-changer.
""Let's pray that it's as weak as possible,"" he said. ""We are preparing for it to be as strong as possible.""
As for looters who might try to take advantage of Florida property owners during this time, DeSantis has promised harsh penalties for anyone who is caught. DeSantis says he will ""throw the book"" at anyone who is caught taking advantage of storm victims.
""This is not going to be an opportunity for folks to take advantage of people,"" DeSantis warned. ""If you think this is an opportunity to loot, you've got another thing coming.""
""Do not try and take advantage of people who are suffering because of the results of the storm. We will be very swift across all levels of government to throw the book at people.""
The latest reports suggest that Milton is once again on the verge of becoming a Category 5 hurricane as it undergoes rapid intensification. Time will tell how severe the storm is by the time it makes landfall somewhere near Tampa Bay.
""There's no guarantee what the weather's going to be like starting Wednesday morning,"" DeSantis said at a press briefing.
""You may have a window where it may be safe, but you may not. So use today as your day to finalize and execute the plan that is going to protect you and your family. Basically, the entire peninsula portion of Florida is under some type of either watch or warning.""

Natural News,"Unveiling the military’s domestic overreach, and the FAILING of the Posse Comitatus Act – NaturalNews.com","(Article republished from GreenMedInfo.com)
The Posse Comitatus Act has long served as a safeguard to prevent military involvement in domestic law enforcement. However, recent legislative and executive shifts have threatened its effectiveness. As highlighted in Joseph Nunn's October 3, 2024, article, ""Why the Posse Comitatus Act Must Be Reformed"", published by the Brennan Center for Justice, the act is riddled with loopholes that have allowed increasing domestic military engagement. Nunn's analysis reveals vulnerabilities within the act that have only worsened with the recent Sept. 27th, 3023 update to the DoD Directive 5240.01, leading to further erosion of civilian protections.
For decades, the Posse Comitatus Act was seen as a firm boundary between military and civilian law enforcement. But the arrival of Directive 5240.01, updated on September 27, 2024, as our recent report discusses, has expanded the Department of Defense's scope, further weakening the already fragile legal constraints. This article explores how both Nunn's outlined concerns and the new directive threaten the act's original purpose and open the door for military overreach in civilian affairs.
The Fragility of Posse Comitatus
Passed in 1878, the Posse Comitatus Act was established to prevent military intervention in domestic law enforcement without Congressional approval. It was meant to ensure a clear division between military authority and civilian law, following the abuses witnessed during the Reconstruction Era in the South. However, as Nunn noted in his 2024 article, despite its noble intentions, the act has long been riddled with exceptions that dilute its effectiveness.
In recent years, these vulnerabilities have been exacerbated by new laws and directives. Specifically, the DoD Directive 5240.01, updated in September 2024, has further expanded the military's power to engage in domestic activities, casting a shadow over what remains of the Posse Comitatus Act's protections. In light of Nunn's analysis and these recent developments, it is crucial to explore the key loopholes, weaknesses, and implications for U.S. civil liberties.
Loopholes and Exceptions to the Posse Comitatus Act
As detailed in Nunn's article, while the Posse Comitatus Act sought to create a clear divide between military and civilian law enforcement, several key loopholes undermine its effectiveness:
Military Cooperation with Law Enforcement Act (1981): This law permits the military to assist in civilian law enforcement, particularly in areas related to drug interdiction, immigration enforcement, and other national security concerns. While focused on counter-narcotics efforts, this legal framework has been expanded to justify military involvement in broader law enforcement activities.
DoD Directive 5240.01: A Stealth Expansion of Military Powers
The September 27, 2024, update to DoD Directive 5240.01 significantly expands the Department of Defense's scope of activities in domestic settings. As outlined in the GreenMedInfo article, ""DoD Directive 5240.01: The Stealth Expansion of Military Intelligence Powers in Life-or-Death Domestic Scenarios"", this directive grants increased authority to military intelligence to conduct domestic intelligence operations, broadening the scope of who can be involved and under what conditions.
The updated directive allows for expanded military involvement in intelligence gathering and operations within U.S. borders, raising significant concerns about civil liberties and the potential for military overreach into civilian affairs without the traditional oversight that would have constrained such actions.
The Threat to Civil Liberties
The broadening of military intelligence operations under the DoD Directive 5240.01 not only threatens the effectiveness of the Posse Comitatus Act but also poses significant risks to civil liberties. By expanding military powers in domestic law enforcement, this directive raises several concerns:
Reduced Oversight and Accountability: The expansion of intelligence powers without clearly defined boundaries blurs the lines between military and civilian law enforcement. This reduces the oversight mechanisms that traditionally kept the military out of civilian policing roles, further weakening the protections offered by Posse Comitatus.
The Role of the National Guard in Eroding Posse Comitatus Protections
The National Guard plays a pivotal role in bypassing the restrictions of the Posse Comitatus Act. Unlike active-duty military forces, the National Guard is often deployed by state governors to perform domestic law enforcement tasks without violating federal law. However, when federalized, the National Guard can blur the distinction between civilian law enforcement and military operations.
During events such as Hurricane Katrina and the George Floyd protests, the National Guard's dual status allowed it to be deployed for policing and crowd control, contributing to the militarization of local law enforcement. This undermines the Posse Comitatus Act's core intention: keeping military forces out of domestic policing.
The Need for Immediate Reform
Both Joseph Nunn's October 2024 article and recent developments surrounding the DoD Directive 5240.01 highlight the urgent need for reforms to the Posse Comitatus Act. Without addressing the existing loopholes and closing the gaps introduced by the directive, the U.S. risks normalizing military involvement in civilian affairs, eroding civil liberties and undermining democratic governance.
To protect the integrity of the military-civilian boundary, several steps must be taken:
Reforming these areas is critical to preventing further erosion of constitutional protections and ensuring that the military remains confined to its appropriate role in national defense. According to Nunn,
""There is bipartisan understanding in Congress that some degree of domestic deployment reform is necessary, particularly regarding the Insurrection Act. Additionally, there is some support for broader reforms aimed at the National Guard and the Posse Comitatus Act. That said, advancing these reforms will take time and require a good deal of discussion about why they matter, as this area of law is not tremendously well understood. Our hope is that this report can help to move this process forward.""
Indeed, after several billion views of content reporting on the Sept. 27th DoD Directive update occurred this past week across X and Youtube, there is a growing chorus of Americans who are calling for Congressional oversight and inquiry into these matters. Below is my latest video update on the subject.
Call to Action: Protect Civil Liberties
The weakening of the Posse Comitatus Act, exacerbated by the DoD Directive 5240.01, requires urgent action to protect civil liberties. Here are steps you can take:
These actions are crucial for ensuring accountability and safeguarding democracy from undue military involvement in civilian life.

Natural News,Homeland Security chief Mayorkas dismisses questions about ELECTION DAY TERRORIST ATTACK that was thwarted – NaturalNews.com,"Oddly, Mayorkas dismissed the reporter’s questions, while providing a scripted response about him helping the victims of Hurricane Helene. This assertion is laughable in and of itself, as the defunct FEMA has been caught multiple times sabotaging grassroots hurricane relief efforts, and telling the country that the agency is out of money. The agency offered victims worthless $750 checks, because over $1 billion of disaster relief funds were used to resettle migrants over the past year.
Now, the Homeland Security chief is dodging some of the most important questions about an alleged terrorist plot that was set to take place on Election Day. This includes questions about how the Afghan national got to the U.S., what their motivations are, and who they are working with inside the U.S. government.
The reporter asked, “An Afghan national who was working for the CIA was arrested for plotting a terrorist attack on Election Day. How was he brought here?” Mayorkas refused to answer the question and continued to dismiss the most basic questions about the terrorist plot. The reporter said that they have received conflicting answers from the Department of Homeland Security. When Mayorkas was pressed about the issue further, he grew angry and insisted he would not answer her questions.
This is the same Homeland Security Director who has overseen the greatest migrant invasion in U.S. history. Countries have been releasing their criminals from their prisons, and they have been making their way through the southern U.S. border. Fentanyl and other deadly drugs are pouring across the border, and women and children are been trafficked due to the lawlessness that has gone unchallenged by the very federal agencies that are supposed to support the national defense. Now, when confronted with the threat of Afghan nationals seeking to terrorize the U.S. on election day, Mayorkas ignores basic questions!
According to the Justice Department, the suspect is an Afghanistan citizen residing in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. He was arrested for conspiring to conduct a terrorist attack on Election Day in the United States, on behalf of the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS). ISIS, is of course a designated foreign terrorist organization (FTO) that was mostly eradicated during the Presidency of Donald Trump. The ISIS caliphate is deeply motivated by ideology and cannot be completely eradicated like a traditional army would be defeated. All signs point to the American people re-electing Donald Trump, which is why ISIS members are being recruited to terrorize the American people on Election Day.
According to a criminal complaint filed today, Nasir Ahmad Tawhedi, 27, conspired and attempted to provide material support to ISIS and obtained firearms and ammunition to conduct a violent attack on U.S. soil in the name of ISIS. As part of the plot, the defendant allegedly took steps to liquidate his family’s assets, resettle members of his family overseas, acquire AK-47 assault rifles and ammunition, and commit a terrorist attack in the United States.
This terror plot follows a similar pattern to the terror that took place in 2020, when American voters were told by their government to stay home and stay safe during the election. This terror campaign allowed unverified mail-in-ballots to be sent out en masse, with untold numbers of ballots going out for people who had moved out of state or who were deceased. This inevitably led to voter fraud through the mail and through ballot drop boxes in inner cities, among other criminal acts that were documented in state legislatures, but with not enough time to resolve.
Now, terrorists are being groomed to potentially interfere with the 2024 election, so that those in power can either suspend the election, extend the election past Election Day, or alter the integrity of the process with another fraudulent stay-home, mail-in ballot campaign. Of the millions of migrants that have poured over the border in the past four years, the Border Patrol has recorded 43,674 arrests of illegal aliens with criminal backgrounds. There could potentially be hundreds of terrorists waiting to plot an attack on Election Day, but the Department of Homeland Security won’t even answer basic questions about a serious terrorist plot that was just thwarted!

Natural News,"Democrat politicians want to confiscate guns from law-abiding Americans, but why not remove politicians from office who are “friends with school shooters” instead? – NaturalNews.com","What’s worse, now the guy running for Vice President of the United States said on national television during the recent debate that he has “become friends with school shooters.” This man, Tim “Tampon” Walz, needs to recuse himself from the Minnesota Governor position he holds now and step down from running for VP of the country. This is plain insanity that a person who could easily be the next President (should something happen to Kommie Kamala if she wins) and he is friends with multiple mass murderers who shoot up schools and kill children?
Many of the children, teens and young adults who think they want to “switch” genders have their doctors prescribe them hormone drugs and puberty blockers, so they can take on traits of the opposite gender. These drugs are very dangerous, often referred to as chemical castration drugs, and can cause hormonal imbalances that affect cognition, cause extreme mood swings, invoke violent behaviors, enhance thoughts of suicide and lead to acts of homicide (as the side effects listed on the medications usually warn the patient).
Plus, many gender-transition patients end up regretting the changes, some of which are permanent, like genitalia-mutilation surgery, breast surgery, facial feature altering surgery and total loss of libido. This can drive anxiety and depression to the brink, where the patient does not value their life anymore, or the lives of those around them.
Then, many of these gender-transitional victims get prescribed dangerous SSRI drugs for their depression and anxiety, driving feelings of homicide and suicide even deeper. This is what Governor Tim Walz promotes. He even has public schools putting tampons in boys’ bathrooms to support kids and teens who want to adopt this insane lifestyle. Is Tim Walz perverted to the extent that he’s promoting transpeople to commit acts of violence?
Consider this; many of the mass shooters of late have been identified as “trans shooters” because of these reasons. As examples, take a look at the Colorado Spring shooter Anderson Lee Aldrich, who shot five people to death, and who identified as “nonbinary.” Is Tim Walz buddies with this guy? Inquiring minds would like to know. Is Walz a co-conspirator? Maybe he should be investigated, now that he has confessed to “becoming friends with school shooters.”
The Aberdeen, Maryland shooter, who shot to death 4 people in a Rite Aid parking lot, Snochia Moseley, identified as a transgender. Was Tim Walz friends with this trans-shooter before he shot 4 people and then killed himself?
Audrey Hale, who shot and killed 6 people at a Nashville private Christian school, and was then gunned down by police, was identified as a transgender person. Was Tim “Tampon” Walz friends with this trans-shooter before the horrific incident? Now Democrat politicians want all schools to help children keep their plans to become transgenders as secrets from their parents. Is that part of the trans-shooter development plan? Maybe that’s embedded in CRT hate-crime curriculum.
Watch the weirdo say who his friends are:

Natural News,Watch: Water fluoridation was a ‘sacred cow’ — what happens next? – NaturalNews.com,"(Article by Michael Nevradakis, Ph.D. republished from ChildrensHealthDefense.org)
“I always thought fluoridation was fine,” North said. “All I’d ever heard was, ‘It’s safe and effective.’”
But when North received a phone call 12 years ago from a friend who asked him to review the science on water fluoridation — specifically a 2006 report by the National Academy of Sciences — what he ended up reading “was unbelievable,” he said.
“Right away I could see this [science] was a direct contradiction to the statements from fluoridation promoters,” North said. “So based on this, I changed my mind.”
Using his knowledge and advocacy experience gained from working in the nonprofit sector, North said began working “pretty much full-time as a volunteer opposing fluoridation.”
Today, North is a board member of the Fluoride Action Network, one of several groups that sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) after the agency denied a petition to end water fluoridation under the Toxic Substances Control Act.
On Sept. 24, a federal court decided the case, ruling that water fluoridation at current levels poses an “unreasonable risk” of reduced IQ in children and that the EPA must take regulatory action in response.
North joined “The Defender In-Depth” this week to discuss the ruling and how it already has prompted some cities and counties across the U.S. to stop or pause the fluoridation of their water supply.
Fluoridation ‘a hot potato within the federal government’
North said that for years, various organizations and individuals petitioned the EPA to stop water fluoridation. But despite basing their petitions on “a tremendous amount of animal and human studies,” the EPA rejected these calls.
“This is a hot potato within the federal government,” North said. “Everybody knows how controversial this is. I mean, it’s basically a sacred cow.”
According to North, “the next step was to file a lawsuit,” which several plaintiffs, including the Fluoride Action Network, Moms Against Fluoridation, Food & Water Watch and individual parents and children, filed in 2017.
The lawsuit, however, was beset with delays — it took seven years for the court to finally issue last week’s ruling, which followed two sets of hearings: one in 2020 and one in February of this year.
“In between, it has been just one delay after another, mainly put out by the EPA, which has been trying to delay this,” North said.
As an example, North cited the publication of a key report by the National Toxicology Program (NTP), which concluded that fluoride is associated with reduced IQ in children at exposure levels at or above 1.5 milligrams per liter, and potentially at lower doses.
According to North, the NTP report was ready for publication in May 2022. However, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services exerted pressure to block its release. “They knew it was full of pretty bombshell kinds of information,” North said.
North said U.S. District Judge Edward Chen, who was “interested in learning about all the science,” refrained from issuing a ruling until the NTP report was released.
“We could not have asked for a more fair, inquisitive judge,” North said.
By August 2024 though, “enough was enough,” according to North, who said Chen agreed the wait for the release of the final NTP report was too long and that a ruling could be issued based on a draft of the report. Ultimately, the final report was released in August.
North said the NTP report confirmed what anti-fluoride activists have been arguing for decades, “a consistent connection, consistent link between fluoride and lower IQ.”
“If you are a pregnant woman, if you are the parent of an infant … this is where the damage to the brain is, this is where the science is showing it’s happening by women consuming fluoride, mainly through [water] fluoridation,” North said.
“It gets into the fetus, and this is where brain damage can be happening — irreversible brain damage, loss of IQ. Then … if the baby is ingesting water mixed with infant formula … this is where significant damage also seems to be taking place,” North added.
North said the NTP examined 72 studies for its report, with 64 of those questioning the practice of water fluoridation — including 18 of the 19 highest-rated studies.
“It doesn’t get much stronger than this,” North said — and the judge agreed. “He finally decided … water fluoridation is an unreasonable risk to humans based on the lowering of IQ in children,” North said.
‘Nobody has to wait for the EPA’
In last week’s ruling, the federal court instructed the EPA to institute procedures and rules to eliminate water fluoridation’s health risks. “The ball is now in the EPA’s court,” North said.
The agency has 30 days to file an appeal. If it does, the process could span one to two years. However, North said, “The important point is that nobody has to wait for the EPA.”
“They’re not deciding whether a community fluoridates or not,” North said. “That doesn’t come down from the federal government for any community.”
Some states mandate water fluoridation for towns with populations of 10,000 or more, but in other states, it’s up to local communities. “It’s their decision to fluoridate or not, so nobody has to wait for the EPA,” North said.
After last week’s ruling, Abilene, Texas; Yorktown and Somers, New York; and the Weber Basin Water Conservancy District in Utah said they would pause or end water fluoridation.
North said the U.S. is an “outlier,” as only 24 other countries fluoridate their water. “The U.S. fluoridates as many people as the rest of the world put together,” he said.
North said commercial pressures to monetize fluoride, which he described as “a hazardous waste industrial byproduct of the phosphate fertilizer industry,” is one reason fluoridation is heavily promoted and practiced in the U.S.
“You’ve got people whose salaries depend on promoting fluoridation,” North said. However, he added there is more than just a profit motive involved.
“Mainly, the promotion comes from the federal government and the medical-dental establishment,” North said. As a result, professional reputations are at stake.
“If it comes out that they are wrong, and boy is it ever coming out, their reputations are going to take a major hit.”

Natural News,Former teacher awarded settlement in “preferred pronouns” lawsuit with “seismic implications” for freedom from LGBT tyranny – NaturalNews.com,"Peter Vlaming, formerly an employee of the West Point School District, received a $575,000 payout, which one right-leaning media outlet said has ""seismic implications"" for the rest of Virginia's educational system as the transgender virus continues to spread far and wide.
Vlaming was represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) whose president and CEO Kristen Waggoner issued a statement about how her organization is ""grateful that, because of this decision, tolerance is now a two-way street, not a one-way ratchet for totalitarian ideology.""
""It protects all teachers in Virginia and its rationale should guide other courts addressing similar issues,"" she added about the settlement ruling.
(Related: Did you hear about Irish teacher Enoch Burke who was arrested recently for refusing to address one of his male students as ""she"" and ""her?"")
Vlaming is hardly the only teacher to face mistreatment for refusing to play ball with the Cult of LGBT. Many other teachers, including some who are represented by the ADF in other states, face similar persecution for doing what is right.
""No teacher should be fired for living according to their [sic] beliefs or protecting their students,"" Waggoner wrote on X / Twitter. ""But that's exactly what happened to Peter Vlaming. So we sued. And won.""
In addition to receiving a $575,000 cash settlement, the West Point School District's board also cleared Vlaming's termination from his employment record as well as altered its policies on gender pronoun tyranny to comply with the updated Virginia education policies established by Republican Gov. Glenn Younkin.
The West Point School District clearly violated Vlaming's right to free speech – or in this case, his right to not be forced to utter someone else's preferred speech. As such, the school district was held accountable in a court of law for this infringement.
""Peter wasn't fired for something he said; he was fired for something he couldn't say,"" commented senior counsel Tyson Langhofer, director of the ADF Center for Academic Freedom, in a statement. ""The school board violated his First Amendment rights under the Virginia Constitution and commonwealth law.""
""As a teacher, Peter was passionate about the subject he taught, was well-liked by his students, and did his best to accommodate their needs and requests. But he couldn't in good conscience speak messages that he knew were untrue, and no school board or government official can punish someone for that reason. We're pleased to favorably settle this case on behalf of Peter and hope other government and school officials will take note of the high cost involved in failing to respect an American's constitutionally protected freedoms.""
Before winning the settlement, Vlaming's case was tossed by a judge in the King William Circuit Court who declared that Vlaming, a Christian, should not be protected because there is no ""valid reason for the law to accept his suit.""
Virginia Commonwealth Supreme Court Justice D. Arthur Kelsey later overturned that ruling, writing that Vlaming had valid ""constitutional, statutory, and breach-of-contract claims"" on his former employer.
""Examining only the allegations in Vlaming's complaint, the circuit court dismissed Vlaming's claims, finding that they failed to state legally viable causes of action. Disagreeing with the circuit court, we reverse and remand for further proceedings,"" Justice Kelsey said.
In speaking to the media about his victory, Vlaming said he is ""relieved"" that his rights of freedom of expression and freedom of religion were ultimately upheld.

Natural News,Alberta to BAN gender alteration procedures for minors – NaturalNews.com,"In a video posted Oct. 1 on her official account on X, Smith said Alberta doctors will be barred from performing gender-related surgeries on individuals under the age of 18. The bill, expected to be introduced this fall, will also restrict access to puberty blockers and hormone therapies for youth under 16, with limited exceptions.
""We are now prepared to introduce the legislation implementing these new policies and will do so when the legislature is back in session,"" Smith said in the video. ""Licensed Alberta doctors will be prohibited from performing gender assignment surgeries on youth under the age of 18 in Alberta.""
The proposed legislation would also require that minors aged 16 and 17 seeking puberty blockers or hormone therapies obtain consent from their parents, as well as approval from both a psychologist and a physician. The bill would also mandate that parents must be notified and give consent if a school staff member wishes to recognize a student by a different name or pronoun in a public setting, such as a classroom. (Related: MUTILATED TODDLERS: Biden administration pushing for age limits to be dropped from transgender surgery guidelines.)
""For 16- and 17-year-olds wishing to proceed with puberty blockers or other hormone therapies for gender reassignment, they may do so only if they have parental psychologist and doctor approval,"" Smith said.
In the video, Smith explained that children need time to understand themselves before making irreversible decisions. She added that ""it is vitally important"" to preserve the time kids have as youth need to ""gain sufficient knowledge, experience and perspective"" before making permanent life-altering decisions.
In January, Smith made a similar announcement on X, wherein she disclosed her agenda of protecting families, especially minors, from extreme forms of transgender ideology.
Smith announced at the time that the new legislation would not only bar medical interventions like gender-related surgeries and hormone treatments for minors but would also require parental consent for students wishing to change their pronouns, as well as prevent transgender women from participating in women's sports.
Under the proposed legislation, Alberta would prohibit minors under 17 from undergoing surgical procedures like mastectomy, breast construction, vaginoplasty and phalloplasty. The use of puberty blockers would also be restricted to individuals aged 16 or older.
The legislation would also require schools to notify parents before teaching students about topics related to gender identity and sexuality. The policy would mandate parental consent for children up to 15 years old who wish to adopt a new name or pronouns that align with a different gender identity. Meanwhile, parents would be informed for 16- and 17-year-olds who do not require parental consent.
Moreover, the legislation would also protect women and girls from competing against transgender women in sports. Smith promised that the new regulations would ensure women and girls could choose to participate in competitions limited to cisgender women.

Natural News,DoD shreds all remaining constitutional protections from Posse Comitatus Act in anticipation of post-election Civil War 2.0 – NaturalNews.com,"As it was written, Posse Comitatus does not allow for any constitutional exceptions. The U.S. military is not supposed to be involved with law enforcement activities in any capacity whatsoever, and yet the Congress-passed bill has been so watered down over the past 50 years or so that armed soldiers could soon become commonplace on the streets of America.
""The law allows only for express exceptions, and no part of the Constitution expressly empowers the president to use the military to execute the law,"" explains the Brennan Center about how Posse Comitatus is supposed to work.
""This conclusion is consistent with the law's legislative history, which suggests that its drafters chose to include the language about constitutional exceptions as part of a face-saving compromise, not because they believed any existed.""
Despite all this, the DoD has decided that there are constitutional exceptions of Posse Comitatus. And because nobody with any power is willing to do anything to stop the DoD, the militarization of America's police forces will continue to expand like a frog boiling in a pot.
""The Department has long claimed that the Constitution implicitly gives military commanders 'emergency authority' to unilaterally use federal troops 'to quell large-scale, unexpected civil disturbances' when doing so is 'necessary' and prior authorization by the president is impossible,"" the Brennan Center further says.
""In the past, the department also claimed an inherent constitutional power to use the military to protect federal property and functions when local governments could not or would not do so. The validity of these claimed authorities has never been tested in court.""
(Related: Did you know that the U.S. Army is already violating Posse Comitatus by manning illegal alien ""migrant"" hotels in New York City?)
The DoD chipped away at what is arguably the last remaining power of Posse Comitatus with the recent implementation of Directive 5240.01, which appears to expand the power of the executive branch, in this case the Biden regime, to weaponize the U.S. military against American citizens.
Instead of only being allowed to deploy troops overseas to fight wars under the direction of Congress, the White House will now, it seems, be able to deploy troops to the streets of America to crack down on whatever nightmare is about to erupt as a result of the nation's irreparable political divide.
The following new provisions were implemented under Directive 5240.01:
1) While assassination of Americans is strictly forbidden, the directive's language allows for lethal actions to be used against Americans who are deemed as ""imminent threats.""
2) The directive expands the definition of ""national security threats,"" aligning with the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) broader definition of domestic terrorism threats.
3) Any intelligence-sharing that could result in lethal force being used must first be approved by the Secretary of Defense. However, Component Heads are still allowed to act immediately using lethal force for up to 72 hours before obtaining approval.
""Imagine waking up to discover that the U.S. military has quietly been granted the authority to assist in domestic law enforcement activities – including the use of lethal force against U.S. citizens in certain circumstances,"" reports Technocracy.news, citing GreenMedInfo.
""Now consider that this change was enacted just weeks before an election, already surrounded by concerns about unrest, civil liberties, and potential government overreach. This is the reality of DoD Directive 5240.01, reissued on September 27, 2024.""

Natural News,J.D. Vance criticizes Kamala Harris for struggling to answer interview questions about her economic and foreign policy – NaturalNews.com,"The ""60 Minutes"" interview with CBS News' Bill Whitaker, which aired on Oct. 7, focused on her past statements, early positions and campaign promises on the economy, immigration, foreign affairs and more. However, when asked about her proposed substantial tax hikes for the wealthiest Americans, Harris claimed that ""the richest Americans pay their fair share,"" but did not provide specific details. (Related: Kamala Harris strategist FAILS to explain her economic policy during live interview, accuses host of being “disrespectful” to women.)
""I’m going to make sure that the richest among us, who can afford it, pay their fair share in taxes. It is not right that teachers and nurses and firefighters are paying a higher tax rate than billionaires and the biggest corporations,"" she said. She even criticized the economic policies of former president Donald Trump in her initial response.
In turn, Whitaker pressed for clarity, asking how she intends to navigate Congress to pass these proposals. Harris, in a seemingly unfocused reply, said: ""Well, you know when you talk quietly with a lot of folks in Congress, they know exactly what I’m talking about because their constituents know exactly what I'm talking about.""
The interview also delved into U.S. relations with Israel, particularly regarding Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. But when asked about the influence of America in the Middle East, Harris offered another ambiguous answer. ""The work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of, many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region,"" she said.
Obviously, Vance wasn't impressed. ""This is not a person who is competent enough to be president of the United States,"" Vance wrote on his official account on X, along with the video clip of the interview.
Harris was also asked about her stance on the current immigration policies and the conflict in Ukraine, only to put the blame on Trump.
Whitaker asked Harris whether the initial border policies of the Biden administration, which allowed a historic surge of immigrants, was a mistake. Harris defended the administration and claimed that the administration had been proactive since taking office.
""It’s a long-standing problem, and solutions are at hand, and from day one, literally, we have been offering solutions,"" Harris said, pointing to ongoing attempts to advocate for an immigration bill in Congress. Whitaker questioned her further about the long-standing nature of the border issue, but Harris did not admit to any policy missteps. Instead, she cited recent changes that have reportedly decreased illegal border crossings and criticized Trump for intervening with the recent immigration bill.
""Donald Trump got word that this bill was afoot and could be passed, and he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem, so he told his buddies in Congress, 'Kill the bill. Don't let it move forward,'"" she said.
Whitaker also asked Harris on how she would handle the ongoing and escalating Russia-Ukraine war if elected as president.
""Ukraine must have a say in the future of Ukraine,"" she said, claiming she would not negotiate with Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the war without Ukraine. ""Donald Trump, if he were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now. Let's be clear about that. He talks about, 'Oh, he can end it on Day One.' You know what that is? It's about surrender.""

Natural News,"Obama appeals to Black men to vote for Harris based on race, calls them misogynists for their lack of enthusiasm – NaturalNews.com","On Oct. 10, during an event in the East Liberty neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Obama chastised Black men in the community for not being enthusiastic enough about Harris' campaign, allegedly because she is a woman. (Related: University of Kansas lecturer suspended after suggesting men who don't want to vote for Kamala Harris should be shot.)
""Part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that,"" said Obama while speaking to volunteers at a Harris-Walz campaign field office.
""We have not yet seen the same kinds of energy… That [lower enthusiasm] seems to be more pronounced with the brothers,"" he added. ""You're coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses … I've got a problem with that.""
Former President Donald Trump's campaign was quick to pounce on Obama's remarks, saying the former president has admitted that ""Black men lack enthusiasm for Kamala.""
The conservative group Black Men for Trump's advisory board released a statement condemning Obama's remarks as ""insulting.""
""It's demeaning to suggest that we can't evaluate a candidate's track record – especially when Kamala Harris has done more harm than good to Black communities,"" wrote the group in an open letter co-signed by Black legislators, including Reps. Byron Donalds (R-FL) and Wesley Hunt (R-TX).
Harris and the Democratic Party's campaign is relying on Black voters to come out in droves, especially in battleground swing states like Pennsylvania, to vote blue in the very tight race with former President Donald Trump, who has made significant inroads in garnering support among historically Democratic-leaning minority communities, with Black men in particular and men of all other races.
To support Harris' effort to get more Black men to come out to vote for the Democrats, the political action committee Win With Black Men has come out to organize weekly calls and events to bolster the vice president's standing among this crucial demographic.
""I believe President Obama is speaking to a tangible, visceral understanding of what it means for all men to relate to women in America. Calling out misogyny is not wrong,"" claimed Win With Black Men Executive Director and co-founder Khalil Thompson.
Thompson's group raised more than $1.3 million for Harris from 20,000 Black men in the 24 hours after President Joe Biden bowed out of the race and endorsed Harris' candidacy.
The group is focused on combating supposed misinformation spreading within Black communities regarding Harris and emphasizing how she apparently has policies that prioritize the well-being of Black men, which supposedly proposes greater economic opportunities, safer communities, social justice policies and better health care.
""We're not a monolith,"" said Thompson. ""However, we are just like every other American in this country who wants a good paying job, that we can provide for our children and participate in their lives and the lives of our partners, that we can get them home safely, afford to go to the grocery store, save a little for retirement and have a vacation.""

Natural News,"National Border Patrol Council endorses Donald Trump, says only he can solve the BORDER CRISIS – NaturalNews.com","The NBPC is the main labor union representing agents and support staff of the United States Border Patrol. During a campaign rally in Prescott Valley, Arizona, on Oct. 12, NBPC President Paul Perez joined Trump on stage to officially announce the union's support for the Republican presidential nominee.
""America, I have a message for you. If we allow border czar [Vice President Kamala] Harris to win this election, every city, every community in this great country is going to go to hell,"" Perez said. ""The untold millions of people unvetted, who she has allowed into this country that are committing murders, rapes, robberies, burglaries and every other crime will continue to put our country in peril.""
""Only one man can fix that. That is Donald J. Trump. He has always stood with the men and women who protect this border, who put their lives on the line for the country,"" he continued. ""On behalf of the 16,000 men and women represented by the National Border Patrol Council, we strongly support and endorse Donald J. Trump for President of the United States.""
Perez noted that their choices could either continue the border chaos or put an end to it. (Related: United Auto Workers president says ""a great majority"" of union members WON'T VOTE for Biden despite official endorsement.)
As a response, Trump thanked the NBPC for its endorsement on his official account on X. ""Thank you to the 16,000 Border Patrol Officers for your COMPLETE ENDORSEMENT and SUPPORT!"" he posted, along with the video clip of Perez' official statement.
The NBPC endorsement validated the result of a recent Rasmussen poll that voters trust Trump more than Harris on immigration policy and border security.
According to the poll, conducted from Sept. 15 to 17 among 987 likely voters, 51 percent of respondents trust Trump over Harris on immigration policy and border security, compared to the 43 percent who favor Harris over Trump.
The result also revealed the importance of immigration among these likely voters for the upcoming election. For instance, 75 percent of respondents say immigration will be an important factor in casting their votes in November. Meanwhile, 51 percent believe immigration policy will be ""very important"" in casting their votes compared to the 23 percent who believe it is less important. Among those who believe immigration is ""very important,"" 80 percent trust Trump over Harris in handling the issue.
Along party lines, 77 percent of Democrats back Harris on immigration compared to the 84 percent of Republicans who trust Trump. Independents also trust Trump more than Harris, with 53 percent backing him and 39 percent supporting Harris. Additionally, the results found that 33 percent of Democrats, 71 percent of Republicans and 50 percent of independents believe immigration policy is an important election issue.
Moreover, 78 percent of white voters, 71 percent of Black voters, 71 percent of Hispanic voters and 69 percent of non-Black minorities believe immigration and border security are important factors that would influence their vote in November. The issue also reflects among voters across income levels, with higher-income earners generally leaning toward Harris, while those earning between $50,000 and $100,000 favor Trump.

Natural News,Departing Russian ambassador to Washington warns of escalating U.S.-Russian tensions and rising risk of nuclear conflict over Ukraine – NaturalNews.com,"Ambassador of the Russian Federation to the U.S. Anatoly Antonov has been relieved after seven years of serving as Moscow's top diplomat in the country. In an exclusive interview with Newsweek, Antonov shared his concerns before stepping down after seven years of service.
During his tenure, Antonov became a prominent voice for the Kremlin's stance on U.S.-Russia relations, which have steadily worsened amid the conflict in Ukraine and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's increased military support for Kyiv.
In his final interview in the U.S., Antonov expressed concern that the ongoing conflict was drawing American leaders deeper into a dangerous situation. (Related: Preparing for WWIII? Thousands of French soldiers to join military exercise in Romania next year for simulated war with Russia.)
""'Project Ukraine' is dragging American politicians further into an abyss, from which it is increasingly difficult to escape,"" Antonov told Newsweek. He criticized U.S. officials for responding to Russian military gains in the contested Donbas region and Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk Oblast with repeated commitments to continue supporting Ukraine ""as long as we can.""
Antonov lamented that Washington had not signaled any interest in negotiations or attempts to reconsider its stance. ""There are zero signals to [Ukraine] about the need to think over their position and sit down at the negotiating table,"" he said. ""Nor are there any hints about stopping the senseless flow of weapons at the expense of the local taxpayer.""
He further warned that U.S. discussions about potentially allowing Ukraine to use American-supplied ballistics to conduct long-range missile strikes in Russian territory were particularly dangerous due to recent warnings from Russian President Vladimir Putin that such actions would amount to NATO's direct involvement in the conflict.
Before being appointed Moscow's top diplomat in the U.S. in 2017, Antonov served as the Russian State Duma's deputy minister of foreign affairs and the deputy minister of defense. Throughout his career, he has served as one of the loudest voices in the U.S. for the Kremlin's interests during the administrations of President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.
Now, as Biden prepares to leave office, Antonov has spent the last few weeks of his time in Washington refraining from commenting on the unique dynamics of U.S. politics. However, in his interview, he did note that American leaders seemed to be shaping their stance on Ukraine based not on the desire for regional peace but on domestic electoral considerations.
""Local party strategists seem to be trying to craft official statements on Ukraine to fit the U.S. electoral cycle,"" Antonov observed. He accused American politicians of prioritizing polling numbers over the well-being of Europeans and Ukrainians.
""They are only interested in adjusting public opinion in their favor, demonstrating 'determination' and 'leadership.' This is pure recklessness,"" he added.
Antonov also expressed dismay over the divided public discourse in the United States. On the one hand, he acknowledged the efforts of certain political thinkers who aim to develop bipartisan solutions to prevent the conflict from spiraling into a global crisis.
""There are reasonable attempts to understand the situation and find options to end the conflict,"" he said. ""But those voices are often silenced or dismissed as 'Kremlin propaganda.'""

Natural News,POLL: Trump support from union and working-class voters HIGHEST for a Republican presidential candidate in four decades – NaturalNews.com,"According to Harry Enten, a political analyst and host of CNN's ""Margin of Error"" podcast, Trump is on track to achieve the best Republican performance among union families, trade school graduates and minority voters without college degrees in 40 years. (Related: Poll finds Democrats’ advantage among Hispanic voters continues to SHRINK.)
Enten stressed the growing appeal of Trump to these traditionally Democratic groups, as Vice President Kamala Harris struggles to maintain a strong lead.
The poll suggests that Harris leads Trump by just nine points among union workers, a sharp decline from previous Democratic performances. For instance, Bill Clinton carried union households by 30 points in 1992 and President Joe Biden won them by 19 points in 2020. Harris' current margin is much closer to the slim 12-point lead of Hillary Clinton in 2016.
Meanwhile, Trump has been gaining tremendous grounds among trade school graduates compared to his predecessors in the GOP. In 1992, Bill Clinton won this group by seven points. Today, Trump leads Harris by a staggering 31 points, a 38-point swing toward the Republican Party.
""More so perhaps than any other bloc, the folks who go to trade school, vocational school, that has moved from being a core Democratic group to now being a core group of Donald Trump’s massive amount of support among the working class,"" Enten said.
The trend extends to working-class minority voters. While Harris still holds a 28-point lead among racial and ethnic minorities without college degrees, this is a significant drop from the 45-point margin Biden enjoyed in 2020.
""This is part of a larger trend that we're seeing throughout our politics in which Republicans, specifically Donald Trump, is doing very, very well among working-class voters,"" Enten said. ""The fact is, Donald Trump seems to have gone into a hotbed of traditional Democratic support and made a lot of movement in ways I don't think a lot of people would have thought when he went down that escalator just back in 2015.""
Harris' struggle to maintain a strong lead among working-class and union voters was made even more evident when the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, one of the largest unions in the United States with over 1.3 million members, refused to endorse a presidential candidate for the first time in over two decades.
The decision came shortly after the union released results from a national poll of its members, which showed 59.6 percent favoring Trump, compared to just 34 percent who supported Harris.
""President Joe Biden won the support of Teamsters voting in straw polls at local unions between April-July prior to his exit from the race,"" the union said in September. ""But in independent electronic and phone polling from July-September, a majority of voting members twice selected Trump for a possible Teamsters endorsement over Harris. The union's extensive member polling showed no majority support for Vice President Harris and no universal support among the membership for President Trump.""
""Unfortunately, neither major candidate was able to make serious commitments to our union to ensure the interests of working people are always put before Big Business,"" Teamsters General President Sean M. O'Brien said in September. ""We sought commitments from both Trump and Harris not to interfere in critical union campaigns or core Teamsters industries – and to honor our members' right to strike – but were unable to secure those pledges.""
Watch this clip from Fox News discussing how ""humiliating"" it is for the Democratic Party that the Teamsters won't endorse Harris.

Natural News,Trump’s Doral Miami resort provides shelter to 275 linemen as they prepare to restore power for over 3M people after Hurricane Milton – NaturalNews.com,"Trump's son, Eric, confirmed this in a post on X, saying that the family opened up the Trump National Doral in Miami, Florida, to serve as temporary housing for the 275 hardworking electrical workers who will be restoring power to the state.
""Honored to have 275 incredible linemen at [Trump Doral] as they get ready to respond to the aftermath of Hurricane Milton! You are amazing and the Trump Family, and the entire state of Florida, appreciate you!"" he said. ""Enjoy the rooms – they are the best in Florida. Be safe!""
Karoline Leavitt, national press secretary for Trump's 2024 campaign, lauded these efforts saying that the Trump family ""truly cares for the hardworking people of this country.""
The resort's room rates range from $251 to $8,251 a night. It features a total of 643 guest rooms, 14 deluxe suites, 27 premier suites, two presidential suites and 48 spa suites, which are all impeccably designed and exquisitely appointed. The luxury hotel has championship golf courses, high-end restaurants, a pool and cabanas.
One father thanked the Trump family for housing his son, who is a lineman, during the hurricane. Milton is just the latest hurricane to hit the area, following Hurricane Helene, which left a trail of devastation across Florida's Gulf Coast and parts of North Carolina Georgia, and Tennessee.
Meanwhile, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced that he has activated and pre-staged over 50,000 linemen in preparation for the hurricane's devastation.
As of press time, at least 17 deaths have been reported across the Sunshine State as the hurricane spawned a deadly tornado that also killed six in St. Lucie County on Florida's east coast. Flooding and uprooted trees left roads across the state impassable as cresting rivers triggered evacuations and rescue missions. (Related: Hurricane Milton kills at least 10 and leaves 3 million without power.)
""There's damage, there's a lot that's going to need to be done,"" DeSantis said at a news conference Friday, Oct. 11. ""We did not get the worst-case scenario but we did get hit and we're going to have to work to bounce back.""
Early estimates suggest the damage wreaked by Hurricane Milton could total $50 billion.
The Florida governor has reportedly pushed back on Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris' ""offer"" to help Milton victims, saying she has ""no role"" in the hurricane efforts and had never reached out during previous storms in Florida.
When asked even before Milton hit about reports of Harris' call, DeSantis said he wasn't aware Harris was trying to reach him.
""I didn't know that she had called. I'm not sure who they called. They didn't call me,"" he said. ""It wasn’t anything that anybody in my office did, in terms of saying it was political.""
""I've had storms under both President Trump and President Biden. And I've worked well with both of them. She's the first one who's trying to politicize the storm. And she's doing that just because of her campaign,"" the governor further argued later in his Fox News interview.
The Florida governor says he has been in touch with President Joe Biden and the leadership of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Biden confirms he has been in touch with DeSantis regarding both hurricanes.
According to the White House, Biden urged the governor to ""call him directly if there is anything that can be done to further support the response and recovery efforts.""
Asked about the federal response, DeSantis said during his news conference that ""we have gotten what we need from the feds… the president has approved what we asked for… I'm thankful for that.""
Meanwhile, Harris accused the governor of playing ""political games"" by not taking her calls during the crisis.
""People are in desperate need of support right now and playing political games at this moment in these crisis situations… is just utterly irresponsible, and it is selfish,"" Harris said last week. ""It is about political gamesmanship, instead of doing the job that you took an oath to do, which is to put the people first.""

Natural News,Germany refusing to send any more weapons to Israel unless Jewish leaders sign “genocide clause” promising not to slaughter innocents – NaturalNews.com,"Germany wants Israel to sign a ""genocide clause"" agreeing to stop the killing of innocents in the Gaza Strip before resuming the delivery of weapons, reported the Axel Springer publishing house in Deutschland. The last time Berlin sent weapons to Israel was back in March, with no further plans to send anything more unless Israel stops the excessive killings.
Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock and Economy Minister Robert Habeck are the ones who ""blocked new deliveries"" of German weapons to Israel, further reported German media giant Bild. These two Green party politicians are hoping that Israel will promise not to use German weapons against innocent civilians in Gaza before any more are sent to the Jewish state.
""The Israeli government must give the German government a written assurance that arms exports from Germany will not be used for genocide,"" Bild reported, citing government and defense industry sources. German law, by the way, strictly prohibits all delivery of weapons to countries that are caught using them against civilians.
""Arms deliveries to Israel are about compliance with the rules of international humanitarian law,"" an individual familiar with the matter told Politico. ""The reason for requesting such a commitment is that a German administrative court could otherwise put a stop to it.""
(Related: Back in August, Bild reported that Israel had imminent plans to invade Lebanon, which has since occurred – what will happen next?)
In accordance with Germany's request, West Jerusalem reportedly sent the necessary written promises to continue receiving weapons of war from Europe's economic powerhouse, though not without heavy criticism from other German politicians.
The ruling Free Democratic Party, along with multiple other politicians in the German parliament, are calling on both the Greens and Chancellor Olaf Scholz to issue clarifying statements about the contentious situation concerning weapons exports to Israel.
""Scholz, as the chairman of the Federal Security Council, also bears responsibility here,"" commented Christian Democratic Union head Friedrich Merz.
As for Baerbock, she has publicly supported the idea that Israel has a right to defend itself, which is what the Jewish state claims it is doing in Gaza right now, but in a more recent speech she clarified that Israel still has to abide by international humanitarian law.
""International humanitarian law and Israel's right to exist are inexplicably linked,"" Baerbock said last week.
Thus far, at least 42,000 Palestinians, many of them women and children, have died at the hands of Israel Defense Forces (IDF), which says it is ""absurd"" that anyone is accusing Israel of committing genocide. As Israel has claimed for many decades, the reason for so much bloodshed is because Hamas supposedly uses Palestinian civilians as human shields.
""Isn't this closing the barn door after the horse escapes?"" one commenter wrote about how the time to enforce legal restrictions of Israel's weapons usage was back when this whole thing started, not more than a year after the fact.
""Too little, too late,"" wrote another. ""Assuming these Western governments cave in to domestic pressure of halting arms deliveries to the apartheid genocidal regime, the latter might respond with psy-ops involving Islamophobic false flags across Europe to damage the pro-Palestinian sentiment.""

Natural News,"Global nuclear catastrophe to happen if Biden allows Ukraine to fire U.S.-made long-range missiles into Russia, Russian ambassador warns – NaturalNews.com","The Kremlin announced on Thursday, Oct. 10, that Antonov had been officially relieved of his duty after seven years of service.
According to him, U.S.-Russian relations, which are at ""arguably the lowest point in their history"" will plunge into an ""uncontrolled nosedive"" if Ukraine gets the green light from Washington. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky met with President Joe Biden last month, where he said that firing U.S. Army Tactical Missile System (ATACMS) inside the Russian territory could break the deadlock in the two-and-a-half-year war. (Related: Putin warns West of nuclear retaliation if Ukraine fires Western-supplied long-range missiles into Russian territory.)
""America will not be able to sit it out across the ocean,"" Antonov said. ""A global nuclear catastrophe would affect everyone.""
He claimed that U.S. strategists were already blithely modeling the impact that an outbreak of nuclear warfare would have on Russia and Ukraine. But at the same time, he said that they mistakenly believe that the imminent catastrophe will only affect Europe and Russia, which for him is extremely short-sighted.
""Now, amid talks of long-range missiles, [Russian President] Vladimir Putin has sent a clear warning to the United States and its allies,"" he said. ""He reminded them of the direct involvement of American so-called 'technical specialists' in planning and carrying out strikes against Russia.""
But the Biden administration has declared an unwavering position to continue military assistance to Ukraine, and many NATO allies have offered similar pledges. The White House also attempted to downplay the impact of its long-range missiles, he added.
Last month State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller insisted no magic would change the face of the conflict.
""When we approve any new weapon system or any new tactic, we look at how it's going to affect the entire battlefield and Ukraine's entire strategy. And that's what we'll continue to do,"" Miller said.
But Antonov insisted that America's green light was Russia's red line as he compared U.S. policymakers to ""a diver frozen before the decisive jump into the abyss.""
Meanwhile, Antonov accused the U.S. of being behind revolutions that have forced Moscow-friendly governments from office in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.
Russia seized the province of Crimea in response to Ukraine's Orange Revolution of 2014 and poured across the country's borders in February 2022 as Ukraine pressed for NATO membership.
The retiring envoy claimed that Russia's warnings had been met with ""silence and smirks"" in the West.
""Year after year, it has been militarily exploiting European territory, conducting waves of NATO expansion to the East,"" he said of the West. ""It has organized color revolutions and anti-constitutional coups, increasingly encircling Russia in a hostile ring, and as the decisive battering ram it chose Ukraine.""
According to him, this only confirms that the political elites have set themselves the task not just to defeat Russia but to preserve the old world order, based on the rules favorable to NATO countries.
Antonov also insisted that Russia had no particular interest in the outcome of the election.
Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris described the Russian plans as ""proposals for surrender, which is dangerous and unacceptable,"" when she met Zelensky last month.
Meanwhile, GOP's Trump has repeatedly promised to end the war in 24 hours and his running mate JD Vance said the plan could involve the existing front line constituting a new border with a ""demilitarized zone"" separating the two countries.
But Antonov said that they are staying ""clear-eyed and understand that in the current circumstances, there is little chance for people who may assume power in the United States not to ultimately find themselves under the dense influence of the 'deep state' and corporate structures that are Russophobic towards Russia.""
He said that America's blind support for the Kyiv regime and its terrorism on Russian territory ""puts an end to even an attempt to approach the discussion of normalization of relations.""
Similarly, he expressed his disappointment at attempts to silence pro-Russian U.S. media outlets.
""Any voices of reason in Washington today are silenced or written off as 'Kremlin propaganda,'"" he claimed. ""The recent unjustified sanctions against Russian journalists are in this vein, as well as provocative attacks by local intelligence services against Dmitry Simes, Scott Ritter and compatriots living in America.""
What he described as a ""brutal cleansing of the information space in America"" has left the field clear for ""poisonous commentaries about the harm of any conversation with the Russians.""

Natural News,Biden regime plots child abduction scheme to remove “gender dysphoric” LGBT minors from “non-affirming” homes – NaturalNews.com,"Under the new rule, foster children who identify as LGBT are to only be placed in ""affirming"" homes where whatever gender or sexuality delusions they suffer from will be accepted and praised at all times. If a gender dysphoric child ends up in a ""non-affirming"" home, then the Biden regime will have the power to remove them for new placement elsewhere.
Conservative and religious groups say the new rule infringes on the rights of non-affirming, aka normal, foster parents, including those who might try to counsel and support their LGBT foster children to accept their God-given gender and sexuality rather than try to butcher it through drugging and mutilation.
Cuyahoga County, Ohio, piloted a program along these lines called ""Affirm Me,"" which ended in 2021, from which the Biden regime pulled the idea. It included a ""Supportive Questions to Ask"" sheet informing foster parents about how they should interact with their LGBT foster children.
""Is there someone you are currently working with (case worker, doctor, therapist) that you talk to about your gender affirming needs?"" one of the questions on the fact sheet reads. ""I would like to support you in any way I can. I am here if you would like to talk about anything regarding affirming your gender.""
The sheet gets even more graphic by telling foster parents to basically encourage their LGBT foster children to surgically tamper with their bodies in order to affirm their gender delusions.
""You have shared that you would like [wider hips, breasts, penis],"" one of the bullet points reads. ""There are many ways in which to affirm you and you can definitely have [wider hips, breast, penis]. Would you like to talk about it with me or someone else?""

No one should be surprised how hard this administration is pushing transgender ideology onto children and families. pic.twitter.com/1vVYqtPvvn
— Meg Brock (@MegEBrock) December 8, 2023
(Related: Remember when Biden's Department of Education rolled out a ""Pride"" seminar for children pushing puberty blockers and mutilating LGBT surgeries?)
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) used Cuyahoga County's program as a model for shaping the new federal foster rule. It essentially pushes foster parents to affirm their foster children's gender identity no matter how damaging it is to those children's bodies.
""The county’s program pushes parents to affirm their child’s gender identity, with federal officials viewing the refusal to do so as a form of emotional abuse,"" explains YourNews.
""This model, developed with federal grant funding, places immense pressure on parents, forcing them to choose between supporting their child's transition or losing parental rights.""
When the Affirm Me program came to an end in Cuyahoga County, by the way, two other Ohio-based foster youth programs, Kinnect to Family and Youth-Centered Permanency Roundtables, picked up where it left off by integrating the model ""as a cultural adaptation to their work.""
Other states have their own similar programs as well that the Biden regime built off of. The California-based nonprofit Family Builders has its own ""Youth Acceptance Program"" (YAP), as they are calling it, that pushes to normalize transgenderism among foster youth.
""The premise is dangerous and could extend outside the foster care context to adoption, custody disputes, and schools,"" commented Rachel Morrison, director of the HHS Accountability Project.
One of Biden's biggest accomplishments was to degrade society by normalizing the transgender mutilation of children. Learn more at Evil.news.

Natural News,Survey: 80% of Americans are concerned about WWIII – NaturalNews.com,"The survey conducted on Oct. 1 and 2 polled 1,000 Americans across various political affiliations. Eighty-four percent of Republicans and 83 percent of third-party voters expressed concern over a potential world war, while only 74 percent of Democrats had the same concerns.
Upon close scrutiny, gender differences were pronounced in the poll's results. Eighty-five percent of women fear a new global conflict, in contrast to 71 percent of men. The survey also found that 55 percent deem the ongoing conflict in Israel as a primary concern, while only 28 percent are concerned about the Russia-Ukraine war that has dragged on for more than two years.
The survey also asked respondents about who they would want to lead them during a time of conflict. Half of them expressed preference for former President Donald Trump, while only 41 percent picked incumbent Vice President Kamala Harris. Fourteen percent of third-party voters expressed confidence in neither.
StudyFinds commented on different aspects of the poll's results. The majority of respondents being concerned about WWIII regardless of party lines ""underscores a pervasive sense of unease among the American public regarding international stability,"" it said.
Moreover, it also commented on respondents picking Trump as a more suitable leader to guide the nation in times of crisis. ""This division suggests that perceptions of leadership effectiveness are closely tied to individual political beliefs, reflecting the complex dynamics of American politics in times of crisis,"" StudyFinds stated. (Related: World War III is now inevitable – here's why it can't be avoided.)
A recent report from the bipartisan U.S. Commission on the National Defense Strategy (CNDS) highlighted that Washington must be ready if war breaks out. The report urged the U.S. to bolster its defense spending to Cold War levels to effectively address growing threats from China, Iran, Russia and North Korea.
Former U.S. Rep. Jane Harman (R-CA), chairwoman of the CNDS, stressed that ""the U.S. faces its ""most serious and challenging"" threats since the end of World War II, including a tangible risk of ""near-term major war."" This call for increased military readiness reflects the urgent need for the U.S. to navigate the complexities of modern warfare and international relations.
In recent remarks, Trump highlighted the world's proximity to World War III. He cited China's aggression toward Taiwan, Iran's nuclear ambitions, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine as critical factors. Tensions in the Middle East are also escalating, particularly between Israel and Hezbollah, raising concerns about the potential for an all-out conflict.
Recent retaliatory strikes between Israel and Hezbollah have intensified, with the Guardian reporting that it's unclear if the two sides have already crossed into ""all-out"" war territory. An attack widely believed to have been initiated by Israel left 42 dead and over 3,000 wounded, further complicating the situation.
The risk of a broader conflict involving Iran, Israel and their respective allies could draw the U.S. into direct engagement, especially with increasing concerns that Russia may be sharing sensitive information and technology with Iran.
As geopolitical instability continues to mount, including tensions with North Korea and the implications of Russia's actions in Ukraine, the potential for a global conflict remains a pressing concern for many Americans. In this charged atmosphere, the specter of war hangs heavy over the public consciousness, prompting citizens to reevaluate their political choices and national priorities as they navigate an uncertain future.

Natural News,Gazprom CEO says EU is committing “energy suicide” by boycotting cheap Russian gas – NaturalNews.com,"All that inexpensive, abundant gas that used to flow through the now-destroyed Nord Stream pipelines is no longer fueling Germany's once-robust economy – and for what?
Alexey Miller, the CEO of Russia's state-run Gazprom energy giant, says the EU gas market is seeing ""demand destruction"" right now because the bloc's leaders have decided to commit ""energy suicide"" with sanctions and other political machinations.
At the recent St. Petersburg International Gas Forum in Russia, Miller explained how gas in Germany and elsewhere throughout Europe is now needlessly high in price, and with limited supply, due to the West blowing up Nord Stream and rejecting Russian energy.
""Some [experts] say that [the situation] may be described as Europe's energy suicide,"" Miller said. Others, he continued, are observing that the ""economic locomotive"" of Europe has turned into ""the sick man of Europe,"" this being a reference to Germany, Europe's former economic powerhouse.

Last year, Europe's largest economy contracted by 0.3 percent, largely due to the destruction of Nord Stream and the resulting energy crisis. In 2025, Germany's economy is expected to contract another 0.2 percent, according to Berlin's Ministry for Economic Affairs.
Like many outside observers are also seeing, Miller noted that a ""deindustrialization of Europe"" is taking place that will only further disrupt the continent's gas market. He warned that the current trend could lead to ""a new price shock for gas and supply disruptions.""
Corrupt EU policies have already created a nearly 10 percent decline in European industrial production, which is now at its lowest levels in a decade. And things will only further deteriorate, he says, especially since industries in the United States, as one example, are spending up to five times less on energy compared to Germany and the EU.
Before the Western-led destruction of Nord Stream, the EU received most of its energy from Russia in the form of natural gas. The attack on Nord Stream has left Europe struggling to find alternatives, especially since it already went ""green"" and got rid of most of its own energy production infrastructure in order to stop ""global warming.""
Statistics out of the EU show that Russia's share of EU gas supplies, meaning the amount of Russian energy used in Europe, plunged from 45 percent in 2021 to just 15 percent in 2023. That roughly 15 percent of Russian energy that still flows to Europe now comes via Ukraine as part of a contract signed by Gazprom and Naftogaz in 2019 – a contract, by the way, that is scheduled to expire at the end of 2024 because Kiev has no plans to extend it.
""All of this stupid warmongering by the Zio-West is infantile and immature at its roots,"" one commenter wrote about the pathetic Western leadership that is behind all this anti-Russia deindustrialization.
""He's right,"" wrote another about what Miller said at the gas forum. ""Russia takes some former Russian territories back from Ukraine and seeing this, Europe commits Harakiri or Seppuku,"" these two terms referring to ancient Japanese forms of ritualistic suicide.
Others noted that Russia has since found new markets for all the gas and oil that once flowed to Europe, which means that even if the EU comes crawling back to Russia begging for the energy pipelines to be restored, it will be tough luck.
""Europe is going to suffer another great depression and this time war or colonialism will not save it.""
The West is in freefall collapse mode because its corrupt leaders serve their own pocketbooks instead of We the People. Learn more at Collapse.news.

Natural News,Trump vows to end double taxation for Americans living overseas – NaturalNews.com,"Under the current U.S. law, American citizens must file federal tax returns annually, regardless of residency status. In other words, Americans living abroad must pay taxes to the U.S. government and the country where they reside, a situation known as double taxation. Mechanisms like the Foreign Earned Income Exclusion (FEIE) and the Foreign Tax Credit (FTC) could mitigate this burden, but they do not fully eliminate U.S. tax liability for the majority. (Related: Donald Trump: Kamala Harris would ""decimate"" Social Security and Medicare if she wins.)
In a video statement released on Oct. 10, Trump said he would end double taxation for overseas Americans ""once and for all.""
""You've been wanting this for years, and nobody has listened to you, and you deserve it, and I'm going to do it,"" Trump said. ""It's the right thing to do, and no American leader has ever been willing to stand up and commit to you the way that I have on many things, but this is a very important element for your safety, security and frankly, for your wallet.""
He also urged overseas Americans to vote in the upcoming election. ""We're in a failing nation, and we’re going to bring it back, and we’re going to bring it back strong. You have to make sure that you are registered and you are going to vote because I'm going to take very good care of you. I'm going to take care of our nation,"" Trump said.
The former president also promised a series of new tax incentives to boost the U.S. auto-manufacturing industry.
These tax incentives include expanding research and development tax credits, increasing equipment deductions for small businesses and allowing car loan interest to be tax-deductible. The proposed incentives also include a 100 percent tax write-off for heavy equipment in the first year and full expensing for new manufacturing investments. Additionally, Trump suggested raising the equipment deduction limit for small businesses from $500,000 to $1 million and extending tax deductions on car loan interest, similar to those available for home loan interest.
""This will stimulate massive domestic auto production and make car ownership dramatically more affordable for millions and millions of working American families,"" he said in front of about 500 business leaders at the Detroit Economic Club.
Furthermore, Trump vowed to revisit the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) to address trade imbalances, particularly the growing trade deficits with Mexico and China upon taking office ""to save the American auto industry.""
""You vote for Trump, and you will see a mass exodus of manufacturing jobs, but from Mexico to Michigan, from Shanghai to Sterling Heights,"" he said, knowing that many people in the audience work in the auto industry.

Natural News,"Chinese auto executive donated to Biden, Harris campaigns after White House awarded subsidy to her EV firm – NaturalNews.com","Stella Li, president of BYD Americas, a subsidiary of the Chinese EV firm BYD, contributed $33,400 to what was originally the Biden Victory Fund, now renamed the Harris Victory Fund. Additionally, Li made two $3,300 donations to the Biden campaign, now the Harris campaign.
The donations were reportedly made after Biden gave Li's company a six-figure subsidy. BYD Americas was reported to have been one of the primary beneficiaries of the Inflation Reduction Act's electric vehicle tax credit. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the company received $395,000 through the Clean School Bus Program.
This is not the first time that Li donated to a Democratic campaign.
As shown by state records, Li donated $50,000 to California Gov. Gavin Newsom's 2018 and 2022 gubernatorial campaigns. The BYD Americas president is identified by her company as a Chinese national with other company documents indicating she has a ""right of abode"" in the United States, the Free Beacon reported.
According to the Federal Election Commission, while foreign nationals generally cannot contribute to political campaigns, green card holders can do so.
As per the Washington Free Beacon, Newsom awarded BYD a nearly $1 billion no-bid contract for masks during the Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. The company had no history of manufacturing masks or personal protective equipment but received the contract regardless.
Moreover, BYD Americas doesn't actually sell passenger cars in the United States. Instead, its primary Western markets include Latin America and Europe. The American subsidiary aims to open a new manufacturing plant in Mexico by 2026 that will produce 150,000 electric cars a year. These cars will mostly be sold in Latin American markets and not in the U.S., despite being subsidized by American taxpayers.
The BYD company is involved with China's Belt and Road Initiative and receives subsidies from the Chinese government as well. Concerns over espionage led Congress to investigate BYD and other Chinese vehicle manufacturers earlier this year. (Related: Chinese electric vehicles could be ""weaponized"" by Beijing, report warns.)
Critics quickly pointed out the irony of the subsidy given to the China-linked robocar maker when the Biden-Harris administration insisted that it was meant to boost EV production in the United States and counter Chinese economic growth.
Biden announced back in September over $3 billion in funding to U.S. manufacturers to ramp up production of advanced batteries and materials for EVs.
The fund will support 25 projects across 14 politically significant states, with many considered battlegrounds in upcoming elections. They include Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Texas, South Carolina and Louisiana.
This is said to be a part of a broader effort by the Biden-Harris regime ""to promote EVs and fight climate change."" Companies receiving the grants will focus on processing lithium, graphite and other materials used in EV batteries, as well as manufacturing key components.
""Today's awards move us closer to achieving the administration's goal of building an end-to-end supply chain for batteries and critical minerals here in America,"" said White House economic adviser Lael Brainard.
This was the second round of grants under the bipartisan infrastructure law that was passed in 2021. Previously, $1.8 billion was allocated for 14 projects. This new round of funding brings the total U.S. investment in domestic battery and critical mineral supply chains to nearly $35 billion, according to Brainard.
""We're using every tool at our disposal, from grants and loans to allocated tax credits,"" Brainard said, noting that the Biden administration has leveraged more than $100 billion in private investment.
China currently controls much of the global supply chain for key minerals like lithium, rare earth elements and gallium, making the U.S. and its allies vulnerable. But last month, Brainard said tariffs on Chinese imports of critical minerals went up.
