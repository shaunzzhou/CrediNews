CNN,US citizens caught in Virginia’s voter purge aimed at noncitizens speak out | CNN Politics,"This week the Supreme Court revived Virginia Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s effort to purge 1,600 people he says are suspected noncitizens from the state’s voter registration rolls using records from the Department of Motor Vehicles.
But the practice, critics say, is haphazard given those DMV records may not be current and can result in US citizens being removed from voter rolls.
CNN obtained access to the list of Virginia voters who were removed and called over 100. We found a variety of US citizens and noncitizens, some of whom were aware they’d been purged while others, who had not yet voted, learned the news from CNN.
Noncitizens CNN spoke with said they didn’t plan to vote and some were unsure how they were even registered.
Documented cases of noncitizens voting are extremely rare. A recent Georgia audit of the 8.2 million people on its rolls found just 20 registered noncitizens – only nine of whom had voted.
“Governor Youngkin has been clear: every eligible Virginia citizen who wants to vote can do so by Same Day Registering through Election Day—that’s what our law says,” said Youngkin spokesman Christian Martinez.
A “final failsafe,” Martinez added, is the ability for residents to use same day registration to vote early or on Election Day.
Here’s what some voters told CNN about their experiences:
‘It felt silly to me that I was removed’
18-year-old Rachel Xu, a student at George Mason University, says she became a citizen a year ago. She was not aware she had been removed from the state voter registration rolls until she was contacted by CNN. She told CNN she moved to the US from China with her family after her father got a job with the US government.
“I’m not that excited about this election but it’s my right to vote and it shouldn’t be taken away from me,” she said.
Xu said she plans to re-register and cast her ballot for Trump.
Nadra Wilson was also listed as a noncitizen and was purged from Virginia’s voter rolls. Wilson told CNN she was born in the US: “I was born in Brooklyn, New York.” The 57-year-old empty nester says she’s been voting in Virginia without any problems since 2015. She had no idea why she was purged from the voter rolls.
Wilson was able to re-register and she says she voted this week, “but I’m very concerned that this happened.”
Fatima Bashir is an 18-year-old student at Northern Virginia College studying cybersecurity. She also didn’t realize she had been purged from Virginia’s voter registration rolls until she received a call from CNN. “I’m surprised right now. Why did they take me off?” Bashir said she was born in Pakistan but became a US citizen a year ago. She is planning to vote this election for the first time. She said she is still undecided but “I have the right to vote.”
Saule Bohoney was also wiped off of Virginia’s voter registration rolls. She is a naturalized citizen born in central Asia. She became aware she had been taken off Virginia’s voter rolls after receiving mail from the state informing her.
Bohoney told CNN that she voted in the 2020 election and is still undecided but has not been able to re-register just yet, though she plans to.
“I have two kids and a full-time job, and I just haven’t had time to address this,” she said. “I felt disappointed that this happened. I am a professional working for a federal intelligence agency. So, it felt silly to me that I was removed.”
A Jill Stein voter
In Alexandria, Virginia, 21-year-old Abdullah Al Mosawa learned from a TikTok about Virginia’s voter registration purge program. He did his own research and realized he was one of the more than 1,000 individuals who had been removed from the state’s voter rolls.
“I wouldn’t say it feels great,” Al Mosawa said, after learning that he was purged because state officials falsely suspected him of being a noncitizen.
Al Mosawa grew up in Yemen and became a US citizen in 2018. This would be his first time voting in a US election.
Because his initial voter registration has been purged, Al Mosawa said he plans to re-register in order to vote for his candidate, Green Party nominee Jill Stein. “Not Trump, for sure.”
“No matter who you vote for, their party still controls them,” he said. “So I tried to go for somebody who’s a little bit different.”
As a busy business owner, he said it’s confusing and difficult to have to register again. But as a young person, he said he is excited to vote and that “it’s time to think about these problems and (elections).”
Ryan Snow, counsel with the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and part of the counsel group representing the plaintiffs in the case, said voting rights groups are now focused on reaching out to voters who have been purged to confirm their eligibility and provide them with information about how to use the same day registration process.",2024-11-02
CNN,Arizona fake electors led vocal campaign to overturn the 2020 election – they’re now part of a ‘robust’ state investigation | CNN Politics,"They called it “The Signing.” Eleven fake electors for President Donald Trump convened at the state Republican Party headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona, on December 14, 2020. They broadcast themselves preparing to sign the documents, allegedly provided by a Trump campaign attorney, claiming that they were the legitimate representatives of the state’s electoral votes.
By that time, Trump’s loss in the state – by less than 11,000 votes – had already been certified by the state’s Republican governor affirming that Joe Biden won Arizona in the 2020 presidential election.
But in the weeks that followed, five of Arizona’s 11 “Republican electors,” as they called themselves, pushed an unusually vocal campaign, compared to other fake electors from states across the country, for Vice President Mike Pence to reject the legitimate Democratic slate of electors.
Instead, they called on Pence to accept them or no electors at all, according to a CNN KFile review of their interviews, actions and comments on social media.
Much attention has been drawn to the fake elector schemes in Georgia and Michigan where local and state authorities charged some participants for election crimes this past summer. But in no other state were there fake electors more active in publicly promoting the scheme than in Arizona.
Now those fake electors find themselves under new legal scrutiny as the Arizona attorney general announced a broad investigation into their actions and their public campaign that could open the electors up to increased legal liability, according to experts who spoke with CNN.
“They were more brazen,” Anthony Michael Kreis, an expert on constitutional law at Georgia State University told CNN. “There is no difficulty trying to piece together their unlawful, corrupt intent because they publicly documented their stream of consciousness bread trail for prosecutors to follow.”
Attorney General Kris Mayes, in an interview with CNN, said she has been in contact with investigators in Michigan and Georgia and the Department of Justice.
“It’s robust. It’s a serious matter,” Mayes, a Democrat, said of her ongoing investigation. “We’re going to make sure that we do it on our timetable, applying the resources that it requires to make sure that justice is done, for not only Arizonans, but for the entire country.”
All 11 electors took part in multiple failed legal challenges, first asking a judge to invalidate the state’s results in a conspiracy theory-laden court case and then taking part in a last-ditch, desperate plea seeking to force Pence to help throw the election to Trump. The cases were dismissed.
Of the 11 fake electors in Arizona, five were the most publicly vocal members advocating the scheme in the state: Kelli Ward, the chairperson of the state party and her spouse, Michael Ward; state Rep. Anthony Kern, then a sitting lawmaker; Jake Hoffman, a newly elected member of the Arizona House; and Tyler Bowyer, a top state official with the Republican National Committee.
Each of these five publicly pushed for the legitimate electors to be discarded by Pence on January 6, 2021. One of the fake electors, Kern, took part in “Stop the Steal” rallies and was photographed in a restricted area on the Capitol steps during the riot at the Capitol.
“The Arizona false electors left a trail here that will surely interest prosecutors,” Ryan Goodman, a law professor at New York University who previously served as the special counsel to the general counsel at the Department of Defense, told CNN.
Electors, a part of the Electoral College system, represent the popular vote in each state. When a candidate wins a state, the party’s designated slate of electors gets to participate in the Electoral College process. The electors meet in a ceremonial process and sign certificates, officially casting their vote for president.
CNN reached out to all of the electors, but only received comment from two of them.
Five vocal fake electors
The most publicly vocal of the fake electors, Kelli Ward called the group the “true electors,” and provided play-by-play updates on the Arizona Republican Party’s YouTube. Falsely saying the state’s electoral votes were “contested,” even though legal challenges to the count had been dismissed, she urged supporters to call on Arizona’s state legislature to decertify the state’s results.
“We believe our votes are the ones that will count on January 6th,” she said in one interview on conservative talk radio, two days after signing the fake documents.
Ward’s comments were echoed in tweets by her husband, Michael, also an elector and a gadfly in Arizona politics known for spreading conspiracy theories. In a post sharing a White House memo that urged Pence to reject the results from states that submitted fake electors, Michael Ward hinted at retribution for Republicans who failed to act.
“My Holiday prayer is that every backstabbing ‘Republican’ gets paid back for their failure to act come Jan 20th!” he wrote in a tweet on December 22.
Another prominent elector was the RNC Committeeman Bowyer, who on his Twitter account pushed false election claims and conspiracies.
“It will be up to the President of the Senate and congress to decide,” Bowyer tweeted after signing the fake electors documents.
In repeated comments Bowyer declared the decision would come down to Pence.
“It’s pretty simple: The President of the United States Senate (VP) has the awesome power of acknowledging a specific envelope of electoral votes when there are two competing slates— or none at all,” wrote Bowyer in a December 28 tweet.
“We don’t live in a Democracy. The presidential election isn’t democratic,” he added when receiving pushback.
A spokesperson for Bowyer said that he was simply responding to a question from a user on what next steps looked like and maintained that there was precedent for a competing slate of electors.
Bowyer urged action in the lead up to the joint session of Congress on January 6.
“Be a modern Son of Liberty today,” he said late in the morning of January 6 – a post he deleted following the riot at the Capitol.
The spokesperson for Bowyer said he had not directly been contacted by Mayes’s office or the DOJ.
Newly elected state representative Hoffman sent a two-page letter to Pence on January 5, 2021, asking the vice president to order that Arizona’s electors not be decided by the popular vote of the citizens, but instead by the members of the state legislature.
“It is in this late hour, with urgency, that I respectfully ask that you delay the certification of election results for Arizona during the joint session of Congress on January 6, 2021, and seek clarification from the Arizona state legislature as to which slate of electors are proper and accurate,” wrote Hoffman.
In interviews, Hoffman repeatedly argued no electors be sent at all because “we don’t have certainty in the outcome of our election,” and to contest Democrat electors if they were sent.
Then-state Rep. Kern, who lost his seat in the 2020 election, spent his final weeks in office sharing “stop the steal” content and participating in their rallies. He said he was “honored” to be a Trump elector.
“On January 6th, vice President Mike Pence gets a choice on which electors he’s going to choose,” Kern told the Epoch Times in an interview in December.
“There is no president elect until January 6th,” he added.
Kern hadn’t changed his tune in an interview with CNN.
“Why, why would you think alternate electors are a lie?,” Kern said.
Kern repeatedly promoted the January 6, 2021, rally preceding the Capitol riot. Kern was in DC that day and shared a photo from the Capitol grounds as rioters gathered on the steps of the Capitol.
“In DC supporting @realDonaldTrump and @CNN @FoxNews @MSNBC are spewing lies again. #truth,” he wrote in a tweet.
Later Kern was seen in a restricted area of the Capitol steps during the riot. There is no indication he was violent, and he has not been charged with any crime.

CNN,A survey asked what Americans were hearing most about the candidates. One of the most common words for Trump was ‘liar’ | CNN Politics,"With time ticking down until Election Day, public impressions of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have not fully coalesced around any singular enduring news story or political issue, according to The Breakthrough, a CNN polling project that tracks what average Americans are actually hearing, reading and seeing about the presidential nominees.
For the second week in a row, the lion’s share of attention from Americans was on each nominee’s activity on the campaign trail, found the poll, conducted by SSRS and Verasight on behalf of a research team from CNN, Georgetown University and the University of Michigan and fielded from October 18-21.
The top activity mentioned for the vice president was sitting for an interview on Fox News, while the former president drew the most attention – though not by an overwhelming margin – for swaying to music onstage for more than 30 minutes at a Pennsylvania rally and for speaking at the Al Smith dinner, a Catholic fundraiser in New York. By contrast, in 2020, the coronavirus pandemic overshadowed any other topic in the final month of the campaign.
The most persistent theme of the 2024 election may be mentions of words such as “lie” and “liar” in conjunction with Trump, who has made numerous false claims over the course of the presidential campaign, including onstage during his debate with Harris and in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. Those references have ranked among the top two words mentioned about him for four consecutive weeks. The relative consistency around Trump is a departure from 2016, when the news recalled about him ricocheted among a series of different topics, while the single word “emails” dominated much of the conversation about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton throughout the majority of the election season.
“Donald Trump lies about almost everything,” one respondent wrote in the latest survey.
While “campaigning” was a prominent topic for both Harris and Trump, what that means breaks down differently for each candidate. In the most recent week of data, nearly half of the mentions of campaigning for Harris related to interviews she’d given, compared with about 13% for Trump, who saw more attention on his rallies.
The economy has also emerged as one of the five most frequently mentioned topics for Harris in every week dating to mid-August, although the sentiment of those mentions – whether the terms and tones used are positive or negative – varies across party lines.
“I’ve heard about her wanting to better the economy,” one Democrat wrote in the latest poll, while a Republican wrote that Harris was taking “credit for the economy being strong when, in fact, the economy was strong when Biden/Harris took over and then tanked the economy.”
The poll also finds the level of public attention to the campaign remaining somewhat below previous peaks. While about 7 in 10 Americans said they’d heard at least something about each of the main candidates, respectively, that compares with roughly 8 in 10 or higher in mid-October 2020 and 2016 – and similarly high numbers in July of this year, during the weeks when Trump was targeted by the first of two assassination attempts and President Joe Biden withdrew from the race.
Overall, the sentiment behind the words Americans used in describing what they’d heard around each candidate remained more negative than positive – although the sentiment used in describing the news surrounding both Harris and Trump remains considerably less negative than the tone used to describe the final weeks of Biden’s campaign.

CNN,House remains paralyzed with no end in sight for speakership battle after Jordan’s exit | CNN Politics,"There is still no end in sight for the high-stakes speakership battle after House Republicans ousted Kevin McCarthy more than two weeks ago.
The search is on for a new GOP speaker nominee after Rep. Jim Jordan on Friday became the latest exit from the race, and it’s already shaping up to be a crowded candidate field.
Frustrations and divisions have only intensified within the conference as Republicans search for a way to resolve the impasse. That, along with the GOP’s narrow majority, has made it increasingly unclear whether any candidate will be able to secure the 217 votes needed to win the gavel on the House floor.
The House, meanwhile, remains in a state of paralysis as Republicans struggle to coalesce around a speaker candidate, with the chamber effectively frozen amid the threat of a government shutdown next month and conflict unfolding abroad.
House Republicans are expected to hold a candidate forum Monday evening and more candidates are likely to throw their names into the running before then.
The showdown over the speakership kicked off earlier this month when a bloc of hardline conservatives voted to remove McCarthy, a historic move that plunged the House into unprecedented territory. Then, in the aftermath of McCarthy’s ouster, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise’s speakership nomination met a swift downfall when the conference failed to come together on his bid.
On Friday, Republicans pushed Jordan out of the race after he failed to win the gavel for the third time in a floor vote earlier in the day. The Ohio Republican fared worse in the vote than he had in previous failed rounds.
Here are some of the candidates now vying to become the next GOP speaker nominee:
- Rep. Tom Emmer, who serves as majority whip, said in a letter to his colleagues shared on Saturday that he was seeking the speakership with the goal of delivering “historic change.” McCarthy is backing Emmer for speaker, sources tell CNN, delivering an early boost for his candidacy.
- Rep. Kevin Hern told CNN on Friday that “yes” he plans to run for speaker. When asked how he plans to get 217 votes, Hern said he’ll work “hard” to get people on his side.
- Rep. Jack Bergman is running for the speaker role, his spokesman told CNN.
- Rep. Austin Scott, who launched a last-minute bid against Jordan last week, but quickly dropped out and then supported Jordan, is now running for speaker again now that the field is wide open, his spokesperson told CNN.
- Rep. Byron Donalds, a Freedom Caucus member, announced on X that he’s seeking the speakership to advance a “conservative vision for the House of Representatives and the American people.”
- Rep. Mike Johnson, the House Republican conference vice chairman, also announced a run for speaker in a letter to his Republican colleagues Saturday, saying “after much prayer and deliberation, I am stepping forward now.”

CNN,"Elon Musk’s super PAC awards $1 million prizes to 2 registered voters, despite DOJ warning | CNN Politics","Elon Musk’s super PAC awarded two $1 million prizes to registered voters in Michigan and Wisconsin on Thursday, after being warned by the Justice Department that the payments might be illegal.
These are the first giveaways by the pro-Donald Trump super PAC after news broke Wednesday that the Justice Department had sent a letter to the group, warning that its “daily” sweepstakes might violate federal election laws against paying for voter registrations.
Musk, the CEO of Tesla and the richest man in the world, launched the sweepstakes on Saturday and his super PAC had named a winner each day – until Wednesday. No winner was announced then, but two winners were announced Thursday on X, the social media platform that Musk owns.
The group has not provided any public explanation for the apparent one-day pause, and a spokesperson for the super PAC declined to comment on Thursday. It’s not clear when Musk received the Justice Department’s letter.
A source familiar with the PAC’s efforts said Friday that “the program never stopped.”
Asked about the lack of an announced winner for Wednesday, the source suggested that it was caused by logistical challenges and not due to the Justice Department’s warning. The super PAC has been referring to the daily winners as “spokespeople” and has framed the $1 million prize money as a salary for their public pro-Trump messaging.
“The spokespeople the PAC selects are real people with real lives and sometimes they are busy. They aren’t going to penalize anyone for not being home when they try to deliver a check,” the person familiar with the super PAC’s efforts said.
Nonpartisan election law experts immediately raised concerns about the sweepstakes after Musk’s initial rollout on Saturday during a pro-Trump campaign event in Pennsylvania.
To win the $1 million prize, people must sign a petition affirming their support for the rights to free speech and bear arms. However, the fine print on the super PAC’s website specifies that only registered voters in seven battleground states are eligible to sign the petition – which experts said is the crux of the potential illegality.
Those controversial requirements have not been changed as of Thursday night and are still on the super PAC’s website.
Federal law makes it a crime for anyone who “pays or offers to pay or accepts payment either for registration to vote or for voting.”
Legal experts previously told CNN that they believe the main problem with Musk’s giveaway was making voter registration a prerequisite to entering the sweepstakes. The problem could be solved if the sweepstakes was offered to any American, regardless of registration status.
In response to a post claiming Musk was “paying to register Republicans,” the tech magnate said winners “can be from any or no political party and you don’t even have to vote.” He has also criticized Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat and former state attorney general, for questioning the legality of the sweepstakes.
Federal filings show Musk has given nearly $119 million – including about $44 million in October – to America PAC, the super PAC he helped form to reelect Trump. He has said he hopes the sweepstakes will boost registration among Trump voters. He recently hit the campaign trail in Pennsylvania, holding events advocating on Trump’s behalf, promoting his petition and spreading conspiracy theories about the 2020 election.
America PAC also received about $3 million in October from members of the influential DeVos family, including $250,000 from former Trump administration Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who quit in the wake of the January 6, 2021, insurrection.
These additional donations in October have enabled Musk’s group to continue spending tens of millions of dollars on canvassing and field operations in key battleground states, helping the Trump campaign keep pace with Kamala Harris’ record-breaking fundraising and massive campaign spending.

Age60
PartyDemocrat
BornOakland, California
Vice President Kamala Harris announced her candidacy for the Democratic nomination for president after Biden withdrew from the ticket and endorsed her on July 21. Harris would be the first Black woman and first Asian American to lead the ticket of a major political party. The daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica, Harris grew up in Oakland and spent much of her political career in California’s Bay Area. As a US senator, Harris was known for her prosecutorial questioning style during hearings with Trump administration officials and nominees, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions and future Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
Past experience
Harris is the current vice president and the highest-ranking female political official in US history. She previously served as a US senator, California attorney general and the San Francisco district attorney.
Key policy issues
With her presidential campaign in full swing, Harris has voiced support for continuing many of Biden’s measures, such as providing tax credits to middle-class and lower-income families, lowering drug costs and eliminating so-called junk fees. Generally, her agenda contains an amped-up series of progressive proposals, though her campaign has confirmed that she’s moved away from several of her more notable left-leaning stances from her 2020 presidential run, such as her interest in a single-payer health insurance system and a ban on fracking.

Former President Donald Trump launched his bid to reclaim the White House in November 2022, aiming to become only the second commander in chief to win two nonconsecutive terms. Trump continues to deny the outcome of the 2020 election that he lost to Joe Biden and promotes baseless conspiracy theories about election fraud. He was twice impeached by the US House of Representatives, including for his role in inciting the deadly January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol following his electoral defeat. In May 2024, Trump was found guilty of all charges at his New York hush money criminal trial. He also faces charges in three other cases, including over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his alleged mishandling of classified documents after leaving office.

The Kennedy family scion first entered the race in April 2023, challenging President Joe Biden in the Democratic primary. But that October, seeing his path to overtake Biden blocked, he switched to an independent run. In August 2024, Kennedy suspended his campaign, and supported former President Donald Trump. Kennedy, however, still suggested an Electoral College tie could put him in the White House and said he intended to remain on the ballot in some states. During his campaign, Kennedy selected Nicole Shanahan as his running mate, and sought to appeal to voters dissatisfied with both the Democratic and Republican parties. He frequently accused Biden and Trump of increasing government spending, prolonging US involvement in foreign conflicts and enacting policies beneficial to large corporations. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Kennedy drew national attention for spreading false information about the coronavirus, vaccines and public health measures.
Past experience
Kennedy worked as an attorney for the environmental nonprofit Riverkeeper. He also was an attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council and president of the Waterkeeper Alliance. He served as chairman of Children’s Health Defense, which is known for promoting anti-vaccination rhetoric.

CNN,The Rust Belt manufacturing collapse devastated their communities. Two men explain who they’re supporting for president | CNN Politics,"Driving through the streets of Saginaw, Michigan, with Hurley Coleman III, the raw tension between what was and what could be in his community runs deeper than what can be seen through the passenger windows.
It’s a feeling that comes through in his every word passing through the streets where he grew up.
“Our region has been screaming and crying out, ‘Hey, we’re here. We’re trying to change. We’re trying to grow. Look at all the thing we’re doing,’” he says. “And yet nobody truly paid attention until we became a battleground county.”
Politicians and their campaigns are paying attention now, that much is clear.
Just as they have zeroed in on a Pennsylvania county about 350 miles away, where we sat at Phil Kerner’s dining room table around fresh pepperoni balls – an Erie County delicacy, his wife informs us – a few days later.
“You’d drive down that industrial corridor on 12th Street, just full shops. Just full shops. Amazing,” Kerner recounted, inviting the obvious follow-up.
So what happened to that street in Erie?
“It’s pretty decimated now,” says the tool and die maker.
Two of the most important battleground counties in two of the most important battleground states.
President Barack Obama won both handily on his path to reelection in 2012.
Donald Trump narrowly captured each on his way to collapsing the Democrats’ vaunted “blue wall” in 2016.
Joe Biden grabbed them back four years later – by the narrowest of margins.
The closely watched political bellwethers share a familiar economic backdrop, animated by their collapse as great hubs in American manufacturing when globalization sucked the life out of industrial powerhouses in this part of the country.
It’s the throughline between the story as told by two families – the Colemans and the Kerners – with generational ties to these communities now fully ensconced in the political Klieg lights.
They share a common passion for where they grew up and continue to reside today. With that comes a significant dose of hope that those places can regain some form of the economic success that defined their past.
“Many of the matriarchs and patriarchs of our families who are now retired, they’re holding on to their properties. They’re hoping that they have something that they can pass down to the generations, to the next generation,” Coleman says.
But their personal journeys are as distinct as the communities within which they were raised.
They diverge on their choice of presidential candidate this November. Their explanations as to why – and their observations of where others in their communities stand on things just weeks before Election Day – offer a candid glance at the opportunities and potential pitfalls facing Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.
A story of resilience
The Coleman family embodies Saginaw’s economic journey since they arrived in Central Michigan, like so many other Black families, during the manufacturing boom that spurred the Great Migration. The automotive industry was the dominant employer – and between General Motors and the rings of suppliers and support businesses that surrounded the plant here, the community was deeply attached to the company’s operations.
“Eighty to ninety percent of the adults in the church were employed full time with GM,” Coleman’s father, a bishop in the Church of God in Christ, says of the congregation he inherited from his own dad.
“Right now, in our congregation, I have one person full-time employed by the auto industry,” Hurley Coleman Jr. says.
In recent years, other industries have started to move in to provide opportunities that had seemed all too fleeting as the broad-based manufacturing tied to major automakers atrophied in the area.
Advanced manufacturing across several industries, including major investments in electric vehicle supply chains, have developed, and major hospitals and medical device companies have expanded their foothold.
“The story that I’d like for us to tell is that we’re resilient and that we do bounce back and that we do have people in this region that are thinking towards the future and that we have, hopefully, a new generation of people that will love this region as well, just like we do,” the younger Coleman says.
Coleman was sitting at his kitchen table as he toggled between sparks of optimism – for his community and his family – and the weight of what he’s experienced over the past several years.
The nonprofit that he leads works with the residents who have the least.
“Sometimes when they come in there and we are their last hope,” Coleman says. “The lights are shut off. They have no food in the cabinets. Senior citizens have been sitting at home, nobody to call, nobody to help them out.”
The best days are the smiles Coleman sees when his team provides that lifeline. But the weight of being a last resort in a community grappling with violence and poverty can be overwhelming.
“There are those days when we have so many people that need help. So many problems, so many issues, so many emergencies and calamities that have happened,” Coleman says.
A craftsman and a diminishing trade
Back in Erie, as Phil Kerner flips through the binder on his desk filled with sketches, time cards and family history, it’s apparent there isn’t much he hasn’t saved over the years.
There’s the copy of the 1920 census that lists his grandfather Edward as a toolmaker in this corner of northwestern Pennsylvania.
The story of Edward’s three sons – two toolmakers and a machinist – shows how deeply intertwined his family had been with the trade and their community at one time.
That’s no longer the case.
“My grandfather did this. My father did this. My uncles did it. My brothers did it. I did it. My kids aren’t doing it,” Kerner says. “That tells you everything, right?”
Kerner still loves his tool and die craft and now works for a local family-owned manufacturer of component parts when he’s not in the workshop he built in his basement.
His work can be painstakingly intricate, from the granular details necessary in the sketch of a design to the art and science required to build a plastic injection mold.
Toys, storage containers, mechanical parts and other items found in homes across the country are likely to contain the type of thing Kerner specializes in crafting.
When President George W. Bush famously stood with a bullhorn on the still-smoldering rubble of ground zero after 9/11, the firefighter standing next to him had a respirator mask around his neck. Kerner designed and built the plastic mold for the mask.
But Kerner can pinpoint the exact moment he saw his industry take a turn as part of a decadelong shift to cheaper and faster production overseas.
“I realized that my best customer for ten years was - I wouldn’t use the word undermining me - but had totally abandoned a lot of us in Erie that were doing work for them,” Kerner recalled.
Kerner remains deeply passionate about his profession, so much so that as he saw interest waning in what he viewed as a top-tier trade, he took matters into his own hands.
He launched a YouTube channel titled, naturally, “The Tool and Die Guy.” He has more than 25,000 subscribers.
“I’m just what they’re looking for - irreverent enough, you know?” Kerner said with a chuckle. “I’m the toolmaker they always wish they had working next to them.”
The videos – now more than 170, including one recapping his sitdown with CNN – was the furthest thing from a vanity project in search of social media fame.
Instead, it was an effort born of that passion for his trade – and his deep concern that the appreciation for the skill and craftsmanship that goes with it has diminished in the same way that manufacturing has in places like Erie across the country.
The impact, he notes, cuts far deeper than a plant and its employees. The entire community takes the hit.
“It’s sad to see it as somebody who has experienced the zenith of manufacturing from the 50s up until the 90s,” Kerner says.
‘Probably going to call Trump’
Kerner cops to being “a little bit of a political junkie,” and he pays close attention to the broader economic news in the country.
“I always tell people I’m not a Republican, I’m a realist. I think they’re all terrible,” he says.
He knows the broader macroeconomic numbers point to an economy that has exceeded expectations and forecasts for several years running. But his view of the economy is tied to what he’s seeing in his household.
“It’s not like my wages are going up,” Kerner says. “Not a complaint, but my wages aren’t going up. And I get it - I see that touted a lot. Wages going up. Wages going up. I talk to my friends, ‘Your wages going up?’ No. I don’t know whose wages are going up.”
He describes his decision for who to vote for in similar terms – comparing it to a business owner forced to choose between making payroll or paying suppliers.
“If you don’t figure this out, you lose your home. We’re going to foreclose on you. Who are you going to call?” Kerner asks. “Probably going to call Trump.”
He estimates about 95% of the people he works with also support Trump.
“I think the general consensus in the business community is Trump’s kind of one of us or one of them, you know, because he’s at least on it,” Kerner says. “You ain’t like the way he did it, but that’s his background.”
What he’d really like to see, he makes clear repeatedly, is something that flies far beneath the current political radar. Elevated and uniform apprenticeship standards that take into account the importance of the trade – and the value that comes with it, which should ensure lifelong employment in manufacturing.
It is, in many ways, the point of his YouTube videos, which have taken on a deeper meaning for him over time.
“As long as there’s an internet, people will know that there was a Kerner family in Erie, Pennsylvania. That the tool and die trade was great. That Phil Kerner did it and taught us how to do the best he could,” he says.
More hope with Harris
Coleman’s feelings about the November election are summed up in a single word.
“Nervous,” he says. “I’m nervous about the future.”
For all of the optimism he conveys about Saginaw’s future, the reality of the policy contrasts between the two candidates is very real in his line of work.
He sees Trump’s fiscal proposals as directly targeting the federal dollars that help his nonprofit operate.
The idea that tax cuts and deregulation will filter down to those on the lower end of the economic spectrum is something he says has never proved to be the case.
“They have no idea the everyday, you know, traumas of a person who’s living in poverty,” Coleman says. “People with money could face hardship that causes them to lose their home or forces them to struggle with the high cost of gas.”
“But that doesn’t parallel the person who was living in poverty,” Coleman says. “It’s just night and day.”
Coleman supported Biden’s reelection – he and his son, HJ, even spent time with the incumbent when he traveled to Saginaw while still a candidate.
He’s now supporting Harris and saw the Democratic National Convention as a positive step in outlining what she brings to the table.
But it’s clear Democrats have work to do with a critical constituency.
“Many Black men in our area are still yet undecided,” Coleman says. He hears often about the border and whether migrants are taking federal aid that could help people in his community.
The pandemic-era stimulus checks, which Trump made a point of putting his name on, also come up regularly.
“There are people who think that the stimulus checks that came out during the pandemic and things of that nature are something that’s going to happen again,” Coleman’s father says.
Still, Biden’s decision to drop out of the race and Harris’ rise has sparked a new level of enthusiasm, according to the elder Coleman.
“Now the conversation is not how bad Biden was or how good Trump was, but what possibly could happen with a Harris presidency,” the bishop says. “I think there’s more opportunistic hope that’s been created in the last few weeks.”
Driving down Williams Street with the younger Coleman, just before the Saginaw River, it’s impossible to miss the string of abandoned silos that jut into the skyline.
Once an unavoidable blot hanging over the city’s business and arts districts, they were transformed a few years ago into a 70,000-square-foot canvas for contract street artists.
For Coleman, the eruption of bright colors and unwieldy shapes represents more than just a beautification project.
“What was old, what was outdated is about its experience of having transformation and rebirth,” he says, staring at the mural. “And people are going to benefit off of others’ creativity and desire to see change. And I think that’s what those silos represent. And it’s the future for this region.”",2024-09-26
CNN,CNN Polls: Harris and Trump remain neck and neck in Georgia and North Carolina | CNN Politics,"Neither Vice President Kamala Harris nor former President Donald Trump has established a clear advantage in the race for the White House in two key Southern battleground states, according to new CNN polls conducted by SSRS.
Likely voters in Georgia divide 48% for Trump to 47% for Harris, and in North Carolina, Harris stands at 48% to Trump’s 47%. Results are within the margin of error in both states, suggesting no clear leader in either contest.
Both states are hotly contested in this year’s presidential election. North Carolina, which narrowly supported Barack Obama in 2008, has voted Republican in the past three presidential elections. In 2020, however, it was the state where Trump earned his slimmest margin of victory. Joe Biden defeated Trump in Georgia by less than 1 percentage point four years ago, becoming the first Democrat to win the state since Bill Clinton in 1992.
The results suggest little movement since CNN’s late-August poll of Georgia and late-September poll of North Carolina, both of which also found no clear leader in the race. An overwhelming 95% of likely voters in each state now say they’ve made up their minds about their vote, leaving a dwindling pool of potentially movable voters, although one that’s still large enough to swing the race either way. More than half of the likely electorate in both Georgia (59%) and North Carolina (52%) say they’ve already cast their ballots, with those voters splitting narrowly toward Harris by a 7-point margin in Georgia and by 6 points in North Carolina.
In both states, roughly two-thirds of Harris backers – 69% in Georgia and 67% in North Carolina – say they’re mostly voting to support her, rather than to oppose Trump. That’s a higher share than in CNN’s latest polling in the other five battleground states – Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – where the average share hovers closer to 60%. Much of the difference is due to Harris’ Black supporters in Georgia and North Carolina, about 8 in 10 of whom say their vote is largely an endorsement of the vice president. That’s the case even as Black registered voters are less likely than White registered voters in both states to describe themselves as “extremely motivated” to vote.
Broad majorities of Trump backers in both states – 81% in Georgia and 75% in North Carolina – say their vote is primarily about support for the former president, rather than opposition to Harris. That’s similar to the share of Trump backers saying the same in other battleground states.
In a contrast to the razor-thin race for the White House, Democrat Josh Stein holds a clear advantage in the race for North Carolina governor, leading scandal-plagued Republican Mark Robinson, 53% to 37%, among likely voters. That’s due to significant ticket-splitting in favor of the Democrat down ballot: 77% of Trump voters in the state say they’re backing Robinson in the gubernatorial race, with 10% backing Stein and another 12% saying they wouldn’t vote for either of the major candidates. Nearly all of Harris’ supporters in the state, 96%, say they support Stein.
While the polls find similar political environments in Georgia and North Carolina overall, there are some significant differences.
Biden gets similarly low ratings for his job performance in each state: 39% of likely voters in North Carolina, and 37% in Georgia, say they approve. But the White House gets notably lower ratings for its response to Hurricane Helene in the Tar Heel State. Forty-two percent of likely voters in Georgia, but just 36% in North Carolina, say they approve of the way the Biden administration has handled the federal government’s response to Hurricane Helene, with sizable shares of likely voters in both states saying they are unsure how they view the response to the storm (17% in North Carolina, 14% in Georgia). Views of the administration’s storm response generally run parallel to partisanship, but still, 11% of Harris supporters in North Carolina say they disapprove of the way the Biden administration handled the response to Helene. In Georgia, the share of Harris backers disapproving stands at just 5%.
In both states, Harris leads among Black likely voters (84% to 13% in Georgia, 78% to 19% in North Carolina) and voters with college degrees (55% to 39% in Georgia, 53% to 42% in North Carolina). White college graduates split about evenly in both states (50% Harris to 47% Trump in North Carolina, 48% Trump to 46% Harris in Georgia). Trump holds a commanding lead, 81% to 15%, among White voters without college degrees in Georgia. He leads that group by a less overwhelming margin, 65% to 31%, in North Carolina.
In North Carolina, the poll finds Trump leading by 7 points among men and Harris ahead by 9 points among women. In Georgia, men favor Trump by the same margin, but women are closer to evenly split (49% favor Harris, 47% Trump). That close margin among women in Georgia is due to a massive gap between White women (66% Trump to 30% Harris) and women of color (79% Harris to 15% Trump). In both states, Harris holds a broad lead among voters who say they live in a city or urban area, with Trump holding a similarly broad advantage in rural areas. But suburban voters in Georgia are split, 48% Harris to 47% Trump, while suburban voters in North Carolina favor Harris, 53% to 42%.
Voters in these two states are among the most likely across battleground states to say that candidates’ positions on the issues are driving their choices more than their leadership traits and approach to the presidency – 58% in Georgia and 56% in North Carolina say issues are more critical to their choice.
Likely voters in both states give Trump the advantage over Harris on trust to handle immigration (by a 15-point margin in Georgia and a 12-point margin in North Carolina), foreign policy (by a 9-point margin in both states) and the economy (by an 8-point margin in both states). They give Harris the lead on trust to handle abortion and reproductive rights (by a 15-point margin in North Carolina and a 13-point margin in Georgia), with voters in both states closely split on which candidate they more trust to protect democracy.
Voters in Georgia say by an 8-point margin that they see Harris, not Trump, as the candidate who cares more about people like them, while voters in North Carolina are more closely divided. In both states, Harris is seen as the more honest and trustworthy candidate, while Trump holds a slim advantage as the candidate better able to bring needed change.
Roughly 8 in 10 likely voters in each state say they’re at least somewhat confident that votes in their state will be accurately cast and counted in this year’s election. In both states, that rises to roughly 9 in 10 among Harris supporters, with 74% of Trump voters in North Carolina and only two-thirds of the Republican’s backers in Georgia saying the same.
Interviews were conducted October 23-28, 2024, online and by telephone with registered voters, including 732 voters in Georgia and 750 in North Carolina. Likely voters include all registered voters in the poll weighted for their predicted likelihood of voting in this year’s election. Results among likely voters in Georgia have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.7 percentage points; it is 4.5 points among likely voters in North Carolina.",2024-10-31
CNN,Analysis: Donald Trump’s campaign of relentless lying | CNN Politics,"The United States that Donald Trump describes in his rally speeches would be pretty bad if it actually existed.
Schools secretly sending children for gender-affirming surgeries without parental consent. Towns and even cities conquered by illegal immigrants. Pervasive election fraud. The highest inflation of all time. Presiding over it all: an illegitimate president who stole the job from the rightful winner.
None of this is true. Trump keeps telling his crowds that it is.
For the third consecutive presidential election, the Republican presidential nominee is running a relentlessly dishonest campaign for the world’s most powerful office. Wildly exaggerating statistics, grossly distorting his opponent’s record and his own, regularly just plain making stuff up, Trump is lying to American voters with a frequency and variety whose only precedent is his own previous campaigns.
Trump made thousands of false claims as president, picking up the pace during crises and elections. But that he has himself done the same thing before doesn’t make it any less noteworthy that he is doing it now.
All presidents lie. Historians say, however, that there has never been a president who has lied this much, has lied about so many different things, or made up so many things out of whole cloth.
“Donald Trump is the first president to consistently seek to create a separate reality,” said CNN presidential historian Timothy Naftali, a Columbia University research scholar and former director of the Richard Nixon Presidential Library – not just misleadingly shading the facts or omitting damaging information but endlessly inventing stories out of thin air.
“He’s found,” Naftali said, “that the big lie is more powerful than the little lie, and if you’re going to get away with a lie, you might as well go with the big lie.”
Lies about subjects big and small
This fall, Trump has lied both about important policy subjects for obvious political reasons and about trivial personal subjects for no apparent reason other than that this is what he has always done.
He has lied about immigration more than anything else.
There was widespread coverage of his baseless debate declaration that Haitian migrants are “eating the pets” of American residents of an Ohio city. But he has told equally imaginary stories about “the Congo” emptying prisons to send criminals to the United States (didn’t happen), unspecified other countries emptying their “insane asylums” for the same reason (no evidence for this, either), and Vice President Kamala Harris diverting all of the Federal Emergency Management Authority’s disaster relief money to migrants (nobody did that, let alone Harris herself).
Trump has been persistently deceptive about the economy, too. He has lied over and over about his signature proposal for across-the-board tariffs on imported goods, falsely claiming that tariffs are merely a tax on foreign countries and don’t affect Americans. They are actually paid by US importers, who often pass on costs to average American consumers.
And Trump has continued his long-running effort to rewrite history. In his telling, he publicly warned against the invasion of Iraq (he didn’t), never called to lock up 2016 Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton (he did), and never “even thought about” ending Obamacare (he called to repeal it as a candidate and tried to repeal it as president); Vladimir Putin laughed in Harris’ face when she met with him to try to avert the invasion of Ukraine (Harris has never met Putin); and no Capitol rioter in 2021 was armed with a gun (multiple rioters carried guns).
There’s a political rationale for lies about such important topics. But Trump has also been doing the bewildering lying about inconsequential topics that was a trademark of his rhetoric not only as president but as a businessman exaggerating the size of his buildings and as a television personality exaggerating his show’s ratings.
In the last month, he has told tales about matters as irrelevant as when he appeared on Oprah Winfrey’s popular television show – no, it wasn’t during the star-studded final week – and a “Man of the Year” award he has for eight years claimed he received in Michigan before he ran for office, though he did not.
Nobody else is like this
It’s not clear how well all this lying is actually working for Trump. While it may help whip up his loyal base, Trump lost the last election, and polling has reliably found that far more people think he is not honest and trustworthy than think he is.
What is clear is that there is no other major current figure in US federal politics, either Republican or Democrat, who lies as frequently as Trump does. President Joe Biden, Trump’s initial opponent in this election, and Harris, Trump’s current opponent, certainly don’t.
Biden has a habit of ad-libbing occasional lies about his biography – among various other things, he is not a former truck driver and did not get arrested protesting for civil rights – and making egregious misstatements about statistics.
Harris, a far more careful speaker than Biden, has made false claims about Project 2025, Trump’s economic record and her own policy shift on fracking. That’s in addition to various disputed predictions about what Trump would do in office if elected.
But when it comes to the facts, the two sides in this election are just not alike.
I have to carefully inspect the transcripts of Harris speeches to see if there might be a claim or two that might be inaccurate. Trump tends to make dozens of obvious false claims in each speech.
In other words, Trump habitually tells more public lies in a single public appearance than Harris tells over the course of a month or more.
The coverage hasn’t changed much
I’ve publicly urged media outlets for years to make the fact-checking of political lies a core part of their coverage, as CNN does, rather than something to be wheeled out on a few high-profile nights a year.
Nine years into Trump’s political career, daily fact-checking still isn’t happening enough. While numerous media outlets did a good job debunking his too-sensational-to-ignore “eating the pets” nonsense, too many lie-filled Trump speeches are still covered by most local and national outlets with, at most, a passing reference to the numerous falsehoods.
If you met someone at a bar who told you 25 things that weren’t true, that would be one of the first things you told other people about this encounter. Trump telling the American people 25 things that aren’t true in a rally speech should be one of the first things media outlets tell their readers and viewers about the speech.
Trump’s dismissive response to fact checks
Maybe then Trump would care a bit more about being corrected.
It’s standard for political campaigns to try to spin fact-checkers. They’ll argue, on or off the record, that a false claim was actually just a bit misleading, or merely missing a bit of context, or even that it was true.
Trump’s campaign team rarely bothers with this type of persuasion effort. His White House didn’t either. Instead, his spokespeople have either ignored requests for comment or, sometimes, emailed over related information that doesn’t come close to proving what he said.
I suspect the Trump team’s rebuttals are so low energy because many of his claims are so indefensible. I also suspect, though, that it’s because Trump appears to have so little concern about being called wrong.
He has almost never adjusted his rhetoric in response to a public debunking. No matter what CNN writes, no matter how many “Pinocchios” The Washington Post awards him, he knows that far more of his supporters will hear the uncorrected false claim – through social media, pro-Trump media outlets and, yes, even many mainstream media outlets – than hear the truth.
Occasionally, he demonstrates that he has himself seen the fact checks. Those moments are revealing.
At a public event in mid-October, Trump repeated his lie that newly released federal figures show that there are 13,099 immigrants with homicide convictions who entered the country “during their administration.” CNN and others had been pointing out for two weeks that these figures are about people who entered the country over decades, including Trump’s own administration, not just under Biden and Harris.
Trump conceded he was aware of this: he said quickly that “they” tried to say the data covered a “longer” period than just the Biden presidency.
“Wrong,” he declared, falsely, without any explanation. And then he repeated the initial lie once more.",2024-11-01
CNN,Special counsel Jack Smith’s office is bracing for retribution if Trump wins | CNN Politics,"One year after bringing historic indictments against former President Donald Trump, the prosecutors left in special counsel Jack Smith’s office are gaming out legal options and bracing for retribution if Trump returns to the White House.
Trump has called Smith a “sick puppy” and pledged to fire him “within two seconds” – which would effectively end two criminal cases over the former president’s handling of classified documents and efforts to overturn the 2020 election. The Justice Department is also unable to prosecute a sitting president.
But until Inauguration Day in January, Smith would have time to weigh his options on issues the department has never had to confront before.
One early hurdle is whether the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel considers a president-elect to be covered by the same legal protection against prosecution as a sitting president. That guidance would determine the next course of action, people briefed on the matter told CNN.
More than a half dozen people who are close to the special counsel’s office or other top Justice Department officials told CNN that they believe Smith doesn’t want to close shop before being ordered to do so or being pushed out by Trump.
“He’s not going to be the one to say, ‘I’m going to fold the tent,’” a former Justice Department official with insight into Smith’s approach told CNN.
The prosecutors are also prepared for a personal toll, including the possibility of GOP-led congressional investigations into their work and internal professional reviews that could be initiated by the Justice Department at Trump’s urging.
Many also have girded for right-wing-initiated furor toward them, knowing it was a possible outcome even two years ago when they joined Smith’s team. The special counsel’s office has had harassment briefings, especially related to online doxing, cybersecurity and stalking. Smith has his own detail of several security guards, and others on his team have taken steps to protect their safety.
Meanwhile, the office is already down to a skeleton crew as some prosecutors have left for other jobs within the Justice Department. Others are also considering leaving, including going to large corporate defense firms where Justice Department lawyers often wait out the revolving door of Democratic or Republican administrations.
The pay in those private-sector jobs is often more lucrative and can defray personal legal bills, if they end up needing to hire their own lawyers.
In the event that Trump wins, staffers detailed to the special counsel’s office would have the option to go back to their home divisions within the Justice Department. Unlike political appointees like Smith, they aren’t able to be fired at the direction of the president.
But former prosecutors on the Trump case could face a difficult workplace, once Trump’s appointees are running the department.
Keeping Trump cases alive
While closing his office before Inauguration has always been an option, sources believe Smith and his core team are likely to keep both Trump cases alive in court as long as they can, knowing they could run headlong into Trump’s wrath.
Smith and his team are appealing Judge Aileen Cannon’s July decision to dismiss the classified documents case against Trump and his two co-defendants in which she ruled Smith didn’t have the authority to charge the case. The department is appealing her dismissal in a broader defense of its ability to use special counsels to insulate politically sensitive investigations. The issue is likely to go to the Supreme Court if the appeals continue.
Cannon’s dismissal of the case wasn’t particularly demoralizing to Smith’s office, sources say, in part because some of the prosecutors realized early on that Cannon would likely be a bad draw for them when she first got the case in 2023.
Still, the prosecution team around the case in Florida was dwindling even before Cannon shut the case down. One prosecutor whom many had believed would have tried the case, David Raskin, left Smith’s office before Cannon dismissed the case to oversee Hamas-related and other national security prosecutions under his own longtime close colleague, now-assistant attorney general for national security Matt Olsen.
In Washington, Smith’s prosecutors are pressing forward in the criminal case alleging Trump orchestrated a conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election after the Supreme Court ruled Trump had immunity for certain official acts taken as president.
In recent weeks, the special counsel’s office filed its 252-page brief in an attempt to convince the trial judge and, potentially, the Supreme Court, Trump’s actions aren’t immune from prosecution.
That move — a sweeping public presentation of evidence with sharp language about Trump’s intent and culpability — was an example of Smith’s undeterred approach, some of the sources said. Trump’s lawyers have criticized the approach in court as out of step with typical case procedure and unfair to Trump as a defendant.
The immunity brief may be the most comprehensive documentation of the January 6 federal criminal case the public will ever see.
Justice officials watching election
Inside the Justice Department, top leaders are watching the election closely, knowing they will need to confront unprecedented legal questions should Trump win.
If Vice President Kamala Harris wins, the choices for the department and the special counsel’s office may be much simpler. The two criminal cases would continue on. Individual prosecutors would have to decide whether to stay on the case long enough to take Trump to trial, which could take years.
Attorney General Merrick Garland has long maintained the two federal criminal cases against Trump, once charged, were in the hands of the court system.
“The matter is now in the hands of the trial judge to determine when a trial will take place,” he told CNN in January.
In the event that Trump wins, one question will be what to do in court during the presidential transition. The Justice Department has long maintained it wouldn’t prosecute a sitting president while he is in office.
Smith and Justice officials almost certainly will need to seek the advice of the department’s Office of Legal Counsel on whether a president-elect can be prosecuted, which could prompt the DOJ to also set the policy for future presidencies, the people briefed on the matter said.
In the January 6 case, prosecutors also could ask the federal trial judge, Tanya Chutkan, to hold the case in abeyance — essentially put it on ice — in the months before Trump takes office.
Then, on January 20 when Trump would be inaugurated, the procedure could get complicated. The January 6 case against Trump is in the hands of Chutkan and approved by a grand jury – two functions of democracy that sit outside of the executive branch and the Justice Department’s total control. Prosecutors would need to ask Chutkan to dismiss the case.
And while the judge ultimately is likely to do so, Chutkan may not immediately close it, and could ask for additional filings, arguments and information.
“Just think of the chaos of it all – that, he [Trump] would love,” one of the former Justice Department officials said.

CNN,Supreme Court lifts restrictions on Biden administration communications with social media companies | CNN Politics,"The Supreme Court on Friday lifted restrictions on the Biden administration’s communications with social media companies while a lawsuit targeting the government’s efforts to combat online misinformation plays out.
The court’s move pauses rulings from a federal trial court and a conservative appeals court that severely limited the ability of the White House, the surgeon general, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the FBI and a top US cybersecurity agency to communicate with social media companies about content related to Covid-19 and elections the government views as misinformation.
A sweeping preliminarily injunction issued this summer by a federal judge in Louisiana effectively blocked a slew of federal agencies and administration officials from communicating with social media companies about taking down “content containing protected free speech” posted on the platforms.
In agreeing to pause the rulings on Friday, the high court also said it would take up the case, though it didn’t say when it would hear oral arguments in the dispute.
Conservative Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas said they disagreed with the court’s decision to pause the lower court rulings.
“The upshot is that the Biden administration gets to keep on doing whatever it’s doing with regard to communicating with social media companies until and unless the Supreme Court rules against it on the merits,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law.
In the five-page dissent, the conservatives criticized the court’s decision to take up the case while it was still in an early phase and called the court’s decision to pause the rulings “highly disturbing.”
“At this time in the history of our country, what the Court has done, I fear, will be seen by some as giving the Government a green light to use heavy-handed tactics to skew the presentation of views on the medium that increasingly dominates the dissemination of news,” Alito wrote in the dissent. “That is most unfortunate.”
Lawsuit targeted government efforts to curtail misinformation
Missouri and Louisiana’s attorneys general, as well as several individual plaintiffs, filed the lawsuit last year, alleging that the government’s efforts to combat online misinformation about Covid-19 and US elections amounted to a form of unconstitutional censorship.
A sweeping preliminarily injunction issued this summer by a federal judge in Louisiana effectively blocked a slew of federal agencies and administration officials from communicating with social media companies about taking down “content containing protected free speech” posted on the platforms.
A three-judge panel at the 5th US Court of Appeals scaled back the injunction in September, narrowing its scope to a few agencies that it said “likely violated the First Amendment” when they leaned on platforms to moderate some content.
The court said the new injunction covered only the White House, the surgeon general, the CDC and the FBI.
After the Biden administration turned to the Supreme Court, the plaintiffs asked 5th Circuit panel to expand the scope of the injunction. The court partially granted the request in early October, adding the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency as an enjoined entity.

CNN,"Who is Rep. Mike Johnson, the new House speaker? | CNN Politics","Rep. Mike Johnson, the new speaker of the House, has been a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump and was a key congressional figure in the failed efforts to overturn the 2020 election.
The Louisiana Republican was first elected to the House in 2016 and serves as vice chairman of the House Republican Conference, as well as GOP deputy whip, an assistant leadership role. An attorney with a focus on constitutional law, Johnson joined a group of House Republicans in voting to sustain the objection to electoral votes on January 6, 2021. During Trump’s first impeachment trial in January 2020, Johnson, along with a group of other GOP lawmakers, served a largely ceremonial role in Trump’s Senate impeachment team.
Johnson also sent an email from a personal email account in 2020 to every House Republican soliciting signatures for an amicus brief in the longshot Texas lawsuit seeking to invalidate electoral college votes from multiple states.
After the election was called in favor of Joe Biden on November 7, 2020, Johnson posted on X, then known as Twitter, “I have just called President Trump to say this: ‘Stay strong and keep fighting, sir! The nation is depending upon your resolve. We must exhaust every available legal remedy to restore Americans’ trust in the fairness of our election system.’”
Although Trump said he wouldn’t endorse anyone in the speaker’s race Wednesday, he leant support to Johnson in a post on Truth Social.
“In 2024, we will have an even bigger, & more important, WIN! My strong SUGGESTION is to go with the leading candidate, Mike Johnson, & GET IT DONE, FAST!” Trump posted.
Johnson serves on the Judiciary Committee and the Armed Services Committee. He is also a former chair of the Republican Study Committee.
After receiving a degree in business administration from Louisiana State University and a Juris Doctorate from the Paul M. Hebert Law Center, Johnson took on roles as a college professor and conservative talk radio host. He began his political career in the Louisiana legislature, where he served from 2015 to 2017, before being elected to Congress in Louisiana’s Fourth District.
Rep. Kevin Hern, an Oklahoma Republican who chairs the influential Republican Study Committee, dropped out of the race for speaker Tuesday evening and backed Johnson.
“I want everyone to know this race has gotten to the point where it’s gotten crazy. This is more about people right now than it should be,” he said. “This should be about America and America’s greatness. For that, I stepped aside and threw all my support behind Mike Johnson. I think he’d make a great speaker.”
Johnson’s win in the secret-ballot race for the House Republican Conference’s nominee for speaker followed Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer’s decision to drop out of the race hours after Republicans chose him to be the nominee following resistance from the right flank of the conference and a rebuke from Trump. Reps. Steve Scalise and Jim Jordan have also dropped out after earlier seeking the speaker’s gavel.
Johnson joined the speakership race in a Saturday post on X, formerly known as Twitter.
“I have been humbled to have so many Members from across our Conference reach out to encourage me to seek the nomination for Speaker. Until yesterday, I had never contacted one person about this, and I have never before aspired to the office,” he said in a posted letter. “However, after much prayer and deliberation, I am stepping forward now.”

CNN,An EV plant bolstered by Biden’s climate law sparks hope in northeast Ohio – but not a revival of its Democratic roots | CNN Politics,"For this long-beleaguered region of Northeast Ohio, a gleaming new 2.8 million-square-foot manufacturing plant symbolizes something that has been fleeting in recent years: hope.
Hope that years of promises – so often broken or deferred – have been replaced by action in the form of 2,200 employees at the Ultium Cells electric vehicle battery plant, which sits at the forefront of cutting-edge green technology and manufacturing.
Hope in the shadow of the hulking former General Motors Lordstown plant that closed its doors in 2019, forcing workers like George Goranitis to leave the only jobs and homes they knew.
“All the mills shutting down, packers shutting down – the last thing here for a good-paying job was General Motors Lordstown,” Goranitis said.
The collapse of the lone remaining cornerstone of a manufacturing powerhouse cut to the heart of a proud community.
“Members, you know, weren’t able to handle some of the news,” Goranitis recalled. “And, you know, the situations they were in at that time, they took their own lives. There was divorces because of it. You know, families were ripped apart.”
The story of the GM plant closure in Mahoning Valley in Northeast Ohio isn’t new.
Nor is the story of how Donald Trump tapped into the anxieties within those communities with his bold promises to bring back the manufacturing prowess of old.
Here in Trumbull County, for decades a Democratic stronghold filled with union workers, President Barack Obama crushed Republican nominee Mitt Romney by 23 points in 2012.
Four years later, Trump flipped the county – the first Republican to do so in more than four decades – in a dramatic demonstration of strength among White blue-collar voters in the industrial Midwest.
He went on to win Trumbull County by an even greater margin in 2020, as Ohio, once the premier bellwether state, cemented its shift firmly into Republican hands.
Trump is once again the GOP nominee.
And he’s once again centering his campaign on big promises of a Midwestern manufacturing renaissance.
“We are going to bring so many auto plants into our country,” Trump boomed at an event this month in Michigan. “You’re going to be as big or bigger than you were 50 years ago.”
It’s a pitch that demonstrates his keen awareness that union voters – especially auto workers – hold the keys back to the White House in the critical states that form a political firewall through Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.
It’s also one that highlights why the story of Lordstown – and the new electric vehicle battery plant located here – is such a critical window into this political moment.
Lordstown today represents singular convergence of political pledges broken and delivered, the pain and promise of economic transition, and the evolving tumult inside unions across the country that have experienced clear wins at the same moment rank-and-file members are shifting away from their long-standing support for the Democratic Party.
“Our plant, honestly, is a Trump plant,” Goranitis, who spearheaded the effort to organize the new Ultium plant where he now works, said of his union worker colleagues in a wide-ranging interview behind his UAW Local 1112 headquarters in nearby Warren.
Trump’s 2017 promise
When Trump arrived in nearby Youngstown in his first year as president, the Lordstown GM plant was already under clear signs of stress. That made Trump’s bold declarations all the more resonant with the community.
“Don’t move,” Trump said as he pledged to bring jobs back to the region. “Don’t sell your house.”
Many of the plant’s workers took Trump’s words literally, according to David Green, who served as the local UAW president during Trump’s term in office.
Seventeen months later, GM announced that the plant would be idled. Employees who wanted to hold on to their pensions would be required to relocate to other GM facilities. Houses were sold. Many moved. Others were forced to commute each week to the new locations, leaving their families to do so.
Trump railed against the GM leadership on Twitter and urged some kind of deal to reopen the plant.
But Green said his letters to the White House pleading for help were ignored – at least until he appeared on Fox News to make his case.
Trump was watching.
Shortly after, he fired off a tweet aimed squarely at Green.
“Democrat UAW Local 1112 President David Green ought to get his act together and produce,” the president wrote. “G.M. let our Country down, but other much better car companies are coming into the U.S. in droves. I want action on Lordstown fast. Stop complaining and get the job done!”
It was a heady moment for Green, who like so many others had followed his father onto the GM Lordstown factory floor and had spent his whole career there until the plant closed.
“I ignored it because my mama told me, ‘Don’t give it any credibility, and it goes nowhere,’” Green said. “The reality is my daughter got bullied over that. And I didn’t know until just a couple of years ago when she told me. She was a senior in high school, and kids were blaming me and mad at her and bullying her.”
Trump then eagerly touted the start-up Lordstown Motors as the savior he was instrumental in delivering.
He dispatched his vice president, Mike Pence, to tour the facility in 2020 with cameras in tow.
A few months before that fall’s election, Trump held a major promotional event on the South Lawn of the White House, flanked by prototypes of what the company pledged would be the first all-electric commercial pickup truck.
“The area was devastated when General Motors moved out, and then we worked together, and we made the deal on the plant,” Trump said as he stood beside the company’s chief executive.
The company would go on to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy three years later.
The executive who stood beside Trump would eventually settle with federal regulators over claims that he misled investors about demand for the first all-electric commercial pickup truck. He did not admit any wrongdoing.
Ultium breaks ground
Given the past several years, there was an understandable skepticism in the community when the new joint venture between GM and South Korea’s LG started construction on its planned electric vehicle battery manufacturing plant, which opened in 2022.
Standing inside that plant this summer, Josh Ayers was candid about when he came to believe what the future could hold.
“Probably when they actually broke ground. I mean, honestly,” Ayers said. When Ayers left the GM plant and his hometown, he never expected to find an opportunity to return to either.
“This gives people in the Valley another chance,” Ayers said as he ticked through the reasons people from here so deeply value the community, from friends and family to the familiar (and highly recommended) local restaurants such as Wedgewood Pizza and the Hot Dog Shoppe.
That Ayers was standing inside a cutting-edge technological plant like Ultium was one thing.
That he was standing next to Kareem Maine, the plant director who for many months had sat across from him during intense negotiations over the plant’s union contract, was another.
The ratification of their agreement in June marked just the latest critical development inside a plant that in many ways has laid the groundwork for an expanding industry.
“It’s easy to get caught up in the day-to-day like you look around, but you really have to take the time, step back and say, ‘Hey, we accomplished a lot in a short period of time,’” Maine said.
Those accomplishments have been closely watched by the current Oval Office inhabitant, who was quick to congratulate Ayers and his team after the agreement.
“Five years ago, the previous administration made false promises to Lordstown workers – and then stood by as the community lost jobs and faced economic devastation,” President Joe Biden said in a statement. “Today, Lordstown is a comeback story and it didn’t happen by accident.”
The Ultium plant started production just two weeks after Biden signed into law a sweeping clean energy investment package.
A record of results
The Biden administration has utilized its major legislative wins to bolster Ultium’s efforts to the tune of billions of dollars in grants and funding assistance.
Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are also unapologetically pro-union, with Biden regularly touting his view that he’s the most “pro-union president in history.”
“I agree with that,” Green said.
While UAW leaders, both national and local, pressed Biden and Harris for more aggressive action on the union’s behalf throughout the past several years of negotiations, their role in the eventual results drove emphatic national endorsements.
And the results are real, bolstering UAW President Shawn Fain’s strike strategy that led to a historic agreement with the Big Three automakers.
But it was the Ultium plant’s inclusion in that agreement – once viewed as a nonstarter in the negotiations – that was truly game-changing here in Northeast Ohio.
In total, wages for the plant’s workers were nearly doubled over the length of the agreement.
Safety standards that would serve as the barometer for all future agreements were locked in.
Most importantly, the GM Lordstown employees who were forced to transfer in 2019 had a clear path back home.
“I teared up quite a few times having these conversations with my brothers and sisters that I used to work with here in Lordstown,” said Goranitis, who started with GM out of high school and spearheaded the organizing effort at the new plant. “They never thought it was going to happen.”
Fain was given a prime speaking slot at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where the story of Lordstown was elevated.
The UAW endorsed Harris and aggressively pushed out video of her appearance on the picket line as a senator and Democratic presidential hopeful in 2019 and her support of unions.
But on the ground here, that record of results hasn’t had a dramatic effect with rank-and-file workers.
“A lot of the members that I do speak with, they say at the time that Trump was in office that just our economy at that time, the jobs were better at that time and businesses were booming,” Goranitis said.
Goranitis, thrust into a leadership position after his efforts over the last few years, is now grappling with the complexities many in UAW leadership are confronting in the months before Election Day.
He won’t tell his members how to vote, but he is trying to explain his view that Harris and Democrats have been better for his members. The results here are, at least on their face, clear-cut.
And yet.
“It’s a hard time right now, right? Because, you know, the unions have always backed Democrats,” Goranitis said. “Always have. And it does look like it’s starting to take a turning point.”",2024-09-25
CNN,Analysis: It’s been 17 days without a speaker. Here’s what needs to happen in the House | CNN Politics,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.
It’s been 17 days since eight Republicans were able to bounce former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy from the top position in Congress and hit pause on all legislative business on Capitol Hill.
Having moved on from McCarthy and his No. 2, Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the third Republican choice, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, failed again Friday to perform the magic trick of uniting nearly every Republican behind him to get a House majority and reopen the chamber.
Jordan, by the way, was once labeled by a Republican former speaker as among a group of “political terrorists” for the way he thought they worked to tear apart Washington.
If Jordan ultimately can’t get enough Republican votes, some Republicans could join with some Democrats behind a separate option – giving interim Speaker Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina temporary power to pass legislation.
Here’s a look at what we know and what we can expect:
Why does it matter that there’s no speaker?
The House is essentially paralyzed until someone is chosen to preside over it.
A placeholder, McHenry, has the power to bring the chamber to order. But no legislation can pass until this is resolved. No government funding bills. No policy bills. To the extent that Congress is meant to address problems with legislation, that is not happening.
What legislation needs to pass and when?
First and foremost, the government essentially runs out of money in less than a month, on November 17. A speaker will need to be involved in negotiations with the White House and the Senate, both of which are controlled by Democrats.
There is momentum for a bill to give further aid to Israel after it was attacked by Hamas this month. And Ukraine is said to be running out of munitions, although support has dropped in Congress for continued aid to Kyiv.
President Joe Biden has asked Congress for a $105 billion package that will include aid for Ukraine and Israel.
What happened to the last speaker?
McCarthy was one of the shortest-serving speakers in US history. In order to get the job in January, he agreed to give any single Republican member the power to call for a vote to “vacate” him from the top spot.
That was his undoing. Far-right members were frustrated that McCarthy relied on Democrats to pass a short-term spending bill and avoid a government shutdown late last month.
McCarthy’s replacement will now have a month to tackle the larger problem of a yearlong spending bill before the government again faces the prospect of a funding lapse.
Does Jordan have momentum?
Jordan, the chairman of the House Judiciary, was chosen last week as the Republican nominee to be speaker. He got the support of a majority of Republicans in a secret ballot vote but not enough to become speaker. He’s lost three separate votes before the full House.
He can only afford to lose three GOP votes on the floor, but opposition to him appears to be growing, not shrinking.
Why is Jordan controversial?
A founder of the far-right Freedom Caucus, Jordan made his name as somewhat of a flamethrower on Capitol Hill. A 2020 election skeptic, Jordan was among former President Donald Trump’s most vocal defenders in Congress, fealty Trump rewarded with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in his final days in office.
That such a conservative lawmaker would be elevated to the top spot in the House speaks volumes about how the GOP has evolved in the age of Trump. Jordan earned Trump’s endorsement earlier this month when it was a two-way race with Scalise.
Jordan has also faced scrutiny over his position as assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University at the time that a team doctor, Richard Strauss, was sexually abusing male students. Some of the abused have publicly argued Jordan heard and ignored their complaints in the 1990s. The Ohio Republican has vehemently denied any wrongdoing or knowledge of the abuse. CNN reported on the issue in 2020.
Who once said Jordan was one of the ‘political terrorists’?
Jordan is among the conservative members whom one former speaker, retired Rep. John Boehner, described as “political terrorists” in his memoir.
“I just never saw a guy who spent more time tearing things apart – never building anything, never putting anything together,” Boehner told CBS News of Jordan in 2021.
Jordan told CNN’s Manu Raju he can unite the party.
“I think we are a conservative-center-right party. I think I’m the guy who can help unite that. My politics are entirely consistent with where conservatives and Republicans are across the country,” he said.
Jordan has used his position as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee to begin investigations into special counsel Jack Smith and Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who are both prosecuting Trump.
What is the math?
There are 221 Republicans and 212 Democrats in the House. Subtracting two vacant seats plus any absences from the normal total of 435 members means 217 or potentially fewer is the current threshold for a majority.
Democrats are unified behind their leader, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York.
What happens if no candidate gets a majority?
They vote again. And again. And again, until either one candidate gets a majority or there is a recess.
If this sounds familiar that’s because it took McCarthy 15 rounds of voting and multiple days to build a majority of Republicans in January.
What happens during the vote?
The clerk of the House will gavel in the chamber and call a quorum. Democrats will place Jeffries’ name into nomination, and Republicans will nominate Jordan.
Then the clerk will call the roll and each member will state the name of the person whom they are voting for. If no one amasses a majority of votes cast, it goes to a second ballot.
Are members required to vote for either Jeffries or Jordan?
There’s no rule that the speaker is a House member. Members can vote for anyone, and they can protest by skipping the vote or voting “present.” The vast majority will vote for their party’s leader.
Is there an alternative to Jordan for Republicans?
Not at the moment, but it’s important to note that Jordan is far from their first choice. All but eight Republicans had backed keeping McCarthy, but because Republicans’ majority is so small, he lost his job.
Then, Republicans nominated Scalise, the House majority leader. But Scalise was far from a universal choice, and rather than work to change the minds of his doubters by horse-trading for their votes, the Louisiana Republican withdrew his name from contention.
Anyone will face a difficult task in unifying a party that includes far-right members such as Rep. Matt Gaetz, the Florida Republican who engineered McCarthy’s ouster, as well as 18 members who represent districts that would have voted for Biden in 2020 under redrawn lines.
Will Republicans revisit the ‘motion to vacate’ rule?
It was McCarthy’s decision to give any Republican the power to call for a vote to remove the speaker at any time. There are voices in both parties who want to see that power controlled. A majority could change the rules Republicans adopted in January.
Jordan has not taken an official position but made clear the first order of business is selecting a speaker. They can revisit whether a speaker should be removed at a later date.
What about the temporary speaker option?
This makes a lot of sense to a lot of moderates. Giving McHenry power until the end of November or the end of the year would allow lawmakers to pass government funding bills and give Republicans a chance to figure out who their leader should be.
Democrats have indicated they are open to helping the plan get the majority vote it would need. But details can be difficult. Many Republicans oppose the perception of working with Democrats in a sort-of coalition government. Democrats have not entirely endorsed the plan.
It’s been 100 years
In the 200-plus years since the first two-year Congress met in 1789, such floor fights have occurred just 15 times, according to the House historian.
All but two of those multi-ballot speaker elections took place before the Civil War as the two-party system was evolving. Back then, floor fights were routine.
Until it took McCarthy 15 ballots in January, a floor fight had taken place only once since the Civil War, exactly 100 years ago, when it took nine ballots for Rep. Frederick Gillett of Massachusetts to be elected speaker in 1923.
The epic record for a floor fight
In 1855 and 1856, it took 133 separate votes for Rep. Nathaniel Banks of Massachusetts to be elected, again by a plurality and not a majority.
The process stretched over more than a month and included a sort of inquisition on the House floor of the three contenders, who answered questions about their view of the expansion of slavery. Read more from the House historian’s website.
It’s also interesting to read about Banks; his official House biography notes he was elected to office as a Republican, an independent, a member of the America Party and as a Democrat.

CNN,US makes final ceasefire push before election but doubts progress will be made in Gaza before next US president is known | CNN Politics,"American officials remain doubtful a final diplomatic push in the Middle East this week will result in a pause in fighting in Gaza before Tuesday’s US presidential election, according to people familiar with the thinking, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu waits to see who the next American president will be.
Hopes for progress in ending the fighting in Lebanon are slightly higher, and the country’s prime minister on Thursday voiced optimism that a deal to bring an end to cross-border violence between Israel and Hezbollah could be in the final stages.
“We are doing our best and are optimistic that within the next few hours or days we will have a ceasefire,” Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said Wednesday in an interview with Lebanese media outlet Al Jadeed.
Any progress at lowering temperatures in the region will be considered a win inside the White House. Still, the sense that Netanyahu is waiting out the US campaign season – a long-held view inside the Biden administration – remains strong as top envoys travel in the region to discuss prospects of bringing the violence to an end.
CIA Director Bill Burns was in Cairo on Thursday for discussions on Gaza and Lebanon, including a meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah El-Sisi.
At the same time, US envoy Amos Hochstein and White House Middle East Coordinator Brett McGurk are in Israel for talks on hostage and ceasefire issues along with a discussion of Iran, all centered on the US policy of “de-escalation backed by deterrence.”
Hopes for striking a deal to end the fighting across the Israel-Lebanon border have been freshly bolstered by progress in the talks over the past several days, and Hochstein was expected to continue the talks this week.
On Thursday, Netanyahu told Hochstein and McGurk that Israel must have the ability to enforce a potential ceasefire agreement in Lebanon to thwart threats from the country.
“Prime Minister Netanyahu made it clear that the main point is not this or that agreement on paper, but Israel’s ability and determination to enforce the agreement and thwart any threat to its security from Lebanon, in a manner that will return our residents securely to their homes,” the statement said.
The US envoys also met Israeli defense minister Yoav Gallant to discuss “security arrangements” related to northern Israel, Lebanon and the return of hostages from Gaza.
But with the conclusion of a razor-thin US election in sight, there is little expectation the final drive toward concluding the war in Gaza will result in immediate success.
That makes it likely the war in Gaza will continue shadowing the US contest in its final days. On Wednesday evening, a few minutes into Vice President Kamala Harris’ speech in Madison, a few disruptions broke out inside the arena, which was filled with many students from the nearby University of Wisconsin-Madison.
“Ceasefire now!” one protester shouted.
“We all want the war in Gaza to end and get the hostages out,” Harris said, adding that she would do “everything in my power” to bring the Middle East conflict to a close.
As a few more protesters echoed in the crowd, she added sharply: “Everyone has the right to be heard, but right now I am speaking.”
The scene, which has been repeated at Harris rallies throughout her abbreviated campaign, demonstrates the political liability the Middle East has become for the Democratic candidate.
Harris almost always points back to the necessity of a ceasefire, even as the talks to secure one stalled.
This week, American officials heading to the Middle East hope to make one final push toward resolving the conflicts before the election, but they are realistic about the likelihood of major breakthroughs.
In Cairo, Burns was expected to continue discussing a new proposal raised in recent days by the United States, Israel and Qatar involving a monthlong ceasefire in Gaza in exchange for the release of some hostages.
After months of stop-and-go negotiations, American officials remain cautiously hopeful the new proposal can shake loose the stalled talks, particularly after the death of Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.
But a number of details are still outstanding, according to people familiar with the talks, including the number and breakdown of hostages and Palestinian prisoners who would be released as part of the agreement.
The temporary truce would be shorter than the six-week first phase that was previously being discussed before talks last fell apart, two sources familiar with the talks said. Qatari negotiators, who, along with Egypt, are the main interlocutors with Hamas, are currently discussing the limited proposal with Hamas, one of the sources said.
And there is continued pessimism that Hamas will agree to any new plan that doesn’t include a permanent ceasefire. Hamas wants “confirmation that there is Israeli approval on any plan that is presented to them,” a diplomat familiar with the discussions said.
On Sunday, Burns was in Doha to meet with Israel’s Mossad Director David Barnea and Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman al Thani in an attempt to revive the ceasefire discussions following Sinwar’s death, which US officials have argued should be a turning point in the Gaza war.
In Lebanon, where Israel has been waging a major operation against Hezbollah, American officials hope to arrange a diplomatic solution to end the violence.
After a conversation Thursday with Hochstein ahead of his visit to the region, Lebanon’s Mikati said he felt optimistic for a potential Hezbollah-Israel ceasefire to be struck “within the next few hours or days.”
Israel and the White House had earlier downplayed a reported ceasefire draft proposal to address the Israel-Hezbollah conflict that had been circulating in regional media outlets.
“There are many reports and drafts circulating. None reflect the current state of negotiations,” the Israeli prime minister’s office said in a statement to CNN.
The White House offered the same message; National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett said purported drafts shared online do not reflect the current state of ceasefire talks.

CNN,More anti-Trump statues are popping up across US. Anonymous artist attached to the project says there could be more | CNN Politics,"It started with a bronze replica of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s desk on the National Mall in Washington, DC – topped with a basketball-sized poop. Now, anti-Trump statues are popping up in more US cities.
The latest appeared in Philadelphia’s Maja Park Wednesday morning, where someone positioned a roughly eight-foot statue of Donald Trump directly behind a sculpture of a nude woman. A plaque below – titled “In honor of a lifetime of sexual assault” – quotes the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape leaked in 2016, when Trump could be heard discussing sexually assaulting women.
“I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait,” the plaque reads. “And when you’re a star they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.”
That sculpture didn’t last long. Philadelphia city crews removed it around noon Wednesday after they were notified of its appearance because the artists did not have a permit, according to Laura Griffith, deputy director of the association for public art.
A seemingly identical Trump statue popped up in downtown Portland, Oregon, last weekend. That one was quickly beheaded and vandalized, with a Portland city council candidate and Trump supporter filming video of himself chiseling away at the plaque. The destroyed statue vanished Monday morning.
CNN received a call Thursday morning from a man who claims he’s spearheading this political art project. The man, insisting he remain anonymous to keep the focus on the art, tells CNN he’s working with a small group. “It’s not huge. Just a few people,” he said. And their message is all about “resistance fatigue.”
“The most shocking things about Trump, as a president and as a candidate, as a person, are so ingrained in our memory, are so distant that they aren’t shocking anymore,” the anonymous man told CNN. “We put these up because we want to remind people that these are important things, and they should inform a decision-making process.”
On Monday, a bronze statue of a tiki torch appeared in DC’s Freedom Plaza, just a couple of blocks from the White House.
The statue, called “The Donald J. Trump Enduring Flame,” appears to mock the former president’s defense of the marchers who attended a White nationalist rally in 2017 that left a woman dead.
“This monument pays tribute to President Donald Trump and the ‘very fine people’ he boldly stood to defend when they marched in Charlottesville, Virginia,” a plaque below it reads. “While many have called them white supremacists and neo-Nazis, President Trump’s voice rang out above the rest to remind all that they were ‘treated absolutely unfairly.’ This monument stands as an everlasting reminder of that bold proclamation.”
A vandal demolished the tiki torch statue Wednesday, and its remnants were hauled away by the team responsible for the art.
The United States Park Police arrested a man on Wednesday for destruction of property and possession of cocaine, according to a public information officer with USPP.
While the artist – or artists – behind the statues have been a mystery for days, a largely redacted permit approved by the National Park Service shows Civic Crafted LLC and Julia Jimenez-Pyzik requested and received permission to display the statues in Washington, DC.
The anonymous artist says Jimenez-Pyzik only helped the group apply for permits – and she’s now being hounded with inquiries as more statues mysteriously appear.
The only statue still standing is the original – the replica of Pelosi’s desk – though it’s also been hit by vandals. In recent days, someone ripped Pelosi’s nameplate off the piece, though it’s since been replaced.
The man would not say whether more statues could pop up before Election Day. “There are still a few days before the election,” he said. “So it’s possible.”",2024-10-31
CNN,"Appeals court upholds January 6 obstruction prosecution, in a ruling that could bolster case against Trump | CNN Politics","A federal appeals court has upheld the Justice Department’s ability to prosecute January 6, 2021, rioters with an obstruction charge, in a new opinion that is likely to bolster prosecutors’ criminal case against former President Donald Trump on the same charge.
The decision, issued Friday, means prosecutors can use the law that criminalizes obstructing an official proceeding as they seek to bring to justice rioters who disrupted the congressional certification of the 2020 presidential election.
The three-judge panel of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals split 2-1 in the decision.
Trump is scheduled to go to trial in his federal election subversion case in March. His attorneys are arguing to have the case against him dismissed.
The appeals court ruled in the case of Thomas Robertson, a former police sergeant from southern Virginia who was convicted for taking part in the US Capitol riot. Robertson had asked the courts to examine the use of the obstruction law in relation to the riot.
Robertson went into the Capitol after then-President Trump’s speech on the Ellipse, and he hit a police officer with a stick. Robertson was later found guilty of obstruction.
The mob violence at the Capitol complex prompted Congress to evacuate the House and Senate chambers, pausing their certification of Joe Biden’s Electoral College win – a development that is a key factor of the DOJ’s obstruction cases against rioters.
Robertson argued in court that he shouldn’t face the obstruction charge because he hadn’t been acting corruptly, as the law requires. He also argued the law was too vague and was unconstitutional.
But the Friday ruling solidifies that his conviction and others like it can stand. In Robertson’s case, the court found he had broken the law in multiple ways, making it clear he acted corruptly.
“Where a defendant acts feloniously to obstruct a proceeding before the Congress, with no evidence or argument that he was merely engaged in peaceful expression, his culpability – i.e., the ‘corruptness’ of his actions – is not difficult to discern,” Judge Florence Pan of the DC Circuit wrote in the opinion.
Judge Nina Pillard agreed with the decision, while Judge Karen Henderson dissented.
Trump is separately charged under the same obstruction law and has pleaded not guilty. Trump is not personally accused of violence, as many rioters like Robertson were, and instead is accused of exploiting the Capitol riot as to derail the presidential transfer of power.",2023-10-20

Who, what, when and where? It can be valuable to take a step back from the day-to-day news and look with a wider lens at the election playing out.
Here are answers to some more general questions that can get lost at the end of the campaign.
When is Election Day?
US law requires a presidential election every four years. These general elections, since 1845, are required to occur on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. This year, that date is November 5.
States oversee their own elections, which means polling times vary from state to state. The first polls close on Election Day at 6 p.m. ET in some counties in Indiana and Kentucky, and the last polls close at 1 a.m. ET Wednesday, November 6, in Alaska. Waves of state polls close every hour in between. But many millions of Americans will vote early in person or by mail.
Get information about your state in CNN’s Voter Handbook.
Why does Election Day last more than one day?
Each state conducts their election a little bit differently. Some, like in Washington state, Oregon and Utah, are done almost entirely by mail, a process that stretches for weeks.
Every state has some form of early voting available, which opens the process to people who can’t get to the polls on Election Day and ensures as many people cast ballots as possible.
Who are the candidates this year?
The Democrat is Vice President Kamala Harris, who is on the ballot with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her vice presidential running mate.
The Republican is former President Donald Trump, who is running this year with Sen. JD Vance of Ohio.
There are other candidates, and the options vary by state. The Libertarian Party’s Chase Oliver is on most ballots, and the Green Party’s Jill Stein is an option in most states as well. The former Democrat Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is also on the ballot in many states. He had been running as an independent but has since endorsed Trump.
That said, the vast majority of Americans will vote for either Harris or Trump.
Why are Trump and Harris the main options?
The two major parties, Republicans and Democrats, each held primary elections across the country earlier in the year.
Despite the fact that many Republicans repudiated Trump after his supporters stormed the Capitol building following his loss in the 2020 election, the former president easily emerged from a crowded field of primary candidates to be the GOP nominee again this year. It’s the third straight election where Trump is the Republican nominee.
For Democrats, President Joe Biden dominated the primaries and faced only token opposition. But after the primary season, concerns about Biden’s age – he’s 81 – accelerated. After CNN hosted a debate in June in which Biden fared poorly against Trump, the president bowed to pressure and dropped out of the race before Democrats held their nominating convention.
Biden’s endorsement of Harris, his vice president, helped make her the consensus nominee despite the fact that she did not take part in primaries. No Democrats rose to challenge her at the convention in August.
When will we know who won?
It could take a while. CNN did not project a winner in 2020 until four days after Election Day. Multiple states were decided by incredibly close margins that year.
In 2016, Hillary Clinton conceded the day after Election Day even though counting was still happening in multiple states. She acknowledged she would not win.
Trump is unlikely ever to acknowledge defeat. If there are close margins in key states, it could take days to determine a winner. The good news is that many states have made changes since 2020 to make it easier for election officials to get a head start on processing mail-in ballots, which take longer to count.
In 2000, one of the closest elections in US history, the winner was not apparent until 36 days after the election when the US Supreme Court ended recounts in Florida. Things were complicated that year by flawed paper ballots in some Florida counties, something that should not be a problem this year.
It could also end up not being that close of an election at all, and networks like CNN could project a winner on election night. We shall see.
What are the main issues?
One overriding issue is the cost of living. Prices spiked after the Covid-19 pandemic, and Trump has capitalized on a nostalgia people have for a time when the cost of groceries was lower. His plan to impose across-the-board tariffs on foreign goods might spike prices further, according to economists, but he has an advantage over Harris on the economy, according to polling.
Trump voters are also motivated by immigration. He would deport millions of migrants who crossed the border illegally, and he would all but shut down the US border.
For Harris voters, the issue of abortion is key. After the Supreme Court, with a third of justices appointed by Trump, overturned Roe v. Wade, Harris has framed reproductive rights as matter of personal freedom and has pledged to protect those rights.
There are ballot initiatives in key states to enshrine abortion rights. The issue is helping drive a gender gap in the vote, according to polling.
There is also the key issue of democracy. Trump was accused by the Justice Department of election interference after he tried to overturn the 2020 election results. That’s a nonstarter for many Democrats. Republicans, meanwhile, have largely grown to accept Trump’s role in the effort to keep Biden from the White House after he won in 2020. And many of them, after years of Trump questioning the system, now doubt the 2020 results themselves.
Trump was convicted on felony charges in New York related to hush money payments before the 2016 election. His sentencing is set for late November, meaning it will be after Election Day. However, his felony convictions, or even the possibility of jail time, don’t make Trump ineligible to serve as president.
How is a president elected in the US?
More than 150 million people are likely to cast ballots for the office of president on or before Election Day. But it’s 538 electors who will choose the president in a process that snakes through December and January.
When voters cast ballots, they are actually selecting a slate of electors tied to the candidate who wins the popular vote in each state.
The electors will then cast votes for president and vice president in each state’s capitol on December 17. That meeting is also known as the Electoral College, and it’s required in the Constitution.
Those electoral votes will be counted in the chamber of the House of Representatives on January 6, 2025, with the new Congress looking on.
The new president takes office on January 20, 2025.
How many electoral votes does each state get?
The number is tied to the size of a state’s congressional delegation, with one electoral vote for each senator and member of Congress.
The smallest states – Alaska, Delaware, the two Dakotas, Vermont and Wyoming – each get three.
With each additional member of Congress, a state gets one more elector. The most populous states are California (54 electoral votes), Texas (40 electoral votes) and Florida (30 electoral votes).
These numbers can change every 10 years because the Constitution requires an official population count, or census, and the number of congressional seats is then reapportioned. The most recent census occurred in 2020, so the number of electoral votes has changed.
Voters in Washington, DC, also get three electoral votes thanks to the 23rd Amendment, but they have no voting representation in the House or Senate. Other US citizens who don’t live in a state, like Puerto Ricans, aren’t so lucky when it comes to electoral votes.
How many electoral votes are there, and how many does it take to win the White House?
There are 538 electors. That figure is equal to 100 senators and 435 members of Congress, plus three votes for Washington, DC.
A majority of electoral votes is 270. Winning the White House is a mapping exercise for presidential candidates. They must pair the states that are safely in their column with enough battleground states to get to 270.
What are the battleground states in 2024?
There are thought to be seven states that could conceivably be won by either candidate. As a result, the campaigns have focused their energy in these areas. They can be broken up into two general categories.
3 Midwestern battlegrounds, aka “the blue wall” – These are the manufacturing and union-heavy states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. They used to be more reliably Democratic but have shifted in recent years as their populations have changed and as Trump has appealed to White voters without a college degree.
When Trump won the White House in 2016, he won all three. When Biden won in 2020, he won all three. If Harris wins all three this year, she will likely have the electoral votes to be president. But polls suggest close races in all three. Turnout will be key, which for Harris means appealing to suburban women and Black voters. All three states have urban centers.
The blue wall states usually vote the same way. The last time they did not all go to the same candidate was in 1988 – notably also a year when California was red and West Virginia was blue. In those eight elections since 1988, the only time the blue wall states went to a Republican was in 2016, when they were won by Trump.
4 Sun Belt battlegrounds – These states with growing populations include Arizona and Nevada in the West and North Carolina and Georgia in the East. Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina used to be more reliably Republican. Trump won North Carolina twice, but the margins were close in 2020. The last Democrat to win there was Barack Obama in 2008. Biden was the first Democrat to win Georgia since Bill Clinton in 1992 and Arizona since Clinton in 1996.
1 vote in Nebraska is a battleground – 48 states award their electoral votes winner-take-all to the victor in their state. Nebraska and Maine do it differently, awarding votes by congressional district. The state of Nebraska is safe Trump territory, but the congressional district around Omaha is a battleground. That one vote could end up being very important in the event of a close race in the Electoral College.
Note: It’s the reverse situation in Maine, the only other state that does not award all of its electors to the statewide winner. Trump could pick up a single electoral vote in Maine.
What if there’s a tie?
The total number of electoral votes, 538, is an even number, which means a tie is conceivable. It’s happened once before, in 1800, although the rules were a bit different then. If no candidate reaches the 270 votes needed to win the election, the new Congress would pick the president and the Senate would pick the vice president in what’s known as a “contingent election.”
Each of the 50 states would get one vote (sorry, Washington, DC). Republicans currently control more House delegations. Even if they lose the overall House majority in November, Republicans would still probably control more than half of the congressional delegations. Delegations in which there’s an even split between Republicans and Democrats (currently there are two) would not be counted.
Bottom line: An Electoral College tie would likely result in a Trump presidency.
In the Senate, it’s a simpler process. Each senator would get one vote to select the vice president. Democrats have a slim majority at the moment, but they are defending more seats on Election Day and there’s a good chance Republicans will control the Senate come January.
How are members of Congress elected, and why is the balance of power key?
Every two years, every seat in the House, all 435 of them, is up for grabs. Most of those seats are relatively safe for either Republicans or Democrats, but there is always the possibility that the majority changes hands.
Democrats are favored in 208 races and Republicans are favored in 212, according to preelection House race ratings from Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. With just 15 races listed as toss-ups, it’s likely that neither party will have a very large majority next year.
Changes in the balance of power have actually happened more in recent elections. This year, Republicans are heading into the election with a small majority, and it’s entirely possible that Democrats win their own small majority for the next House even if they lose the White House and control of the Senate.
It’s important for either party to control the House. Presidents need control to enact their priorities. The out-of-power party wants control to block the president’s priorities. In an ideal world, the two sides would work together to find consensus on issues like immigration and the tax code.
How do things work in the Senate?
It’s a little bit different in the Senate, where only a third of the seats are up for grabs every two years. Democrats are on defense as they try to defend their slim Senate majority.
Of the 34 seats for which there is an election this year, Democrats are defending 20 and Republicans are defending 13. Two of those Democratic seats, in West Virginia and Montana, are likely to be won by Republicans, according to the Senate race ratings. Another one, in Ohio, is rated as a toss-up.
Democrats hope they can pick up an unexpected win in either Texas or Florida, but Republicans are on pace to have a slim majority in the Senate next year. Assuming Republicans hold all of the seats they currently hold, they can control the chamber if they flip one Democratic seat and win the White House (the vice president breaks ties in the Senate) or win two seats regardless of the outcome of the presidential race.
No matter who has control of the Senate, neither party is expected to have a supermajority. That’s important because senators generally abide by a custom of respecting the filibuster. It usually requires 60 votes to enact major pieces of legislation, although both Republicans and Democrats have found ways around that in recent years.
Republicans found a way to enact tax cuts under Trump without 60 votes. Democrats did the same thing with their Inflation Reduction Act, which, among other things, aims to transition the US to a greener economy.",2024-10-29
CNN,What the polls have told us about the 2024 election | CNN Politics,"Election polls can’t foretell who will win the presidential election. They’re inherently imprecise. They carry the potential for error.
All that being the case, polls this year have found plenty that’s meaningful about how voters think about politics in 2024 – from Americans’ broad-ranging pessimism about the political landscape to the deep divide in values between supporters of Donald Trump and Kamala Harris.
As a rule, polling provides a snapshot of opinions, rather than a prediction about how people may act in the future – whether that’s how they’ll eventually vote or any other decisions they might make. That’s especially true of this election, with surveys showing no clear leader in the presidential race, either nationally or in the septet of swing states likely to prove decisive to the outcome. And although most surveys suggest a tight race, a more decisive victory for either candidate remains well within the realm of possibility.
“Shifts of a single point can be consequential to the outcome but are beyond the ability of most polls to capture with any precision,” Patrick Murray, the director of the Monmouth University poll, wrote last week.
But throughout the year, polling data has helped to capture the contours of the 2024 race, with several findings that fall well outside the margin of error. The election is playing out against a fundamentally bleak backdrop: The share of voters who say things in the US are going badly is higher than in any pre-election poll since 2008, and President Joe Biden’s approval rating has remained consistently and significantly underwater. At the same time, to an unusual extent, the earliest days of the race were largely a referendum on Trump, rather than the incumbent. That dynamic shifted somewhat when Biden was replaced on the ticket by Harris, touching off an immediate surge in Democratic motivation.
While the results of issue polls can sometimes vary based on framing, some results have been remarkably robust. Americans continue to be broadly opposed to the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe vs. Wade, with opposition consistently registering above 60% in CNN polling over the past two years. Other issues show deep political divides: In CNN polling this fall, Trump supporters were 46 percentage points likelier than Harris supporters to say that growing diversity poses a threat to American culture, which coincided with the Trump campaign’s increasing reliance on anti-migrant rhetoric.
Here are more findings from the polls about this year’s election:
Which issues matter to which voters?
Economic issues rate more prominently for voters than they have in any presidential election since the Great Recession, a Gallup poll released in October found, with concerns about democracy also scoring high this year.
Thinking an issue is important, of course, doesn’t necessarily imply a vote solely on that basis, but top-issue polling gives a sense of which concerns and campaign themes are resonating most with different parts of the electorate. The Gallup poll, notably, found a stark partisan divide, with no overlap between the top five issues for Republican and Republican-leaning voters and Democrats and Democratic leaners. Among GOP-aligned voters, the top-ranking issues are the economy, immigration, terrorism and national security, crime and taxes; among Democratic-aligned voters, they are democracy in the US, Supreme Court justices, abortion, health care and education.
How Trump and Harris supporters differ in their visions for America
Partisan divides on the issues run further than priorities.
A Pew Research Center report released this summer catalogued the differences between each candidates’ supporters “on issues that have divided Americans for decades, such as the role of guns in society, race and the legacy of slavery.” Harris supporters were more than 50 points likelier than Trump supporters to say that the legacy of slavery continues to have a significant impact on Black people in America today and that “America’s openness to people from all over the world is essential to who we are as a nation.”
Trump supporters were more than 40 points likelier than Harris supporters to say that gun ownership increases safety and that the criminal justice system in the country is insufficiently tough.
Which campaign news is breaking through?
For much of the general election, a polling project called The Breakthrough, asked Americans a simple question – what have they seen, heard, or read lately about each of the candidates?
In the last weeks of the campaign, Harris’ media appearances and Trump’s rallies got a lot of attention. And though no single topic has proved as dominant throughout the election as the pandemic was in 2020, the words “liar” and “lies” have consistently shown up prominently in the public conversation around Trump.
The Breakthrough findings have also helped chart the tumultuous final days of the Biden campaign, the battle to frame Harris as a candidate and the way that Trump’s September debate performance helped to elevate fringe false claims about migrants to the national stage.
Polling data is a single, imperfect gauge of people’s opinions – which may not always be morally, or even factually, correct. But polls of the US, ultimately, are a means of talking to Americans across a wide range of demographics, life experiences and views, on topics that stretch far beyond elections, or even politics. In a deeply fragmented society, and with social media often reflecting an unrepresentative sample of the loudest voices, they’re still a valuable tool for understanding the country as a whole.",2024-11-01
CNN,Nebraska’s high court says people with felony records can register to vote | CNN Politics,"Nebraska’s top election official had no authority to declare unconstitutional a state law that restored the voting rights of those who have been convicted of a felony, the state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday in a decision with implications for the approaching election.
In July, Secretary of State Bob Evnen ordered county election officials to reject the voter registrations of those with felony convictions, citing an opinion issued by Attorney General Mike Hilgers. That opinion, which Evnen had requested, deemed as unconstitutional a law passed this year by the Legislature immediately restoring the voting rights of people who have completed the terms of their felony sentences.
Evnen’s order could have kept 7,000 or more Nebraska residents from voting in the upcoming election, the American Civil Liberties Union said. Many of them reside in Nebraska’s Omaha-centered 2nd Congressional District, where both the race for president and Congress could be in play.
In an otherwise reliably Republican state that, unlike most others, splits its electoral votes, the district has twice awarded an electoral vote to Democratic presidential candidates — once to Barack Obama in 2008 and again to Joe Biden in 2020. In a presidential race shown by polling to be a dead heat, a single electoral vote could determine who wins.
Given the Omaha district’s history, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and Democratic groups have spent millions in the district in the hopes of securing the electoral vote — far more than former President Donald Trump and Republican groups.
The last day to register to vote for the 2024 general election in Nebraska is October 25 and must be done in person at a voter’s county election commission office. Election Day is November 5.
Hilgers′ opinion had said the new law violates the state constitution’s separation of powers, saying only the state Board of Pardons under the control of the executive branch can restore voting rights through pardons.
Pardons are exceedingly rare in Nebraska. Evnen, Hilgers and Gov. Jim Pillen make up the three-member Board of Pardons. All three are Republicans.
The opinion also found unconstitutional a 2005 state law that restored the voting rights of people with felony convictions two years after they complete the terms of their sentences.
The ACLU is representing advocacy group Civic Nebraska and two Nebraska residents, a Republican and an independent, who would be denied the right to vote under Evnen’s directive. Because Evnen’s move came only weeks ahead of the November election, the ACLU asked to take the lawsuit directly to the Nebraska Supreme Court, and the high court agreed.
Restoring the voting rights of former felons has drawn national attention in recent years. In Florida, lawmakers weakened a 2018 voter-approved constitutional amendment to restore the voting rights of most convicted felons. Following that, an election police unit championed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis arrested 20 former felons. Several of them said they were confused by the arrests because they had been allowed to register to vote.
In Tennessee, lawmakers killed a bipartisan bill this year that would have let residents convicted of felonies apply to vote again without also restoring their gun rights.
Dozens of states allow people living with felony convictions to vote, either for those not currently in prison or upon completion of their sentences. Two states, Maine and Vermont, allow everyone, even those in prison, to vote. But despite a recent trend toward restoration of rights, felony disenfranchisement laws prevent around 5.85 million people across the country from voting, according to the ACLU.
Felony disenfranchisement laws date to the Jim Crow era and mainly targeted Black people, according to experts. Black registered voters have an overwhelmingly positive view of Harris, according to a recent poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",2024-10-16

CNN,These are the House Republicans running for speaker | CNN Politics,"The high-stakes race for the House speakership entered a new phase Tuesday evening, with a slate of more Republicans vying for the gavel after Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer withdrew his bid just hours after winning the GOP conference’s nomination.
The party is under intensifying pressure to find a new leader, though it remains increasingly unclear whether any Republican can get the 217 votes needed to win the gavel on the House floor.
After Emmer’s abrupt exit, the conference pivoted toward finding a new nominee, with five candidates in the running.
Members will cast a successive series of secret ballots, and the candidate who garners the fewest number of votes in each round will be dropped from the running. The winning candidate will still need a majority of the conference behind them, meaning that it’s possible the race for speaker might not be fully settled at the end of the conference meeting.
Here are the Republican lawmakers vying for the speakership:
Rep. Byron Donalds
The Freedom Caucus member from Florida, who’s among the few Black Republicans in Congress, first announced on X that he would seek the speakership to advance a “conservative vision for the House of Representatives and the American people.”
Donalds received votes from the GOP’s far-right members in January’s speaker marathon as a protest to Kevin McCarthy, who ultimately clinched the speakership after 15-rounds of voting but was ousted earlier this month.
Donalds is serving his second term, winning his first election to Congress in 2020 after GOP Rep. Francis Rooney vacated Florida’s 19th Congressional District. The Florida State University graduate worked in the banking, finance, and insurance industries before being elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2016, according to his office.
Rep. Chuck Fleischmann
The Tennessee Republican was first elected to Congress in 2010.
A University of Tennessee law school graduate, he sits on the House Appropriations Committee, where he chairs the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee, and serves on the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.
Fleischmann previously supported Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan for speaker.
Rep. Mark Green
The Tennessee Republican has been in Congress since 2019. He chairs the Homeland Security Committee and also sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee.
A veteran and ER doctor, Green was a Tennessee state senator before winning his election to the House of Representatives.
Rep. Mike Johnson
The Louisiana Republican, who serves as the House GOP conference vice chairman, first announced a run for speaker in a letter to his colleagues over the weekend, saying, “After much prayer and deliberation, I am stepping forward now.”
Johnson was first elected to the House in 2016 and serves as a deputy whip for the House GOP. He was previously chairman of the Republican Study Committee, and sits on the Judiciary Committee, Select Committee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, and on the Armed Services Committee.
Rep. Kevin Hern, an Oklahoma Republican who chairs the influential Republican Study Committee, dropped out of the race for speaker Tuesday evening and backed Johnson.
“I want everyone to know this race has gotten to the point where it’s gotten crazy. This is more about people right now than it should be,” he said. “This should be about America and America’s greatness. For that, I stepped aside and threw all my support behind Mike Johnson. I think he’d make a great speaker.”
Rep. Roger Williams
The Texas Republican was first elected in 2012 and previously supported former speaker nominee Jordan.
Williams is the chairman of the Small Business Committee and serves on the Financial Services Committee.
Williams had previously said that he wouldn’t launch a bid for the speaker’s gavel. In an October 21 statement posted to social media, he said that it “wasn’t the right time” to run for the position.

CNN,Analysis: How the ‘uniparty’ myth shut the House down | CNN Politics,"A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.
Republicans’ House speaker morass continued Tuesday with a little help from former President Donald Trump.
Yet another lawmaker with support from most House Republicans – Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, who was picked as their party’s nominee – failed to get the support of nearly all Republicans. He dropped out of the running Tuesday afternoon, leaving Republicans again back at square one. Late Tuesday, the GOP conference selected a fourth nominee, Rep. Mike Johnson, who faces a floor vote Wednesday.
Emmer, who supports military aid to Ukraine and who voted to certify the 2020 election, saw his chances fade in the most bizarre possible way hours after being picked.
Trump lobbied against Emmer with a social media post that hit while Emmer was trying to convince a few dozen skeptics on Capitol Hill and Trump was inside a New York courtroom facing civil fraud charges. Trump later told reporters outside the courtroom, “It looks like he’s finished.”
After one fired speaker and three failed candidates who got majority but not universal support, no one seems currently capable of uniting their tiny House majority – and the idea of getting help from Democrats remains, for now, unthinkable to both Republicans and Democrats.
A picture of parties divided
It’s a situation that highlights not only Republican divisions, but also the bright line between Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill.
But it’s important to note that it was born of a fringe protest meant to demonstrate there’s no difference at all between the two parties.
What is ‘uniparty?’
The term “uniparty” has been a favorite of people like Steve Bannon, the former Trump White House official turned podcaster. He’s been using it for years in conjunction with the similarly cynical idea of Washington as a swamp that needs to be drained or the belief in a deep state that needs to be rooted out.
Bannon’s goal is to mobilize support for dismantling the current version of the US government.
The term also features prominently in the more-conservative-than-Fox-News media environment – networks like One America News, known as OAN, and Salem Radio.
‘Guerilla war’
“Right now, we are governed by a uniparty,” Rep. Matt Gaetz, the Florida Republican, told the former Trump administration official Sebastian Gorka in a September interview on the right-wing Salem News Channel in which he argued then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy was in cahoots with President Joe Biden and the Democratic leader, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York. Gaetz posted the interview on his official House website.
“You’ve got a small band of House conservatives who are fighting, really, in a lot of ways, a political guerrilla war against that uniparty,” Gaetz said. In early October, it was Gaetz who moved to successfully oust McCarthy from the speakership.
The parties actually have very different priorities
It’s indisputable that government spending has ballooned in recent years and reasonably arguable that it is out of control. But blaming a perceived “uniparty” is oversimplified nonsense.
Republicans under Trump passed a tax cut bill all by themselves. Democrats under Biden passed a spending bill without help from Republicans.
Reforming costly programs seems impossible because the two parties rarely work together, not because they secretly collude.
If there is a uniparty, where is its speaker?
Multiple Republicans who supported McCarthy have argued Democrats are to blame for the current lack of a speaker because they did not break party ranks and support McCarthy.
There has been no substantive movement toward a unity speaker of some sort, although it is becoming hard to imagine any Republican getting enough support to become speaker without help from some Democrats.
The current math is that any Republican can lose the support of only four party comrades and become speaker without Democratic help.
Next funding deadline is November 17
Another lawmaker who voted to oust McCarthy is Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, who argued back in September that allowing the government to run out of money would not be that bad.
“Don’t let the DC uniparty scare you into thinking that a government shutdown is the end of the world,” Biggs said on social media in September, before McCarthy used Democratic votes to pass a funding bill.
This is a line of thinking that will get more attention, perhaps, when the government again faces a funding lapse November 17.
RELATED: The last time the government faced a funding lapse, just last month, CNN documented how a government shutdown could impact Americans.
Any potential speaker must find a way to both get the support of people like Gaetz and figure out how to fund the government in a little more than three weeks.
Emmer’s downfall is yet another cautionary tale. The majority of House Republicans backed Emmer, their fourth choice this year to be speaker, in both secret ballot voting and a behind-closed-doors roll call vote.
He had been working to convince holdouts when the post opposing him hit Trump’s social media account. For the fringe of the party, counts against Emmer include that he is a supporter of additional funding for Ukraine to repel Russia’s invasion. Foreign aid is a chief target of those who believe there is a uniparty.
A quarter of Americans don’t feel represented by any party
Politico noted back in 2017 that the term has roots on the American left, in the rhetoric of Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate turned Green Party presidential candidate.
While there is not much polling on the idea of a uniparty, there is a lot of polling about the two main political parties.
In a Pew Research Center survey published in September, just 10% of Americans said they saw “hardly any” difference between the parties. A larger portion of the country – 25% – does not feel either party represents the interests of people like them, but that sentiment is held by roughly equal shares of Republicans and Democrats.
Similarly, about a quarter of both Republican and Republican-leaning voters and Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters do not feel well-represented by their parties.
Interestingly, despite gripes about a uniparty by the Republican fringe, Republicans are less likely than Democrats to express an interest in more party choices, according to Pew’s survey.",2023-10-24
CNN,Analysis: Trump’s White House would mainstream vaccine skepticism as confidence drops among Republicans | CNN Politics,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.
Anyone who doubts that a second Trump term would take vaccine skepticism into the mainstream of American government and life should watch Kaitlan Collins’ interview on CNN Wednesday with the co-chair of Donald Trump’s presidential transition team, Howard Lutnick.
On the one hand, Lutnick disputed the vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s recent assertion to supporters that he would be in charge of the US Department of Health and Human Services if Trump is elected.
On the other hand, Lutnick sounded convinced, after spending a few hours with Kennedy this week, that the government is hiding something about vaccines.
When Collins noted that neither of them are doctors but that vaccines have been shown to be safe and effective, Lutnick asked, “Why do you think vaccines are safe?”
Collins told him that kids get them and they’re fine.
“Why do you think they’re fine?” Lutnick asked. He pointed to the disproven theory that vaccines cause autism and said, quoting Kennedy, that the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is blocking data about vaccines.
“(Kennedy) wants the data, so he can say these things are unsafe,” Lutnick told Collins. “He says, ‘If you give me the data, all I want is the data, and I’ll take on the data and show that it’s not safe.’ And then if you pull the product liability, the companies will yank these vaccines right off, off of the market. So, that’s his point. He’s not trying to do anything, but things that made sense.”
Regarding Kennedy’s goal. If it is as Lutnick says, it seems that Kennedy is interested in opening up a wave of vaccine lawsuits to get manufacturers to yank vaccines.
Regarding liability. Congress responded to a wave of lawsuits related to vaccines in 1986 to create the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, which is intended to compensate the extremely small portion of the population that develops adverse reactions to vaccines. The program, which is funded by an excise tax on recommended vaccines, has paid more than $4.5 billion to around 9,500 people since 1988, according to the Department of Justice. Vaccine manufacturers can be sued for injury in state court.
Regarding the allegation of “blocked” data. What are Kennedy and Lutnick talking about? It’s not at all clear.
Kennedy’s Make America Healthy Again PAC directed me to a spokesman for his shuttered presidential campaign, which has not returned a request for comment.
Lutnick tried to moderate his position in a post to X after the CNN interview, saying he does support vaccines, but he also wants to respect people who don’t – and he repeated that there is data the government is blocking.
“We would be doing everyone a service if the government respected Bobby Kennedy’s request to make the full data available,” Lutnick wrote on X.
When I asked the CDC for quick comment on this story about whether there is “blocked” data, they noted it’s a difficult subject to address and wanted a specific example to respond to. Lutnick clearly didn’t have specifics. But he’s an investment banker, not a medical researcher.
Jerome Adams, who was US surgeon general under Trump, said Kennedy should not get a senior role in a Trump administration.
“Bottom line: It’s hard to implement your other political priorities if you’re busy dealing with a measles or polio outbreak,” he told The Washington Post.
Ultimately, the CDC offered this statement from a spokesman:
What does the government do to review vaccine safety?
The system by which the ongoing safety of vaccines is monitored is multilayered and complicated.
It involves a government-run reporting system, the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, which is essentially a tip line where anyone can make a claim, for any reason. Those complaints are searchable, including by the public, but they aren’t vetted, and reports may have nothing at all to do with a vaccine dose. The searchable data is also nonspecific.
The CDC also maintains the Vaccine Safety Data Link, a collaborative effort between the CDC and health care organizations like Kaiser Permanente, and the data has been used in many studies. Sharing specific information about some of these cases publicly could violate privacy laws.
The CDC is also involved with the Clinical Immunization Safety Assessment Project, which coordinates a nationwide network of experts and also conducts vaccine safety research.
The point is not that any of these things is perfect, but rather that there is a lot of work that goes into assessing the safety of vaccines with help from government agencies on an ongoing basis.
There are also independent organizations like the Institute for Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins University.
Drop in faith in vaccines
But while the system satisfies the medical community, it is increasingly not satisfying the public, a phenomenon that was turbocharged by the Covid-19 pandemic and related vaccines, as well as recent politics.
Whereas in 2001, 94% of Americans said that parents getting their children vaccinated was extremely or very important, that figure has dropped to 69%. It’s still a strong majority, but it hides a remarkable partisan shift, according to long-term polling by Gallup.
In the years since the pandemic, the portion of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents who say it is extremely important for parents to get their children vaccinated has fallen from 52% in 2019 to 26% in 2024. A strong majority of Democrats and Democratic leaners, 63%, still say childhood vaccination is extremely important.
Dr. Daniel Salmon, director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety, wrote with colleagues for the New England Journal of Medicine this year that more needs to be done to maintain public faith in vaccines. They noted that extremely rare adverse reactions “no longer seem rare when vaccines are given to millions or billions of people.”
They recommended taking excess money from the VICP, the fund for people who have adverse reactions, to more robustly fund safety research and help build up public trust in vaccines. They also recommended a holistic, independent review of the vaccine safety system.",2024-10-31
CNN,‘Change is necessary’: Coast Guard pledges reforms after mishandling reports of sexual assault | CNN Politics,"The US Coast Guard, rocked by allegations that its leaders for years concealed damning information about sexual assaults and other serious misconduct, released a highly critical report Wednesday acknowledging it had “failed to keep our people safe,” while vowing to make reforms that would better protect them.
After spending 90 days speaking with hundreds of service members, reading through more than 170 written comments and “sifting through a mountain of data,” an internal review team said it had heard a resounding message from the workforce that “these failures and lack of accountability are entirely unacceptable” and that leaders “must do something about it.”
“Too many Coast Guard members are not experiencing the safe, empowering workplace they expect and deserve (and) trust in Coast Guard leadership is eroding,” the authors wrote in the roughly 100-page report, noting that they had heard from victims of sexual assault and harassment stretching from the 1960s to the current day who “expressed deep rooted feelings of pain and a loss of trust in the organization.”
The scathing internal review was launched after CNN exposed a secret criminal investigation, dubbed Operation Fouled Anchor, which found that serious misconduct had been ignored and, at times, covered up by high-ranking officials. It wasn’t until CNN started asking questions about Fouled Anchor this spring that Coast Guard leaders rushed to officially brief Congress on the scandal — leading to outrage on both sides of the aisle, multiple government investigations and proposed legislation.
CNN’s coverage of Fouled Anchor and subsequent reporting revealing that Coast Guard leaders declined to prosecute a retired officer for sexual misconduct “have led people to experience feelings ranging from disappointment to outrage,” the report said.
“For so many victims, there are even deeper levels of broken trust: in leaders who failed them in preventing and responding to sexual violence; in a military justice system with antiquated legal definitions of rape; in non-existent support programs for those impacted prior to 2000,” it stated. While the report outlined a number of changes made in the last two decades, it also acknowledged that reforms to date have not been enough to prevent assaults and properly support victims.
The review did not seek to hold past perpetrators or officials involved with the Fouled Anchor cover-up accountable, saying multiple government investigations launched by Congress remained ongoing.
Instead, it looked to the future and focused on preventing future assaults and other misconduct, describing the report as a “road map aimed at improving” the agency’s culture.
Along with the report’s findings, the Coast Guard announced a series of actions directed by the agency’s leader, Commandant Linda Fagan, through recommended changes to everything from training and victim support services to strengthening processes for holding perpetrators accountable.
“This report acknowledges the Coast Guard’s failures and uses them to inform a way ahead, rebuild trust, and set the baseline for organizational growth,” the document states, noting that many of the actions require additional funding and authority to implement.
Among the reforms are the creation of a mentorship program for victims to help them navigate the aftermath of a sexual assault, the development of a “safe to report” policy so that victims are not penalized for collateral minor misconduct (such as alcohol use at the time of an incident), more secure locks on Coast Guard Academy bedrooms and improved oversight of the school and its cadets – including a new chain of command for the academy head.
Fagan also directed officials to better keep tabs on the academy’s hallmark “Swab Summer” training program, which is run by upperclassmen at the academy, and to consider strengthening policies that allow the agency to reduce pension payments for those found to have committed misconduct.
The report was the Coast Guard’s most expansive response to the growing criticism of its handling of misconduct. And while it was being released publicly, and members of Congress had been briefed on its contents earlier, the report was specifically addressed to “U.S. Coast Guard workforce, past and present.”
“You made it clear that you want and expect our Service to confront this issue and make it better. You want our Service to deliver meaningful change,” the report stated. “Whether you’re a member who has a story to share — or the shipmate standing beside them — this is our time. Let’s get it right.”
While the Coast Guard is focused on the future, members of Congress are still determined to get answers about past failures as well.
“This new report still does not hold anyone accountable for past failures—particularly those at the Coast Guard Academy,” said Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, where the Coast Guard Academy is located. Murphy and other lawmakers have continued to slam the agency for its failure to be transparent about sexual assault and other misconduct. “It does lay out a modest plan to improve oversight, training, and support for survivors, but a report is nothing more than paper until concrete steps are taken.”
Democratic Senators Maria Cantwell and Richard Blumenthal also criticized how, despite calling this effort an “accountability” review, the Coast Guard still failed to hold anyone to task for the mishandling of sexual assault cases. Cantwell reiterated the importance of an independent investigation, saying she is looking forward to seeing the results of the probe currently being conducted by the Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General.
Earlier this year, CNN reported how former Commandant Karl Schultz and his second-in-command, Vice Commandant Charles Ray, failed to act on plans to share the findings of Fouled Anchor with Congress and the public. Ray resigned from his position at a Coast Guard Academy leadership institute soon after, but no other current or former Coast Guard officials have publicly faced any consequences.
“Current Coast Guard personnel are being told to trust their leadership, but their leaders aren’t holding predecessors accountable,” K. Denise Rucker Krepp, a former Coast Guard officer and former chief counsel of the Maritime Administration wrote in a recent letter to Congress, describing how she had attended a “community healing” event sponsored by the Coast Guard Academy Alumni Association last month.
“Before my first cup of coffee I learned about a woman who was raped shortly after joining the service. She never told her parents about the crime,” she wrote. “While washing my hands in the bathroom, another woman shared that she was raped while attending the Coast Guard Academy in the late 1990s. Another woman shared that she was gang-raped by three students at the school and had spent two-thirds of her life on medication because of the crimes that occurred almost 40 years ago.”
Next week, more survivors of sexual assault and harassment at the Coast Guard Academy are slated to share their experiences publicly in a Congressional hearing. The hearing, announced just yesterday, is part of an ongoing Senate probe launched in reaction to the Fouled Anchor cover-up.

CNN,Virginia city’s preelection fight over certification shows how local procedures have become a flashpoint | CNN Politics,"A lawsuit from two Republican officials in Waynesboro, Virginia, that threatened not to certify the 2024 election results attracted a counter lawsuit Monday from voters in the Shenandoah Valley city who are seeking a court order that would force the board to formalize the results.
The dispute — in which the Republican officials on the Waynesboro Board of Elections are demanding a hand-count of ballots before they certify the 2024 results — is just the latest example of how local certification procedures have become a hot spot for unsubstantiated election fraud claims since former President Donald Trump’s attempts to overturn his 2020 loss.
The Virginia lawsuits stand out, however, for how the local officials are threatening to not formalize the results — potentially gumming up the works for certifying the entire state vote — well before the final ballot has been cast.
The two Republican officials, election board Chair Curtis Lilly and Vice Chair Scott Mares filed their lawsuit on October 4 in the Waynesboro Circuit Court against state elections officials, alleging that the voting machines used in Virginia are unverifiable and could potentially be manipulated.
In response, five Waynesboro voters filed their own lawsuit against the local officials, asking that the Circuit Court step in to protect their rights “under the Virginia constitution to have their votes counted and certified.”
The voters alleged the GOP officials’ lawsuit was an “effort to spread distrust of voting machines, the use of which is expressly permitted by the Virginia Constitution.”
In their initial suit, the Waynesboro officials said there was “no way to ensure that the [voting] machine does not connect to the internet or present results inconsistent with the content of the ballot box.” They claimed in affidavits that, because they could not certify that “votes have been counted and apportioned correctly by voting machines,” they would “refuse to certify the 2024 election until such time as the legal regime permits for hand-counting ballots.”
Lilly and Mares are two of three Waynesboro election board members in a Republican-leaning city where the majority of votes went for Trump in 2020. Waynesboro is about 30 miles west of Charlottesville, Virginia.
The new lawsuit from the Waynesboro voters alleged, citing a news report, that one of the GOP officials got the idea to file a lawsuit from the attorney who is now representing them. That lawyer, Thomas Ranieri, said in a statement Tuesday that his clients “want to ensure that all voters’ votes are safely cast and accurately counted, which is something they cannot verify at the present.”
“This case is not primarily about machines or removing voters; it is primarily about whether my clients can verify an election’s integrity in good conscience and under their oath without making sure that the votes represented on the returns are true and accurate,” Ranieri said in the statement, adding that the officials would submit to what the court decides but that they would appeal any decisions they disagree with.
A spokesperson for the Virginia State Board of Elections did not reply to CNN’s inquiry. The office of state Attorney General Jason Miyares, a Republican, said it does not comment on ongoing litigation.
While the dispute arises from a rural county in a state not seen as a key battleground in the presidential race, it shows how the once unheralded processes of election administration have become flashpoints in the fallout from 2020 election subversion schemes.
During that election, officials in Wayne County, Michigan, briefly balked at certifying the results in that jurisdiction, which includes the heavily Democratic Detroit, amid a relentless campaign by Trump to claim without proof that the election was rife with fraud. The officials eventually formalized the vote count.
“Certifying elections has not been an issue in the past. It has historically been a formality that marks the end of the vote-counting process,” Lauren Miller Karalunas, a senior counsel at the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s law school, told CNN. “But in 2020, that changed when we saw refusals to certify the results after the election. This is an escalation of that, where we are seeing threats of refusal to certify an election even before the election has occurred.”
Elections since have featured similar, albeit less high-profile, local squabbles over certification. The refusal by Republican officials in Cochise County, Arizona, to certify the 2022 midterms by the legal deadline resulted in criminal charges, with one of the two charged officials entering a guilty plea this week in the case and the other set to face trial next month.
Fights over the certification of election results have already become a hallmark of the 2024 contest, with battleground Georgia contending with a growing legal drama over new state election rules that Democrats say could allow local officials to delay or decline altogether certification of this year’s results.
The officials in the key presidential states targeted in Trump’s 2020 gambits have been preparing strategies to head off local-level certification fights.

CNN,Supreme Court to consider conservative effort to block federal power and a challenge to ‘qualified immunity’ for police officers | CNN Politics,"The Supreme Court on Friday added another case to its docket that asks the justices to overturn decades-old precedent to scale back the power of federal agencies, as well as a case that looks at “qualified immunity” for police officers.
The new case is a companion to a similar dispute involving herring fishermen that the justices have already agreed to hear his term. Although the court did not explain its thinking, it likely added the new case because Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson is recused from the first case, having dealt with it as a lower court judge before her elevation to the high court.
The pair of cases represents a conservative attack on the so-called administrative state.
For decades, conservatives have argued that federal agencies are unaccountable to the public and have become too powerful in violation of the separation of powers. How the court decides the two cases could change the way the government tackles such issues as climate change, immigration, labor conditions and public health.
At issue in both appeals are herring fishermen in the Atlantic who say the National Marine Fisheries Service does not have the authority to require them to pay the salaries of government monitors who ride aboard the fishing vessels to make sure federal regulations are being followed.
In agreeing to hear the case, the justices signaled they will consider a 1984 decision – Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council – that sets forward factors to determine when courts should defer to a government agency’s interpretation of a law. First, they examine a statute to see whether Congress’ intent is clear. If it is, then the matter is settled. But if there is ambiguity, the court defers to the agency’s expertise.
The court will hear both cases, Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo and Relentless v. Department of Commerce, in January.
Qualified immunity case
The justices on Friday also agreed to hear the case of a city council member from Texas who says she was arrested in retaliation for calling for the removal of a police ally.
The case allows the court to revisit the scope of a legal doctrine called qualified immunity, which protects police officers from civil claims.
The case concerns Sylvia Gonzalez, a Castle Hills, Texas, city council member, who led an attempt to circulate a citizens’ petition to remove the city manager – an ally of the police – from office.
Gonzalez was arrested under a Texas tampering law that makes it a crime for concealing or removing a government record. She claims she inadvertently placed a copy of the document in her binder and admitted her mistake.
She spent a day in jail, handcuffed and wearing an orange jail shirt.
The district attorney dropped charges against her, and she later sued in federal court, alleging illegal retaliation in violation of the First Amendment, saying the that the city manager had engineered a plan to arrest her and remove her from office.
She argued in court papers that the tampering statute used against her was overly broad had never been used to charge someone for the “uneventful offense of putting a piece of paper in the wrong pile.”
Under normal circumstances, a person alleging retaliatory arrest must demonstrate that police had not proven probable cause to arrest her. But lawyers for Gonzalez argued that there is an exception to the rule in cases in which the law is not routinely enforced.
A district court denied qualified immunity to the officers, but Gonzalez lost her case at the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals, which held that there was probable cause to arrest her and that it “necessarily defeated” her retaliatory arrest claim.

CNN,Speaker Mike Johnson walks back comments that GOP would ‘probably’ try to repeal CHIPS Act | CNN Politics,"House Speaker Mike Johnson might have put a significant dent in the reelection hopes of one of the GOP’s most vulnerable congressional incumbents on Friday and later backtracked comments where he said he would consider repealing the CHIPS Act.
Earlier in the day at a campaign stop in Syracuse, New York, Johnson had told reporters that Republicans “probably will” try to repeal the semiconductor chip manufacturing package if they control Congress and former President Donald Trump wins the White House. The legislation is poised to bring a $100 billion microchip manufacturing center to the area where Johnson was campaigning with GOP Rep. Brandon Williams.
“As I have further explained and clarified, I fully support Micron coming to Central NY, and the CHIPS Act is not on the agenda for repeal,” Johnson later said in a statement. “To the contrary, there could be legislation to further streamline and improve the primary purpose of the bill—to eliminate its costly regulations and Green New Deal requirements.”
At the campaign event, Williams – who is facing a tough challenge from Democratic state Sen. John Mannion – had stepped in to say he would “remind (Johnson) night and day how important the CHIPS Act is” as Micron prepares to break ground on a plant in New York.
Williams said in a statement later Friday that he “spoke privately with the Speaker immediately after the event. He apologized profusely, saying he misheard the question.”
The CHIPS and Science Act was passed in 2022 and will invest more than $200 billion over a five-year period to help the US regain a leading position in semiconductor chip manufacturing. The new funding was intended to help companies bring chip manufacturing back to the US and, as a result, help lower costs and prevent supply chain disruptions.
Earlier Friday, Johnson was asked by a reporter from Citrus TV News, “The former president has said that he doesn’t support the CHIPS and Sciences Act. You voted against it. If you have a Republican majority in Congress and Trump in the White House, will you guys try to repeal that law?”
“I expect that we probably will, but we haven’t developed that part of the agenda yet,” Johnson said. “We’ve got to get over the election first and that’s why we’re so happy to be in New York’s 22nd. Brandon Williams is one of the most important races in the country and that’s why Democrats are spending millions and millions and millions of dollars to try to unseat him.”
After Williams defended the CHIPS Act, which he described as “hugely impactful here,” Johnson then said, “When you have an issue where consensus is necessary to be built, ‘cause different states have different perspectives on these things, you have to have somebody who is a strong advocate for that legislation. People listen to Brandon Williams. If that is an important thing for your district, you need this guy there to make that case.”
Johnson later said his objection to the CHIPS Act was related to other programs that were included in the bill. “We’re going to support chip manufacturing, we do not support the Green New Deal. When you separate those two things, that makes it a whole lot simpler,” he said.
Democrats immediately pounced on the gaffe. The “Kamala HQ” account on X posted video of the exchange, and Mannion commented, “Trump wants to dismantle, Johnson is in lock-step, Williams calls it corporate welfare.”
“In Congress, I’ll defend CHIPS and Science and keep the investments coming home to (Central New York) and the Mohawk Valley,” Mannion wrote.
Williams was not yet in Congress when the bill passed but criticized it on the campaign trail in 2022.",2024-11-01
CNN,The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2024 | CNN Politics,"While events on the other side of the world – and the other end of the US Capitol – have dominated recent news, the race for control of the Senate is a crucial factor in what Washington could look like after next year’s elections.
The 2024 Senate map is advantageous for Republicans as they try to pick up the one or two seats needed to flip the chamber, depending on who wins the White House next year. Members of the Senate Democratic Caucus are defending the most competitive seats – the top eight on this list of 10 seats most likely to flip – which is not likely to change ahead of November 2024.
The order of the ranking, however, is changing. (Rankings are based on CNN’s reporting, fundraising figures and historical data about how states and candidates have performed.) Pennsylvania, for example, shoots up from No. 7 in July to No. 4 this month – in large part because it’s the one battleground where Republicans aren’t facing a messy primary.
GOP candidate fields elsewhere have only grown over the past couple of months, despite the National Republican Senatorial Committee’s new policy of taking sides in primaries. Besides Pennsylvania, the national party has made its preference known for specific candidates in West Virginia, Montana, Nevada and Michigan. The NRSC is neutral in Ohio’s crowded primary and hasn’t ruled out endorsing in Arizona.
Whether engaging in primaries early on will pay off remains to be seen. So far, however, NRSC Chairman Steve Daines’ tactic of keeping Donald Trump close appears to be working, as the former president hasn’t yet endorsed against any of the campaign committee’s picks.
The GOP presidential front-runner – with his four criminal indictments – is likely to be a liability in some places next year if he is the party’s nominee. But Republicans take comfort in the fact that he won the top three states on this list handily in 2020 and red-state Democrats will have to run with an unpopular President Joe Biden atop the ticket. In an era of increasingly nationalized politics, it’s becoming harder to run for Senate in a state that voted for the opposite party’s presidential nominee. In Democrats’ favor, however, Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Jon Tester of Montana and Sherrod Brown of Ohio have succeeded at it before.
Vulnerable Democratic senators will try to distance themselves from Biden where they can or try to signal that they represent a check on the White House. For example, six of them (plus independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who caucuses with Democrats) recently joined a bipartisan call to the secretary of state to freeze $6 billion in Iranian assets after Hamas’ attack on Israel – even though the administration has made clear that the money hasn’t been touched, has strict restrictions around it and the US hasn’t found a direct link between Iran and the Hamas attack.
It’s too early to say whether current events – especially abroad – could have any impact on elections that are still over a year away, but with the GOP-led House paralyzed without a speaker and Congress being called upon to approve aid to Israel and Ukraine, the moment has underscored how congressional contests have very real consequences.
Here’s where things stand in the race for the Senate just over a year before Election Day 2024:
1. West Virginia
Incumbent: Democrat Joe Manchin
West Virginia remains the seat most likely to change party hands next year, whatever Sen. Joe Manchin does. The most conservative Democrat in the Senate – who hasn’t ruled out running as an independent for reelection or for president – Manchin isn’t expected to announce his plans until the end of this year. He raised $715,000 in the July-to-September third quarter – enough to maintain appearances that he’ll be a candidate next year. The haul is also more than what either of his major GOP opponents raised but about half a million less than his previous quarter total. (The chances of this seat flipping only go up if Manchin declines to seek a third full term.)
Even if he runs without the “D” after his name, he’ll have an uphill battle in a state Trump won by 39 points in 2020. His vulnerability is apparent in the way GOP-affiliated ads are tying him to Biden and Democratic-aligned spots are tying him to Trump. One Nation, for example, has attacked him over his support of Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, while Duty and Honor PAC has touted Manchin’s work with Trump to protect miners’ pensions.
The immediate fight, however, is the GOP primary, where Jim Justice, the popular Democrat-turned-Republican governor, has outraised Rep. Alex Mooney by about $300,000. While national Republicans and Trump are behind Justice, the Club for Growth and an allied super PAC have committed nearly $13.6 million to the House Freedom Caucus member. The club’s political arm is airing ads calling Justice a RINO, or Republican in Name Only, and trying to tie him to Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell.
2. Montana
Incumbent: Democrat Jon Tester
Sen. Jon Tester, another red-state Democrat, is no stranger to tough races. But the most pressing question is whether GOP Rep. Matt Rosendale – fresh off his vote to oust House Speaker Kevin McCarthy – decides to complicate national Republicans’ plans by mounting his own bid to avenge his 2018 loss to Tester. The NRSC likes retired Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, who already has the backing of the two other members of Montana’s congressional delegation (including Daines, the NRSC chairman) and Gov. Greg Gianforte. Sheehy, who entered the race in July, raised $2.9 million in the most recent fundraising quarter (including about $653,000 in personal money), but he’s a relative newcomer. (The Minnesota native has taken heat, for example, for saying in a Breitbart News interview that there were more bears than people in Montana.)
Rosendale, too, has out-of-state roots, and his House campaign only brought in about $335,000 during the third quarter. But as a previous statewide candidate – he was elected state auditor in 2016 and lost to Tester by about 4 points in 2018 – he starts with more built-in name recognition than Sheehy and could potentially benefit from assistance from the Club for Growth. Sheehy has been on air trying to introduce himself, leaning heavily into his military service and using ranching motifs to highlight his ties to the state. He’s also been attacking Tester for not adhering to some of the commitments in an ethics pledge he ran on during his first campaign, as CNN’s KFile reported.
An outside group called Last Best Place PAC, seemingly linked to Democrats, is attacking Sheehy – a sign Democrats may think he’d be a tougher opponent than Rosendale. Tester appears to be taking the race seriously – he raised more than $5 million in the third quarter and ended September with $13 million.
3. Ohio
Incumbent: Democrat Sherrod Brown
Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is gearing up for a tough race in a state that’s been trending red over the past decade. (He raised $5.8 million in the third quarter, ending the period with $11.2 million.) He’ll need all the money he can get if he faces one of the two self-funders vying for the GOP nomination. Both businessman Bernie Moreno and state Sen. Matt Dolan loaned their campaigns $3 million in the third quarter. Secretary of State Frank LaRose – who raised about $1 million, including $250,000 he loaned his campaign – doesn’t have the same kinds of personal resources, but he likely starts with a name ID advantage as the only statewide elected official in the GOP race. He became the public face of an August ballot effort to raise the threshold for amending the state constitution – seen as a proxy fight over an upcoming November referendum on abortion rights. LaRose admitted the measure was effectively about abortion, so the effort’s failure has been a point of attack from his primary opponents.
Trump carried Ohio twice, and his backing proved instrumental in getting now-Sen. JD Vance over the finish line in last year’s Republican primary, which also featured Dolan and, briefly, Moreno. Vance is backing Moreno in this primary, and while Trump has praised Moreno, he hasn’t made any endorsement yet. The NRSC is so far staying neutral in this race. The candidates met for their first forum last weekend, where US aid to Ukraine was a point of divergence between Moreno – who, like Vance, wants to suspend it – and Dolan, who wants it to continue. (LaRose called for making aid contingent on securing the US southern border.)
Meanwhile, Brown has been on the picket line with striking United Auto Workers – underscoring the economic populist streak that Democrats hope will allow him to defy the political tilt of his state once again.
4. Pennsylvania
Incumbent: Democrat Bob Casey
The Keystone State moves up several spots this month largely because of how uniquely settled the GOP primary is compared with other battleground states. Republicans coalesced around Dave McCormick to take on Democratic Sen. Bob Casey soon after the former hedge fund executive got into the race in late September. (State Sen. Doug Mastriano announced in May that he was passing on a bid – a major relief for national Republicans who were wary of the failed 2022 gubernatorial candidate and election denier.)
But Democrats think McCormick, who unsuccessfully sought the state’s other Senate seat last year, has his own baggage. He tried to tack to the right in an effort to secure Trump’s endorsement and the GOP nomination in the 2022 Senate primary, which could alienate some suburban Philadelphia voters in a general election. He’s also facing questions about his residency. McCormick insists that he lives in Pennsylvania but returns to Connecticut to visit his daughter, who’s still in school there and lives with his ex-wife. “And if there’s a political cost associated with that, so be it,” he recently told ABC27’s “This Week in Pennsylvania.”
Still, the combination of McCormick and his vast personal resources during a presidential year are likely to make this Casey’s most competitive Senate race yet. The three-term incumbent, who raised $3.2 million in the third quarter, has a well-known political name in the state and enjoys a 48% job approval (and 31% disapproval) rating, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released earlier this month. He led McCormick 50% to 44% among registered voters in that survey, but this race is still young.
5. Arizona
Incumbent: Independent Kyrsten Sinema
Kari Lake – who embraced election denialism and conspiracy theories in her losing 2022 gubernatorial bid – was far from Republicans’ dream Senate candidate in this emerging purple state. But the former TV anchor is going to be hard to beat in a primary given her strong connection with the GOP base. Trump endorsed her by video at her announcement rally earlier this month, and there are signs that the party establishment is trying to keep her close. “We have not ruled out endorsing Lake,” a source familiar with the NRSC’s strategy told CNN. Daines has said the national party has had “productive conversations” with Lake, who recently told The Associated Press she’d vote for McConnell for leader. She’s also picked up the backing of Senate GOP Conference Chairman John Barrasso.
But Lake still won’t admit she lost last year’s gubernatorial race and her past hard-line positions on abortion could turn off swing voters. Her candidacy represents a familiar challenge for Arizona Republicans, whose recent nominees for key offices swung right in the primary and then struggled to pivot to the general election. Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb is also running for Senate, but raised just $475,000 in the third quarter.
The race will remain unsettled, however, until Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who left the Democratic Party to become an independent last year, announces whether she’s running. Her $825,000 haul in the third quarter raised questions about her future, given that it was less than what she’s raised in the past. But Sinema still had more than $10 million in the bank as of September 30. Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, meanwhile, outraised her yet again – bringing in $3.1 million last quarter – but had about half of her cash on hand.
6. Nevada
Incumbent: Democrat Jacky Rosen
Nevada is a slightly more Democratic state than most on this list, although that’s not saying much. It voted for Biden by about 2 points, so Democrats aren’t taking Sen. Jacky Rosen’s reelection for granted. She raised $2.7 million in the third quarter, ending with $8.8 million in the bank.
National Republicans have made clear their preference for retired Army Capt. Sam Brown, an unsuccessful 2022 Senate candidate who’s trying to tie Rosen to Biden and his economic policies. But that hasn’t winnowed the GOP field. Trump’s former ambassador to Iceland, Jeff Gunter, entered the race in August and has cut an ad that refers to him as “110% pro-Trump.” Retired Air Force Lt. Col. Tony Grady, who lost a GOP primary bid for lieutenant governor last year, also jumped into the race in August. Former state Assemblyman Jim Marchant, an election denier and the losing 2022 GOP nominee for Nevada secretary of state, only raised $74,000 last quarter, compared with $1.2 million for Brown.
The primary isn’t until June, but Democrats are already seizing on what they see as vulnerabilities in Brown’s abortion positioning, including comments he made during a 2014 run for the Texas state legislature and his past work with the Nevada Faith and Freedom Coalition.
7. Wisconsin
Incumbent: Democrat Tammy Baldwin
Wisconsin slides down one spot on this list, in part because Republicans still don’t have a major candidate to take on Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin. That doesn’t mean this race won’t eventually be very competitive in a battleground presidential state that swung from Trump to Biden in 2020.
Republicans are eyeing businessman and 2012 Senate candidate Eric Hovde, who would likely have the ability to self-fund. Baldwin raised $3.1 million during the third quarter and began October with about $6.9 million in the bank. This is one of the few states where presidential performance isn’t necessarily indicative of Senate race outcomes. GOP Sen. Ron Johnson, for example, won a third term last year after Biden had carried the state, albeit by only about half a point, two years earlier.
8. Michigan
Incumbent: Democrat Debbie Stabenow (retiring)
Michigan is a bluer state than its Midwestern neighbor Wisconsin – Biden carried the Wolverine State by nearly 3 points and Democrats saw success up and down the ticket in 2022, in part because abortion was such a galvanizing issue. Democrats are now trying to ensure that retiring Sen. Debbie Stabenow’s seat remains in their hands. Much of the party has coalesced around Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who raised nearly $3 million in the third quarter, although she does face primary challenges, including from actor Hill Harper, who raised about $559,000 and kicked in about $463,000 more of his own money.
Republicans landed a prominent recruit in former Rep. Mike Rogers, who succeeded Stabenow in the House and represented an earlier version of Slotkin’s Lansing-area seat for seven terms. Rogers, who raised $824,00 in the third quarter after entering the race in September, earned immediate praise from the NRSC as the “type of candidate who can perform well with suburban Michiganders.” And although the former House Intelligence chairman may use his recent absence from elected politics as a selling point, the GOP has changed a lot since he left Congress in 2015 – especially in Michigan, where the state party has a controversial new chair.
Since entering the race, Rogers has already landed a primary challenge from former Detroit Police Chief James Craig, who was disqualified from last year’s governor’s race over signature issues. Former Rep. Peter Meijer, who has formed an exploratory committee, could still run – although the one-term congressman isn’t likely to curry much favor with the GOP base after voting to impeach Trump in 2021.
9. Texas
Incumbent: Republican Ted Cruz
Texas is a hard state for Democrats to flip – they haven’t won a statewide election here since 1994, their longest losing streak in the country. But GOP Sen. Ted Cruz makes a good villain for national Democrat donors. (See Beto O’Rourke’s massive 2018 fundraising hauls in his closer-than-expected loss to the senator.)
The question, however, is whether that grassroots Democratic opposition to Cruz can translate widely enough to deny him a third term. Democratic Rep. Colin Allred, who has already proved to be a strong fundraiser, brought in $4.7 million in the third quarter – more than Cruz’s $3.1 million. Democrats tout the former NFL player’s background as a good fit for Texas – he first won election to the House by flipping a GOP-held district in the Dallas area and has previously won support from the US Chamber of Commerce.
But although Allred already appears focused on Cruz, he’ll have to get through a crowded primary first. Among the other candidates is state Sen. Roland Guttierez, who represents Uvalde and raised $632,000 in the third quarter.
10. Florida
Incumbent: Republican Rick Scott
Former Democratic Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell announced her campaign to take on GOP Sen. Rick Scott in late August. Despite only being in the race for part of the third quarter, she narrowly outraised the first-term senator and former governor – $1.5 million to $1.4 million. Scott gave his campaign an additional $154,000 of his own money, and there’s plenty more where that came from for the wealthy former health care CEO.
Florida has been trending red in recent years – Trump carried the state by about 3 points in 2020, nearly tripling his margin from four years earlier. But each of Scott’s races for governor and Senate have been relatively close, and he’s never run in a presidential year. Democrats have targeted him over some of his more unpopular policy proposals – such as a sunset provision for all federal programs, which he later revised to exclude Social Security and Medicare after criticism from within his own party. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, for example, has been running digital ads casting Scott and Cruz as threats to popular entitlement programs.
Even with Democratic investment, though, it’s going to take a lot to flip this seat blue. The state’s senior senator, Republican Marco Rubio, won reelection last year over a high-profile Democratic opponent by 16 points.",2023-10-22
CNN,How elderly dementia patients are unwittingly fueling political campaigns,"Hundreds of elderly political donors, including those with dementia, have fallen victim to Republican and Democratic political campaigns and groups.
A single donation sparks a flurry of text messages and emails from candidates and political organizations across the country.
The messages make urgent pleas for money and look as if they are coming directly from major political candidates.
They come at an unrelenting pace, directing donors to pages that often sign them up for monthly – or even weekly – donations. Money is then drained from their bank accounts without them realizing it.
Ultimately, some of these elderly, vulnerable consumers have unwittingly given away six-figure sums – most often to Republican candidates – making them among the country’s largest grassroots political donors.
(CNN) — The 80-year-old communications engineer from Texas had saved for decades, driving around in an old car and buying clothes from thrift stores so he’d have enough money to enjoy his retirement years.
But as dementia robbed him of his reasoning abilities, he began making online political donations over and over again — eventually telling his son he believed he was part of a network of political operatives communicating with key Republican leaders. In less than two years, the man became one of the country’s largest grassroots supporters of the Republican Party, ultimately giving away nearly half a million dollars to former President Donald Trump and other candidates. Now, the savings account he spent his whole life building is practically empty.
The story of this unlikely political benefactor is one of many playing out across the country.
More than 1,000 reports filed with government agencies and consumer advocacy groups reviewed by CNN, along with an analysis of campaign finance data and interviews with dozens of contributors and their family members, show how deceptive political fundraisers have victimized hundreds of elderly Americans and misled those battling dementia or other cognitive impairments into giving away millions of dollars — far more than they ever intended. Some unintentionally joined the ranks of the top grassroots political donors in the country as they tapped into retirement savings and went into debt, contributing six-figure sums through thousands of transactions.
To provide a snapshot of who these vulnerable donors are and how much money they have lost to increasingly aggressive fundraising campaigns, reporters reached out to more than 300 of the biggest and most frequent small-dollar political donors and their family members. Through these interviews and consumer complaints, reporters collected the accounts of more than 50 unwitting elderly donors and traced the path of where their money went.
Often coming in $5 or $10 at a time, contributions from this small sampling of donors alone added up to more than $6 million over the last five years — the majority of which ended up with Trump and a long list of other Republican candidates, CNN found.
While this is a small fraction of the billions raised by political campaigns, for many of the individuals who made the donations, the sums represented huge portions of their life savings.
Deceptive fundraising tactics, including those that trick elderly donors, were exposed in the wake of the 2020 election. While studies show that older Americans tend to lean more Republican, both parties have continued to rake in donations from elderly voters. And mainstream Republican candidates have only doubled down on this strategy, using more aggressive and predatory tactics than those used by Democrats, according to donor complaints, interviews with experts and a review of solicitations. The Republican fundraising machine has been subject to more than 800 complaints to the Federal Trade Commission since 2022 — nearly seven times more than the number of complaints lodged against the other side.
“The fact there are lots of complaints means this is likely a huge problem,” said Prentiss Cox, a law professor at the University of Minnesota and former manager of consumer protection at the Minnesota Attorney General's Office, when presented with CNN’s reporting. “From a consumer protection standpoint, this raises red flag level concerns about consumer misinformation and deception.”
Donors identified by CNN were often in their 80s and 90s. They included retired public workers, house cleaners and veterans, widows living alone, nursing home residents and people who donated more money than they paid for their homes, according to records and interviews.
The money they gave came from pensions, Social Security payments and retirement savings accounts meant to last decades. Donors took out new credit cards and mortgages to pay for the contributions. In some cases, they gave away most of their life savings. Their cell phones and email inboxes were so full of pleas for money that they missed photos of their grandkids and other important messages.
At least one person continued to be charged for contributions after his death.
Donors or their families often learned of the extent of their donations from CNN reporters. The family members of some said their loved ones had also been the targets of common elder scams. Most asked CNN not to name them out of concern that they would be further victimized or ashamed.
One 82-year-old woman, who wore pajamas with holes in them because she didn’t want to spend money on new ones, didn’t realize she had given Republicans more than $350,000 while living in a 1,000 square-foot Baltimore condo since 2020.
By the time a Taiwanese immigrant from California passed away from lung cancer this year at age 80, she had given away more than $180,000 to Trump’s campaign and a litany of other Republican candidates – writing letters to candidates apologizing for not getting donations to them on time because she was going into heart surgery. She had only $250 in her bank account when she died, leaving her family scrambling to cover the cost of her funeral.
And a 78-year-old, a widow who limited showers to save on her water bill and canceled her long-term care insurance, didn’t understand why the retirement savings her husband had left her was dwindling so quickly. After CNN reached out to her family, they learned that the woman gave more than $200,000 in donations to Democratic political groups and candidates.

The federal government has gone after non-political companies for similar tactics, such as making false statements in ads or making them seem as if they were written directly to the recipient. But regulators have done little to stop fundraisers from using misleading and deceptive advertisements to target vulnerable donors. And the lawmakers who experts say would need to act to protect consumers at both the state and federal levels are the same ones benefiting from the current fundraising machines.
The biggest beneficiary of the small-dollar donations from unwitting donors identified by CNN was Donald Trump. His current and former campaigns and affiliated political committees brought in more than $400,000 from these elderly consumers between July 2019 and June 2024, which included multiple election cycles. The national committees which raise money to support House and Senate races across the nation also received hundreds of thousands of dollars from such donors, according to CNN’s analysis, and in all, the long list of Republican candidates and causes took in nearly $4 million.
A spokesperson for the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee noted that fundraising efforts over the years have varied and said Trump ads were designed to be respectful, including such language as “don’t sweat it” if donors couldn’t afford to contribute on a regular basis.
On the Democratic side, much of the money went to left-leaning political action committees known as PACs, not mainstream Democratic candidates. The Progressive Turnout Project and its affiliated group, Stop Republicans, took in the most, with roughly $150,000 coming from the vulnerable donors identified by CNN. President Joe Biden’s presidential campaign was not among the top recipients, taking in only about 10% of the $400,000 Trump brought in from those elderly donors.
Vice President Kamala Harris had not yet launched her presidential bid during the fundraising period covered in CNN’s analysis, though more recent campaign finance reports show her campaign has taken in several thousand dollars from this snapshot of donors. The Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

The fundraising operations that have solicited money from vulnerable senior citizens use either WinRed or ActBlue, two juggernaut digital platforms that unite hundreds of political groups and campaigns under a single umbrella. Each platform charges a fee of about 4% of every transaction, although WinRed is a for-profit company and ActBlue is a nonprofit. Campaign finance records show that the two groups took in more than $100 million in fees from federal campaigns and political committees in the last two years alone.
WinRed, founded by a former Trump staffer in 2019, and ActBlue, which has been around for two decades, say it is the campaigns themselves that are choosing the frequency and tenor of the pleas for donations. WinRed did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A spokesperson for ActBlue said the platform is designed to give “donors full control” over their contributions, saying donors or their families can contact their in-house support team with any concerns.
But it is the fundraising platforms that have made it easier than ever for campaigns to bring in as much money as possible from their bases. Both have boasted of record-breaking hauls this campaign cycle, with WinRed saying this summer it was processing more than 2,700 donations per minute — a jump of more than 40% from 2020.
The controversial feature that fools many donors is a pre-checked box campaigns use to automatically authorize recurring donations. Donors often don’t realize they need to uncheck that box, so while attempting to make a one-time small donation, they are unknowingly signing up for weekly or monthly recurring donations. Sometimes it takes months or years before they realize a campaign has been regularly charging their credit card or taking money out of their bank account.
While many mainstream Democratic candidates have backed away from the practice, both the Trump and Harris campaigns have recently been using donation pages with pre-checked recurring boxes to raise money, a CNN analysis of fundraising emails and Facebook and Instagram ads found.
Trump’s campaign said two of his current fundraising committees only returned to the use of pre-checked boxes in September after pausing the practice in January 2023. The spokesperson, however, did not address whether another Trump-affiliated committee still receiving donations this year had been using the tactic. Trump Campaign Senior Advisor Brian Hughes said ""we strive to be direct and transparent by informing them immediately when they have registered for recurring donations, sending a notice three days before processing, notifying them when the processing is complete, and having staff on-hand to assist with refunds and cancellations.”
Recurring donations only multiply as confirmed donors become valuable political currency — their names and contact information quickly swapped and sold. And once WinRed or ActBlue has a donor’s financial information, donations can be triggered by actions including a response to an online survey, an order of campaign merchandise or a one-word reply to a text message.
As a result, records show, some donors ended up being charged in excess of 100 times in a single day.
‘Lonely and isolated’
Richard Benjamin, an 81-year-old from Arizona, believed he had been in personal communication with former president Trump through all the messages he was receiving.
At one point, he told his children the former president invited him to a luxurious reception at Mar-a-Lago. He had grown up on a farm and worried he would feel out of his element at such a fancy venue. But when he received what he described to his children as an invitation to be a VIP at a rally in Arizona, he was thrilled he would finally meet the former president himself. He started making travel plans and asking his sister-in-law if she would like to accompany him, since his wife had passed away in 2018.
Later, he told his son how angry he was that Donald Trump Jr. wouldn't call him back even though the former president’s son had sent Benjamin so many nice messages.
“He was old, lonely and isolated,” his son, Jason Benjamin, told CNN, saying the pandemic only compounded that isolation. “’Save America, help save America,’ that was the constant message. He would get thanked for helping to save America.”
Richard Benjamin, who now lives in a memory care unit at an assisted living facility, would look forward to the emails and texts, and especially to the ones thanking him for being a true American and patriot when he donated his money. This eventually led him to give about $80,000, leaving him tens of thousands of dollars in debt and his children angry at the campaigns who they say tricked their dad and took advantage of his compromised state of mind. “He really, in his heart, believed that Donald Trump and Donald Trump Jr. and other politicians were personally reaching out to him,” Jason Benjamin said.
Richard Benjamin and his family showed CNN that he continues to be inundated with text messages and phone calls from politicians to this day. Yet he often couldn’t identify the politicians he financially supported.
“There’s no excuse for them to allow something like this to happen,” Jason Benjamin said of the campaigns behind the many solicitations. An employee from Richard Benjamin’s bank even lodged a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission about deceptive practices, saying Benjamin had never intended to donate close to the amount he did, according to FTC records.
Forensic geriatrician Kathryn Locatell said what Richard Benjamin felt each time he received a “thank you” message or made a donation is the same “dopamine hit” a lot of elderly Americans are seeking. And the solicitations are crafted in a way that intentionally suck elderly donors into their web, providing “a feeling of belonging to a thrilling, special club.”
“You and I could call these demands for money laughable but to a person who’s lost their capacity to judge reality, and who’s been soaking up all the toxic misinformation out there, on the internet and TV, it’s a perfectly coherent reality and they’re happy to join in and become a part of it,” she said. “That’s how all their money will be drained until it’s gone.”
Because the text informing donors they are enrolling in recurring donations is often so tiny, particularly on WinRed donation pages, it would be very easy for someone who isn’t actually processing what they’re reading to miss it, according to Locatell and other experts interviewed by CNN. Elderly donors who have short-term memory issues could be making one-time donations again and again, not remembering that they made a donation even an hour earlier, they added.
“These ads are a form of misleading, undue influence,” Locatell said. “One simple rule could be enacted: Ads can’t contain these pre-checked boxes; the person has to actively choose recurring donation.”
Behavioral symptoms such as getting hooked by solicitations like these and making poor financial decisions often happen in the early stages of dementia, before family members even realize their loved ones are experiencing any sort of cognitive decline.
CNN compared examples of pages donors use to make contributions to presidential candidates, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.
Some donors believe political candidates are speaking to them directly, with an ad like this one indicating that Trump requested to be their friend on social media.
Invitations to join phony boards or focus groups are another common fundraising tactic that experts told CNN are used to make people feel special and are more likely to entrap elderly donors who may have diminished reasoning abilities.
Polls like this one — with 11 questions — can rile up voters before asking them for money.
The yellow box automatically signs donors up for weekly donations, after asking if Trump can count on their “sustained support.”
The way this small text appears to be hyperlinked makes it seem like donors should click there to sign up for recurring donations. But they are actually already signed up by the pre-checked box above.
These boxes, which claim to be messages from Trump, are known as upsells. A click on both of these results in two additional donations.
Fundraising pages for the Harris campaign, like this one, are clearer than those used by Trump.
This headline tells donors they will be signing up for weekly donations.
Harris fundraising pages tend to be short and relatively simple.
Like Trump, the Harris campaign sometimes uses pre-checked boxes that automatically sign donors up for recurring donations unless they opt out.
Calls from CNN reporters asking about donations prompted some family members to rush over to their loved ones’ homes to help look through statements or to begin the long process of taking over their finances. Other families CNN spoke with said it was the unusually large number of political donations – which took precedence over expenses as important as electricity bills and taxes -- that alerted them something was wrong.
In the case of the 80-year-old retired communications engineer who gave away close to half a million dollars, one of the man’s sons discovered his savings account was nearly drained from all his donations. The son said he took him to a neurologist where he was diagnosed with dementia and spent weeks canceling credit cards and disputing charges, attempting to turn off recurring donations one by one. He ultimately received refunds from WinRed for his father’s most recent donations. Still, his father remains out roughly $300,000.
“When I found this out and started showing Dad, he was shocked, he had no idea,” his son said. “He's not a man to give anyone what he considered his life savings.”
It often falls on families to try to help their loved ones.

The daughter of an 81-year-old woman with Alzheimer’s disease told CNN that when she visited her mother at her home last month, her mom got a call from Ted Cruz’s campaign and a text with an ActBlue link within minutes of each other. She said her mother was going to donate to each before she stopped her. Her mother’s cognitive decline has gotten so bad, she said, that she believed when someone asked her for money, she needed to give it. The daughter, who lives in another city, said she has been trying to coordinate her mother’s medical care while also sorting through the credit card debt she accrued after giving away more than $100,000.
No oversight
When an elderly man discovered thousands of dollars' worth of political charges on his credit card he said he never authorized, he turned to the agency that oversees campaign donations – the Federal Election Commission – for help.
“I am an 89-year-old widower, a retired architect who lives alone,” he wrote in a 2022 complaint. He said he had been plagued by robocalls and scam mail and it appeared ActBlue was “rife with fraud.” By the time the FEC completed its investigation, he had died, collapsing ""on his way to the post office to mail postcards to voters in Texas,” according to his obituary. But the agency hadn’t planned on doing anything about his complaint anyway, writing in a response that the matter was “rated as low priority” for an enforcement action based on criteria including the severity of the allegation and the dollar amount involved.
The agency shut down another complaint made about WinRed by the daughters of an elderly woman who said their mother had lost more than $6,700 to “elder abuse” with the same boiler plate response, noting the “low dollar amount involved.”
The FEC would not comment on WinRed or ActBlue specifically but said in a 2023 report on legislative recommendations that it had been regularly hearing from donors who had signed up for recurring donations without their knowledge or consent. The report noted consumers had often attempted to cancel the donations without success before contacting agency staff for help. Agency officials said the outcry from donors ""strongly suggests that many contributors are unaware of the ‘pre-checked boxes’ and are surprised by the already completed transactions appearing on account statements."" But it said it didn’t have the authority to ban the practice, and that Congress should introduce legislation to change this — a recommendation agency officials first made after the New York Times reported on the issue in 2021.
""I'm a retired cleaning lady. I just can't believe anyone would do this to me.""
""I gave Trump $20 6 years ago that was just once. Since then I've been hounded by REPUBLICANS BEGGING FOR MONEY. On the RNC Convention day I received 77 text messages of more begging.""
""My father is elderly and isn't able to manage his finances anymore, so this went on undetected for a while until we realized that he was running out of money and didn't know why.""
""I was recently helping my 93 year old father, who suffers from a cognitive impairment, sort through a pile of mail and saw a massive fraud that someone in ActBlue is perpetrating on my father.... these fraudsters need to stop defrauding older people, especially ones with mental impairments.""
""I can't afford you taking all my Social security payments. You drained my bank account, before I can even get food or pay my bills.""
""I am distressed by what appears to be outright fraud on behalf of the Republicans.""
""I may never contribute again. You are greedy and illegally fool people into taking our money. Not American. not what I thought the party stood for.""
""My grandmother, utterly confused and frustrated by the situation has paid her bills and been draining her financial accounts... she was absolutely floored and clearly did not understand the gravity of the deception.""
Dan Weiner, director of the Brennan Center’s Elections & Government Program, said federal campaign finance law is primarily intended to police political corruption but offers few protections for donors. He said seeking recurring donations “from someone who is not of sound mind” is “unscrupulous behavior [that] falls into a legal gray area.”
The Federal Trade Commission criticized pre-checked boxes in a 2022 staff report as an example of a “trick” and “psychological tactic” used by retailers and direct marketers “to get consumers to part with their money.” But the agency — which enforces laws governing deceptive advertising, among other regulations — told CNN it did not have jurisdiction over ads used by political campaigns, or over the operations of WinRed and ActBlue, despite fielding hundreds of complaints from consumers.
Currently, pre-checked boxes for recurring donations are allowed in almost every state despite widespread condemnation of the practice from consumer advocates. Federal legislation introduced in recent years that would have prevented their use died in committee without gaining traction.
And while four Democratic attorneys general have been investigating the fundraising tactics of WinRed and ActBlue, no action has been taken to date. A number of Republican lawmakers have specifically targeted ActBlue with investigations after right-wing influencers claimed the large volume of transactions from some donors suggested money laundering. CNN has found no evidence of money laundering, instead finding that many elderly donors simply didn’t realize how much they were giving.
Individual complaints made to state attorneys general around the country, meanwhile, have not resulted in any apparent action taken against the fundraising platforms or campaigns, according to records obtained by CNN. And in what some donors and experts have pointed to as a potential conflict of interest, the same attorneys general receiving complaints about these platforms have also used WinRed and ActBlue for their own fundraising efforts.
Making it stop
In Utah, a 69-year-old woman, who had a tube surgically placed in her brain to drain fluid from it and had such severe dementia that she required around-the-clock home care, donated nearly $20,000 to Republican candidates in less than four months.
WinRed continued to charge her even after the attorney overseeing her financial affairs informed the company of her condition and sent a cease-and-desist letter. He filed a lawsuit in 2021 against the platform, which remains ongoing. But it still took a year to make the donations stop. Just seven days after she made her last donation to the Republicans, public records show that more donations were charged to her accounts. This time, to a political group supporting Democrats.

filed a complaint about
WinRed to the Florida
attorney general
Matthew Hurtt, the chairman of Virginia-based Arlington County Republican Committee, said he has fielded more than 200 calls and emails from frustrated donors located all over the country. Many of them are elderly donors who say they have struggled to stop their recurring contributions and receive refunds. Hurtt is not affiliated with WinRed, but said he receives the angry inquiries because WinRed is registered in Arlington, so charges made through the platform can sometimes show up with “Arlington” on credit card statements.
Hurtt, like other experts, told CNN he believes such aggressive fundraising tactics are short-sighted and will turn off voters in the long run.
“We don't have to trick people into giving money to our candidates and to our causes,” Hurtt said. “Any platform that tricks older donors into giving money unwittingly seems like a scheme to me.”
Both WinRed and ActBlue have said they notify donors of each recurring contribution and have guides on their websites explaining how donors or their families can request refunds and cancel recurring donations.
ActBlue told CNN it has trained its customer service staff to be on the lookout for those donors who use keywords that indicate confusion or cognitive issues and escalate them to a higher level of service. The platform said this situation is rare and that employees do what they can to accommodate refunds beyond the standard 90-day refund window.
WinRed’s website meanwhile says it “is happy to refund any donation made in error,” but notes that it can only provide refunds for those contributions made in the last 60 days.
Some of the candidates and PACs who CNN identified as receiving the most money from elderly, unwitting donors said they try to work with contributors to refund mistaken donations.
But many of those interviewed by CNN said it was hard to determine which campaigns to contact, especially since donations were often spread out among hundreds of groups. They usually contacted WinRed or ActBlue instead and found the process confusing, difficult and frequently unsuccessful.
In the case of WinRed specifically, many said they couldn’t even figure out how to reach a representative on the phone. One frustrated son who filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office told CNN he resorted to tracking down a company intern he found on LinkedIn in the hopes of finally turning off his mother’s recurring donations. He said she had lost more than $20,000 and that after contacting WinRed and even cancelling her debit card, she continued to be charged.
In Washington state, meanwhile, WinRed was quick to dismiss an 80-year-old woman’s plea for the state to investigate the platform for “senior abuse” -- saying the woman had agreed to the company’s terms of use, which make clear it provides refunds only as required by law. By the time she had filed her complaint, her money was long gone. It was up to her to reach out to the campaigns for any refunds.
“With all due respect,” WinRed’s attorney wrote, “there is nothing here to investigate.”
How CNN reported this story
CNN reviewed Federal Election Commission reports on hundreds of millions of contributions made through WinRed and ActBlue, the main donation platforms for Republican and Democratic campaigns. Reporters identified the top small-dollar donors who also gave the most frequently on each platform in recent years, and then reached out to more than 150 of those top donors and their family members for each platform.
Based on these interviews, as well as an analysis of hundreds of consumer complaints submitted to the Federal Trade Commission and state Attorneys General, reporters identified more than 50 elderly donors who gave more than they intended, many of whom suffered from cognitive decline or dementia. Reporters also reviewed complaints lodged on consumer advocacy websites TrustPilot.com and PissedConsumer.com.
Reporters reviewed data on donations made by those vulnerable donors reported in WinRed and ActBlue’s FEC filings over five years, from July 2019 through the end of June 2024. The donation amounts reported in the story do not include any refunds the donors later received, which were typically only a small fraction of the total they had given.
To identify ads with pre-checked recurring donation boxes, reporters downloaded data on fundraising ads on Facebook and Instagram from Meta’s Ad Library, and also reviewed fundraising emails sent by Trump and Harris’ campaigns provided by the Archive of Political Emails, which collects emails from numerous campaigns.",2024-10-22
CNN,Redistricting battles have mostly ended. Here’s how they could determine the balance of power in the US House | CNN Politics,"Multiple Supreme Court showdowns. Closed-door negotiations. And millions of dollars in litigation.
After months of legal and legislative skirmishes around the country, much of the redistricting drama of the 2024 election cycle is behind us. And it has ended pretty close to where it began: Just a handful of seats could determine which party controls the US House of Representatives, where Republicans now hold a threadbare majority.
In North Carolina, newly empowered GOP state legislators took an aggressive approach with their map-drawing, crafting lines that are expected to allow their party to flip at least three seats now held by Democrats. But, in recently concluded redistricting in New York, Democrats, who had final say over the map, adopted a more modest position – essentially turning just one Republican-held seat a deeper shade of blue.
In the South, Democrats are expected to gain two seats as a result of Voting Rights Act rulings out of Alabama and Louisiana. But a protracted battle over the congressional map in another Southern state, Georgia, has not changed the partisan balance of the state’s US House delegation heading into November.
“It’s amazing that with all of the states where we’ve had things going on and with all the different lawsuits, we are really only talking about a small number of districts that are guaranteed to change hands as a result of this entire shuffle,” said Nick Seabrook, a political scientist at the University of North Florida and the author of the 2022 book “One Person, One Vote: A Surprising History of Gerrymandering in America.”
“We have actually emerged nationally with a pretty fair map,” he said. “I certainly think that there are ample opportunities for either party to win.”
Adam Kincaid, the president and executive director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, sees a “tick to the right” under the new landscape, with the likely net addition of two more House seats that former President Donald Trump would have carried in 2020. But he cautioned that it was still a “tight map” and a “tight electorate.”
“From top to bottom, the country is a 50-50 country right now,” Kincaid said.
(Although Republicans control the House by a narrow margin, under the map used in the 2022 midterm elections, 17 of those GOP lawmakers were elected in communities that backed President Joe Biden in 2020.)
Democrats, meanwhile, say they emerged in a stronger position after wielding the nearly 60-year-old Voting Rights Act to prevail in legal fights in deep-red Alabama and Louisiana. Federal judges ordered lawmakers in those states to give Black residents more opportunities to elect House candidates of their choice.
“Alabama and Louisiana are just two states once thought to be unreachable in the fight for fairness that have quickly become more representative” as a result of the legal actions, John Bisognano, president of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, said in a statement. “I’m confident the House map will remain highly competitive going into 2024.”
Here’s a state-by-state look at the recent redistricting disputes and where they stand:
Louisiana
Facing a court-ordered deadline, the Republican-controlled state Legislature in January approved a map with a second Black-majority district that is expected to be in effect for this year’s elections.
The action, viewed as a win for Democrats, endangers the seat now held by Republican Rep. Garret Graves.
The implementation of the new map follows a protracted legal battle over the state’s congressional district lines.
Although Black people make up roughly a third of the state’s population, Louisiana has just one Black lawmaker – who is also the lone Democrat – in its six-member US House delegation.
A federal judge threw out the state’s Republican-drawn map in 2022, saying it likely violated the Voting Rights Act. Republican officials in the state appealed to the US Supreme Court, which put the lower-court ruling on hold until it decided the Alabama case, which it did in June this year.
Once the high court had weighed in on the Alabama case, the legal skirmishes again lurched to life in Louisiana.
A federal court had given the GOP-controlled state Legislature until the end of January to draw a new map, after deciding that the lower court had ruled correctly that the state lawmakers’ map improperly diluted the voting power of Louisiana’s Black residents.
If the Legislature had not acted by that deadline, the lower court could have proceeded to a full trial to resolve the map in time for this year’s elections. A dozen non-Black voters filed a legal challenge to the Legislature’s map, arguing it was an illegal racial gerrymander, and a three-judge panel agreed.
That set off a fresh appeal to the US Supreme Court, which on May 15 paused the panel’s ruling in an order that will likely allow the Legislature’s map to be used in this year’s elections.
New York
Republicans flipped four US House seats in New York in the 2022 midterm elections, victories that helped secure their party’s majority in the chamber.
Then, a ruling by the state’s highest court appeared to jeopardize those gains by potentially making it easier for Democrats to pick up as many as six GOP-held seats.
In the end, however, the Democratic state lawmakers, who hold ultimate control of the redistricting process, settled on a map that made only modest adjustments to the status quo lines.
First, a bit of history: A state court judge oversaw the process of drawing the map used in the 2022 elections following a long legal battle and the inability of New York’s bipartisan Independent Redistricting Commission to agree on new lines. But Democrats scored a court victory last summer when a state appellate court ruled that the redistricting commission should redraw the map.
Republicans appealed that decision, and oral arguments were held in November before New York’s Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court.
On December 12, the Court of Appeals ordered the state to once again restart the mapmaking process. As a result, New York’s redistricting commission created a new map, but the Democratic-controlled state Legislature tinkered with the commission’s lines, as permitted under state law.
The Legislature’s final product ended up putting a Central New York seat held by Republican freshman Brandon Williams at greater risk for his party. It also shored up for Democrats Tom Suozzi’s Long Island seat, which the party flipped in a February special election to succeed expelled former Rep. George Santos.
Leaders of both political parties say they can live with the map’s modest approach, which still puts the Empire State at the epicenter of the battle for the House. But some progressives have criticized New York Democrats, who hold supermajorities in the state Legislature, for not taking a more aggressive approach.
Former New York Rep. John Faso, a Republican who had been a key player in litigation over redistricting, said the map drawn by Democrats “has no material differences from the current map.”
“This turned out to be much ado about very little,” he added.
North Carolina
North Carolina’s legislature, where Republicans hold a supermajority, has drawn new congressional lines that observers say could prove a windfall for the GOP and boost the party’s chances of retaining its House majority next year.
The state’s current House delegation is split 7-7 between Democrats and Republicans.
A map that Republican state lawmakers approved put three House Democrats in what one expert called “almost impossible to win” districts.
The affected Democrats were Reps. Jeff Jackson, who currently represents a Charlotte-area district; Wiley Nickel, who holds a Raleigh-area seat; and Kathy Manning, who represents Greensboro and other parts of north-central North Carolina. All three opted not to seek reelection to the House.
A fourth Democrat, Rep. Don Davis, saw his district retooled to become more friendly toward Republicans while remaining competitive for both parties.
State-level gains in the 2022 midterm elections gave the GOP new sway over redistricting in this swing state – Republicans flipped the state Supreme Court, whose members are chosen in partisan elections. Last year, the new GOP majority on the court tossed out a 2022 ruling by the then-Democratic leaning court against partisan gerrymandering.
A map that had been created after the Democratic-led high court’s ruling resulted in the current even split in the state’s House delegation.
Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper does not have veto power over redistricting legislation. A group of Black and Latino residents of North Carolina filed a lawsuit alleging that the GOP-approved map “intentionally discriminates” against minority voters in violation of the US Constitution.
Alabama
In one of the cycle’s highest-profile redistricting cases, a three-judge panel in Alabama approved a map that created a second congressional district with a substantial Black population. Before the court action, Alabama – which is 27% Black – had only one Black-majority district out of seven seats.
The fight over the map went all the way to the US Supreme Court – which issued a surprise ruling, affirming a lower-court opinion that ordered Alabama to include a second Black-majority district or “something quite close to it.” Under the map used for the 2024 election, the state’s 2nd District now loops into Mobile to create a seat where nearly half the population is Black.
The high court’s 5-4 decision in June saw two conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, side with the three liberals to uphold the lower-court ruling. Their action kept intact a key pillar of the Voting Rights Act: that it’s illegal to draw maps that effectively keep Black voters from electing a candidate of their choice.
The ruling reverberated around the country and affected the outcome of similar court cases underway in Louisiana and Georgia that centered on whether Republican-drawn maps improperly diluted Black political power in those states.
Given that Black voters in Alabama have traditionally backed Democrats, the party now stands a better chance of winning the newly reconfigured district and sending two of its members to Congress after November’s elections.
The new map also could result in two Black US House members from Alabama serving together for the first time in state history.
Georgia
Georgia Republicans, who hold a governing trifecta in the state, finalized a new congressional map last year that safeguarded their party’s dominance in state politics and dashed Democrats’ hopes of adding an additional US House seat.
The new map complied with an order issued by US District Judge Steve Jones to establish an additional Black-majority district. But it preserved the GOP’s 9-5 edge in Georgia’s US House delegation by moving the Atlanta-area district represented by Rep. Lucy McBath, a Black Democrat, farther into Republican territory.
Jones had ordered state lawmakers to draw a new congressional map by December 8, arguing that the Republican-controlled legislature improperly diluted the political power of Black voters in their establishment of district boundaries following the 2020 census. In that ruling, Jones said state lawmakers’ earlier map had violated the Voting Rights Act.
In a big win for Republicans, Jones in late December ruled that the new legislature-drawn map that preserved Republicans’ 9-5 advantage “fully complied” with his order.
A separate federal case in Georgia challenges the congressional map on constitutional grounds.
Florida
A state judge in September struck down congressional lines for northern Florida that had been championed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, ruling that the Republican governor’s map had improperly diluted Black voting power.
This case, unlike the Alabama fight decided by the US Supreme Court, centers on provisions in the state constitution.
The judge concluded that the congressional boundaries – which essentially dismantled a seat once held by Al Lawson, a Black Democrat, that connected Black communities across a northern reach of the Florida – violated the state’s Fair Districts amendments, enacted by voters. One amendment specifically bars the state from drawing a district that diminishes the ability of racial minorities “to elect representatives of their choice.”
But in December, a state appeals court upheld the map DeSantis had advocated, saying the plaintiffs “failed to present any evidence” that the earlier version of the district – which connected Black communities from Jacksonville to Tallahassee – contained a singular cohesive community that would have a right to protection under Florida’s constitution.
The case is now before the all-Republican state Supreme Court, where DeSantis appointees hold most seats. The disputed map appears likely to remain in place for this year’s elections after the court denied the plaintiffs’ request to speed up the case and hold arguments before the congressional candidate qualifying period in April.
In a separate case — centered on whether the map violates the US Constitution – a federal court sided with DeSantis.
Observers say that in the end, the outcome of the state litigation is more likely than the federal case to determine the future of the North Florida district, given the state constitution’s especially strong protections for the voting rights of racial minorities and the lower burden of proof required to establish that those rights were abridged.
Kentucky
The Kentucky Supreme Court in December rejected arguments from Democrats that a map drawn by the state’s Republican-controlled legislature violated the state constitution as an “extreme partisan” gerrymander.
The dispute centered on lawmakers’ decision to move Kentucky’s capital city – Democratic-leaning Frankfort – out of the 6th Congressional District and into an oddly shaped – and solidly Republican – 1st District. Doing so helped shore up the GOP odds of holding the 6th District, represented by Republican Andy Barr.
Under its previous lines, the 6th District was a more competitive seat. (Democrat Amy McGrath came within 3 points of beating Barr in 2018; last year, Barr won a sixth term under the new lines by 29 points.)
A lower-court judge had ruled that the Republican-drawn map did not violate the state’s constitution, and the state’s high court, in a December 14 ruling, agreed.
South Carolina
A redistricting case pending before the US Supreme Court centers on the future of a Charleston-area seat held by Republican Rep. Nancy Mace, who made headlines last year for joining House GOP hard-liners in voting to remove Kevin McCarthy as speaker.
Last year, a three-judge panel concluded that the lines for the coastal 1st Congressional District, as drawn by state GOP lawmakers, amounted to an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.
The Republican lawmakers appealed to the US Supreme Court. During oral arguments, several justices in the court’s conservative majority expressed skepticism that South Carolina officials had engaged in an improper racial gerrymander and seemed inclined to reinstate the lawmakers’ map.
The 2024 elections will proceed under the current map, the three-judge panel ruled in March. The judges, in part, cited the delay in the high court issuing a decision.
New Mexico
Republicans in New Mexico argued that the congressional lines drawn by the Democrats who control state government amounted to an illegal gerrymander under the state’s constitution.
At stake: a swing district along the US border with Mexico. If Republicans had prevailed, the 2nd District seat – now held by a Democratic Rep. Gabe Vasquez – could have become more favorable to Republicans.
But a state judge in October upheld the map drawn by Democrats, and the New Mexico Supreme Court affirmed that ruling.
Utah
The state Supreme Court, in a case it heard in July, is considering whether it even has the authority to weigh in on map-drawing decisions by the GOP-controlled state Legislature.
Republican state officials have argued that the court’s power over redistricting decisions is limited.
Advocacy groups and a handful of voters are challenging a congressional map that further carved up Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County between four decidedly Republican districts.
Doing so, the plaintiffs asserted in their lawsuit, “takes a slice of Salt Lake County and grafts it onto large swaths of the rest of Utah,” allowing Republican voters in rural areas and smaller cities far away from Salt Lake to “dictate the outcome of elections.”

CNN,Why these Republicans think voting against Trump could save the GOP | CNN Politics,"Michael Pesce is conservative in the truest sense of the word.
He speaks with an economy of words. He holds himself to a high standard but prefers not to judge others. He gets through tasks methodically, wasting no time or energy – even when enjoying his hobbies.
Pesce is a hunter, and Pennsylvania deer season overlaps with election season. Archery hunting is open now, with a rifle hunting period set to open in November. So Pesce stopped by the ranges at a state park recently to check his gear.
“Hunting season is starting,” Pesce said. “That’s more important than any election for a lot of people.”
First, several shots at the archery targets, where Pesce at one point used a dime to adjust his bow sight. Once satisfied, it was down to the nearby firearm area. Pesce set his target 100 yards down range, and set his .30-6 hunting rifle on its stand.
A few stalls down, two men were firing AR-15-style assault rifles. Dozens of shots, the empty shells piling up at their feet. Pesce quietly made note of how loud it was, then got about his business: just three shots to adjust his rifle scope, then two more to allow a visitor to test his aim and get a feel for the rifle.
Then time to pack up, taking even the empty shells Pesce recycles for new bullets. A Coast Guard veteran. A Reagan Republican. A Nikki Haley voter in the April GOP primary who will be a Kamala Harris voter a week from Tuesday.
Pesce’s conservative principles tell him he can never vote for Donald Trump. And they tell him he has to vote for Harris, to try to keep Trump out of the White House, even though Pesce doesn’t like surprises and does not believe the vice president has clearly laid out a governing vision.
“That’s the scary part,” Pesce said. “I am not voting for a candidate. I’m not voting for a policy. I’m voting against a candidate and policies, and not even all the policies. Just, you know, the unstableness. Some of the things he says are truly scary.”
Pesce is part of our All Over The Map project, an effort to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds and are part of potentially decisive voting blocs.
In Pesce’s case, he’s one of the Republicans in the counties that surround Philadelphia who supported Haley in the primary even though the former South Carolina governor had exited the race weeks before. They’re voters who view Trump as anything but conservative or principled. In many cases, they believe Trump must be defeated again to shake their party out of his spell.
“If Trump loses, then I think Republicans will start coming back to what they were,” Pesce said. “Because they won’t have that radical right side. They won’t have the craziness and instability.”
It was our third visit in five months, and Pesce, true to his conservatism, has been consistent: He said in May he would vote for President Joe Biden even as he raised concerns about his age and took issue with some of his agenda. In conversations since the switch to Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket, Pesce has made clear he sees a duty to try to block Trump.
He recently traveled West through several states that are reliably Republican. Turning on the TV or the radio was different. He returned to Pennsylvania even more mindful that he lives in the biggest of the presidential battleground prizes.
“No one’s ever been through anything like this,” he said of the 2024 campaign. “Is this an election for Americans, or is this for those seven states?”
It is important to remember our project is anecdotal reporting; the voters we are tracking, in this case Haley primary supporters, are not necessarily representative of the full universe of such voters. Yet they still provide us with valuable and sometimes telling insights. And they live in places that will be critical to the final math of who wins Pennsylvania’s 19 electoral votes.
This time, we met Pesce at a state range in New Tripoli, which is in blue-collar Lehigh County. He lives a few miles away in Bucks County, which in recent elections has been the most competitive of the suburban collar counties that surround Philadelphia.
Those collar counties represent one of the crucial 2024 math tests: Can Harris hold or build on Biden’s 2020 suburban strength or will Trump claw back at least to his 2016 performance, when he lost the Philadelphia suburbs but by a smaller margin than in 2020? In a state so competitive, tiny shifts can make the difference.
‘American first, conservative second and Republican third’
Joan London and Berks County offer another glimpse at the battlegrounds within the battlegrounds.
Berks is still red when you look at election maps, and it is too far out to be considered a Philadelphia suburb. But as the suburbs grow and change, often the exurbs do, too. Still farmland, but more given up to homes and services. Still plenty of Trump signs, but in some pockets surprising competition.
“This neighborhood is becoming a lot like the Philadelphia suburbs,” said London, an attorney who was born closer to Philly, in Montgomery County. “This is a primarily Republican leaning borough, always has been. But when it comes to national elections, I do see more and more support for Democratic candidates.”
A walk down London’s leafy street in Wyomissing proves her point. No Trump signs but Harris signs on several of the lawns on her block.
Not her house. London’s lawn has one sign supporting a Republican legislative candidate.
But London is voting for Harris – the first time she will vote Democrat for president.
“Sometimes you have to say American first, conservative second and Republican third,” London said.
Her decision is a shift from when we first met in May. Then, London told us she voted in the GOP primary for Haley but then switched her registration to independent because she opposes Trump and what she sees as his dangerous populism.
But back then she said she would write in a conservative because she could not support Biden. She was even more firm in that belief just after Harris took over the ticket because she views the vice president as more liberal than Biden.
She had settled on Pat Toomey, a conservative former senator from Pennsylvania, as her write-in choice. Then she watched the Trump-Harris debate, and it stirred why, back at the age of 18, she chose to be a Reagan Republican.
“The last straw was what he said about the Ukraine,” London said. “When he said we have to have a negotiated settlement. … For someone who claims to be a conservative to say that was, in my opinion, outrageous. It’s appeasement. It’s dangerous.”
She slept on what that debate answer stirred in her. And she awoke a Harris voter because, like Pesce, she believes the only way to get her party back is for Trump to be defeated.
“I needed to vote against allowing him to become president again,” London said. She knows the polling in Pennsylvania and other swing states is tight and that Trump could well win.
“I don’t want it on my conscience that I contributed in some way to that,” London said.
London is reluctant to speak for others but believes she may have company among at least some fellow local conservatives.
“I was surprised by how many people came up to me and kind of whispered, ‘I feel the same way as you do,’” she said. “So I have a feeling there are quite a few private conversations that are occurring behind the scenes in Republican and conservative circles.”
It could matter if London has company. Hillary Clinton lost Berks County by 18,189 votes. Biden lost it, too, but by a slightly smaller margin: 16,841.
That 1,348 vote difference seems tiny, maybe insignificant, when you note that Pennsylvania has more than 9 million registered voters.
But ‘every vote counts’ is not a cliché in the battlegrounds: Trump’s winning margin here in 2016 was just 44,292; Biden’s in 2020 was 81,660.
Never Trump, but not yet Harris
Cynthia Sabatini is another Haley voter who now factors into the battleground math.
She lives in Media, in suburban Delaware County.
Sabatini is a registered Republican but she has never voted for Trump. And she says she never will.
“Trump is a non starter for me,” she said in a recent interview at home.
But she is not sold on Harris, either, and her questions track what we hear from a lot of voters in our travels, even committed supporters of the vice president.
“I don’t know who she is,” Sabatini said. “I really don’t. Because she had different positions than she does now. But she continues to say they are within her value system. So connect the dots for me.”
What can Harris do to win her vote in these final days?
“You need to answer questions on point,” Sabatini said. “You need to provide more details about your economic plan. You need to provide more details about your vision for this country.”
Sabatini wrote in a Republican senator in 2016 when Trump won Pennsylvania. She voted for Biden in 2020. She is well aware of the 2024 math, and friends voting for Harris aren’t shy about reminding her how critical it is for the vice president to get big margins in the suburbs.
“I don’t care what they personally think about that,” Sabatini said. “I don’t want to be forced into making a decision between one of the two.”
She meditates frequently, sometimes twice a day, and says it can clear the mind for tough choices.
As she ponders hers, she shares this: “I think Trump is going to win.” That, she said, is based on betting lines, not the polls.
Sabatini does not want Trump back in the White House. She has a mail-in ballot and plans to drop it off on Election Day. Her decision could come as late as that morning.
She will make it according to her beliefs: Either Harris will win her over or she will cast another write in, with Haley her leading choice if it comes to that.
“The lion’s share of my friends are Democrats,” she said. “They think at the 11th hour people will have such reservations about Trump that it will cause them to vote for Harris. I don’t see it that way.”",2024-10-26
CNN,‘We’re in a different space’: Police chiefs in battleground states make new plans to secure elections | CNN Politics,"Police chiefs across the United States are making unprecedented plans for Election Day and the weeks that follow.
Many departments hope to be near-invisible on Tuesday itself so as to create no impediments to people casting their ballots, but they told CNN they are ready to intervene — to protect polling places and votes as they have always done, but also to counter rumors and misinformation.
“Me and thousands of police chiefs all over the country are really taking this very, very seriously,” said Police Chief Shon Barnes of Madison, the capital city of the swing state of Wisconsin.
“As we are a battleground state, we’re not only thinking about what will happen on November 5, but in December when the (Electoral College) electorate shows up and they have to cast their vote, what will that look like and making sure that nothing happens to impede that vote.”
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Johnny Jennings in North Carolina, another swing state, told CNN: “I, as many other major city chiefs, am more concerned about what happens after Election Day and whether people are satisfied with the results and/or the timing of the results.”
The issue has become pressing for law enforcement since the January 6, 2021, insurrection at the US Capitol that delayed certification of the last presidential election. Law enforcement leaders at last month’s International Association of Chiefs of Police conference discussed how to make sure the electoral process could be completed if there was disruption not just in Washington, DC, but in their cities and states.
At that conference, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Kevin Bethel said some court proceedings had been canceled on Election Day in his city, freeing up 400 officers to be deployed. He said they were prepared for any number of incidents — from hoax “swatting” calls to an active shooter — all to happen on Election Day.
“It really has taken what we’ve always done, but never really focusing on voting, and taking those layers and laying them on top and making sure our individuals know what the cadence is going to be on that day,” he said.
The extra officers will often stay in the background, chiefs said, leaving poll security to election officials, unless they are called in to help with any problems.
Why chief hopes for a concession speech
In Madison, Barnes said emotions could be critical.
“We’re in a different space than we were many years ago when it comes to elections,” he said. “We do understand the process, but we also understand that it’s almost like people feel like it’s attached to who they are. And what that means is if you don’t win or your candidate doesn’t win, how are you going to accept that?”
Close battles may trigger recounts and historic legal fights are already being gamed out, which could mean it is days or even weeks before results are confirmed.
If that happens in Wisconsin, Barnes said he is ready for people to come to his city to demonstrate, perhaps some taking advantage of the state’s open-carry firearm rules. He’ll be looking to make sure people don’t break laws but he also hopes there will be no violation of what he called “the civility of our democratic process.”
“I do believe that, depending on who wins or who loses, the tenor of the conversation will change. I really believe that,” he said.
“I am expecting a peaceful transfer of power, which is what we normally have, and there are some clues that that’s happening. One is a concession speech. We hope that there’s a concession speech and it allows people to heal and move on and put what appears to be a divided country back on the same path.”
A CNN poll suggested this week that 88% of American adults believed that once votes were certified, the loser of the presidential election should accept the results and concede, but only 30% thought former President Donald Trump would do that in the event he lost. Some 73% of those questioned thought Vice President Kamala Harris would accept a defeat.
“We have put more planning into this than we did four years ago,” Barnes said of election security. “The events that happened on January 6 have really woke a lot of people up.”
As well as training officers on election laws, some of which are new this year in states like Georgia, chiefs have also familiarized themselves with how the results from the ballot boxes go through state electors and then to Washington.
“I don’t see a lot of panic around (Election) Day but I do see some apprehension around certifications, what we’ll have going on here in December,” Barnes said. “That’s where I hear people saying, ‘Well, what if it doesn’t go the way people want?’ That’s not without merit, unfortunately.”
In the Madison incident response center, police officers will be gathered to monitor any crowds or hotspots on large screens all around the room, and also to try to squash unfounded rumors.
“The disinformation worries me because social media moves so fast. One thing could go out and it could be retweeted, reposted and we have to be a part of that,” Barnes said.
His officers will be fact-checking reports or complaints and putting out their own accounts on social media. If a problem is reported in “Madison,” investigators are going to let people know if it’s Madison, Wisconsin, or actually a place with the same name in any of more than 20 other states.
The spread of lies or misleading statements and the potential impact are top of mind in other swing states.
Sheriff Willie Rowe of Wake County, North Carolina, told CNN: “While implementing our standard protocols, we are closely watching for misinformation, social media threats, and potential protest activity to be ready should any local concerns arise.”
In Pennsylvania, the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police said it was preparing for a busy election week as it balanced “the protection of First Amendment rights to free speech and peaceful assembly, while also preserving public safety.”
Sheriff Russ Skinner in Maricopa County in swing state Arizona said he was disquieted by his county getting global attention for becoming a hotbed for conspiracy theories since 2020, but insisted good plans were in place to tackle misinformation.
“We’re very concerned about those type of comments being made and not just from potential candidates, whether they’re winning, losing or what their conspiracy theory is,” Skinner told a news conference.
Before 2020, he would have expected to deploy 40 or 50 deputies on just Election Day, and once the ballots were at the counting center, their work would be done, he said.
Now, more than 200 employees could be assigned on a rolling basis to respond to needs on what will be a multi-day event.
Madison’s Barnes said they didn’t even talk about election security when he trained at the academy 25 years ago.
Barnes, a former high school history teacher who quotes Alexis de Tocqueville on fears about the “tyranny of the majority,” knows police have not always been on the correct side of ensuring all citizens can exercise their voting rights. But even with a visit to the site of “Bloody Sunday” in Selma, Alabama and his studies of the Civil War, Barnes said living and working in Wisconsin in 2024 has given him a whole new perspective.
“Battleground means something totally different to me now.”",2024-11-01
CNN,Maps and charts: Tracking the early votes in key states and how it compares to 2020 | CNN Politics,"CNN is monitoring who is casting pre-election ballots in the 36 states that offer early voting, as well as how early voting numbers compare with four years ago, when pre-election voting reached historic levels during the Covid-19 pandemic.
This page, updated daily, draws on data from Catalist, election officials and Edison Research.
Democrats held a wide advantage over Republicans in early voting four years ago, but the gap could be narrower this time as top Republican officials urge supporters to embrace voting before Election Day on November 5.
Voters register by party in four of the seven president battlegrounds and in each of those four, Democrats have cast a smaller share of pre-election ballots this year than at this point in 2020. Registration data by party is not available for the battleground states of Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin.
The overall downtick in interest in early voting so far shouldn’t be surprising.
The 2020 election featured historic levels of pre-election voting during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some voters were wary to vote in-person with guidelines from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention recommending social distancing. Four years later, with the country out of the pandemic, more voters could be heading back to the ballot box for in-person voting either before or on Election Day.
Another measure evident in the data so far is that older voters have made up a larger share of people casting ballots in battleground states, compared with this point in 2020.
The data also show early voting trends by racial and ethnic groups, offering clues about the makeup of the electorate. In some battleground states, a greater share of White voters have cast pre-election ballots than at this point in 2020.

CNN,How Biden is continuing to cancel student loan debt despite Supreme Court ruling | CNN Politics,"Although the Supreme Court struck down President Joe Biden’s signature student loan forgiveness program in late June, his administration has found ways to cancel more than $48 billion in debt since then.
The cancellations have come through existing federal student loan forgiveness programs, which are limited to specific categories of borrowers, such as public-sector workers, people defrauded by for-profit colleges, and borrowers who have paid for at least 20 years.
These programs are separate from the rejected forgiveness plan, which would have canceled about $430 billion of the $1.6 trillion of outstanding federal student loan debt all at one time.
The Biden administration has been granting student loan forgiveness through these existing programs on a rolling basis since coming into office and has discharged a total of $127 billion for nearly 3.6 million people to date.
That’s more student loan forgiveness than was granted under any other administration – in part due to the Biden administration’s efforts to temporarily expand some debt relief programs and to correct past administrative errors made to borrowers’ student loan accounts. The actions draw a stark contrast with the Trump administration, which tried to limit some of these forgiveness programs and slowed the processing of some applications.
But Biden’s Republican critics say that at least some of his debt relief actions are illegal and are an attempt to circumvent the Supreme Court’s ruling.
Recounting past payments and fixing errors
Nearly $42 billion of federal student loan debt has been canceled for almost 855,000 borrowers enrolled in income-driven repayment plans – largely due to the Biden administration’s effort to recount borrowers’ past payments and fix what officials have called “past administrative failures.”
Borrowers enrolled in income-driven repayment plans, which have been available in some form since 1993, are generally eligible for debt discharges after making qualifying payments for at least 20 years. The plans lower monthly payments by tying them to a borrower’s income and family size.
But the Department of Education has historically had trouble tracking borrowers’ payments.
Last year, the US Government Accountability Office recommended that the department do more to ensure that borrowers receive the forgiveness they are entitled to, after it found that there were thousands of loans still in repayment that could already be eligible for forgiveness.
“These are borrowers getting discharges that they should have received under programs authorized by Congress if they’d been operated as they should have over decades,” a Department of Education official said to CNN in an emailed statement.
Generally, the one-time recount will give borrowers credit toward forgiveness for any months in which they made payments regardless of what repayment plan they were enrolled in at the time, according to the Department of Education. The recount especially helps borrowers who may have been inappropriately steered by their student loan servicing company into a long-term forbearance, a period in which they stopped making payments.
A legal challenge moves forward
The one-time account adjustment effort was first announced by the Biden administration in April 2022 – but the cancellations did not begin until this year.
The administration announced it was canceling $39 billion in student loan debt due to the changes just two weeks after the Supreme Court knocked down Biden’s signature loan forgiveness program – drawing some skepticism about whether the move was legal.
“The Biden administration is trampling the rule of law, hurting borrowers, and abusing taxpayers to chase headlines,” Republican Rep. Virginia Foxx, chair of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, said in a statement at the time.
“Today’s celebration of counting no payments as payments is just the latest example of the ongoing delusion at the White House,” she added.
The Biden administration is facing at least one lawsuit over the account adjustments, filed by the New Civil Liberties Alliance on behalf of the conservative groups Cato Institute and the Mackinac Center for Public Policy. The plaintiffs recently filed an appeal after the lawsuit was dismissed by a federal judge in Michigan, who ruled that they did not have standing to bring the complaint.
Lawyers for the Biden administration have not yet been required to respond to the complaint and specify the legal authority relied on to cancel billions of dollars of student loan debt by adjusting past payments.
“There are several sources of authority that the department may be relying on, given its expansive authority over the federal student loan program generally and the income-driven repayment plans in particular,” said Abby Shafroth, co-director of advocacy at the National Consumer Law Center and director of its Student Loan Borrower Assistance Project.
Even if the lawsuit succeeds, Shafroth said it would surprise her if the court’s decision would result in reversing the debt relief that has already occurred.
Expanding debt relief program for public-sector workers
Nearly $51 billion of student loan debt has been canceled for 715,000 borrowers through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program since Biden took office.
The PSLF program cancels outstanding federal student loan debt for public-sector workers who have made 120 qualifying monthly student loan payments, or about 10 years’ worth of payments. A variety of government and nonprofit workers – including teachers, social workers, some nurses and doctors, and government lawyers – may qualify for the program.
The program was created by Congress in 2007 but was plagued with administrative problems before Biden took office.
In 2021, Biden put a temporary waiver in place, expanding eligibility so that some borrowers could retroactively receive credit for past payments that did not otherwise qualify for PSLF.
More than 95% of the borrowers who have been granted debt relief by the PSLF program qualified because of Biden’s temporary waiver.
The temporary benefits ended in October 2022. But the Department of Education has since conducted an executive rulemaking process to permanently change some of the qualifying restrictions of the PSLF program. The changes allow borrowers to receive credit toward PSLF on payments that are made late, in installments or in a lump sum, for example. Those changes went into effect in July.
Processing claims left over from the Trump administration
The Biden administration has canceled $22.5 billion of student loan debt for more than 1.3 million borrowers through an existing program known as borrower defense to repayment, which delivers student debt relief to people who were defrauded by their college.
Most recently, $37 million was canceled for more than 1,200 borrowers who attended the University of Phoenix because the government found that the for-profit school misled students about job prospects.
The borrower defense program was created by Congress decades ago but was rarely used until Corinthian Colleges, a for-profit network of schools, collapsed in 2015.
Under Biden, the Department of Education has made progress in whittling down a backlog of borrower defense claims that built up during the Trump administration.
At one point, more than 200,000 borrower defense claims were pending as former Education Secretary Betsy DeVos made efforts to limit the program. Those efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.
Cutting red tape for disabled borrowers eligible for debt relief
The Biden administration has also made it easier for disabled borrowers to receive the debt relief to which they are entitled. Nearly 513,000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability have received $11.7 billion in student loan forgiveness since 2021.
Previously, borrowers were required to provide documentation from a physician, the Social Security Administration or the Department of Veterans Affairs to show that they qualified for debt relief.
But the Biden administration changed the rule so that the Department of Education can provide automatic discharges for disabled borrowers who are identified through administrative data matching with the Social Security Administration – without the borrowers submitting paperwork.",2023-10-22
CNN,Analysis: Today’s swing states are tomorrow’s safe states | CNN Politics,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.
For the vast majority of Americans who live outside the seven battleground states, there is a confounding helplessness in 2024.
On the one hand, polling suggests a historically tight race heading into Election Day.
On the other hand, the Electoral College map suggests that the results in all but those seven states are a foregone conclusion, assuming people show up and vote the way polling suggests they will.
Every vote counts, obviously, but some seem to matter more than others. At least in some years.
Swing today, safe tomorrow
If there is some consolation for the millions of Republicans in California and Democrats in Texas – and so on – it is that today’s swing state is tomorrow’s safe state.
Missouri, for example, is a flyover state for presidential candidates today, reliably red and far off the radar of campaigns popping back and forth between actual battlegrounds.
But for about 100 years, Missouri was the ultimate bellwether in presidential elections, voting for the winner in 25 of 26 elections between 1904 and 2004 – within the lifetime of most of today’s voters.
Florida and Ohio, both of which are now red states for presidential purposes, were hotly contested battlegrounds until this election cycle. Virginia and Colorado, which were battlegrounds in roughly the same era, are now essentially blue in presidential years.
In the closest possible election that people alive today can remember, 2000, it’s Florida’s “hanging chads” and the US Supreme Court decision that ended a recount there that stick in people’s minds. But New Hampshire and New Mexico, now both blue states, were also decided by the smallest of margins.
Battlegrounds for about a generation
The point is that the people and politics of this country are constantly churning and moving. The makeup of the battlegrounds seems immutable in a single election, but battlegrounds have a shelf life, and it might only last about a generation.
I talked to David Schultz, a political science professor at Hamline University and author of the book, “Presidential Swing States,” which will be due for its fourth edition after the 2024 presidential election.
Swing, battleground and competitive are different things
Schultz told me that while we use terms like “swing state” and “battleground state” interchangeably, they’re actually different things.
A swing state is one that has actually flipped and recently supported presidents from different parties. Think of the “blue wall” states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. They swing from Democratic President Barack Obama in 2012 to Republican President Donald Trump in 2016 and then back to Democratic President Joe Biden in 2020.
Now they’re battleground states, or places where candidates show up and campaign.
They also fall into a third category of competitive states, where results are within 5 percentage points.
“In many cases, a swing state is really all three. It’s a battleground state. It’s been flipped. It’s competitive. But in some cases, there are states that have not flipped yet,” he argued.
More technically, according to Schultz, these states usually share some characteristics, including that they are relatively evenly split between Republicans and Democrats and that their “average or median voter is to the right of where the Democrats are nationally and to the left of where the Republican Party is nationally.”
Today’s battlegrounds
That’s about where the Rust Belt states collectively known as the blue wall are at the moment.
They had voted in a bloc for Democrats in every election from 1992 until Trump won them in 2016. They moved back toward Democrats in 2020 and represent Democrats’ best chance to retain the White House, according to many political strategists, even though the long-term demographic trends might not be so favorable for Democrats there. The parties are increasingly divided by education and race.
In Schultz’s view, if there’s one single bellwether state this year, it’s Pennsylvania.
Republicans are in a similar situation with Sun Belt states like Georgia and North Carolina, which have seen population growth among young people and people of color.
The country is constantly changing
Schultz argued that with deaths spurred by the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as internal migration and new voters being eligible to vote, some states have seen up to a 20% change in the makeup of their populations since just the last election.
That means the country’s population has changed quite a bit since some states last swung.
In the 1988 election, the last time the blue wall did not vote together, Pennsylvania and Michigan voted with the loser, Democrat Michael Dukakis. That election represented the end of an era in many ways. That was the last election in which California, the most populous state, voted for a Republican president, George H.W. Bush.
Texas, the second most populous state, on the other hand, hasn’t voted for a Democrat since Jimmy Carter won the White House in 1976, although results there were quite close in 1992 and 1996 when Clinton won the White House.
Schultz said the country has seemed to sort itself into red and blue and that something is shrinking the number of competitive states.
“If a state gets to be a reputation of being Republican or Democrat, we start to see patterns of immigration, of people sorting themselves out of where they want to live,” he told me.
Will Texas ever turn?
Democrats, for years, have been hoping that demographic shifts would again put Texas in play, something that could completely reshuffle the electoral map. Schultz doesn’t see that kind of shift in Texas for another four or eight years.
But he does think there are some states that could become new swing states in the years to come. He mentioned South Carolina and Montana, states that could shift as more young people move into them, changing their makeup.
If you look at all the competitive states in all the elections going back to 1976, most of the states have swung one way or the other or been competitive in the past 50 years.
Some states change all of a sudden
Sometimes, the swing bypasses the competitive category altogether.
West Virginia today is one of the most reliably Republican states – when it swung from Democrats to Republicans in the 2000 election, it swung hard. The result placed it outside the “competitive” category.
In other years, nearly the entire country swings, such as in 1984 – when the only state won by the Democratic candidate, Walter Mondale, was Minnesota, his home, which he took along with Washington, DC.",2024-10-29
CNN,GOP-led states and industry groups ask Supreme Court to block Biden’s ‘good neighbor’ pollution rule | CNN Politics,"A group of Republican-led states, fossil fuel industry groups and utilities filed an emergency request with the Supreme Court Wednesday, asking it to block the implementation of the Biden administration’s “good neighbor” rule – a regulation to cut down on harmful smog and air pollution that wafts downwind and across state lines.
The Clean Air Act requires the Environmental Protection Agency to occasionally review and revise the interstate pollution rule to make sure it aligns with the latest health guidelines and science. The EPA strengthened the rule in March under a court-ordered deadline, after it languished without update during the Trump administration.
The revision required 23 states that weren’t meeting the requirements to adhere to the rule, which prevents smog and air pollution from power plants and heavy industry from floating into other states and worsening air quality. For instance, if one state generating ozone and smog through its coal-fired power plants sends these pollutants into another neighboring state, it could be in violation of the rule.
The rule is being challenged in multiple courts, but so far none of those cases have successfully blocked it. In their application to the Supreme Court, the Republican states and industry groups say the Biden EPA plan threatens the reliability of the nation’s electric grid. The court will likely ask for a response from the EPA before taking action on the request.
“The plan inflicts irreparable, economic injuries on the States and others every day it remains in effect,” petitioners wrote on Wednesday. “Worse still, the plan is likely to cause electric-grid emergencies, as power suppliers strain to adjust to the federal plan’s terms. To prevent these harms, the Court should step in now.”
CNN has reached out to the EPA for comment.
To adhere to the updated rule, heavy industry and power plants will need to be outfitted with specialized pollution control equipment and run it throughout peak ozone season, which varies state to state. The rule is part of a suite of EPA rules that both cut down on pollution that can be harmful to human health, but also have the effect of cutting down on planet-warming pollution from coal-fired power plants.
“If it’s allowed to be fully implemented, this clean air rule will reduce asthma symptoms for millions of Americans, keep thousands of people out of the hospital, and save over a thousand lives each year,” Kathleen Riley, an attorney for the nonprofit environmental litigation group Earthjustice, said in a statement. “None of the rule’s protections should be put on hold.”",2023-10-18
CNN,Trump was doing historically well among Hispanic voters before Madison Square Garden rally backlash | CNN Politics,"Donald Trump’s Sunday rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City featured numerous instances of speakers making racist or bigoted remarks. Perhaps none more notoriously so than comedian Tony Hinchcliffe’s offensive comments about Puerto Rico.
What makes those remarks – which the former president’s campaign has sought to distance itself from – so noteworthy is they come at a time when Trump seems to be making inroads with Hispanic voters. In fact, he seems to be on his way to doing better with this group than any GOP presidential nominee since George W. Bush in 2004.
Consider an average of recent polling data on Hispanic voters: Kamala Harris is ahead of Trump by just 13 points. That’s well off an average of post-election and exit poll data from 2020, when Joe Biden carried Hispanic voters by 26 points.
What’s remarkable is that this 26-point deficit, itself, was an improvement for Trump from 2016. Trump lost Hispanic voters by 39 points to Hillary Clinton, according to an average of exit poll and post-election data.
The polling data and 2020 outcome represent a big reason why the Trump campaign has made a concerted effort to win over more Hispanic voters. It helps to explain why the former president held a massive rally in the heavily Hispanic Bronx earlier this year and visited a barbershop in that same New York City borough this month.
Trump’s improvement with Hispanic voters also helps to explain the current electoral map. Harris’ best path to securing the 270 electoral votes needed to win seems to run through the Great Lakes battlegrounds of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. She has been basically even with Trump in polling of these states, if not running slightly ahead.
Meanwhile, in Arizona and Nevada, two Southwest battlegrounds with larger Hispanic populations, Trump has been doing well.
He has consistently held a margin-of-error advantage in Arizona surveys. In fact, it’s been Trump’s best polling state of any that Biden won in 2020. The polling from Nevada has been limited, but it too has moved more toward the former president than what polling averages indicate in the Great Lakes battleground states.
Both Arizona and Nevada have more Hispanic voters than any of the other five battleground states, which also include Georgia and North Carolina.
Trump has been doing particularly well among Hispanic men, as well as Hispanic voters without a college degree.
Will a rally like Sunday’s make a difference in that support? It’s unclear.
What is notable, however, is that such rallies hark back more to the rhetoric the Trump campaign used during the 2016 cycle, when he performed far worse with Hispanic voters.
Still, I would be hesitant to think too much will change after Sunday.
For one thing, most Hispanic voters are not from Puerto Rico, especially in the battleground states. For another, Hispanics are not one-issue voters.
According to a recent New York Times/Siena College poll, the No. 1 issue for Hispanic voters was the economy (29%). That matches the 27% of all likely voters who said the economy was their top issue in deciding their vote this year.
Immigration ranked third for all likely voters, at 12%, which, again, mirrors the 15% of likely Hispanic voters who felt the same way.
Of course, one could argue that Sunday’s rally could have turned off non-Hispanic voters. We already know that Harris is doing historically well for a Democrat among White college-educated voters. They’re the ones who have been moving most to the left since Trump entered the political scene, in no small part because of his rhetoric.
White college-educated voters are of paramount importance to Harris in the suburbs of Philadelphia and Detroit and the areas around Madison, Wisconsin. Given how close the contests in those states are, any movement could make all the difference in the world.
If nothing else, the Madison Square Garden rally seems to have focused people’s attention on Trump (see Google searches), but for a negative reason.
I doubt the Trump campaign likes that.",2024-10-28
CNN,Biden makes the case for wartime aid to Israel and Ukraine in primetime address | CNN Politics,"President Joe Biden tied the wars in Ukraine and Israel together during a primetime Oval Office address Thursday, making an impassioned appeal to the American people to support two fellow democracies that he says are facing existential threats.
The president has often cast this moment in history as an “inflection point” – a battle between the world’s democracies and autocracies. On Thursday, he argued that “this is one of those moments,” making a direct appeal to the American people as he sought to build support for US funding for wars abroad that could face a challenging path in Congress, where the House of Representatives remains unable to pass legislation in its second week without a speaker.
“Hamas and Putin represent different threats, but they share this in common: They both want to completely annihilate a neighboring democracy, completely annihilate it,” Biden said.
“We can’t let petty partisan, angry politics get in the way of our responsibilities as a great nation. We cannot and will not let terrorists like Hamas and tyrants like Putin win. I refuse to let that happen,” he added.”
He laid out the stakes for the American people, calling the wars a national security imperative and a critical moment for the future of American leadership and democracies worldwide.
“American leadership is what holds the world together. American alliances are what keep us in America safe. American values are what make us a partner nation you want to work with,” he said. “To put all that at risk – we walk away from Ukraine, we turn our backs on Israel – it’s just not worth it.”
The president said support for both wars is “vital for America’s national security.”
“History has taught us that when terrorists don’t pay a price for their terror, when dictators don’t pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos and death and more destruction. They keep going. And the cost and the threat to America in the world keep rising,” Biden said, warning, “If we don’t stop Putin’s appetite for power and control in Ukraine, he won’t limit himself just to Ukraine.”
And he warned more broadly that the United States’ adversaries and competitors “are watching.”
“If we walk away and let Putin erase Ukraine’s independence, would-be aggressors around the world would be emboldened to try the same. The risk of conflict and chaos could spread in other parts of the world – in the Indo Pacific, in the Middle East, especially in the Middle East,” Biden said.
A request for more funding
The primetime address took place on the eve of the White House requesting north of $100 billion from Congress to deliver aid and resources to Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan, and the US border with Mexico, even though the legislative branch is paralyzed by the dysfunction in the House of Representatives.
The administration has informed lawmakers it plans to seek $14 billion for border security in its new funding package, a marked increase from the previous ask, according to a source familiar. The administration previously asked for $4 billion in supplemental funding to address needs on the US-Mexico border. The new ask encompasses fiscal year 2024, which is why it’s higher than the supplemental request submitted by the White House over the summer, according to another source familiar.
Biden said he would be submitting an “urgent budget request” for supplemental funding for Israel and Ukraine, among other national security priorities.
“That’s why tomorrow I’m going to send to Congress an urgent budget request to fund America’s national security needs – needs to support our critical partners, including Israel and Ukraine. It’s a smart investment that’s gonna pay dividends for American security for generations,” Biden said.
While the White House believes there remains broad bipartisan support in Congress for the package, as three administration officials told CNN, real questions remain about the path for such a package with a leadership vacuum in the House of Representatives and consternation about federal spending levels that have cast into question the government’s ability to fund itself beyond mid-November.
The Biden administration in August delivered its last so-called supplemental funding request, which encapsulates unique requests beyond traditional government programs. The proposal requested $24.1 billion to aid Ukraine through the end of the year, but Congress failed to approve it during a process to greenlight short-term federal funding.
Biden reiterated that he will not put American boots on the ground in Ukraine.
“I will not send American troops to fight in Ukraine. All Ukraine is asking for is help. For the weapons, munitions, the capacity, the capability of pushing invading Russian forces off their land and the air defense system to shoot down Russian missiles before they destroy Ukrainian cities,” he said.
As public opinion toward military aid provision for Ukraine has waned in the last year, Biden also sought to explain the process, tying it to American jobs.
“We send Ukrainian equipment sitting in our stockpiles. And when we use the money allocated by Congress, we use it to replenish our own stores, our own stockpiles, with new equipment. Equipment that defends America and is made in America,” he said, pointing to Patriot missiles for air defense batteries that are made in Arizona and artillery shells that are manufactured in 12 states across the country, including Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Texas.
“Just as in World War II, today, patriotic American workers are building the arsenal of democracy and serving the cause of freedom,” he said.
Public opinion regarding US assistance has been mixed.
In a recent CNN poll, nearly all respondents were sympathetic with the Israeli people in the wake of surprise attacks launched by Hamas, but there was no clear consensus on the right level of US involvement. One-third (35%) said the US is providing the right amount of assistance – and another 36% were unsure whether the level of US assistance is appropriate. The US has long provided security assistance to Israel, which receives roughly $4 billion annually under a 10-year memorandum of understanding. The new request would provide billions more.
By contrast, support to sustain aid to Ukraine has waned significantly since Russia’s unprovoked invasion in February 2022. An August CNN poll found 55% of respondents said Congress should not pass more funding to aid Ukraine. The partisan divide has been deepening, too: Nearly three-quarters of Republicans opposed more funding for Ukraine, while 62% of Democrats supported it.
Since Russia’s invasion, the White House and Congress have provided more than $75 billion in funding to Kyiv, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.
Speech comes after high-profile visit
The speech comes on the heels of his wartime visit to the Middle East, which went on even after a blast tore through a hospital in Gaza. While his planned stop in Amman, Jordan, to meet Arab leaders was canceled just as the president was preparing to depart the White House, Biden did spend hours on the ground in Tel Aviv.
For Biden, a trip in the formative days of a potentially drawn-out conflict amounted to the ultimate test of his confidence – built over decades – that getting in the same room can influence people and events.
During the speech, the president reflected on the visit, which included a meeting that stretched well past what officials had expected, in which Biden sought to use his decades-long relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – one that has endured significant strain over the past year – to offer advice and seek commitments on the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza.
“The terrorist group Hamas unleashed pure, unadulterated evil in the world. But sadly, the Jewish people know, perhaps better than anyone, that there is no limit to the depravity of people when they want to inflict pain on others. In Israel, I saw people who are strong, determined, resilient and also angry, in shock and in deep, deep pain,” he said.
He reiterated his support for Americans being held hostage by Hamas.
“As I told the families of Americans being held captive by Hamas, we’re pursuing every avenue to bring their loved ones home. As president, there is no higher priority for me than the safety of Americans held hostage,” he said.
He also pointed to an agreement securing “sustained delivery of lifesaving humanitarian assistance for the Palestinians, from the United Nations to Palestinian civilians in Gaza,” warning Hamas against diverting or stealing the shipments.
The US, Egypt and Israel have all signaled readiness for aid to begin moving into Gaza, following Biden’s high-profile visit. However, the Rafah crossing from Egypt to Gaza is not expected to open Friday for a convoy of humanitarian aid to get into Gaza, multiple sources told CNN, despite expectations voiced by Biden and others that it would be open.
“I would not put money on those trucks going through tomorrow,” one source familiar with the discussions told CNN.
During his address, Biden sought to draw a clear distinction between Hamas and the Palestinian people and argued for a two-state solution to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.
“Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people. Hamas uses Palestinian civilians as human shields, and innocent Palestinian families are suffering greatly because of them,” he said.
The US, he later added, “remains committed to the Palestinian people’s right to dignity and to self-determination. The actions of Hamas terrorists don’t take that right away.”
Biden empathizes with both Muslims and Jews
During Biden’s speech, he spoke out forcefully against both Islamophobia and antisemitism, both of which have intensified in recent days, offering comfort and condemnation.
Biden acknowledged the fear from Jewish families “worried about being targeted in school, wearing symbols of their faith walking down the street, or going out about their daily life.”
And he empathized with Muslim Americans who are “outraged… saying to yourself, ‘Here we go again, with Islamophobia and distrust we saw after 9/11.’”
“We can’t stand by and stand silent where this happens. We must, without equivocation, denounce antisemitism. We must, also without equivocation, denounce Islamophobia,” he said.
Biden and first lady Dr. Jill Biden spoke Thursday evening with the father and uncle of Wadea Al-Fayoume, the Palestinian American boy stabbed to death in Illinois on Saturday.
The Bidens “expressed their deepest condolences to the ( Al-Fayoume) family as they mourn; their prayers that Wadea’s mother, Hannan Shahin, makes a full recovery; and their commitment to keep speaking out against anti-Palestinian, anti-Arab, and anti-Muslim hate and violence,” the White House said.
Biden invoked the Al-Fayoume family in his Oval Office address.
“Just last week, a mother was brutally stabbed. A little boy – here in the United States – a little boy who just turned six years old was murdered in their home outside of Chicago. His name was Wadea, Wadea. A proud American, a proud Palestinian-American family,” Biden said.
He offered a message of recognition to those impacted: “To all of you hurting, those of you hurting, I want you to know I see you. You belong. I want to say this to you: You’re all American.”
“In moments like these, and when fears and suspicion, anger and rage run hard, we have to work harder than ever to hold onto the values that make us who we are,” he said.
While he said that Americans should not “forget who we are,” he also warned that the government of Israel should not “be blinded by rage.”
The message – tinged with hard-learned lessons from life in the United States after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks – echoed thoughts Biden shared with Israelis while in Tel Aviv the day before.
“I caution this: While you feel that rage, don’t be consumed by it,” Biden told his audience, a collection of Israelis and Americans.
“I know the choices are never clear or easy for the leadership,” Biden went on, recalling mistakes the United States made after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. “There’s always cost, but it requires being deliberate, requires asking very hard questions. That requires clarity about the objectives and an honest assessment about whether the path you’re on will achieve those objectives.”

CNN,Tensions between Trump and RNC spill over into public view | CNN Politics,"Former President Donald Trump’s decision to skip next month’s third GOP presidential primary debate and instead hold a rivaling rally just up the road highlights how complicated – and at times thorny – the relationship between the Republican National Committee and the front-runner’s team has become.
The RNC was caught off guard when Trump’s campaign announced last week that it would hold a counterprogramming event the same night as the debate, just down the road from the Miami arena where other Republican candidates would be facing off.
While Trump has not attended any of the debates, citing his commanding lead in the polls, the decision to host what appears to be a competing event in the same area has rubbed some Republicans the wrong way.
“It’s a slap in the face [to the RNC],” one Republican operative with ties to the committee told CNN. “An intentional slap in the face.”
Allies close to Trump attempted to justify the decision, pointing to Trump’s public frustration that the RNC is continuing to hold debates despite the wide margin he has over the rest of the field. Earlier this month, the former president’s top campaign advisers called on the RNC to “immediately cancel the upcoming debate in Miami and end all future debates in order to refocus its manpower and money” on defeating Democrats in 2024.
But even before the debates took center stage, Trump’s relationship with the organization, led by his own hand-picked chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel, had become increasingly tumultuous in recent months.
For one, the former president privately still harbors resentment towards the organization over the 2020 election, blaming them for not having what he believes were the proper attorneys in place to challenge the election results, multiple sources told CNN. Some Trump allies have tried unsuccessfully to rid him of this belief – noting that it was not the RNC’s responsibility to provide the legal resources to challenge the election. Others have pointed out that his own 2020 campaign should have had a better legal infrastructure in place – however, these arguments, like many involving the 2020 election, have fallen on deaf ears.
While Trump seems to understand that why the RNC has not endorsed his 2024 candidacy, sources said he has asked allies and aides why the RNC must remain neutral in the 2024 GOP presidential primary race. The RNC’s bylaws mandate neutrality; this primary season, McDaniel has taken pains to act as an impartial chair.
The RNC stressed that it is focused on presiding over the GOP primary in a fair way to all the candidates running for the Republican nomination for president.
“The RNC will continue to enact a fair, transparent debate process. In addition to sanctioning the primary debates, the RNC is continuing to buildout our 2024 operation, with in-state hires for Political and Election Integrity staffers in key battleground states,” an RNC spokesman said in a statement.
Trump appointed McDaniel as chair after he was elected in 2016, and dozens of establishment Republican committee members were replaced by Trump loyalists. Trump personally felt like he helped make McDaniel into the party leader she is, and has expected loyalty from her as a result, sources familiar with their relationship said. When Trump was president, McDaniel was extremely supportive. And, while Trump was a driving force behind McDaniel retaining the chair of the committee earlier this year, many in his orbit fault her for Republicans’ underwhelming results in the 2022 midterms.
“There’s a general concern about Ronna and the RNC when it comes to the 2020 and 2022 elections,” a person close to Trump told CNN, pointing to what they saw as mistakes with the party’s messaging strategy and get out the vote efforts.
“There’s a lot of concern about her leading the party going forward,” the source added.
However, Trump’s top campaign officials are in regular touch with RNC leadership and Trump’s senior campaign advisers, including Susie Wiles, flew to California earlier this year for McDaniel’s reelection as chair. Privately, Trump’s team had made it clear that they were backing McDaniel against her opponent, Trump attorney Harmeet Dhillon.
Shortly after winning, McDaniel told Fox News that this would be her “last term as chair…It’s done.”
After a major political party picks a nominee, there are usually some adjustments between that nominee’s campaign structure and the party committee – something that some members of Trump’s inner circle would like to see if Trump becomes the GOP nominee.
One source noted that it was too early to have a conversation about changes at the RNC, but added that top officials, including McDaniel, should be willing to step aside to make way for new leadership if Trump wins the nomination.
Another insisted that Trump is not planning to “clean house” should he becomes the nominee.
“It’s not unusual for the nominee to make some changes at the RNC, and I imagine Trump will, but there is nothing planned,” one source close to the former president said, noting that McDaniel’s term would be over in a year and a half anyway. “There would be a new RNC chairman that I imagine Trump would be influential and in choosing just like he was influential with [McDaniel].”
The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.
Tensions began escalating ahead of first debate
After McDaniel announced the first debate would be in August, Trump began to suggest publicly he may not participate, citing his lead in early polls and because he would face questions from what he described as “hostile” news networks.
Trump also said in a Truth Social post that the RNC didn’t get “approval” from him or his campaign ahead of announcing the debates, though presidential candidates do not have singular control over the format or timing of these events.
A GOP adviser familiar with the process said Trump’s campaign was fully briefed on the timing, location and other specifics of the announced primary debates. McDaniel had told Trump personally that the debates would start in August, according to two sources familiar with the conversation.
The debate fight came to a head when RNC officials met with Trump’s senior campaign advisers in Nashville last spring at the RNC retreat to sort out what had become a public back and forth, multiple sources familiar with the meeting told CNN.
The conversation turned into a heated back-and-forth between David Bossie, who is in charge of the RNC debate committee, and Trump campaign adviser Chris LaCivita. McDaniel and Wiles stepped in break it up.
As it became clear Trump would not likely participate in the first debate, McDaniel and Bossie privately visited Trump at Bedminster in July to encourage him to participate in the debates, CNN previously reported. Trump was noncommittal on his plans during that meeting. However, in the weeks that followed, he increasingly became frustrated with McDaniel and Bossie for continuing to try and pressure him into attending – something that has also contributed to the straining of their relationship, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.
“Sitting there, having Bossie and Ronna tell him that it’s a good idea to go to a debate where he’s going to get the crap kicked out of him by all the other candidates, never mind the moderators, there’s no upside,” the source said. “He didn’t appreciate it.”
“It just started to grate on him,” the source said.
RNC officials and members pushed back at the idea that they would not hold the debate just because Trump is leading in the polls.
“The reality is 50% of the base is with him – that means there’s another 50% that’s not,” the Republican operative said. “That 50% has to feel like there’s a fair process that played out if they’re going to turn out if Trump is nominated and actually vote for him.”
While Trump bristled at the date, which he said was early, the sources said that he did not completely shut it down. But two Trump sources familiar with the conversations between Trump’s campaign and the RNC said that his team and the former president himself had made it clear that he would not attend a debate before Labor Day.
Trump instead sat for a pre-recorded interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.
The legal complications
The link between Trump world and McDaniel and the RNC goes deeper than politics, as the chairwoman and the committee have become entangled in Trump’s legal woes. The RNC paid millions of dollars to law firms representing Trump in various investigations, but stopped after Trump announced his third presidential run due to their neutrality policy.
The committee “cannot pay legal bills for any candidate that’s announced,” McDaniel told CNN’s Dana Bash last November when asked whether the RNC would stop paying Trump’s legal bills if he became a candidate.
“We cannot do in kind contributions to any candidate right now. He’s the former president being attacked from every which way with lawsuits, and he’s certainly raised more under the RNC than we’ve spent on these bills,” she added at the time.
McDaniel also testified before the House select committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, and is likely to testify in the federal trial as well. The federal case into Trump’s alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election is just one of several trials Trump is facing early next year.
Earlier this month, the judge presiding over the Georgia election subversion case signed an order to compel McDaniel to testify at the trial.
“You’d think that maybe everyone attacking her would take into consideration that she’s probably going to end up in several of his trials,” the GOP operative told CNN.
As of now, it’s unclear how her potential testimony could further impact their relationship, but her role as a likely witness could further add to the strain between the two.",2023-10-23
CNN,Johnson leans on Trump in frantic push to save House majority | CNN Politics,"It’s been two years of a chaotic GOP-led House. But this time, Speaker Mike Johnson insists, things will be different.
As he barnstorms through blue districts central to the fight for the House, Johnson is seeking to nationalize the battle for the majority, promising an “aggressive” 100-day agenda and aligning himself closely with Donald Trump, even taking selfie videos with supporters and texting them to the former president, like he did in this battleground Long Island district that tilts Democratic.
In an interview with CNN, Johnson predicted that a unified GOP Washington would mean less of the infighting that derailed the Republican agenda over the past two years. He also walked back his suggestion from earlier this week that they do away with the Affordable Care Act, a sharp departure from the yearslong GOP effort to kill the Democratic health law.
Yet the speaker did little to alleviate Democratic fears that Trump would be largely unchecked if he wins again and Republicans control Congress, downplaying Trump’s unsubstantiated claims of “cheating” in this year’s election and shrugging off the former president’s repeated calls to retaliate against his political foes. And he contended that the “little secret” Trump promoted is simply a get-out-the-vote effort, even as he wouldn’t say outright that he’d accept the election results if Vice President Kamala Harris wins no-matter-what.
Asked if he would accept a Harris win next week, Johnson said: “Yes, look, I’m going to qualify this, and this is going to make everybody freak out again. If it’s a free and fair election,” arguing that some House Democrats have refused to say if they’d certify a Trump win.
As he barnstorms the country, raising tens of millions of dollars and traveling through more than 20 states in October alone, Johnson is calculating that swing-district Republicans will need a boost from the MAGA base in order to pull out victory in a high-turnout election. It’s a departure from previous election cycles when vulnerable members in purple districts would often shy away from the top of the ticket and their national party.
But in a polarized electorate, Trump’s success on Tuesday is critical for Johnson – both for the majority and for his own political future.
“Very often,” Johnson told CNN when asked how often he speaks with the former president. “It’s very important for what we think is going to be ahead of us, for us to have a very close working relationship.”
If the GOP loses the House, the blame game will play out in full force, and it remains an open question whether Johnson will try to run for House minority leader, something Johnson insists he has “not given one second of thought to.” But if Republicans win the chamber, he stands the favorite to remain as speaker – though he almost certainly would have another tight majority, a dynamic that led to two years of disarray in the House and the ouster of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy.
Asked how he would avoid the pitfalls that dogged the GOP over the last two years, Johnson said he’s “convinced we’re going to have a larger majority this time.”
“Then, if we have unified government, if Trump’s in the White House, and we have the Senate as well, I think everybody on my side is going to be in a much better mood,” Johnson told CNN. “And I think they’ll want to be part of the reform agenda and not a speed bump in the way.”
But whichever party is in charge almost certainly will have a tight majority. And with 60 votes needed to advance most bills in the Senate, even a GOP-led chamber would run into pitfalls trying to pass more partisan bills out of the House.
The battle for the House has centered largely on 16 GOP seats in districts that President Joe Biden carried in 2020 and five Democratic seats in districts Trump won. And the House could hinge largely on the outcome of battles in California and New York, including five GOP freshmen from the Empire State whose victories flipped the House in 2022.
Indeed, outside groups have poured in $110.7 million on air in New York House races alone, according to data from AdImpact, making it the most of any state. And through Election Day, $850 million will have been spent in the overall battle for the House, with Democrats spending $100 million-plus more than GOP groups, making it the most expensive fight for the House majority ever.
What Johnson is promising: An “aggressive” 100-day agenda taking aim at federal regulations, extending the GOP tax cuts and following Trump’s cues if he’s back in the Oval Office.
“We’ll run a legislative agenda that follows his executive orders, and immediately then we’ll turn to the economy,” Johnson told a crowd of Nassau County Republicans this week. “We’re going to turn the engines of the free market right back on. … We’re going to extend the Trump era tax cuts, because they’re going to expire next year if we don’t fix that. And then you know what we’re going to do next? We’re going to take a blowtorch to the regulatory state.”
But after suggesting earlier this week that it was time for Obamacare to go, and enduring backlash from Harris in the aftermath, Johnson told CNN that Republicans would not repeal the Affordable Care Act, despite the yearslong GOP effort to do so.
“Look, we are laser focused on improving health care as we are every area,” Johnson said. “We need higher quality of care in many parts of the country. We need greater access. We need lower cost. And there are ideas on how to do that. That’s what I was referring to.”
But Johnson’s allegiance to Trump has been a source of tension with Democrats, including over the baseless notion of mass election fraud. Just this week, Trump contended that there’s “cheating” in Pennsylvania, echoing his bogus claims in the 2020 election.
Johnson defended the former president.
“Trump is not sowing doubts,” Johnson said. “What he and all of us are trying to do is have accountability to ensure that we don’t have hijinks and irregularities.”
Yet it’s unified GOP control of Washington that has sparked Democratic fears that Trump would be unchecked, especially as he has warned repeatedly that he would target his enemies.
But Johnson insisted Trump is “not going to go after his enemies,” despite it being a common campaign refrain for the former president.
“So all this hyperbole trying to scare people, it’s nonsense,” Johnson said. “That’s not going to happen. We’re going to follow the law.”

CNN,Fact check: Watch out for these election night falsehoods | CNN Politics,"Donald Trump told lie after lie in his speech on election night in 2020. With the former president running again in 2024, here are 12 possible falsehoods to watch out for on this week’s election night – and perhaps the following days, too.
False declarations of victory
As the votes were still being counted on election night in 2020, Trump wrongly declared that he was the winner of various swing states it turned out he lost – and that he was the winner of the election it turned out he lost.
Fact-checker’s tip: Don’t trust any candidate’s own declarations of victory. Instead, wait for major media outlets’ unofficial projections (popularly known as “calls”) of the winner of each state and the election.
False claims that Harris couldn’t possibly have won legitimately
It’s very possible that Trump wins this election. But if Vice President Kamala Harris wins, Trump might well revive his pre-November false claims that the only way Harris could possibly prevail is through cheating.
Fact-checker’s tip: Know that this claim is nonsense. Opinion polls have consistently found that Trump and Harris are locked in a close race. It could be won, fair and square, by either of them.
False claims that out-of-context videos show nefarious behavior
Social media is awash in posts that misleadingly describe what is happening in election-related videos. In 2020 and beyond, for example, Trump and his allies claimed that a video had captured flagrant illegality by two Georgia election workers who were actually doing nothing wrong.
Fact-checker’s tip: Before you believe that a video shows what a caption on social media claims it shows, seek information from the feeds of state and local elections authorities and state and local journalists.
False claims that good-faith errors were malicious
In 2020, a small Michigan county made an error in its initial reporting of the votes, reporting Trump votes as if they were Biden votes – and Trump and his allies used that mistake, which was promptly corrected, as a primary basis for a sprawling conspiracy theory baselessly alleging that voting technology had been rigged to steal the election.
Fact-checker’s tip: Know that there is always a smattering of initial mistakes when counties around the country are processing and reporting more than 150 million votes. Human error is always more likely than a conspiracy; seek proof before attributing these errors to malicious intent.
False claims that Democratic-dominated cities engage in massive cheating
Trump has falsely claimed for years that overwhelmingly Democratic cities with large Black populations, such as Philadelphia, Detroit, Milwaukee and Atlanta, are rife with election fraud.
Fact-checker’s tip: Demand proof for any such claims made in 2024. Know there was no evidence of any widespread voter fraud, or any cheating by the elections authorities, in any Democratic-dominated city or state in 2020.
False claims that normal late-night reporting of votes is suspicious
Trump has repeatedly claimed that there was something amiss about supposed “dumps” of votes in the overnight hours of election night in 2020. In reality, those were just normal votes being counted as usual and added to the public totals as soon as possible.
Fact-checker’s tip: Know that counting votes takes time, especially in populous urban counties with large numbers of voters, and that it’s standard, not suspicious, for some votes to be reported after midnight on election night. Also know that Republican state senators in the swing states of Wisconsin and Pennsylvania declined to pass legislative proposals between last election and this election that would have allowed for a faster count.
False claims that vote-counting after Election Day is suspicious
Trump, who infamously called in 2020 to “STOP THE COUNT” when the count showed him with temporary leads over Biden, has sometimes baselessly called into question the legitimacy of counting votes after election night.
Fact-checker’s tip: Know that the count always continues after election night. While media outlets often “call” races on election night, those “calls” are unofficial projections based on incomplete data. The official count proceeds until all valid votes are counted.
False claims that mail-in ballots are rife with fraud
Trump has for four years made false claims about mail-in ballots, wrongly claiming they are rife with fraud.
Fact-checker’s tip: Know that there is no evidence of widespread fraud with mail-in ballots; while experts say there is marginally more fraud with these ballots than with in-person voting, it’s still a minuscule percentage of votes. Also, Trump himself encouraged supporters to vote by mail this year even as he has continued to criticize mail-in ballots.
False claims that ballots accepted after Election Day are illegitimate
Trump suggested in 2020 that mail-in ballots that are received after Election Day are illegitimate and should not be counted.
Fact-checker’s tip: Know that there is nothing illegitimate about these ballots.
Some of them are votes by servicemembers and other citizens living overseas, who get extended return deadlines in many states. Others can also be lawful votes: even some states run by Republicans, including Utah, West Virginia and Ohio, allow ballots from citizens living in the US to be counted even if they arrive a certain number of days after Election Day, as long as they are postmarked by the deadline on or before Election Day. (Of this year’s seven swing states, however, Nevada is the only one that doesn’t require mail-in ballots to arrive by the evening of Election Day.)
False claims that there is no verification of military and overseas voters
Trump baselessly claimed in September that Democrats were using military and overseas ballots to cheat in the election, wrongly saying these ballots are sent to people whose identities have not been checked.
Fact-checker’s tip: Know that the identities of these voters were verified by their local elections offices when they registered to vote.
False claims that noncitizens are voting en masse
Trump has falsely claimed for years that large numbers of noncitizens are casting illegal votes in presidential elections. For example, even after he won the 2016 election, he incorrectly asserted that millions of undocumented immigrants had voted in California.
Fact-checker’s tip: Know that these claims are false. There are a tiny number of known cases of illegal voting by noncitizens – and nonpartisan experts on election law say such cases are almost always caught, thanks to layers of identity verification built into the registration and voting process.
False claims about voter registration applications in Pennsylvania
In the week leading up to Election Day, Trump has falsely claimed that more than 2,000 phony “votes” were discovered in a single county in Pennsylvania.
Fact-checker’s tip: Know that the issue in this county did not involve actual votes. Rather, these were voter registration applications that were thought to be suspicious and placed under investigation.",2024-11-02
CNN,Liz Cheney ties House GOP chaos to Trump’s behavior | CNN Politics,"Republican former Rep. Liz Cheney on Sunday tied the “dangerous” House GOP chaos to former President Donald Trump’s behavior and the Republicans supporting him.
“I wish that it were surprising. You know, what we’ve seen is a result of really the leadership decisions that Kevin McCarthy made back after the 2020 election and certainly after January 6. And, you know, looking the other way in the face of the kind of assault on our democracy that we’ve seen from Donald Trump and his allies in the House,” Cheney told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.”
Her comments come amid the House GOP’s high-stakes speakership battle after McCarthy was ousted more than two weeks ago. Rep. Jim Jordan on Friday became the latest to exit the race, prompting a crowded candidate field to seek the speakership.
Frustrations and divisions have only intensified within the conference as Republicans search for a way to resolve the impasse. That, along with the GOP’s narrow majority, has made it increasingly unclear whether any candidate will be able to secure the 217 votes needed to win the gavel on the House floor.
Cheney, who was one of Trump’s strongest critics in Congress, said Sunday she has also “been watching the extent to which political violence and the threats of violence have now reared their head once again. Those have become part of our politics in a way that certainly they never should.”
Several Republicans who opposed Jordan’s House speakership bid said they experienced angry calls, menacing messages and even death threats since casting their votes.
“Now, that kind of acceptance of violence is completely inappropriate and dangerous in our politics. So, I – we need people who are serious and who recognize and understand the dangers that we’re facing globally, as well as from Donald Trump and those who support him,” she said.
Trump, Cheney added, “is the single most dangerous threat we face” as a nation.
“He cannot be the next president. If he is, all of the things that he attempted to do but was stopped from doing by responsible people around him at the Department of Justice, at the White House Counsel’s office, he will do. There will be no guardrails and everyone has been warned.”

CNN,US says it expects North Korean troops to enter combat against Ukraine in the coming days | CNN Politics,"As many as 8,000 North Korean troops are in Russia’s Kursk region and are expected to enter combat against Ukraine in the coming days, top US officials announced Thursday.
Secretary of State Antony Blinken, speaking alongside Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and their South Korean counterparts in Washington, said the troops have been trained “in artillery, UAVs, basic infantry operations, including trench clearing, indicating that they fully intend to use these forces in frontline operations.”
Although the US has not yet seen the troops engaged in the actual fighting, Blinken warned Thursday that “should these troops engage in combat or combat support operations against Ukraine, they would become legitimate military targets.”
The 8,000 North Korean troops now in Kursk represent a majority of the 10,000 the US says were deployed to Russia. The announcement of their impending use in combat comes as the US and its allies weigh how to respond to the escalating military partnership between Moscow and Pyongyang.
“We are consulting closely with our allies and partners in other countries in the region on these reckless developments and on our response,” Austin said at Thursday’s press conference. The US will announce additional military support to Ukraine “in the coming days,” Blinken said.
Ukrainian forces have held territory in Kursk since launching a surprise incursion into the Russian border region in August. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who called for South Korea to take a more active role in supporting Kyiv, warned Thursday that when the North Korean troops are deployed, “they will be pushed forward, sustaining heavy losses, as Russia tries to minimize its own troop mobilization.”
Asked if he believed Ukraine would be able to hold its territory in Kursk with the additional North Korean forces deployed to the region, Austin said the “answer is yes.”
Russian troops have suffered heavy losses throughout the more than two years of full-scale war against Ukraine. The US defense secretary noted Thursday that the number of North Korean troops sent to Kursk “pales in comparison” to the number of casualties Russia sees regularly.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Friday praised what he called “very close contacts” with the North Korean military and intelligence services.
“This helps to solve very important tasks for the security of our and your citizens,” Lavrov said at the start of a meeting with his North Korean counterpart Choe Son Hui.
The meeting in Moscow marked the sixth time the Russian and North Korean foreign ministers are meeting this year, according to Lavrov.
On Thursday, Blinken and Austin redoubled their calls for China to use its influence with North Korea to stem its “provocative actions.”
“We’ve had communications with China – in fact, we had a robust conversation just this week, and I think they know well the concerns that we have and the expectations that, both in word and deed, they’ll use the influence that they have to work to curb these activities,” the top US diplomat said. He added that Beijing should be concerned by the deepening cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow.
“We’re very focused on and concerned about what Russia might be doing in order to enhance the (North Korean) capacities, its military capacity – that too should be a real concern to China, because it’s profoundly destabilizing in the region,” Blinken noted.
“I’m surprised by China’s silence” on North Korea’s support for Russia, Zelensky said in an interview with South Korea’s KBS. “I can’t say that China is on our side, but as a regional security guarantor, its silence is striking.”

CNN,Senate Democrats reject offer from GOP donor friend of Clarence Thomas for 5 years of financial records | CNN Politics,"Senate Democrats rejected Thursday an offer from by GOP megadonor Harlan Crow to supply the Judiciary Committee with some information related to the travel and luxury vacations he gifted to Justice Clarence Thomas over the past five years.
In a letter signed by the committee’s Democratic majority, the senators said Crow’s proposal is an insufficient “partial” compromise to the committee’s questions that would leave out information they believe necessary to “inform the Committee’s ongoing legislative efforts” for Supreme Court ethics reform.
Crow’s relationship with Thomas has been under the spotlight since ProPublica published a series of reports detailing luxury travel that Thomas received from Crow, as well as a private 2014 real estate deal with Thomas’ family. The real estate transaction and the bulk of the hospitality went unreported on Thomas’ annual financial disclosures, as did Crow’s reported payments for the tuition of a grandnephew of Thomas. Earlier this fall, Thomas amended past disclosure reports to reflect more trips with Crow as well as the real estate deal.
Thursday’s letter reveals that a lawyer for Crow had agreed to provide information to the Senate Judiciary Committee covering only the last five years of their friendship. The proposed response would not include – as the committee had requested – an itemized list of all gifts, payments and items of value exceeding $415, as well as real estate transactions between the two men over their more than two-decade long friendship.
In exchange for the information, according to the letter, the committee would have to “forego any further inquiries” into Crow’s dealing with Thomas, including follow-up questions.
“Receiving only partial responses during this arbitrary time period is insufficient to inform the Committee’s ongoing legislative efforts,” Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin wrote in a letter signed by nine other members Thursday. He added that Crow had until October 19 to put forward a renewed offer.
“It is disappointing that after many months of good faith efforts to voluntarily cooperate with the Judiciary Committee despite serious constitutional concerns about its inquiry, members of one party forced the committee to reject a mutually respectful compromise,” the Office of Harlan Crow said in a statement.
“The committee’s rejection of a reasonable compromise offered in the spirit of transparency underscores that this is a political campaign designed to discredit a sitting Supreme Court Justice and not a legitimate effort to legislate,” the statement said.
Last spring, Michael Bopp, a lawyer for Crow, questioned whether the committee has the authority to launch such an investigation because, he said, it lacks a valid legislative purpose. He said he would meet with staff to discuss questions regarding the interactions between his client and Thomas.
“We respect the Senate Judiciary Committee’s important role in formulating legislation concerning our federal courts system, and would welcome a discussion with your staff,” Bopp wrote.
Over the summer there had been sporadic meetings between lawyers and staff, according to a source, but Thursday’s letter marks a new escalation of tension as the justices have started a new term.
The committee also sent letters to conservative activist Leonard Leo, who refused last summer to provide Democratic lawmakers with information regarding his interactions with Justice Samuel Alito, who attended a luxury fishing trip with him in 2008 and took a ride on a private jet owned by a conservative hedge fund manager. In a letter in July, Leo’s lawyer said the congressional inquiry “exceeds the limits placed by the Constitution on the Committees investigative authority” and is tainted by partisan politics.
The senators rejected Leo’s arguments that the committee’s inquiry amounted to political retaliation – calling the charge a “frivolous mischaracterization.”
“Specifically, the Committee has been examining how the current ethical framework governing federal judges fails to capture the full scope of previously undisclosed gifts, transportation and lodging made available to Supreme Court justices by parties with business before the Court,” the Democrats wrote.

CNN,CNN Poll: Most voters don’t think Trump will concede if he loses the 2024 election | CNN Politics,"Most voters think former President Donald Trump will not concede if he loses the 2024 presidential election, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS, with a sizable minority of his backers saying losing candidates have no obligation to do so. And should legal challenges related to the election find their way to the Supreme Court, a majority of all voters has little or no confidence in the high court to make the right decisions.
Overall, just 30% of registered voters think Trump will accept the results of the election and concede if he loses, while 73% say that Vice President Kamala Harris would accept an election loss.
Most registered voters (54%) believe that Harris would concede if she lost and that Trump would not, while 18% say that both candidates would do so, 15% that neither of them would, and only 11% that Harris would not concede but Trump would.
Homing in on each candidate’s supporters, a near-universal 97% of Harris supporters expect her to concede if she loses, while a much smaller 57% majority of Trump’s supporters believe he would acknowledge a loss.
That 57% represents an uptick from July, when just half of Trump’s supporters thought he would concede a loss – a shift that comes even as his campaign has laid the groundwork to weaken confidence in America’s election system and claim victory regardless of the results in November.
Harris supporters are broadly unified in their perceptions of what the candidates would do: More than 9 in 10 Harris supporters say that she would concede, but that Trump would not (92%).
Most Trump supporters think both candidates would handle the situation the same way, but they’re split over which way that would be: Thirty-three percent say both would concede, 26% that neither would. About a quarter (24%) of Trump backers say the former president would concede while Harris would not, and just 15% that Trump would not concede while Harris would.
In general, the vast majority of American voters support the basic principle that candidates have an obligation to accept the results of elections, with 88% saying that losing candidates have an obligation to concede once the results are certified in every state and 12% saying they do not. But that rises to 20% among registered voters who support Trump, compared with only 3% who feel that way among Harris supporters.
A 56% majority of registered voters say they have just some or no trust in the Supreme Court to make the right decisions on any legal cases relating to the 2024 election, little changed from January. There’s a substantial political split, with Trump supporters roughly twice as likely as Harris supporters to express at least a moderate amount of trust in the court, 61% to 31%.
Trust in the court lags among younger voters, with just 8% of voters younger than 35 saying they have a great deal of trust in the court to make decisions on the 2024 election, compared with 21% among voters ages 65 or older. Black voters (9% a great deal of trust), Democrats (4%) and liberal voters (5%) also express minimal trust in the court.
The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS online and by telephone October 20-23, 2024, among 1,704 registered voters nationwide drawn from a probability-based panel. Likely voters include all registered voters in the poll weighted for their predicted likelihood of voting in this year’s election. Results for the full sample of registered voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points; it is 3.1 for likely voters, and larger for subgroups.

CNN,Promises Kamala Harris has made so far in her campaign,"Promises Kamala Harris has made so far in her campaign
Editor's Note: CNN's What Matters newsletter connects the dots of the ever-changing political landscape. Click here to sign up for free.
During her shortened 2024 presidential campaign, Vice President Kamala Harris has crisscrossed the country unveiling how she will address the key issues facing the nation.
In policy proposals, speeches and rallies, she has offered a wide range of ideas aimed at making life more affordable for Americans and promoting a forward-looking vision of “an opportunity economy” that focuses on strengthening the middle class. However, she has not provided many details on her plans, which she has said she’d pay for largely by raising taxes on the wealthy and big companies.
Many of her proposals continue measures put forth by the Biden administration, such as providing tax relief to middle-class and lower-income families, lowering drug costs and making housing more affordable. Like President Joe Biden, she has vowed to protect reproductive freedom and secure the border.
But Harris has aimed to put her own stamp and style on matters ranging from abortion to the economy to immigration – trying to walk a fine line of taking credit for the administration’s accomplishments while not being jointly blamed by voters for its shortcomings. The vice president has also made it clear that she has her own views on some key matters, particularly Israel’s treatment of Gazans in its war with Hamas. And she’s said she may go further than Biden in cracking down on asylum claims.
Harris has also stressed on the campaign trail that she is a capitalist, as she moves away from some of her more notable progressive stances from her 2020 presidential run, such as her interest in a single-payer health insurance system and a ban on fracking.
And she has repeatedly sought to contrast her vision for America with that of former President Donald Trump. (See Trump’s campaign promises here.)
“In this moment, I believe we face a choice between two different visions for our nation: one focused on the future, the other focused on the past,” she told members of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta at an event in Indianapolis in late July. “And with your support, I am fighting for our nation’s future.”
Here’s what we know about Harris’ views:
Economy
High prices are a top concern for many Americans who are struggling to afford the cost of living after a spell of steep inflation. Many voters give Biden poor marks for his handling of the economy, and Harris may also face their wrath.
Harris has talked about the key pillars of her economic vision – particularly strengthening the middle class – on the campaign trail and in an 82-page policy paper that the campaign released in late September. However, she has not provided many details on her proposals.
As part of her economic agenda, Harris wants to counter the increase in food costs, which she argues stems in part from some big grocery chains that are keeping prices high even though their production costs have leveled off.
To do so, she is calling for the first-ever federal ban on price gouging on food and groceries. The policy paper specified that the ban would be aimed at big corporations unfairly exploiting consumers during crises and emergencies to increase their profits and compared Harris’ idea to similar price-gouging bans already in place in 37 states, including Texas and Florida.
Harris would also secure new authority for the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general to investigate and penalize companies that unfairly exploit consumers in the quest for excessive profits on food and groceries.
Also, she has proposed increasing a tax deduction for new small businesses to $50,000, up from $5,000. Plus, she would take several steps to cut the red tape that small businesses face, including creating a standard deduction for them and making it easier for them to operate across state lines.
Harris is also looking to help Black and Latino entrepreneurs and others by providing 1 million fully forgivable loans of up to $20,000 to start or grow a business.
The vice president has also pledged to strengthen the manufacturing sector by creating a new “America Forward” tax credit. It would be targeted at investment and job creation in key strategic industries, according to the policy paper, which mentions steel and iron, biotechnology, artificial intelligence, semiconductors, aerospace, autos and farming. Her investments in American innovation would cost about $100 billion and would be paid for by international tax reform, which Congress must approve.
“We will prioritize investments for strengthening factory towns, retooling existing factories, hiring locally and working with unions because no one that grows up in America's greatest industrial or agricultural centers should be abandoned,” she said during a late September speech in Pittsburgh.
Plus, Harris said she’d double the number of registered apprenticeships by the end of her first term, as well as increase skills-based hiring and eliminate degree requirements.
Her platform also calls for boosting investment in community development financial institutions, or CDFIs, which are dedicated to serving low-income people and communities that are missed by traditional lenders.
Harris has also committed to raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, in keeping with a long-standing Democratic goal. The federal minimum wage has been $7.25 since 2009.
In her campaign speeches, Harris has echoed many of the same economic themes as Biden, saying she wants to give Americans more opportunities to get ahead.
She promised at a late July rally to continue the Biden administration’s drive to eliminate so-called junk fees and to fully disclose all charges, such as for events, lodging and car rentals.
On day one, I will take on price gouging and bring down costs. We will ban more of those hidden fees and surprise late charges that banks and other companies use to pad their profits.”
Taxes
Harris has proposed using tax credits to provide relief to middle class and lower-income Americans. Her plan revives or extends temporary measures that Biden and congressional Democrats enacted in major packages when the party controlled Congress during the first two years of Biden’s term.
Harris’ proposal would restore the American Rescue Plan’s popular expansion of the child tax credit to as much as $3,600, up from $2,000, and call for it to be made permanent. The enhancement was only in effect in 2021.
Her plan would restore the American Rescue Plan’s enhancement of the earned income tax credit, known as the EITC, which increased the maximum credit for workers without dependent children to roughly $1,500. That previous boost was only for 2021.
Plus, the proposal would also add a new child tax credit of up to $6,000 for middle-class and lower-income families with children in their first year of life.
There's one more way I will help families deal with rising costs, and that's by letting you keep more of your hard-earned money.”
And Harris has also promised to end federal income taxes on tips, sparking Trump’s ire that she is copying his campaign promise. Tips would remain subject to payroll taxes under Harris’ plan.
To help pay for these and other measures on her wish list, Harris would raise the corporate tax rate to 28%, up from the current 21% rate set by Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Doing so would raise about $1 trillion over the next decade, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
The vice president also wants to raise the long-term capital gains rate to 28%, up from the current 20% rate, for those earning more than $1 million. That’s a break from Biden’s proposal to increase the capital gains rate to the top rate he wants to levy on ordinary income – 39.6%. High earners are also subject to an additional 3.8% net investment income tax, which Biden wants to lift to 5%.
Harris also said she supports Biden’s Billionaire Minimum Income Tax proposal, which seeks to ensure that those worth more than $100 million pay a federal income tax rate of at least 25% on their income – including unrealized gains on assets, which are not currently taxed.
Plus, she is in favor of quadrupling the tax on stock buybacks to 4%, as the president proposed in his fiscal year 2025 budget.
Housing
Harris has rolled out a three-section plan aimed at addressing the nation’s housing shortage. Parts of it build on proposals that Biden has already unveiled.
The vice president’s plan promises to provide up to $25,000 in down-payment support for first-time homebuyers. The down-payment support would apply to working families who have paid rent on time for two years, with more generous support for first-time homebuyers. The plan would also provide a $10,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers, something Biden proposed earlier this year.
The plan would allow for more than 1 million first-time buyers per year, including first-generation homebuyers, to access the funds, according to her campaign.
Harris is also calling for the building of 3 million new housing units. To spur construction, she would provide a first-ever tax incentive for builders who build starter homes sold to first-time buyers. She also would expand an existing tax incentive for building affordable rental housing.
By the end of my first term, we will end America's housing shortage by building 3 million new homes and rentals that are affordable for the middle class.”
The plan also highlights two main proposals that aim to lower rent costs in the US. The first would block landlords from using algorithm-driven price-setting tools to set rents. The second would discourage wealthy investors from buying up properties and marking up rents in bulk by removing tax benefits for investors who buy large numbers of single-family rental homes.
Health care
Harris’ health care platform builds on the Biden administration’s efforts to reduce prescription drug costs.
She is calling to expand the current $35 monthly cap on out-of-pocket costs for insulin and the upcoming $2,000 annual limit on out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs generally to all Americans, not just Medicare enrollees. These caps were put in place for those on Medicare in the Inflation Reduction Act. The $2,000 limit on Medicare Part D drug costs takes effect in January.
(The three major insulin manufacturers in the US offer price caps or savings programs that lower the cost of insulin to $35 for many patients – a move Biden pushed for in his State of the Union address last year.)
Harris’ plan would also accelerate the speed of Medicare’s drug price negotiations so that the costs of more medications come down faster. The Biden administration just announced the results of the first-ever round of negotiations, which is expected to result in $6 billion in savings for Medicare and a $1.5 billion reduction in out-of-pocket costs for seniors when the lower prices take effect in 2026.
The vice president would use some of that savings to establish a Medicare at Home program, which would provide home health aides to enrollees who cannot independently handle activities of daily living, such as bathing and eating. In addition, Harris is proposing that Medicare cover hearing aids and exams, eye exams, and new glasses and lenses.
Also, as part of her plan to help rural communities, Harris would recruit 10,000 health care professionals by expanding scholarships, loan forgiveness and other programs for doctors and nurses who will work in rural and tribal areas. In addition, she would launch a new grant program to train and fund community health workers in rural areas and expand grants to community and rural health centers.
Harris also supports expanding rural telehealth services by permanently extending Medicare coverage of telehealth benefits and by doubling federal funding for telehealth equipment and technology.
Plus, she is calling to reduce the number of “ambulance deserts” by increasing funding and technical support for emergency medical technicians and first responders, as well as providing more resources for ambulances, lifesaving equipment and first-responder stations. And she would give grants to volunteer ambulance programs.
Consumer debt
Hefty debt loads, which weigh on people’s finances and hurt their ability to buy homes, get car loans or start small businesses, are also an area of interest to Harris.
In her economic plan, she pledged to work with states to cancel medical debt for millions of Americans and help them avoid falling behind on health care bills in the future. States and municipalities have used American Rescue Plan funds to cancel $7 billion of medical debt for up to 3 million Americans, according to the campaign.
Harris has been a leader in the White House’s efforts to ban medical debt from credit reports, noting that those with medical debt are no less likely to repay a loan than those who don’t have unpaid medical bills.
Also, as vice president, she has promoted the Biden administration’s initiatives on student debt, which have so far approved more than $175 billion of student loan forgiveness for nearly 5 million people. “We are fighting, and I’m going to continue to fight for student debt relief,” Harris said during an interview in early October.
A potential Harris administration could keep that momentum going – though some of Biden’s efforts have gotten tangled up in litigation, such as a repayment plan that lowers monthly payments and shortens the time it takes to receive student loan relief.
Abortion
Harris took on the lead role of championing abortion rights for the administration after Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022. This past January, she started a “reproductive freedoms tour” to multiple states, including a stop in Minnesota thought to be the first by a sitting US president or vice president at an abortion clinic.
On abortion access, Harris embraced more progressive policies than Biden in the 2020 campaign, as a candidate criticizing his previous support for the Hyde Amendment, a measure that blocks federal funds from being used for most abortions.
Policy experts suggested that although Harris’ current policies on abortion and reproductive rights may not differ significantly from Biden’s, as a result of her national tour and her own focus on maternal health, she may be a stronger messenger.
Climate
Harris has been a champion on climate and environmental justice for decades. As California’s attorney general, Harris sued big oil companies like BP and ConocoPhillips, and investigated Exxon Mobil for its role in climate change disinformation. While in the Senate, she sponsored the Green New Deal resolution.
During her 2020 campaign, she enthusiastically supported a ban on fracking — but a Harris campaign official said in late July that she no longer supports such a ban.
Fracking is the process of using liquid to free natural gas from rock formations – and the primary mode for extracting gas for energy in battleground Pennsylvania. During a September 2019 climate crisis town hall hosted by CNN, she said she would start “with what we can do on Day 1 around public lands.” She walked that back later when she became Biden’s running mate.
Biden has been the most pro-climate president in history, and climate advocates find Harris to be an exciting candidate in her own right. Democrats and climate activists are planning to campaign on the stark contrasts between Harris and Trump, who vowed to push America decisively back to fossil fuels, promising to unwind Biden’s climate and clean energy legacy and pull America out of its global climate commitments.
If elected, one of the biggest climate goals Harris would have to craft early in her administration is how much the US would reduce its climate pollution by 2035 – a requirement of the Paris climate agreement.
Immigration
Harris has repeatedly tried to counter Trump’s attacks on her immigration record.
Her campaign released a video in late July citing Harris’ support for increasing the number of Border Patrol agents, and she has often called out Trump’s successful push to scuttle a bipartisan immigration deal that included some of the toughest border security measures in recent memory.
The vice president has changed her position on border control since her 2020 campaign, when she suggested that Democrats needed to “critically examine” the role of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, after being asked whether she sided with those in the party arguing to abolish the department.
In June of this year, the White House announced a crackdown on asylum claims meant to continue reducing crossings at the US-Mexico border. Harris has said that she would maintain Biden’s crackdown on asylum claims – and potentially go further.
Trump’s attacks stem from Biden having tasked Harris with overseeing diplomatic efforts in Central America in March 2021. While Harris focused on long-term fixes, the Department of Homeland Security remained responsible for overseeing border security.
She has only occasionally talked about her efforts as the situation along the US-Mexico border became a political vulnerability for Biden. But she put her own stamp on the administration’s efforts, engaging the private sector.
Harris pulled together the Partnership for Central America, which has acted as a liaison between companies and the US government. Her team and the partnership are closely coordinating on initiatives that have led to job creation in the region. Harris has also engaged directly with foreign leaders in the region.
Experts credit Harris’ ability to secure private-sector investments as her most visible action in the region to date but have cautioned about the long-term durability of those investments.
Israel-Hamas
The Israel-Hamas war is the most fraught foreign policy issue facing the country and has spurred a multitude of protests around the US since it began in October 2023.
After meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in late July, Harris gave a forceful and notable speech about the situation in Gaza. She echoed Biden’s repeated comments about the “ironclad support” and “unwavering commitment” to Israel, as well as the need to get the Israeli hostages back from Hamas captivity. The country has a right to defend itself, she said, while noting, “how it does so, matters.”
However, the empathy she expressed regarding the Palestinian plight and suffering was far more forceful than what Biden has said on the matter in recent months. Harris mentioned twice the “serious concern” she expressed to Netanyahu about the civilian deaths in Gaza, the humanitarian situation and destruction she called “catastrophic” and “devastating.”
She went on to describe “the images of dead children and desperate hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time,” and said, “I will not be silent.”
But when describing the ceasefire deal in the works, she didn’t highlight the hostage for prisoner exchange or aid to be let into Gaza. Instead, she singled out the fact that the deal stipulates the withdrawal by the Israeli military from populated areas in the first phase before withdrawing “entirely” from Gaza before “a permanent end to the hostilities.”
Harris didn’t preside over Netanyahu’s speech to Congress in late July, instead choosing to stick with a prescheduled trip to a sorority event in Indiana.
The vice president continued calling out the plight of the people in Gaza, as well as the need to free the Israeli hostages and secure a ceasefire deal, in her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in August.
President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.”
Ukraine
Harris is committed to supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression, having met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at least six times and announcing earlier this year $1.5 billion for energy assistance, humanitarian needs and other aid for the war-torn country.
At the Munich Security Conference earlier this year, Harris said: “I will make clear President Joe Biden and I stand with Ukraine. In partnership with supportive, bipartisan majorities in both houses of the United States Congress, we will work to secure critical weapons and resources that Ukraine so badly needs. And let me be clear: The failure to do so would be a gift to Vladimir Putin.”
More broadly, NATO is central to our approach to global security. For President Biden and me, our sacred commitment to NATO remains ironclad. And I do believe, as I have said before, NATO is the greatest military alliance the world has ever known.”
Police funding
The Harris campaign has also walked back the “defund the police” sentiment that Harris voiced in 2020. What she meant is she supports being “tough and smart on crime,” Mitch Landrieu, national co-chair for the Harris campaign and former mayor of New Orleans, told CNN’s Pamela Brown in late July.
In the midst of nationwide 2020 protests sparked by George Floyd’s murder by a Minneapolis police officer, Harris voiced support for the “defund the police” movement, which argues for redirecting funds from law enforcement to social services. Throughout that summer, Harris supported the movement and called for demilitarizing police departments.

CNN,Amy Coney Barrett: Supreme Court ethics code would be a good idea | CNN Politics,"Amy Coney Barrett on Monday became the latest Supreme Court justice to address ethics concerns, saying that she thought it would be a “good idea” for the justices to adopt a formal code of conduct that would directly bind the justices.
Her comments came during an appearance that was briefly interrupted by protesters at University of Minnesota Law School in a talk moderated by Professor Robert A. Stein. “Not the Court, not the State, People must decide their fate,” chanted the protesters, who appeared to make reference to her controversial vote last year to overturn Roe v. Wade – a decision that has triggered protests nationwide.
When the talk resumed, Barrett confirmed that the justices have been discussing ethics concerns and are committed to holding themselves to the “highest standards.”
It would be a “good idea” to adopt a formal code, she said, “particularly so that we can communicate to the public exactly what it is that we are doing in a clearer way than perhaps we have been able to do so far.”
She stressed there is “unanimity among all nine justices that we should and do hold ourselves to the highest ethical standards possible.”
Although Barrett didn’t address specific concerns, news reports over the last several months have detailed alleged ethics lapses on the part of some of the justices and Democrats in Congress are pushing for legislation that would enforce a code conduct.
Other justices have confirmed in recent months that talks about ethics are ongoing, although no concrete steps have been announced. Barrett said she couldn’t speak to the timing of any announcement.
Barrett, who voted with her conservative colleagues last year to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that established a constitutional right to an abortion, was also asked about when a justice should vote to overturn precedent.
She said that there are several considerations a judge thinks about when voting to overrule precedent, including the “effects of that error” on the law today and whether the error “has distorted other areas of the law.”
“Overturning precedent is not something to be done lightly,” Barrett said.
On a different note, Barrett, who has seven children, also spoke of the perils of being a working mother – noting that she shares the same struggles as many working parents.
She recounted a morning last term where one of her children had been listening to the Baha Men’s “Who let the dogs out” just before the school bus arrived.
Hours later, Barrett confessed, she found herself walking down the austere marble hallways of the court humming the hit because she couldn’t get it out of her head.
Motherhood, Barrett said, is very “grounding” and keeps her “very much rooted in real life.”
Asked if she was enjoying herself on the high court, Barrett said the job has its “ups and downs” and that she feels a “grave responsibility” at times.
“Enjoying myself is not quite the word I would use, but it is a privilege to serve, and I have no regrets about undertaking the service, and I am fully conscious that everything I am doing is very important for the people of America and those are the people for whom I work,” she said.

CNN,Democratic divisions over Israel heat up over Gaza hospital blast controversy | CNN Politics,"Democrats on Capitol Hill are furious over Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib’s refusal to retract or add new context to her statements blaming Israel for the deadly blast that devastated a Gaza hospital, killing hundreds of people and setting off a regional backlash against the US and Israel.
Tlaib’s initial social media posts reflected the early Hamas-sourced reports out of Gaza. But those reports are now at odds with initial American intelligence, which subsequently concluded that the Israel Defense Forces were not responsible for the explosion.
The dispute has laid bare long-standing and increasingly passionate disagreements among congressional Democrats over the party’s relationship with Israel – and, now, how to position the party as the deadly conflict in Israel and Gaza escalates.
Mainstream Democrats, led by President Joe Biden, continue to insist on staunch support for Israel, while some progressive House members are becoming more insistent that the US aggressively push for a ceasefire and hold Israel accountable for alleged war crimes against Palestinians. And within the progressive bloc too, high-profile members such as New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have occasionally diverged, at least rhetorically, from their ideological allies and have spoken in more cautious, conciliatory tones. The political director for Rep. Ro Khanna, another influential progressive, resigned because the California Democrat did not sign a resolution calling for a ceasefire.
Tlaib, a Palestinian American and a longtime advocate for Palestinian rights, has been the most outspoken critic of Israel in Congress since her election in 2018. Her insistence on blaming Israel for the blast, which the US believes was struck by an errant rocket launched by extremist group Islamic Jihad, has roiled colleagues determined to present a united front at a harrowing time.
“That’s a vile position to take,” Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz told CNN, suggesting that Tlaib should review intelligence made available to House members. “She should at least pull those tweets down, instead of remaining entrenched in a position that is dangerous and unacceptable.”
Democrats have mostly been measured in their public comments about Tlaib, expressing frustration with her unyielding position in light of the conflicting reports and new evidence that Israel was not responsible for the hospital blast while also blaming the media over its coverage of the tragedy.
“When Israel makes statements, they have to show satellite imagery and all sorts of video. But when Hamas says something, the entire media world ran with it.” Florida Rep. Jared Moskowitz said. “It caused riots in all sorts of countries. It caused meetings to be canceled for the president. And so everyone has to be careful before they just react, and wait for things to be confirmed.”
But the effort to project unity could soon become untenable – and the divisions are becoming more personal.
According to a source with knowledge of the complaints, some Jewish Democrats have privately complained to Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries’ team about comments from Tlaib and Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, who initially echoed reports blaming Israel for the hospital attack before posting additional context about the hospital explosion and acknowledging the US intelligence assessment. (Jeffries has embraced the US and Israeli intelligence conclusions and a spokesperson said in a statement that Jeffries, like Biden, backs Israel’s “unequivocal right to defend itself against Hamas under the established rules of war and strongly disagrees with any effort to blame President Joe Biden or the policies of his administration.”)
Tlaib’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the matter, but the Michigan Democrat appeared at a Wednesday rally on Capitol Hill and continued to blame Israel.
“That’s what’s been really painful – just continue to watch people think it’s OK to bomb a hospital, where children,” Tlaib said. “What’s so hard sometimes is watching those videos and the people telling the kids, ‘Don’t cry.’ But like, let them cry. And they’re shaking, and somebody – you know this – they keep telling them not to cry in Arabic. They can cry, I can cry, we all can cry. If we’re not crying, something is wrong.”
“People are furious,” one House Democrat told CNN about the reaction to Tlaib’s comments. “The intelligence that we’ve received is clear. Do you believe Hamas’ intel or do you believe the United States’ intelligence?”
There’s now a push among some House Democrats to convince Tlaib to get an intelligence briefing on the hospital strike, according to the source.
Another House Democrat felt that Tlaib’s comments were frustrating but not entirely unexpected and that her colleagues are taking different approaches to addressing them. Some have been speaking out publicly while others are giving Tlaib space to walk back her comments.
Some Democrats pointed to a social media post by Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman as summing up the way a lot of them are feeling right now.
“It’s truly disturbing that Members of Congress rushed to blame Israel for the hospital tragedy in Gaza,” Fetterman wrote. ” Who would take the word of a group that just massacred innocent Israeli citizens over our key ally?”
Another Democratic aide, though, argued that the pushback against Tlaib and Omar undermined the Democratic Party’s brand.
“Part of being a ‘diversity party’ and a ‘big tent party’ includes bringing new voices who have been marginalized into the party,” the aide said. “And Muslim Americans have been some of the most marginalized people in American life for the past two decades.”
“No one in Congress is denying the horror of Hamas or the horror of the thousands of Israelis killed and the largest attack on Jews since the Holocaust,” the aide said, adding that the frustration among Muslim Americans – and some Jewish Americans – lies in “one side with very little political power receiving all of the outrage.”
Former House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, downplayed the discord in the caucus.
“Name me more than four people,” Hoyer told CNN, in an apparent reference to the original “squad” of Tlaib, Omar, Ocasio Cortez and Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley. “Do we have some people that have a different view? We do. But it’s not the position of the party.”
But the ranks of the dissenters have grown since then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi first offered a similarly dismissive assessment of the squad members in 2019. Progressives now make up a growing share of the House Democratic Caucus. More than a dozen Democratic members have so far publicly called for a ceasefire, including those who signed a proposed resolution by Missouri Rep. Cori Bush, a newer squad member.
“I am grieving for every Palestinian, Israeli, and American life lost to this violence, and my heart breaks for all those who will be forever traumatized because of it,” Bush said in an accompanying statement. “War and retaliatory violence doesn’t achieve accountability or justice; it only leads to more death and human suffering.”",2023-10-20

CNN projects who will win races as data becomes available.
While some noncompetitive states could be projected shortly after their polls close, others could take hours.
The map is situated so that former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, could see his side of the electoral vote count grow rapidly after early poll closings, particularly if there are earlier projections for more populous red states like Florida and Ohio.
Some of the biggest vote mines for Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, have polls that close later, including California and New York.
Here’s a look at when polls close and how many electoral votes are at stake each hour:
7 p.m. ET
Polls close statewide in the first six states, including the battleground of Georgia, which has 16 electoral votes. Who knows when there will be enough data to project a winner in any of these states.
It’s also important to note that polls in some parts of Indiana and Kentucky close earlier, at 6 p.m. ET. It will take some time for projections even in some more solidly red or blue states. Most polls also close in Florida at 7 p.m., but the panhandle closes at 8 p.m. and no statewide projections will occur before all polls close in a state.
Georgia’s secretary of state has said there up to 70% of votes could be counted by 8 p.m. because of early voting and pre-processing of mail-in ballots.
- 28 electoral votes lean toward Trump: Indiana, Kentucky and South Carolina
- 16 electoral votes lean toward Harris: Virginia and Vermont

CNN,Supreme Court allows Biden administration to continue fully enforcing ghost gun regulations | CNN Politics,"The Supreme Court on Monday allowed the Biden administration to continue regulating so-called ghost guns – untraceable homemade weapons – as firearms under federal law.
The court’s brief order grants the Justice Department’s request to wipe away a lower court order and allow the regulations to remain in effect while a legal challenge brought by firearm manufacturers continues to play out in the lower courts.
There were no noted dissents to the order.
Ghost guns are kits that a user can buy online to assemble a fully functional firearm. They have no serial numbers, do not require background checks and provide no transfer records for easy traceability. Critics say they are attractive to people who are legally prohibited from buying firearms.
In the Justice Department’s emergency application to the justices, Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar pointed out that a district court judge had essentially ignored an order the Supreme Court issued just two months ago.
Back in August, a 5-4 court sided with the Biden administration in a challenge brought by a group of manufacturers and allowed the regulations to remain in effect while legal challenges play out. At the time, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Amy Coney Barrett sided with the liberal justices in the government’s favor.
After the order was issued, however, a district court judge based in Texas stepped in to block the regulations as applied to two manufacturers. The injunction was then largely upheld by the conservative 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals.
In an unusually sharp filing, Prelogar told the justices in an emergency application that the district court and the 5th Circuit “have effectively countermanded this Court’s authoritative determination about the status quo that should prevail during appellate proceedings in this case.”
The court “should not tolerate that affront,” she wrote.
“Although there’s no explanation for today’s ruling, it’s hard to see it as anything other than a repudiation of the lower courts for not correctly reading the tea leaves of the court’s August ruling that froze a similar injunction,” said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law. “In that sense, it’s just the latest in an increasing line of rulings by the Supreme Court pushing back against district courts in Texas and the 5th Circuit.”
Prelogar called the lower court ruling “a grave threat to public safety because the lack of background checks makes ghost guns uniquely appealing to felons, minors, and other prohibited persons – and because when ghost guns are inevitably used in crime, they are essentially impossible to trace.”
In 2022, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives updated its regulations to define the kits as firearms under the law so that the government could more carefully track them.
The rule does not prohibit the sale or possession of any ghost gun kit, nor does it block an individual from purchasing such a kit. Instead, it requires compliance with federal laws that impose conditions on the commercial sale of firearms. Those conditions include requirements that commercial manufacturers and sellers mark products with serial numbers and keep records to allow law enforcement to trace firearms used in crimes.",2023-10-16
CNN,Uncertainty looms for future aid to Ukraine and Israel as speaker drama continues | CNN Politics,"As the search for a speaker continues, some House Republicans are already casting doubt over the future of the administration’s $105 billion security supplemental request for aid to Ukraine, Israel, the southern border and Taiwan, a major issue that any future speaker will have to contend with.
A number of Republican rank-and-file members in the House have made clear that the administration’s request won’t survive their chamber without changes and many House Republicans have already said that additional funding for border security isn’t enough without a policy overhaul, which would likely be a red line for many Senate Democrats.
“This is a hell no. And no one in the House GOP should support it. It’s asinine, unpaid for, ineffective and dangerous,” Rep. Chip Roy of Texas posted on X about the supplemental request.
Other Republicans who support parts of the request blasted the administration for trying to tie Israel funding to funding for Ukraine, which has seen cratering support in recent months.
“Israel deserves to have a conversation that is devoted to them right now,” Republican Rep. Mike Garcia of California, a defense appropriator, told CNN. “We need to strip out the Ukraine funding and we need to give the Israeli partners the respect they deserve.”
Even those who have backed Ukraine aid and have pledged to support it in the future want to understand why the administration is asking for so much.
“It seems like a lot,” Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska said. “I’d like to see the breakout of the needs. I want to support it, but that seems like a lot of money.”
There is broad bipartisan support for Ukraine, but funding the military efforts there has become a flashpoint for conservatives and an issue that will likely bedevil a future speaker just as it had former Speaker Kevin McCarthy. The administration’s request included more than $60 billion in assistance for Ukraine with over $14 billion for Israel. The Israel funding will likely move quickly in the House, but it’s very likely that the future speaker would decouple the requests so they are voted on individually.
The tightrope any future speaker will walk is that the Republican conference is divided over sending additional aid to Ukraine. On the one hand, hardliners derided McCarthy for his support of the country early on in the war and McCarthy had remained publicly noncommittal about putting a future aid package on the floor. But there are some members for whom support Ukraine is an essential issue.
“I support Ukraine and Israel. I think we should do both,” Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania said. “I think we should do whatever gets both of them across the finish line, whatever strategy works best. I don’t want to hold back one for the other. I support both.”
To this point, the supplemental request has been overshadowed by a chaotic search for House speaker, but it may come into focus soon as the Senate prepares to take up the request quickly.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has made clear he hopes to take up the supplemental request as soon as possible.
“This legislation is too important to wait for the House to settle their chaos. Senate Democrats will move expeditiously on this request, and we hope that our Republican colleagues across the aisle will join us to pass this much-needed funding,” Schumer said.
The Senate Appropriations Committee has scheduled a hearing for October 31 to review the request and will hear from Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who are expected to testify and make the case for why the money is necessary.
But the House cannot begin to consider the legislation on the floor in any form until a speaker is selected.",2023-10-23
CNN,House Oversight Committee launches investigation into Coast Guard after CNN report | CNN Politics,"The House Oversight Committee has launched an investigation into the US Coast Guard’s “mishandling of serious misconduct” — including sexual assault, racism and hazing — after CNN exposed that its leaders concealed reports documenting those problems from its workforce, the public and Congress.
The inquiry is the latest in a string of government probes announced in the wake of CNN’s reporting, which revealed the existence of a yearslong investigation that found rapes and other sexual abuse at the Coast Guard Academy had been ignored and, at times, covered up by high-ranking officials. Dubbed “Operation Fouled Anchor,” the internal probe was kept confidential by Coast Guard leaders for years until CNN started making inquiries into the report earlier this year.
Last week, CNN exposed that Coast Guard leaders suppressed yet another report, this time a “Culture of Respect” review from April 2015, that documented racial and gender discrimination and assault across the service.
In a letter sent Friday to the Coast Guard’s leader, Commandant Linda Fagan, House lawmakers lambasted the agency, saying that the Coast Guard “may have obstructed the ability of Congress to carry out constitutionally mandated oversight authority and legislation to address these issues,” “prevented actionable change within the agency” and “likely put more people at risk.”
“[The Coast Guard] only notified Congress about Operation Fouled Anchor and its April 2015 Report when existence of these reports was going to be in the press,” wrote committee Chairman Rep. James Comer and Rep. Glenn Grothman, chairman of the Subcommittee on National Security, the Border, and Foreign Affairs. “The Committee has serious concerns that congressional committees would not have been notified of these reports, and the serious allegations contained within them, if it had not been for the threat of public reporting.”
The announcement comes on the heels of the Coast Guard’s own acknowledgment of past failures in a rare and highly critical internal report issued this week that also orders a series of changes to how the agency handles sexual assault. A number of congressional lawmakers and assault survivors were not satisfied, however, saying the agency still needs to hold past perpetrators and the leaders who covered up their dangerous and criminal behavior accountable – rather than only looking to the future.
The committee requested a litany of documents and information “to assist the Committee in investigating these reports, the withholding of information from Congress, and the inaction of senior leadership to combat misconduct,” including a list of Coast Guard officials involved in the handling of sexual misconduct cases from the time of Fouled Anchor to present.
CNN’s reporting showed that, over the years, alleged perpetrators weren’t being held accountable for misconduct. Many of the problems documented in the Coast Guard’s reports continue to plague the agency, according to interviews with current and former service members.
Meanwhile, a probe by the Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General remains ongoing, as does a Senate inquiry – with a hearing scheduled next week where multiple whistleblowers and survivors of sexual assault and harassment will testify.

CNN,Analysis: House GOP circus embarrasses senior party leaders as the country and the world wait for a speaker | CNN Politics,"House Republicans on Monday open the next act of their Washington farce, desperately searching for a speaker after ousting the incumbent and rejecting two would-be replacements while still clueless about how to dig out of the crisis.
Congress has seen impeachments, fiscal cliffs, government shutdowns and even an insurrection, but the modern Republican Party is surpassing itself with a debacle that is embarrassing senior party leaders and threatens to damage the House GOP’s hopes of saving and expanding upon its tiny majority in 2024. Far from tackling critical bills needed to fund the government, the leaderless House can’t do the basics, like pass a resolution condemning the Hamas attacks in Israel.
At least nine new candidates have signed up to run for speaker ahead of a new selection process this week after Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan folded his futile bid for the job on Friday, following Majority Leader Steve Scalise the week before. The uprising that began nearly three weeks ago with the toppling of Speaker Kevin McCarthy has now weakened three of the most powerful figures in the House GOP. Perhaps a newcomer can change the calculations of the extremists who opposed McCarthy and Scalise and the more moderate battleground district members who doomed the bulldozing Jordan. But there’s no sign yet any of them can win the 217 votes needed in the full chamber to claim the top job. And more importantly, for whoever eventually wins the gavel, the task of making the House a functional legislative body looks impossible after weeks of GOP infighting that cultivated fresh grievances and demands for vengeance.
“You know, getting 217 is obviously going to be very difficult and is the sort of Rubik’s Cube of the answer to all of this,” Ohio Rep. Mike Turner, chairman of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday.
Twisting colored squares together in the right order seems simple by comparison with attempts to unite a House Republican conference unable to comprehend how clownish it looks. Republicans, determined to fight a civil war over fractures in the conservative movement, seem oblivious to the degenerating global stability all around them or the shutdown threat directly in front of them.
The vacuum is rendering one branch of the US government inoperable, since the Senate can’t pass laws without the other chamber. “We need (a speaker) because the House can’t do anything without a speaker,” Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” Sunday.
The imbroglio is far more serious than the classic congressional drama wherein lawmakers procrastinate and work through their political rituals, and then finally get their acts together. In a practical sense, the absence of a speaker means the House cannot support Israel in accordance with a new aid request from President Joe Biden. A critical and bitter debate over new Ukraine funding – $60 billion of which was requested by Biden last week – cannot begin. Before long, the blocked US lifeline could have grave consequences in Ukraine’s war for survival and boost Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is betting US resolve will wane – not a bad wager considering increasing GOP resistance to defending the democratic government in Kyiv.
But forget reverberations overseas. The House meltdown could soon begin to harm millions of Americans. The GOP has wasted three of the precious weeks that it had to solve a spending showdown that could shut down the government by the middle of November. Even if the party suddenly moves quickly toward choosing a new leader, it’s unlikely much serious work gets done this week either.
What the vacant speakership says about the GOP
The empty speaker’s chair offers an eloquent metaphor for how internal political chaos is compromising American leadership. It’s also threatening the more-than-two-centuries-long experiment in self-government by the people that relies ultimately on no one getting everything they want but accepting incremental change. That’s a concept that the modern GOP seems to reject – as evidenced by the claims of Donald Trump and many of his acolytes in the House that they have the right to rule even though the former president’s bid for a second term was rejected by voters in 2020.
The House Republican conference is showing that it cannot even compromise with itself, let alone construct a unified position before eventually accepting the trade-offs that will be needed in dealing with a Democratic-run Senate and White House. Whichever Republican finally wins the speakership will face similar questions to the ones that eventually cost McCarthy his dream job – namely whether to indulge far-right Republicans with extreme spending cuts that the White House and the Senate will never accept, or to avert a government shutdown by advancing stopgap funding with some Democratic votes. Unless a new speaker can change the dynamic, their tenure risks being even shorter than that of the California Republican.
A new speaker will also be hampered by the reality that chaos and a neutered government are a welcome outcome for many grassroots Republicans in a party transformed by Trump. Many of these lawmakers have perfected the extremism that hedges against primary challenges and the cacophony that pleases the ratings-driven demands of conservative media. Influence in the GOP is no longer bought by years of service that paves the way for committee chairmanships. Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, who led the eight Republicans who voted to can McCarthy, understands the equation well – which is one reason why senior figures bemoaning the need to “govern” aren’t persuading rabble-rousing members. The most obvious representative of this style of stunt politics Republicanism is Trump – who, despite being impeached twice, falsely claiming the 2020 election was stolen and facing four criminal trials, is the runaway front-runner for the GOP’s 2024 presidential nomination.
Embarrassed GOP leaders plea for an end to the mess
Sheer fatigue in the House GOP may create an opening for a candidate who could become a weak speaker with no national name recognition but who could attract the least rancor from across the divided conference. Until then, serious Republican legislators in the House only have the power to express dismay as America’s enemies delight in watching US democracy founder.
“This is probably one of the most embarrassing things I’ve seen because if we don’t have a speaker of the House, we can’t govern. And every day that goes by, we’re essentially shut down as a government,” House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, said on ABC News’ “This Week.”
McCarthy, who supported Jordan but is now backing House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, warned on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that the situation cannot be allowed to endure much longer. “This is embarrassing for the Republican Party. It’s embarrassing for the nation, and we need to look at one another and solve the problem,” the former speaker said.
Emmer is among nine GOP candidates seeking to lock down votes ahead of an expected secret ballot to pick a speaker nominee on Tuesday. The Minnesota Republican’s problem, however, is much like McCarthy’s – he is likely to struggle to win the support of the far-right House Freedom Caucus that reviles the GOP leadership team.
The other members throwing their hat into a ring that does not include a single woman are Reps. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma, who chairs the influential Republican Study Committee; Jack Bergman of Michigan, a mainstream conservative and Marine veteran; Austin Scott of Georgia, who launched a last-minute bid against Jordan last week but quickly dropped out; Byron Donalds of Florida, a rising star Freedom Caucus member and one of the few Black Republicans in Congress; Mike Johnson of Louisiana, the GOP conference vice chairman; Pete Sessions of Texas, a congressional veteran who lost his seat in 2018 and soon returned to represent another one; Dan Meuser, a former Pennsylvania secretary of revenue and member of the Problem Solvers Caucus; and Gary Palmer of Alabama, who chairs the Republican Policy Committee.
Newt Gingrich – a former Republican speaker who is credited with inventing back in the 1990s the highly partisan style of hardball governing preferred by today’s GOP – said party leaders must choose anyone who can get to a House majority regardless of who they are, or the charade could go on for weeks. And he warned with critical government funding and budget bills looming, the GOP doesn’t just have to unite on a new speaker but on a new period of unified governance.
“That 217 has to be committed not just to elect a speaker, but to stick together for the next five or six months. They got big decisions coming down the road,” Gingrich told Fox News. “There’s a very real danger that they’ll elect somebody, and three or four or five weeks from now, you’re going to have a group of people blow up and decide to go back into the same mess.
“So they need to pick somebody to get stability.”
Putting aside the irony of those words coming from the firebrand Georgia Republican, the House GOP has shown over the last three weeks that stability is the last thing the party is able, or even wants, to deliver.",2023-10-23

CNN,Analysis: Biden may have handed Trump a big assist with his ‘garbage’ gaffe | CNN Politics,"Joe Biden had largely been an afterthought one week before the election in which he’d once hoped to win a second term.
Not anymore.
With an imprecise attempt to defend Puerto Ricans from attacks at Donald Trump’s Sunday night rally in New York, the president on Tuesday inadvertently injected himself into the home stretch of the campaign and forced Vice President Kamala Harris into clean-up mode.
The gaffe offered Trump an opening to turn headlines away from his own antics that add up to the most extreme closing argument of any modern presidential campaign.
Biden mentioned Puerto Rico, slandered as a “floating island of garbage” by a comedian at Trump’s Madison Square Garden event. But his clumsy defense of the self-governing American territory — and the vital swing voters in its diaspora on the US mainland — sparked a new political firestorm and distracted from Harris’ big closing argument speech against a White House backdrop on Tuesday night.
“And just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico ‘a floating island of garbage.’ Well, let me tell you something … I don’t know the Puerto Rican that I know… or Puerto Rico where I’m – in my home state of Delaware – they’re good, decent, honorable people,” Biden said during virtual remarks in a Voto Latino get-out-the-vote call meant to help Harris.
“The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters,” Biden said, pausing for a moment before continuing. “His, his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable and it’s un-American.”
The White House quickly tried to clean up the president’s remarks, with spokesman Andrew Bates saying he’d been referring to the “hateful rhetoric” at the rally in New York, not the former president’s backers. He said that Biden had actually said this: “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter’s – his – his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American.”
And in a further sign that the White House recognizes the potential political fallout of the episode, Biden himself took to social media to address it.
“Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage—which is the only word I can think of to describe it. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation,” Biden wrote on X.
But the damage may already have been done.
Biden’s comment drew immediate comparisons with then-Democratic nominee Hillary’s Clinton’s remark in 2016 that half of Trump’s supporters should be “put into the basket of deplorables” because of their “racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic” views. Her remarks became a rallying call for Trump and conservative media and remain a badge of honor for Trump fans who view East Coast Democratic elites as condescending and disdainful of their way of life.
On Wednesday morning, Harris was forced to address the controversy.
“Listen, I think, first of all, he clarified his comments, but let me be clear: I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for,” the Democratic nominee said. “You heard my speech last night and continuously throughout my career. I believe that the work that I do is about representing all the people whether they support me or not,” Harris said on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews.
“I am sincere in what I mean: when elected president of the United States, I will represent all Americans, including those who don’t vote for me, and address their needs and their desires,” Harris added.
But Trump had already seized on the remarks.
The former president was alerted to them by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio during a rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Tuesday night. Trump said, “Wow. That’s terrible. That’s what it says. That’s what it says. So, you have, remember Hillary, she said ‘deplorable’ and then she said ‘irredeemable,’ right? But she said deplorable, that didn’t work out. ‘Garbage’ I think is worse, right?”
And Trump’s campaign seized on Biden’s remarks to try to create the same kind of dynamic, claiming that the ex-president is supported by “Latinos, Black voters, union workers, angel moms, law enforcement officers, border patrol agents, and Americans of all faiths,” while his opponents “have labeled these great Americans as fascists, Nazis, and now, garbage.” The Trump campaign’s national press secretary Karoline Leavitt added: “There’s no way to spin it: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris don’t just hate President Trump, they despise the tens of millions of Americans who support him.”
Harris now has a new political problem
No one can say how this latest twist in a turbulent campaign will affect the final result. But in the vicious heat of the last week of the deadlocked presidential campaign, when even a few imprecise words can wreak significant political consequences, it may not matter what Biden really meant. Perception is everything.
Just when Harris’ team wanted to keep the attention on Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally, which played into her contrast message on Tuesday night, the president handed Harris a political mess. She’s now almost certain to be asked whether she also regards Trump’s backers as “garbage.” Her answer will only prolong the story. The former president is also likely to seize on the gaffe to argue that Democrats view working Americans in the heartland with contempt.
A Trump fundraising email Tuesday evening read: “FIRST Hillary called you a DEPLORABLE! THEN they called you a FASCIST! And moments ago Kamala’s boss Biden called you GARBAGE!”
His campaign has already been trying to twist fallout from claims that Trump pined for the kind of generals that served Adolf Hitler into an argument that Harris believes all of his supporters are Nazis.
Biden’s “garbage” remark may also offer Trump an opening to finally spin his way out of the backlash about Puerto Rico caused by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe at the New York rally. “Probably he shouldn’t have been there,” Trump said of the comedian in an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity that aired Tuesday evening. His earlier comments that the event was “an absolute love-fest” had done nothing to defuse the controversy.
More broadly, a Biden comment that will be portrayed by pro-Trump media as contempt for the ex-president’s supporters came at exactly the moment that Harris is trying to come across as a unifying figure to win over Republicans who are disaffected with Trump’s extremism but are not yet ready to take the leap to vote for a Democrat.
“Here is my pledge to you,” Harris said on Tuesday night, at a rally on the Ellipse in Washington, the spot where Trump told his supporters to “fight like hell” before the invasion of the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. “I pledge to seek common ground and commonsense solutions to make your life better.”
The vice president went on: “To people who disagree with me, unlike Donald Trump, I don’t believe people who disagree with me are the enemy. He wants to put them in jail. I’ll give them a seat at the table.”
Clinton and Obama warned against demeaning Trump supporters
Whatever Biden meant, his remarks fly in the face of admonishments to Democrats from two other presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, who pleaded with activists during the Democratic National Convention to take the political fight to Trump but not to disrespect his voters.
“Meet people where they are. I urge you not to demean them … treat them with respect, just the way you’d like them to treat you,” Clinton said, urging delegates to make the case for the vice president with their neighbors carefully.
Obama addressed the risk that name calling could cause available voters to conclude that all politicians are the same. “A sense of mutual respect has to be part of our message. Our politics has become so polarized these days that all of us, across the political spectrum, seem so quick to assume the worst in others unless they agree with us on every single issue,” he said. “We start thinking that the only way to win is to scold and shame and out yell the other side. And after a while, regular folks just tune out, or don’t bother to vote at all.”
Democrats are likely to regard a flap over a few ill-chosen words by the president, whether they were intended or not, as a triviality at a time when Harris is warning that the country could next week elect a man she blasted on Tuesday as a “a petty tyrant.”
And verbal missteps by Biden and other Democrats pale by comparison to the often vulgar rhetoric and unhinged commentary of the Republican nominee, who recently made a crude comment about the anatomy of late pro-golf legend Arnold Palmer at the start of a rally. And while Biden’s notoriously loose tongue got him into trouble, the significance of his remarks isn’t as serious as a false claim by Trump in Pennsylvania on Tuesday night that Democrats are already cheating in the county of Lancaster, in what appeared to be his latest attempt to sow doubt on the fairness of the election in advance.
But the fallout of Hillary Clinton’s “deplorables” comment in 2016 showed that imprecision and implied contempt can haunt candidates and their surrogates in the endgame of elections. In a neck-and-neck race that may be decided by mere thousands of votes in swing states, neither Harris nor Trump can afford mistakes. And the history of presidential elections is littered with incidents that appear insignificant at the time but can take on wider implications. Hinchcliffe’s slamming of Puerto Rico is a classic example since it has left Trump scrambling to placate Puerto Rican voters in Lehigh County, an important area in Pennsylvania where he had hoped to eat into the Democratic vote.
Biden’s diminished campaign role
Tuesday’s controversy will also likely renew speculation about Biden’s future role in the campaign. He was, after all, forced to shelve his reelection bid following a disastrous debate performance on CNN in June that exposed his advanced age and sparked questions about his cognition. While he has appeared several times with Harris, he’s been used sparingly by her campaign in recent weeks. And as CNN reported on Tuesday, his gaffes have caused responses – from eyerolls to outright anger – from some Harris campaign aides.
Last week, the president referred to Trump in New Hampshire and said, “We got to lock him up,” before quickly adding, “Politically lock him up. Lock him out. That’s what we have to do.” The comment went viral on conservative talk radio and social media, as Republicans claimed it proved Trump’s claims that Biden had weaponized the Justice Department against the GOP nominee. In Arizona on Friday, Biden referred to former Rep. Gabby Giffords, who survived being shot in the head at a 2011 campaign event, in the past tense, suggesting she was no longer alive.
While aides have previously brushed off such slips as “vintage Biden,” noting his history of gaffes and the president’s proclivity to misspeak, they also acknowledge there’s no room for error.
“We’re in ‘Do No Harm’ mode,” one official involved in discussions of Biden’s role, said, according to reporting by CNN’s Kayla Tausche, MJ Lee and Kevin Liptak.

CNN,Supreme Court declines to intervene in Louisiana congressional map dispute | CNN Politics,"The Supreme Court on Thursday declined to intervene in a Louisiana congressional map dispute, potentially delaying the implementation of a new map that could create a district that boosts the power of Black voters in the state.
The brief order will come as a disappointment to critics who say conservative-led states are trying to stall court orders requiring new maps that would impact the balance of power in the House of Representatives next fall.
There were no noted dissents.
Liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote a brief concurrence saying she agreed with the court’s denial but that the decision was temporary and leaves open the possibility that the court could intervene at a later date.
In June 2022, a district court judge ordered that Louisiana’s map – with only one Black-majority district out of six in a state with a 33% Black population – should be redrawn with a second Black-majority district.
After months of litigation, the district court had scheduled a hearing slated to discuss proposals for the new map. But a federal appeals court issued an order canceling that hearing in order to give the state more time to propose new maps.
The NAACP Legal Defense Fund asked the justices to lift that order, but they declined to do so on Thursday.
The case is one of several that has come before the justices in recent months concerning race and congressional representation that could impact which party controls the House after next year’s elections.
The court previously ordered Alabama to redraw its congressional map to account for the state’s 27% Black voting population, which was introduced this month.
Earlier this month, the justices considered whether South Carolina engaged in impermissible racial gerrymandering.
Louisiana process
The Louisiana challenge is currently continuing on two tracks. The district court is seeking to remedy a Voting Rights violation, while a federal appeals court is already considering whether to put that ruling on hold.
In August, the district court judge overseeing the case ordered a hearing for early October in order to select a new congressional map in the state. It came after expansive discovery and a five-day preliminary injunction hearing. While the state chose not to propose new remedial maps, the challengers, including the NAACP-LDF, proposed their own. At the hearing the court was expected to select a new map.
But Republican officials went to a federal appeals court asking for a delay. The panel of judges on the appeals court agreed to delay the hearing, holding that the state hadn’t had enough time to propose new maps.
Lawyers for the civil rights group urged the justices to step in and reverse the order from the panel of judges on the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals.
“While the panel’s principal rationale for issuing the writ was that the Louisiana Legislature should be afforded an opportunity to enact a new map in compliance with the district court’s injunction, the Legislature has already had multiple opportunities to enact a new map and has not done so,” Stuart Naifeh of the NAACP-LDF told the justices in court papers.

CNN,Donald Trump campaign manager shared posts in 2021 saying Trump’s lies caused the violence on January 6 | CNN Politics,"In the immediate aftermath of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, a number of conservatives and Republicans broke ranks with then-President Donald Trump and blamed him for the violence that day. Among them was Trump’s current campaign manager, Chris LaCivita.
In a series of reposts on X – formerly Twitter – LaCivita shared comments calling January 6 an “insurrection” that was fueled by Trump’s baseless election lies. Some of those posts have since been deleted from LaCivita’s feed, but CNN was able to review them on the Internet Archive WayBack Machine, which archives internet webpages.
On January 6, 2021, LaCivita reposted several posts that harshly condemned Trump, suggesting that even some of his closest allies once viewed the deadly outcome as a direct result of Trump’s lies.
In a statement to CNN, Lacivita said his likes and retweets on January 6 were not supportive statements.
“Retweets and likes are not endorsements. I’m focused on winning the election two weeks from now, and not distractions from CNN,” he said.
LaCivita’s shared posts included a statement on January 6 from former President George W. Bush, who expressed “disbelief and dismay” at the violent assault on the Capitol, calling it “a sickening and heartbreaking sight.”
“I am appalled by the reckless behavior of some political leaders since the election and by the lack of respect shown today for our institutions, our traditions, and our law enforcement,” read the statement by Bush that LaCivita shared. “The violent assault on the Capitol – and disruption of a Constitutionally-mandated meeting of Congress – was undertaken by people whose passions have been inflamed by falsehoods and false hopes.”
The post, which was shared on the evening of January 6, was later deleted from LaCivita’s feed.
CNN also reviewed a video showing a screen recording of posts that LaCivita liked on January 6, including one from Republican former Rep. Barbara Comstock of Virginia, who called for Trump’s Cabinet to remove him from office via the 25th Amendment.
“Twitter locked @realDonaldTrump for 12 hours. Now the Cabinet needs to lock him down for the next 14 days. #25thAmendmentNow,” Comstock wrote on the evening of January 6.
Although X has since removed the ability to view likes, a user whose tweet was liked by LaCivita confirmed to CNN that his post had indeed been liked by Trump’s campaign manager on January 6.
The 25th Amendment allows the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet to declare the president unfit for office, temporarily transferring power to the vice president.
Another post shared by LaCivita was a stark message from a Republican Senate aide, which John McCormack, then a reporter for the conservative magazine National Review, shared on X.
“Text message from a GOP Senate aide: ‘This is a disgusting tragedy. Someone literally lost their life because of a lie that Trump told, Cruz/Hawley capitalized on, and fringe media echoed. This is in no way shape or form sustainable.’”
Another since-removed post from LaCivita’s feed included a comment calling those who stormed the Capitol “thugs.” The comment from a GOP political staffer linked to a CNN tweet reading, “Pro-Trump protesters have stormed the US Capitol, where members of Congress were meeting to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s win.”
“They are not protestors. They are thugs,” the post read.
The shared comments by LaCivita, the top staffer for Trump’s quest to retake the White House this November, are notable as the former president in the closing weeks of the campaign has sought to recast the events that day.
On social media, Trump has shared unfounded conspiracies suggesting the riot was an inside job perpetrated by the federal government. He has also called the rally and events preceding it as a day of “love and peace,” and suggested that if he regains the White House, he will pardon January 6 rioters convicted of violent acts that day.
During a Univision town hall last week, Trump defended his supporters’ actions, claiming they stormed the Capitol because they believed the election was “rigged.” He continued to mischaracterize the day’s events, stating, “That was a day of love from the standpoint of the millions.”
Last week, on Truth Social, Trump also shared a post calling January 6 “the day the government staged a riot.”
The unfounded conspiracy theory that the federal government staged the January 6 attack has been widely debunked as baseless.
LaCivita, a longtime Republican political strategist with a career working on high-profile campaigns throughout Virginia and nationally, has served in the role of co-campaign manager for Donald Trump’s third presidential bid with fellow seasoned political operative Susie Wiles since 2023.
He first gained national recognition during the 2004 presidential election for his role in the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth campaign, the group that sought to undermine and attack Democratic nominee John Kerry’s military record.",2024-10-23
CNN,"In race for Congress, Democrats burn through cash while outraising Republicans in final election sprint, new filings show | CNN Politics","Staring down the prospect of losing the Senate and amid a tight race for the House, Democrats are burning through cash in the final sprint to Election Day, new federal filings show.
The pre-general election reports, which cover the first sixteen days of October, are the last opportunity before November 5 to see just how much congressional campaigns have raised and spent. Democrats are defending a razor-thin majority in the Senate, while Republicans are trying to maintain their own narrow edge in the House.
In almost all the key races, Democratic candidates brought in more than their Republican opponents between October 1-16. At this point in the race, neither side has a significant overall cash-on-hand advantage, with campaigns spending all the resources they can to win.
With no clear leader in the presidential election according to the most recent CNN Poll of Polls, the battle for Congress will be crucial to determining whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump will have a supportive first branch of government to help implement the new president’s policies.
Senate Democrats’ final stand
Democrats face daunting odds to retain their narrow Senate majority. With Republicans almost certain to flip West Virginia’s Senate seat, they would need Harris to win the White House while not losing any of the other seats held by Democratic senators or senators who caucus with the party.
But Senate Democrats have had a massive money advantage all cycle. According to a CNN analysis of campaign finance reports filed with the Federal Election Commission, Democratic candidates in Senate races rated as competitive by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales have thoroughly outspent their Republican opponents.
With less than two weeks until Election Day and early voting well underway, Democratic Senate candidates in 10 key races – not counting Nebraska, where Democrats don’t have a nominee – spent about $76 million altogether in the first 16 days of October while raking in nearly $49 million, according to the latest filings. Republicans combined to raise about $28 million, while spending more than $39 million over 11 races. Those totals did not include Ohio GOP nominee Bernie Moreno, whose filings were not available on the FEC site as of publication time.
The most vulnerable Democratic incumbents are up for reelection in states that Trump twice carried comfortably – Jon Tester in Montana and Sherrod Brown in Ohio.
Brown raised $7.8 million between October 1 and 16, spent $7.9 million and entered the final two weeks of the campaign with $4.4 million in the bank. More than $500 million has been spent on the Ohio race through Thursday, the most of any Senate contest in 2024. Inside Elections currently rates the Ohio race as the only Toss-up on the Senate map.
In Montana, Tester, the last remaining Democrat in statewide elected office, raised more than $9 million in the first half of October, spent more than $12 million and had just over $4 million on hand for the final dash to Election Day. His Republican opponent, retired Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, raised nearly $2.4 million, spent $2.5 million and had a similar amount left to spend. Inside Elections rates the Senate race in Montana as Tilts Republican.
The battle for the House
In the 30 House races currently rated as Toss-ups or tiling toward one party by Inside Elections, Democratic candidates have combined to outspend their GOP opponents, $190 million to $117 million over the course of the cycle through October 16.
Three Democratic candidates – Alaska Rep. Mary Peltola, Washington Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, and Virginia challenger Eugene Vindman – have spent over $10 million on their campaigns. Peltola and Gluesenkamp Perez represent districts that would have backed Trump in 2020, and Vindman is running for a competitive seat outside Washington, DC.
The battle for the House majority could come down to nine fiercely contested seats in deep-blue California and New York, which were key to Republicans winning control of the chamber two years ago. In these seats alone, Democrats have outspent Republicans, $58 million to $43 million this cycle. In the pre-general election period, the Democratic candidates in these seats outspent their GOP opponents, on average, $1.7 million to $1.3 million, though the average Republicans began October 17 with a slight cash-on-hand advantage.
Big donors, big dollars
Hundreds of millions of dollars have already been spent in the battle for Congress, and ultrawealthy donors are still pouring money into super PACs.
Elon Musk donated $10 million to the Senate Leadership Fund, the GOP super PAC aligned with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Musk has already spent nearly $120 million on the presidential election through America PAC, the super PAC he helped form to support Trump. Senate Leadership Fund also received $5 million from hedge fund manager Paul Singer, and $2 million from investment banker Warren Stephens.
The fund’s Democratic counterpart, Senate Majority PAC, received a $25 million donation from Majority Forward, the group’s dark money nonprofit arm, which is not required to disclose its donors.
The Congressional Leadership Fund, the top House GOP super PAC, received another $2 million check from billionaire hedge fund manager Ken Griffin in October. Griffin, who hasn’t donated to Trump this cycle, has donated $16 million to the fund so far this cycle. The group also received $4.5 million from insurance executive Patrick Ryan and his wife, Shirley, as well as $2 million from Singer.
On the Democratic side, House Majority PAC received a $2 million donation from billionaire businessman and former 2020 presidential candidate Tom Steyer, $1.8 million from philanthropist Marilyn Simons and $1.1 million from the Sixteen Thirty Fund, a Democratic-aligned nonprofit that is not required to disclose its donors.
In Michigan, the Great Lakes Conservative Fund, which has spent over $20.5 million in the Senate race in support of Republican Mike Rogers, received $1.2 million in donations from the DeVos family – including $125,000 from Trump’s former Education secretary, Betsy DeVos.
And in Pennsylvania, Keystone Renewal PAC, which has spent $48 million supporting Republican nominee Dave McCormick, received another $1 million from Pennsylvania-based billionaire Jeff Yass.",2024-10-25
CNN,Trump ally Mike Johnson elected House speaker three weeks after McCarthy ouster | CNN Politics,"The Republican-led House elected Rep. Mike Johnson as the new House speaker on Wednesday – a major leadership change that comes three weeks after the historic ouster of Kevin McCarthy. Johnson, a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump and a key congressional figure in the failed efforts to overturn the 2020 election, will now take the reins of the bitterly divided House Republican majority and faces the looming threat of a government shutdown next month.
Johnson’s elevation puts an end to the paralysis the House had been stuck in after McCarthy was pushed out by hardline conservatives – an unprecedented move that plunged the chamber into uncharted territory. Republicans tried and failed three separate times to coalesce behind a new speaker nominee before ultimately uniting around Johnson, a conservative lawmaker who has so far had a relatively low profile on the national stage. In a remarkable show of unity following weeks of fierce GOP infighting, the Louisiana Republican was elected with 220 votes and no Republican defections.
The new speaker will now face a litany of pressing issues. Government funding is set to expire on November 17, and the GOP-controlled House will need to work with the Democratic-led Senate to avert a shutdown, setting up an early leadership test for Johnson. Lawmakers must also decide whether to send further aid to Ukraine as it fights a war against Russian aggression as well as aid to Israel in its war against Hamas. There is widespread bipartisan support for aid to Israel, but many House Republicans are opposed to sending additional aid to Ukraine.
Hours after the speaker election, the House passed a resolution in support of Israel in its war against Hamas. The measure passed with overwhelming bipartisan support by a vote of 412 to 10.
Johnson, fresh off his victory on the House floor, said he will pursue an “aggressive schedule” in the weeks ahead and alluded to the chaos that had paralyzed the House and distracted from the GOP agenda.
“You’re going to see an aggressive schedule in the days and weeks ahead. You’re gonna see Congress working as hard as it’s ever worked and we are going to deliver for the American people,” he said.
“We’ve gone through a little bit of suffering. We’ve gone through a little bit of character building, and you know what has produced more strength, more perseverance and a lot of hope, and that’s what we’re about to deliver to the American people,” he said.
Johnson was first elected to the House in 2016 and has previously served as vice chairman of the House Republican Conference. A Trump ally, he supported objections to Electoral College results when Congress met to certify Joe Biden’s presidential win on January 6, 2021 – the day a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol seeking to overturn the results of the election. He also lobbied fellow House Republicans to support a Texas lawsuit seeking to overturn the election. A reporter was loudly booed by House GOP members for asking Johnson after he became the speaker-designate if he stands by his decision to support overturning the election.
New speaker takes over following weeks of chaos
The fight for the speaker’s gavel has opened new rifts among House Republicans and deepened old ones. Republicans rallied around Johnson in a display of unity, but it remains to be seen how long that will hold.
Johnson secured the nomination for the speakership late Tuesday evening in a vote that capped off a chaotic day that started with Republicans picking Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer to be their latest nominee only for him to drop out hours later after facing stiff resistance from the right flank of the conference and a rebuke from Trump. After winning the party nomination, Emmer faced swift opposition from the right flank of his conference as well as a rebuke from Trump. In a post on Truth Social, Trump called Emmer a “Globalist RINO,” and said that voting for him “would be a tragic mistake.”
Emmer was the third Republican to win the GOP nomination only to then exit the race after failing to lock up the necessary votes to win the gavel, following Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and Steve Scalise also of Louisiana.
Jordan, who is known as Trump ally and a fierce conservative agitator, took his fight for the speakership to the House floor in a bid to put members on the record – but failed to secure the gavel in three separate rounds of voting that saw him lose more support with each ballot.
Some Republicans who opposed Jordan decried what they described as a pressure campaign against them by allies of the Ohio Republican. And several Republicans who opposed Jordan’s speakership bid said they experienced angry calls, menacing messages and even death threats since casting their votes. Jordan condemned the threats.
Even as he faced stiff resistance, Jordan vowed repeatedly to continue his fight. But after his third failed floor vote, the House GOP conference voted internally to push him out of the race in a dramatic turn of events. Jordan’s failure to win the gavel highlighted the limits of Trump’s influence in the speaker’s race after the former president endorsed Jordan.
As Republicans failed to coalesce around successive candidates, frustration and tensions within the conference intensified and frequently spilled out into public view as members lamented the impasse and questioned whether anyone could secure enough support to win the gavel given the GOP’s narrow majority.
Johnson emerges as new GOP leader
Johnson has a background as a staunch conservative Republican and an ardent Trump supporter.
After the election was called in favor of Joe Biden on November 7, 2020, Johnson posted on X, then known as Twitter, “I have just called President Trump to say this: ‘Stay strong and keep fighting, sir! The nation is depending upon your resolve. We must exhaust every available legal remedy to restore Americans’ trust in the fairness of our election system.’”
Johnson serves on the Judiciary Committee and the Armed Services Committee. He is also a former chair of the Republican Study Committee.
As CNN’s KFILE has reported, Johnson has a history of harsh anti-gay language from his time as an attorney for a socially conservative legal group in the mid-2000s.
In editorials that ran in his local Shreveport, Louisiana, paper, The Times, Johnson called homosexuality an “inherently unnatural” and “dangerous lifestyle” that would lead to legalized pedophilia and possibly even destroy “the entire democratic system.”
In another editorial, he wrote, “Your race, creed, and sex are what you are, while homosexuality and cross-dressing are things you do. This is a free country, but we don’t give special protections for every person’s bizarre choices.”
At the time, Johnson was an attorney and spokesman for Alliance Defense Fund, known today as Alliance Defending Freedom, where he also authored his opposition to the Supreme Court ruling in Lawrence v. Texas – which overturned state laws that criminalized homosexual activity between consenting adults.
In 2022, Johnson also introduced a bill that some have described as a national version of what critics have called Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” bill.

CNN,Biden’s clean energy law revived this red corner of Georgia. Voters there are backing Trump anyway | CNN Politics,"The face of a new era in American manufacturing is here, just off Interstate 75, tucked into this northwest corner of Georgia.
That’s where you’ll find the Qcells plant that pumps out 32,000 solar panels a day and has a total panel production capacity of 5.1 gigawatts. For context, officials note, the peak capacity of the Hoover Dam is roughly 2 gigawatts.
“When I came here, there was dirt. There was no building,” said Lisa Nash, the plant manager here, walking CNN through the high-tech factory floor in August. “I was the first person hired.”
Asked if she could have envisioned where things are now, she didn’t hesitate: “No.”
In Nash’s view, the dramatic growth isn’t just a success story for the company or industry, it’s also major win for the community here in Dalton.
“The population’s growing. They’re buying houses, rent, shopping, eating out. They’re contributing back into the local community, paying taxes,” Nash said.
It’s a cutting-edge operation that was made possible by the sweeping climate investment law enacted by the Biden administration in 2022.
“We’ve had lots of support in the state and federal level of various kinds,” said Scott Moskowitz, the head of market strategy and public affairs at Qcells. “But it wasn’t till the Inflation Reduction Act passed, which really provided the spark that this industry needed to make these types of investments.”
Which is why Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to the plant last year to highlight its growth – and speak to some of its employees.
“To meet her and to have a conversation with her, I was shocked because I was thinking, you know, she’s up here, but she’s actually down to earth, very straightforward,” said Kimberly Richardson, the Qcells employee selected by management to introduce Harris during her visit.
Richardson embodies a new generation of manufacturing workers – someone with no experience in solar panels or the green technology space prior to joining Qcells who has quickly acclimated – and risen – inside the company, where she’s now in charge of the plant’s recycling operation.
For Richardson, a Black woman, Harris’ campaign for president carries a deep meaning.
“She represents every woman in the United States, every woman,” Richardson said. “She set the tone for every woman in the United States, every little girl, to say, ‘I can do this,’ and that’s a good thing.”
But while Georgia may be a hotly contested battleground state, Richardson’s view isn’t exactly widespread here, where support for former President Donald Trump runs strong.
“She wasn’t well received in north Georgia,” Kasey Carpenter, the Republican state representative for the area, said of the Harris visit.
The Qcells plant offers a window into the convergence of local, state and federal government aligning to accelerate a manufacturing transition that has turbocharged a local economy. That the effort has crossed party lines is rare enough in these polarized times.
But that it happened in a community that backs a presidential candidate who has attacked the very law that is central to its rapid expansion underscores the complex – and in this case, contradictory - overlap of politics and a local economy.
Trump strikes a chord
Located in the congressional district represented by GOP firebrand Marjorie Taylor Greene, Dalton is Trump country.
“The independence that we keep up here – it’s that independence and outsider that he’s really struck a chord with,” Carpenter said of Trump’s rock-solid support in the area. “And my folks, they appreciate that. And quite frankly that I appreciate that too.”
Carpenter is far from a die-hard Trump supporter.
“We’re in a world where we get two candidates, but we have 27 boxes of cereal on the shelf. That’s the world I live in,” he said. “It’s that frustrating that you have two candidates.”
But for voters here, the political debate over the economy comes down to one thing.
“Inflation is such a big issue for our community right now that that’s going to trump anything that kind of I think about,” Carpenter said.
This is the paradox playing out during a dramatic comeback for this part of the state.
The Qcells plant – the largest of its kind in the Western Hemisphere – sits in what has long been known as the carpet capital of the world.
The moniker can be found on the signs welcoming visitors to Dalton, which has held a dominant market share of the carpet and flooring industry for decades.
But it also left the area particular vulnerable to something most thought was impossible until 2008: a housing market crash.
“It was a bloodbath for us here,” Carpenter said. “It was a ghost town. And it took us years to get out of it.”
The market collapse sparked local leaders to start thinking through – and setting up the infrastructure for – the diversification of the town’s economy.
That overlapped with efforts at the state level – most recently by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp – to line up incentives for major companies to relocate to or build in Georgia.
The Biden administration’s incentives from the federal side turbocharged the efforts on green energy.
“They are all equally important,” Nash said when asked whose support was most critical between federal, state and local government. “It’s like a recipe and without one ingredient, you can’t successfully have this project.”
The result has been the revival of a model that was thought to be a thing of the past.
“If you walk around in the factory, you’re going see a broad age band,” Nash said. “We have a 65-year-old father. His son and his daughter work here. There are high school students that we interview because of their gaming.”
What was once aspirational is now reality – and growing.
‘A hometown feel’
Just about 50 miles down I-75 is Cartersville, where on a recent Saturday the center of town was jam-packed with residents stopping through booths filled by local vendors selling locally sourced food and agricultural goods.
For two years running, this has been ranked the top farmer’s market in Georgia, which might not be expected in a county that voted 75% for Trump in 2020.
But in some ways, it’s a key element to an approach that helped the town lure Qcells to build its next plant here, just a few miles away from where CNN linked up with its mayor, Matt Santini.
This is clearly a Republican town, with deep-rooted support for the former president. But in Santini’s mind, the true nature of the place is the community itself.
“It’s doubled in size since I moved here in the early ‘90s, but it’s still a place where, again, you can walk through a farmer’s market,” Santini said. “You see people talking and getting along with each other. We have a hometown feel.”
Back in Dalton, that hometown feel is exactly the vibe a visitor gets walking into the Oakwood Cafe.
The restaurant is technically the day job for Carpenter, the state legislator – and one that keeps him connected to the community he represents while in Atlanta when the Legislature is in session.
“I’m real connected,” Carpenter said with a chuckle. “I fry their chicken on Monday, and Saturdays I’m washing their dishes.”
Carpenter describes his community and its residents with pride.
“It’s blue-collar, man. We’re all workers,” he said.
But he acknowledges there’s a heavy dose of ideological irony in the economic engine that has taken root in the area over the past few years.
“We’re growing the green energy that they don’t necessarily care that much about,” he said. “But I think they’re coming around because they see the impact on the economy.”
That impact, he notes, has been significant.
“Whether it’s janitorial, whether it’s restaurants, catering, whether it’s, you know, plastics, you know, garbage bags, whatever, shipping goods, all of that stuff flows downstream from something like that,” Carpenter said.
Threats that haven’t resonated
That downstream effect – perhaps most tangible in the form of downtown Dalton’s new boutique hotel, right across the street from the Oakwood Cafe, the area’s first in 50 years and evidence to many of the city’s comeback.
Still, the campaign-trail threats from Trump to repeal pillars of the climate law that sparked the growth haven’t moved voters here – or really resonated.
“I don’t think they realize that if the whole thing is repealed, it will affect those 2,500 jobs down on the south end of the county. And it’s real,” Carpenter said. “It will have consequences.”
Qcells representatives are quick to point out that they first broke ground in Dalton in 2018 because Trump’s tariffs on solar panels incentivized production stateside.
Still, the former president’s threats are impossible to ignore, even if the bipartisan support for the project across the federal, state and local levels offers it a level of protection should Trump win.
“You want to ask me that after November?” Nash, the Qcells plant manager, responded when asked about the future for the industry.
But she underscored the scale of the transformation already underway – and what that means for the future.
“No, I’m optimistic because we’re just scratching the surface,” she said.
It’s a future Nash’s parents thought didn’t exist.
“Both of them said, ‘Don’t go into manufacturing,’” she recalled. “I’d like to think they’re both proud of me today because of this. I look at my kids and my grandkids, and I’m thinking: ‘I wouldn’t mind them doing that.’”
It’s a window into a transformation that has taken hold of an entire community – a one-industry town no more.
Asked if there were any plans to add “Solar capital of the world” onto the current Dalton signs in town, Carpenter thought about it for a minute.
“No, but we should, though,” he said. “We’ve gotta wait and see what happens. Right now, the story still remains.”",2024-09-27
CNN,Analysis: What is the ‘red mirage’ or the ‘blue shift’ and will it happen this year? | CNN Politics,"A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.
It’s been called the “red mirage” or the “blue shift.”
It’s the recent phenomenon by which an apparent Republican lead early after polls close on election night is erased by the counting of mail-in ballots later in the evening or in the days after Election Day.
Former President Donald Trump has pointed to the red mirage to back up his baseless allegations of election fraud, when in fact it has been a function of the rise of mail-in voting and the often-peculiar rules about when those ballots can be counted.
What happened in 2020?
When most Americans went to bed on election night in 2020, on November 3, the end result was far from clear.
The contest between then-President Trump and now-President Joe Biden was still too early to call in the key states of Arizona, North Carolina, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Maine, Georgia and Pennsylvania.
The following days would include dramatic hours spent watching the counting of votes in these states. The vote count didn’t reflect a Biden lead in Georgia until early in the morning of November 6, when, as CNN’s Phil Mattingly showed viewers on the Magic Wall, small batches of votes were being counted and affecting the very close election.
CNN was able to project that Biden would win the election four days after Election Day, on November 7, but counting would continue. An analysis by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that counties won by Biden counted slower, on average, than counties won by Trump.
There was also a blue shift in 2016, but it was not decisive. As CNN’s Marshall Cohen wrote, when Hillary Clinton offered her concession and admitted her loss to Americans the day after Election Day, she was still behind in the popular vote. While the trickle-in of ballots was not enough to get her the White House, it was more than enough to give her an edge of millions of ballots in the popular vote.
In 2020, the slowest-counting states were places like California, which are heavily Democratic and where every registered voter is sent a mail-in ballot. That means a blue shift in the popular vote could still occur even if it does not delay figuring out the presidential election results.
It’s important to remember that while news networks like CNN might project a winner when it is clear who will win, the races are not officially certified until later. Certification deadlines vary from state to state, but they all have until December 11, 2024, to complete recounts, if needed, and settle disputes around presidential results.
How long will it take this year?
There is some indication that things could go quicker in some key states.
In Georgia, a new election law means more people will vote early in person rather than by mail, which could speed up the process of counting mail-in ballots. North Carolina no longer accepts mail-in ballots if they arrive after Election Day.
The Brennan Center for Justice, which tracks election-related laws, has a rundown of potential choke points.
Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, said recently on CBS’ “Face the Nation” that he expects the vast majority of ballots to be processed and counted in the hours after polls close.
“All early votes and all early accepted ballots, they all will have to have their results reported by 8 p.m. That’s 70, maybe even 75% of all the vote totals will be reported no later than 8 p.m. on election night,” he said. But if the election in Georgia is as close in 2024 as it was in 2020, the outcome may still not be clear.
Raffensperger was asked if it could take a week to determine the winner in Georgia.
“Absolutely not,” he said. “What we will be waiting for is the overseas ballots that come in no later than Friday, and so those will then be the final numbers. And we’ll just see if that makes the difference in the total vote totals.”
Other states, like the key battlegrounds of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, have not made it possible for election officials to process any ballots before Election Day. But the count could be faster in those places as well, with more experience and fewer ballots to handle when compared with the pandemic-era 2020 election. The Center for Election Innovation & Research has a rundown of the various rules and timelines for processing mail-in ballots.
In Michigan, another key state where processing of ballots can occur before Election Day, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson was also asked by CBS about how long it will take to count ballots. Benson, a Democrat, said she hopes to know the outcome by the end of Wednesday, November 6, a day after polls close.
“We will always prioritize accuracy and security over efficiency,” she said.
Close elections can take time to figure out
In the event of tight margins, it could still take days.
The top elections official in Pennsylvania is Republican Al Schmidt, who told NPR recently that people need to trust the system in the period after polls close.
“In 2020 … we saw that window of time between the polls being closed at 8 p.m. on election night and the race being called as a period of vulnerability where people were seeking to undermine confidence in the results,” he said, noting that in the end, after all the votes were counted, the Pennsylvania results were not that close.
The closest elections can take time, as anyone who is old enough to remember 2000 can attest. A close election in Florida was paired with a flawed punch-ballot system that left some ballots with “hanging chads” up for debate.
The outcome of the election that year dragged on for more than a month – 36 days until the US Supreme Court halted a partial Florida recount and essentially handed the election to George W. Bush. Then-Vice President Al Gore conceded on December 13 and then became one of just three vice presidents to oversee the counting of electoral votes in their own defeat. Harris could be the fourth. Or the first since George H.W. Bush to oversee their own victory.
In the same way that no one knows who will win the 2024 election, it’s also not entirely clear how long determining the winner this year will take.",2024-10-27
CNN,Milwaukee’s Black voters expose cracks in Democratic foundation for Harris | CNN Politics,"Devonta Johnson is going door to door, clipboard in hand, wearing a bright yellow vest and a seemingly permanent smile.
“How do you feel about Kamala Harris?” Johnson asks when a woman answers the door and steps out onto the porch.
“I think she is great,” the woman says, and Johnson’s smile gets even bigger.
“How do you feel about Trump?” he asks.
“Not so great,” is the quick response.
The conversation lasts another minute or so, as Johnson runs through early voting opportunities and asks for a phone number so he can check back and make sure supporting Harris translates into voting for her. Then a pleasant goodbye, and Johnson turns back to the sidewalk and heads to the next knock.
Johnson and his colleagues from Black Leaders Organizing for Communities walk these streets year-round. But their steps are now a bit quicker and the falling leaves add a little color and crunching sound. The Halloween decorations on the lawn tell us the calendar is moving. So does the new script the canvassers are carrying.
“I just wanted to remind you that early voting starts on October 22,” one says to a man who steps out to talk.
It is turnout time, and any path to a Democratic victory in Wisconsin – which flipped from Trump to Joe Biden four years ago – begins in these overwhelmingly Black neighborhoods on Milwaukee’s north side.
“There’s a lot of momentum,” says Angela Lang, a veteran organizer who is the BLOC executive director. “Generally speaking, people feel pretty good about where we are at.”
The energy and activism among Black women is obvious. Plus, Lang says, her conversations with other organizers suggest perhaps a few surprises in the Wisconsin count.
“You can’t win a statewide election here without going through the heart of Milwaukee and in some cases that runs through this office and the work that our team does,” Lang said in an interview. “But we are also seeing folks in heavily red areas that are getting together with other women at coffee shops without their husbands knowing, for example, and starting to have those conversations.”
We first visited Lang and BLOC a year ago, in the early weeks of our CNN project – “All Over The Map” – to track the 2024 election through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds or are members of crucial voting blocs.
It is obvious that Harris is in better shape now than Biden was during that first visit last October.
Back then, even Johnson, then 21, said he was not sure who he would vote for, describing Biden and Trump as too old and disconnected from his generation. Now, he is as excited to vote for Harris as he is to knock doors organizing for her and other Democrats.
“At the time, I was like kind of iffy, feeling like everybody else, kind of undecided,” Johnson said of his choices before Harris got in the race. “But now that Kamala got the ball and she rollin’ with it, I feel like oh yeah. … She’s making a good image for herself and for the Democrats.”
A year ago, Lang was blunt about Biden’s struggles in Milwaukee’s Black neighborhoods. Now she says there is energy around Harris and myriad efforts to find creative ways to generate high turnout.
“It’s extremely different,” Lang said.
Cracks in the Democratic coalition
Yet she candidly discussed cracks and concerns in the Democratic foundation, which were on clear display as we walked with the canvassers and sat in on the meeting in which they share notes about what they call being “on doors.”
Some who answer don’t plan to vote.
“Because they say it isn’t going to change anything,” one of the canvassers said at the meeting.
Young Black voters are harder to motivate.
“We still got a job to do,” one of the canvassers told her colleagues. “They have a lot of questions that’s not answered.”
But by far the biggest worry is Black men.
Two things come up the most.
“People are, like, ‘I think I had more money in my pocket when Trump was in office because of the stimulus checks during the pandemic,’” Lang said.
She tells canvassers to point out Congress passed that funding and that Trump initially opposed the idea, though he in the end had his signature printed on the checks.
The second concern is about how Harris got her start in politics: as a county prosecutor and later as California’s attorney general.
“It makes sense why people may have a little bit of a pause,” Lang said of the vice president’s background in law enforcement. “I myself did as well.”
Now she tells canvassers that a key Harris priority as a prosecutor were programs designed to reduce recidivism.
‘They look at a man as being a leader’
Brian McMutuary says he is open to listening in the final days. He was a lifelong Democrat until he voted for Trump in 2020.
He disagrees with Trump on abortion rights and immigration. But he likes the former president’s take on cryptocurrency and remembers being better off when Trump was president.
“When I go to the grocery store, I get what I need, not so much what I want or what the kids want,” McMutuary said in an interview in Menomonee Falls, a Milwaukee suburb. “We need to make it each week. We have a budget, you know. It is tight.”
McMutuary also says he worries Russia’s Vladimir Putin and China’s Xi Jinping would not treat Harris as an equal.
“They look at a man as being a leader,” he said.
He said he had no problem with a woman president.
“Nope, not at all,” McMutuary said. “It’s about doing the right thing for the country.”
Eric Jones says he has heard that and more as he makes the rounds getting coffee, going to the barbershop or in his real estate business.
“If I were a gambling man, I would probably put my money on Harris,” Jones told us in an interview at Confectionately Yours, a new Black-owned coffee shop and bakery on Milwaukee’s Martin Luther King Jr. Drive.
“Things are getting better,” Jones said. “The numbers are better. The energy is different. It’s a lot different from when we were here last time, especially in terms of the election.”
Still, he sees the same cracks and doubts relayed by the BLOC community organizers, especially among Black men.
“They’ll say, ‘I had more money when he was the president,’’’ Jones said.
Harris’ work as San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general might help woo suburban voters but, at a minimum, raises questions here.
“Law enforcement has not been kind to Black people historically,” Jones said. “District attorneys have not been kind to Black people historically.”
Jones also says abortion and transgender rights have come up in some recent debates at stops in the community.
“The good old party feels they have a monopoly on the Christian vote,” Jones said. “The Democratic Party feels they have a monopoly over the Black vote. The problem is there are a lot of Blacks that are Christians and the Black church is one of the strongest institutions in the Black community, right?”
“So you have this tug of war in a city that I’m pretty sure the Black folk will decide who wins that city, and more than likely, the presidency.”",2024-10-11
CNN,Analysis: Trump’s plan to radically remake government with RFK Jr. and Elon Musk is coming into view | CNN Politics,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.
For much of the presidential campaign, former President Donald Trump worked to distance himself from Project 2025, the detailed game plan written by conservative activists for a second Trump term.
Whether or not his allies will try to implement portions of the controversial plan if he wins the 2024 election is still the topic of some debate.
But there is an equally radical and expansive government reformation plan coming out of Trump’s own mouth, in which heterodox figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. would be given free rein to “go wild” on the health safety system and Elon Musk would be enabled to, as the tech billionaire said, “start from scratch” with the federal workforce.
Separately, Trump’s transition co-chair appeared on CNN Wednesday night to argue Kennedy and Musk probably wouldn’t be given specific government jobs but that Kennedy would be given data in order to question vaccines.
So without getting bogged down in whether Trump does or does not support Project 2025, here’s a look at what the former president and the people he says he would empower have said they would do if he wins the White House.
‘Go wild’ with RFK Jr.
Trump has promised to give Kennedy leeway to remake the way the government health apparatus protects Americans.
“I’m going to let him go wild on the food. I’m going to let him go wild on the medicines,” Trump said during his closing argument rally at Madison Square Garden on Sunday.
Much of what Kennedy pushes sounds positive. His “Make America Healthy Again” PAC promises to focus on “prioritizing regenerative agriculture, preserving natural habitats, and eliminating toxins from our food, water, and air.”
But those ideas are short on specifics, and there are personal issues that would impede anyone else from government service. Kennedy compared vaccine requirements with the Nazi Germany era, claiming Anne Frank was in a better situation; was once arrested for heroin possession; and has pushed wild conspiracy theories about chemicals in the water making children gay or transgender.
Kennedy’s own health has also been a concern. He once ate so much tuna and perch that he experienced “severe brain fog” from mercury poisoning, he told The New York Times.
In video obtained by CNN, Kennedy told supporters on Monday that Trump had promised to give him sweeping power over multiple agencies if the former president wins the election.
“The key that I think I’m – you know, that President Trump has promised me is – is control of the public health agencies, which are HHS (Department of Health and Human Services) and its sub-agencies, CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), FDA (Food and Drug Administration), NIH (National Institutes of Health) and a few others, and then also the USDA (Department of Agriculture), which is – which, you know, is key to making America healthy. Because we’ve got to get off of seed oils, and we’ve got to get off of pesticide intensive agriculture,” Kennedy said.
In an interview with CNN’s Kaitlan Collins, Howard Lutnick, co-chair of the Trump-Vance transition team, said Kennedy would not be in charge of HHS but would be given access to data about vaccines in order to check their safety. But vaccines that are currently approved and authorized for use in the US have been proven safe and effective. Lutnick also pushed unproven conspiracy theories that vaccines are behind autism in children. Although it is still unclear what causes autism, the scientific consensus is that vaccines do not.
“He says, ‘If you give me the data, all I want is the data, and I’ll take on the data and show that it’s not safe.’ And then if you pull the product liability (protections), the companies will yank these vaccines right off, off of the market,” Lutnick said.
Meanwhile, “Trump’s plans have been met with alarm in the public health community, not so much for the specific policy proposals Kennedy has communicated as part of his ‘Make America Healthy Again’ platform as much as for the key issue he’s been leaving out: vaccines,” according to CNN’s Meg Tirrell. She wrote an in-depth review of Kennedy’s record on health issues.
Both Trump and Kennedy have expressed vaccine skepticism, and Kennedy has been a longtime activist pushing debunked theories about vaccines. During the campaign, Kennedy has deemphasized his views on vaccines, Tirrell notes. His push for more natural food does find support among some health experts.
‘Start from scratch’ with Musk
Musk, the superrich Trump supporter, would be given a much wider portfolio than Kennedy and be charged with a massive downsizing of the federal government.
It’s an even stickier situation since Musk’s many companies, including SpaceX and Tesla, have a profit-motivated interest in business with the government. The US government currently relies on SpaceX, which also owns the satellite internet provider Starlink.
If there’s any doubt that a Musk government role could be a risk for conflict of interest, simply look at the fact that he has said he could be in charge of the “Department of Government Efficiency.” DOGE is the name of Musk’s cryptocurrency, an area the Trump family is also keen to enter.
Lutnick told Collins that Musk wouldn’t enter the government because he can’t sell SpaceX but would instead be writing software to give to the government.
Musk has been no stranger to making headlines as his support for Trump has been on full display this campaign season. He is currently trying to move a lawsuit over his $1 million giveaway to voters into federal court, potentially averting a hearing Thursday in Philadelphia state court that he was required to attend. At the center of the legal battle is a daily $1 million sweepstakes that Musk’s pro-Trump super PAC, called America PAC, is offering to registered voters in battleground states.
His lawyers filed a “motion of removal” in federal court late Wednesday night. This typically pauses the state case and puts the matter in the hands of a federal judge – unless and until that judge decides to send the case back to state courts.
Musk is also constantly pushing out antisemitic things and has mused about how women shouldn’t vote. Not to mention reports of his meetings with hostile foreign leaders.
In a potential new Trump administration, Musk promises a reinvention of the federal bureaucracy.
“Let’s start from scratch,” Musk said at an event in October in Pittsburgh, suggesting a drastic remaking of the federal bureaucracy.
CNN’s David Goldman looked this month at what Trump and Musk have said about a potential Musk role in government, which would be focused on steep spending cuts – Musk has said he could trim $2 trillion, perhaps with help from artificial intelligence – and rolling back regulations. But he’d do it in a nice way, apparently.
“Musk has promised a gentle touch, offering generous severance packages to laid-off government workers, while at the same time proposing an assessment system that threatens layoffs to wasteful employees,” Goldman wrote.
The problem, according to the former Treasury Secretary Larry Summer, is that there’s not $2 trillion to be gained from massive government layoffs.
“Respectfully, I think it is idiotic,” Summers said on Fox News this week. “These people think it’s like some business. But here’s the problem: Only 15% of the federal budget is for payroll. So even if you took all the employees, every single person working for the federal government out, you couldn’t save anything like $2 trillion.”
Summers has a point about payroll. The government spent about $271 billion to compensate 2.3 million civilian employees in 2022, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Summers said that to achieve trillions in cuts, Musk would have to look at Social Security and Medicare benefits, something Trump has promised not to do.
‘No Obamacare’
House Speaker Mike Johnson, a top Trump ally, said in Pennsylvania on Monday that if Trump wins and Republicans keep the House, there would be a “massive” overhaul of the health care system. “No Obamacare?” shouted an attendee at the campaign event. “No Obamacare,” Johnson said.
He added: “The ACA is so deeply ingrained; we need massive reform to make this work. And we got a lot of ideas on how to do that.”
During a debate with Vice President Kamala Harris in September, Trump did not give specifics, but he did say he had “concepts” of a plan. These have not been shared publicly.
Trump tried, and failed, during his time in White House to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but retooling the health care system is clearly still a priority for Republicans.
Drastic change won’t be easy
This is a good spot to point out that no matter what Trump is promising Kennedy and Musk, and no matter what Johnson hopes to do about health care, the realities of the US government make drastic change hard to achieve.
A minority in the Senate, assuming it’s larger than 40 senators, could block any attempt to really undo the Affordable Care Act. The Senate is supposed to confirm top officials like Cabinet secretaries, although Trump and other presidents found ways around that rule in the Constitution. It’s not clear if Kennedy could find the votes to be confirmed as secretary of Health and Human Services or if Trump would even nominate him. If Kennedy had a role in the White House, his ability to enact sweeping change would be limited.
While presidents have authority over the federal workforce and Trump was working to reclassify many federal employees to make them easier to fire when he was president, a “start from scratch” scenario would theoretically require congressional approval.
Not that we can say with any certainty what would require congressional approval since, unlike with the detailed Project 2025 plan, there are no specifics to match any of these big ideas. At least not yet.

CNN,"Supreme Court declines to revisit landmark libel ruling, though Clarence Thomas wants to reconsider the decision | CNN Politics","The Supreme Court declined on Tuesday to revisit the landmark First Amendment decision in New York Times v. Sullivan, rebuffing a request to take another look at decades-old precedent that created a higher bar for public figures to claim libel in civil suits.
The media world has for years relied on the unanimous decision in the 1964 case to fend off costly defamation lawsuits brought by public figures. The ruling established the requirement that public figures show “actual malice” before they can succeed in a libel dispute.
Despite being a mainstay in US media law, the Sullivan decision has increasingly come under fire by conservatives both inside and outside the court, including Justice Clarence Thomas, who said on Tuesday that he still wanted to revisit Sullivan at some point.
“In an appropriate case, however, we should reconsider New York Times and our other decisions displacing state defamation law,” Thomas wrote in a brief concurrence to the court’s decision not to take up the case. He said that the case, Don Blankenship v. NBC Universal, LLC, was a poor vehicle to reconsider Sullivan.
Just a few months ago, the conservative justice attacked the ruling in Sullivan in a fiery dissent in which he called it “flawed.” Thomas issued other public critiques of Sullivan in recent years, including in 2019, when he wrote that the ruling and “the Court’s decisions extending it were policy-driven decisions masquerading as constitutional law.”
The case at hand concerns Don Blankenship, a former coal baron who was convicted of a federal conspiracy offense related to a deadly 2010 explosion at a mine he ran, in what was one of the worst US mine disasters in decades. His sentence of a year in prison was one day less than a felony sentence.
“Blankenship himself admits this was a highly unusual sentence for a misdemeanor offense; he notes that he was the only inmate at his prison who was not serving a sentence for a felony conviction,” according to a lower-court opinion in the case.
During his unsuccessful 2018 US Senate campaign in West Virginia, a number of media organizations erroneously reported that he was a convicted felon, even though his conspiracy offense was classified as a misdemeanor.
Blankenship sued a slew of news outlets for the error, alleging defamation and false light invasion of privacy. Lower courts ruled against him, finding that the outlets did not make the statements with actual malice, the standard required by Sullivan.
Attorneys for Blankenship told the justices in court papers that the “damage was irreparable” since no felon has ever been elected to the Senate, and urged them to overturn the Sullivan decision.
“The actual malice standard poses a clear and present danger to our democracy,” they wrote. “New York Times Co. v. Sullivan and its progeny grant the press a license to publish defamatory falsehoods that misinform voters, manipulate elections, intensify polarization, and incite unrest.”
Attorneys for the media outlets urged the justices not to take up the case, arguing that it’s “as poor a vehicle as one could imagine to consider” questions related to Sullivan’s holding because, they said, the reporting mistakes were honest ones.
“There is good reason why the actual malice standard of New York Times has been embraced for so long and so often,” the media organizations told the justices. “At its essence, the standard protects ‘erroneous statements honestly made.’ While it permits recovery for falsehoods uttered with knowledge of falsity or with reckless disregard for the truth, it provides the ‘breathing space’ required for ‘free debate.’ A free people engaged in self-government deserves no less.”
Just last year the court declined to revisit Sullivan in a case brought by a not-for-profit Christian ministry against the Southern Poverty Law Center.
At the time, Thomas dissented from the court’s refusal to take up the case.
“I would grant certiorari in this case to revisit the ‘actual malice’ standard,” he wrote. “This case is one of many showing how New York Times and its progeny have allowed media organizations and interest groups ‘to cast false aspersions on public figures with near impunity.’”
In 2021, conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch also questioned the decision in Sullivan, writing in a dissent when the court decided not to take up a defamation case that the 1964 ruling should be revisited in part because it “has come to leave far more people without redress than anyone could have predicted.”",2023-10-10
CNN,Mishaps in Michigan spur Trump allies to spread misleading election claims | CNN Politics,"In the closely watched battleground state of Michigan, election officials are under the microscope, with isolated mistakes or missteps serving as fodder for election deniers to lay the groundwork for widespread doubt of election results.
Several incidents this week – ranging from an isolated case of an illegal ballot cast to human errors from the secretary of state’s office that have since been corrected – have shown how conspiracy theorists have been unrelenting in their attempts to suggest something far more sinister is underway.
“For those of us who run elections, it’s a stressful time anyway and we really worry about this situation and these kinds of stories spiraling out of control,” Washtenaw County clerk Lawrence Kestenbaum, a Democrat, said. “Psychologically, having people impugning the process and so forth is stressful.”
Despite extensive efforts at transparency and attempts to swiftly correct the record for the public in Michigan, the incidents have already been amplified online to suggest systemic cheating and fraud in the election, making it difficult to reel in original misleading claims.
‘Canary in the coal mine’
Although Michigan has had a smooth and strong start to its statewide early in-person voting this week, the state also faced several incidents that point to the ease with which small cases can be amplified on social media to suggest otherwise.
On Wednesday morning, confusion over the number of ballots cast in the state was sparked because of a formatting error that has since been corrected, with no extra votes counted, according to the Michigan secretary of state’s office.
Some of the confusion appears to have originated from a post on X by Matthew DePerno, one of the more high-profile election deniers in Michigan. A former GOP nominee for attorney general in Michigan, DePerno was charged last year in connection with efforts in 2020 to illegally access and tamper with voting machines in hopes of proving that the election was stolen from Donald Trump. DePerno has pleaded not guilty in the voting machines case.
DePerno’s post, which has been viewed more than six million times, said his review of Michigan’s Qualified Voter File — a voter records database that tracks ballot submissions — showed one voter ID had recorded a vote dozens of times at various addresses. DePerno added that the data in the spreadsheet showed over 160,000 excess ballots cast.
The Michigan secretary of state’s office attributed the confusion to a “formatting error” in the spreadsheet that it says has been corrected, which inadvertently appeared to show the same vote attributed to former addresses associated with an individual.
“Each of these voters only had one vote recorded for this election. This error in the data export process has been corrected and these erroneous extra lines no longer appear on the report,” the statement said.
Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump also attempted to clear up the allegations in a post on X, saying “it was a glitch in the system - these duplicates were not and WILL NOT BE COUNTED.” Her acknowledgement that this was a glitch, and not indicative of widespread fraud, backed up the explanations from Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat.
When asked about the clarifications from Trump and the secretary of state’s office, DePerno told CNN: “If you believe this is an export issue then you are a moron.”
DePerno’s doubling down despite the explanation and correction underscores the difficulty with assuaging the doubts sown by those spreading the claims on social media to allege wrongdoing.
“The explanation has a lot less reach than the initial claim … when you compare the reach of government officials, it makes it impossible for information to catch up with viral claims,” said Ben Decker, the CEO of threat intelligence group Memetica. “These are kind of the canary in the coal mine of post-Election Day disinformation narratives.”
The far-right conspiracy site The Gateway Pundit also appeared to dismiss the official explanations and referred to the incident as a “voting scandal” in a headline Thursday morning.
“Bless Lara’s heart, but this is not acceptable and likely inaccurate,” The Gateway Pundit wrote in response to her assurance the issue had been dealt with.
Rare case of non-citizen voting
At the same time that the claims by DePerno were making the rounds on social media, authorities announced that Michigan prosecutors charged a Chinese citizen with voter fraud and perjury after he allegedly cast a ballot for the 2024 election.
Sources familiar with the matter told CNN the 19-year-old Chinese man who allegedly voted is a student living in Ann Arbor, home to the University of Michigan. Authorities said the man isn’t a US citizen and therefore can’t vote in federal elections.
Experts say illegal voting by non-citizens is extremely rare, and when it does happen, it is usually caught quickly. The announcement by Michigan’s secretary of state and attorney general, both Democrats, and local prosecutors in Ann Arbor, emphasized the isolated nature of the case.
“Investigations in multiple states and nationwide have found no evidence of large numbers of noncitizens registering to vote. Even less common is a noncitizen actually casting a ballot. When it does happen, we take it extremely seriously,” Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Washtenaw County Prosecutor Eli Savit said in a statement.
It appears that the student’s vote can’t be nullified after the fact and will be counted, since ballots can’t be retrieved once they have gone through the tabulator. Unlike vote-by-mail, ballots cast at in-person voting locations don’t contain any identifying information about the individual voter, making it impossible to determine which one belonged to the student, county clerk Kestenbaum told CNN.
Experts said this is intended to maintain ballot secrecy and is standard election procedure. The case is still under investigation and it’s not clear which candidates the student voted for.
“An in-person ballot is placed in a tabulator or ballot box, intermingled with other ballots. This is to preserve secrecy, so you can’t go into the ballot later and confirm who a particular parson voted for,” said David Becker, a former Justice Department voting rights official and founder of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research.
Investigations are underway to determine whether the incident may have been an accident or part of an intentional foreign plot to undermine the integrity of the US election. The Chinese man – a student at the University of Michigan – cast his ballot on Sunday and then reached out to local election officials later that day in an attempt to get the ballot back, according to a source familiar with the situation.
Benson walks back Dominion claim
Also this week, right-wing accounts on social media began circulating remarks made by Benson at a news conference on Monday during which she claimed there was a “nationwide issue” with some specialized Dominion machines that would make it more cumbersome for Michigan voters with disabilities to split their ticket and vote for candidates from different parties.
Tech billionaire Elon Musk, who has been relentlessly sharing potential misinformation about elections on his account, promoted Benson’s comments in a post on X, asking Dominion “what’s going on” with the machines. The post, which included a video of Benson’s remarks, was viewed over 42 million times.
As conspiracy theories about Dominion’s Voting Assist Terminal (VAT) machines began spreading, the company blasted Benson, accusing her of making “false and misleading” comments about supposed problems with its accessible machines for voters with disabilities.
“The Michigan Department of State has confirmed there is no issue preventing any voters from making their preferred selections and casting their paper ballot,” the Dominion statement said.
The voting technology company said it does not have any machines in any other states that offer straight party-line voting “like the State of Michigan does,” arguing that this was not, in fact, a nationwide issue as Benson had claimed.
Benson subsequently backed off her remarks, saying through a spokesperson “Dominion has explained that the VAT programming error only affects users in Michigan.”
Mishaps and issues involving Dominion machines often catch fire on social media — because many pro-Trump figures are still promoting the lie that Dominion machines were involved in rigging the 2020 election in President Joe Biden’s favor. A controversial right-wing sheriff from Barry County, Michigan, who has also lied about Dominion’s actions in 2020, posted on X this week about a “criminal investigation” he’s leading into the company.
Despite the recent challenges, election officials in Michigan say they are confident that they are prepared to withstand efforts to undermine confidence in the results.
“We are accustomed to scrutiny – everyone thinks they are an expert on elections,” Kestenbaum said. “I don’t spend a lot of time on worst-case scenarios … you can imagine things descending into chaos somehow. I don’t believe that will happen and I think that the official, legal and bipartisan process that we have will prevail over attempts to disrupt or subvert it.”

CNN,Election officials are hustling to fight misinformation in real time as early voting begins | CNN Politics,"The election misinformation machine is already ramping up in critical battleground states as early voting gets underway, and election officials are hustling to combat falsehoods in real time.
Conservatives have been sharing uncorroborated instances of machines flipping votes, claims of widespread fraud in mail ballots and suggestions that election officials are subverting the process if it takes multiple days to count ballots. The claims are ricocheting around social media as voters hit the polls. They mirror claims that former President Donald Trump and his allies spread around the 2020 election as they tried to head off Trump’s loss to now-President Joe Biden.
State and local election officials, however, are also preparing for a deluge of false and misleading claims, and are actively trying to address issues before they go far.
“Our humble ask is that before people swallow whole what they see in their social media feed, they at least verify it against a trusted source,” Minnesota Secretary of State and president of the National Association of Secretaries of State Steve Simon, a Democrat, told reporters this week.
Bret Schafer, a senior fellow at the nonprofit Alliance for Securing Democracy who’s focused on election-related disinformation, said that some of the push is needed because social media companies have stepped back from challenging false claims.
“It’s reassuring how much better election officials have gotten around communication in advance of the election,” Schafer said. “There definitely wasn’t the same level of interaction four years ago … in trying to communicate any changes in how voting will work this time, and, to the extent possible, short-circuit some of the false election narratives we know will be coming.”
Here are four examples from this month as early voting continues in earnest:
Machines switching votes?
“We have received a report that twice, persons voting on a machine had the machine alter their vote from Trump to Harris,” the Washoe County Republican Party in Nevada claimed in an email blast that was flagged on social media by local political reporter Jon Ralston.
It was reminiscent of the many debunked voting machine claims from 2020. And while those conspiracy theories continue to swirl online, a spokesperson for Washoe County told CNN there have been no specific complaints about machines flipping votes since early voting began.
Claims of voter fraud also circulated in Texas this week as early voting began in the state. In one instance, shared by some right-wing personalities on social media, a man claimed that his vote had been switched on the voting machine from one candidate to another, telling people to “check your paper ballots.” Trump allies who shared the video claimed that Texas’ Tarrant County used a voting system that had vulnerabilities and led to the alleged switch.
The county’s Elections Administration Department issued a statement Tuesday pushing back on these claims, saying that in one reported instance, a voter reviewed their printed ballot and “found that it did not correctly reflect his choice for President.”
Another ballot was provided and the issue was resolved, the department said, adding that they had “no reason to believe votes are being switched by the voting system.”
Counting votes in Georgia
In Georgia, several right-wing accounts seized on a CBS interview with GOP Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger over the weekend, in which he said the state should be able to report 70% to 75% of the vote total by 8 p.m. on Election Day. He noted the state would still need to tally overseas and military ballots, which can be received until the Friday after Election Day and could help determine the winner in a razor-thin race.
But Raffensperger’s critics twisted his comments to make it seem as if he was suggesting 25% of the remaining vote would come from overseas or military ballots and that there was no chance the state would be able to report results for three days – claims Raffensperger did not make.
“I know you’re up to something & it is going to all come to light,” Kylie Jane Kremer, a Trump supporter who helped to organize the January 6, 2021, rally on the Ellipse that precluded the attack on the US Capitol, said on X. “You don’t just belong in jail, you belong under the jail, for subverting Georgian’s right to secure, free & fair elections.”
Kremer told CNN, “Raffensperger is putting out confusing information to the masses on voting,” but said she believes all overseas and military ballots should be counted.
Raffensperger responded to some of the criticism on X, reiterating that most of the early vote would be tallied by 8 p.m. and Election Day votes would be reported later that evening.
But the inaccurate extrapolations had already taken off and, much to the disappointment of officials in Georgia, Utah Sen. Mike Lee was among those criticizing Raffensperger.
Lee, a Republican, posted “Just…no” on X, as he shared a post inaccurately claiming that Raffensperger said the results wouldn’t be ready for three days.
Raffensperger’s appearance on CBS came as he too was debunking a claim that machines were flipping votes.
“We’re going to respond quickly to these sorts of things in 2024 because it’s not supported by the facts,” Raffensperger said. “The equipment’s working.”
Mail ballots in Arizona
In Arizona, officials were also hitting back at the notion that taking multiple days to count the ballots somehow equates to election fraud.
“Any Secretary of State in any state who gets on TV today and says it’ll take days to count the votes is a cheater, a traitor, and should be arrested,” a prominent right-wing account called Catturd posted on X.
Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, a Republican, shot back: “That’s one possibility. A different possibility is that different states have different state laws.”
In Arizona, for instance, experts expect hundreds of thousands of voters to return their mail ballots on Election Day, which takes time to process and count. Other states don’t have the same kind of deluge of Election Day mail ballots.
Unattended ballots in Minnesota
In another instance that left officials scrambling, officials in Minneapolis over the weekend tried to mitigate the fallout of a picture circulating on social media showing boxes of unattended ballots in a parking lot.
Local GOP leaders and pro-Trump accounts raised suspicions on Friday about the incident, spreading the photo and questioning the legitimacy of mail-in voting, which nonpartisan experts say is a secure process that isn’t plagued by widespread fraud.
Within hours, Hennepin County officials issued a statement acknowledging the “unacceptable” security lapse – and posted 18 minutes of surveillance footage to YouTube, showing that nobody touched the unguarded ballots.
“Mis- and disinformation is one of the biggest challenges facing elections officials right now, and getting out ahead of rumors as quickly as we can is our only hope of combatting them,” Hennepin County elections director Ginny Gelms told CNN.

CNN,Senate confirms FAA leader after 19-month vacancy | CNN Politics,"The Senate on Tuesday confirmed Michael Whitaker to a five-year term running the Federal Aviation Administration.
Whitaker is a former Obama-era deputy FAA administrator, and said at his confirmation hearing earlier this month that his past “time at FAA gives me some real advantage” taking the top job. Most recently he was an executive at a company developing electric air taxis, and he previously served in senior roles at several airlines, including United Airlines.
Now, Whitaker takes the reins at the FAA as the agency, in his words, “faces big challenges.”
Among his first priorities, industry officials say, is providing a steady, consistent hand atop FAA, which oversees aviation safety, air traffic control and aircraft certification. The FAA has come under scrutiny after a series of airliner close calls on US runways, flight disruptions linked to air traffic control understaffing and the killing of 346 people in Boeing 737 MAX crashes after the FAA certified the plane as safe.
Whitaker has also said he would prioritize technological and other improvements for “the aviation system of the future.”
“When I was at the FAA just a few years ago drones were new, commercial space launches were rare and flying taxis were still only in cartoons,” Whitaker said at his confirmation hearing. “All of this has changed and it requires that the agency look forward, adapt quickly and execute a plan for the future.”
He has support from a variety of aviation industry groups, including those representing airlines, pilots and airline passengers.
He is the Biden administration’s second FAA chief nominee. The first, Denver airport CEO Phil Washington, withdrew his name over criticism of his limited aviation experience and link to a political corruption investigation.
The post was vacated in March 2022 when Steve Dickson, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, stepped down midway through his five-year term. The agency has been run by a series of interim administrators, most recently the deputy transportation secretary.

CNN,Trump says ‘war hawk’ Liz Cheney should be fired upon in escalation of violent rhetoric against his opponents | CNN Politics,"Donald Trump said former Rep. Liz Cheney is a “war hawk” who should be fired upon, as he raged against one of his most prominent intra-party critics while campaigning Thursday night in Arizona.
“She’s a radical war hawk. Let’s put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, OK?” the former president said at a campaign event in Glendale with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson. “Let’s see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face.”
Trump also hurled insults at Cheney, once the third-ranking Republican in House leadership, calling her “very dumb,” a “stupid person” and “the moron.”
Trump’s suggestion that Cheney should face gunfire represents an escalation of the violent language he has used to target his political foes. And it comes days before an election in which the former president — who never accepted his 2020 loss — has already undermined public confidence. In recent weeks, he has also suggested a military crackdown on political opponents he has described as “the enemy within.”
Cheney is perhaps the most vocal Republican critic of Trump’s efforts to overturn the 2020 election, and his role in his supporters’ January 6, 2021, riot at the US Capitol. She played a leading role on the House select committee that investigated the attack, and later was ousted from her deep-red Wyoming House seat by a Trump-backed primary opponent in 2022.
Cheney responded to Trump’s comments overnight, saying: “This is how dictators destroy free nations.”
In a post on X, the former congresswoman went on to say: “They threaten those who speak against them with death. We cannot entrust our country and our freedom to a petty, vindictive, cruel, unstable man who wants to be a tyrant.”
In recent weeks, Cheney has campaigned alongside Vice President Kamala Harris, urging Republicans to set aside party differences to back the Democrat and reject a candidate she says poses a threat to democracy.
Harris, who told reporters traveling with her Friday that she hadn’t spoken with the former congresswoman since the comment, said anyone who uses such rhetoric “is clearly disqualified and unqualified to be president.”
Arizona Attorney General Kris Mayes, a Democrat, on Friday said that her office is investigating whether Trump’s comments are a death threat under state law.
“I have already asked my criminal division chief to start looking at that statement, analyzing it for whether it qualifies as a death threat under Arizona’s laws,” Mayes told Arizona station 12 News.
“I’m not prepared now to say whether it was or it wasn’t, but it is not helpful as we prepare for our election and as we try to make sure that we keep the peace at our polling places and in our state,” she added.
Following outrage over the remark, the Trump campaign on Friday issued a statement, which it later elaborated on, defending the former president.
“President Trump is 100% correct that warmongers like Liz Cheney are very quick to start wars and send other Americans to fight them, rather than go into combat themselves. This is the continuation of the latest fake media outrage days before the election in a blatant attempt to interfere on behalf of Kamala Harris,” Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said.
Dick Cheney’s Harris support surprised Trump
On Thursday, Trump also told Carlson he was surprised former Vice President Dick Cheney also endorsed Harris because he had pardoned Cheney’s former chief of staff Scooter Libby, who was convicted of perjury in 2007.
“I don’t blame him for sticking with his daughter, but his daughter’s a very dumb individual — very dumb,” Trump said.
Trump said Cheney is a “stupid person” and claimed that when the Wyoming Republican was in House Republican leadership, “she always wanted to go to war with people.”
“You know, they’re all war hawks when they’re sitting in Washington in a nice building, saying … ‘Let’s send 10,000 troops right into the mouth of the enemy,’” he said.
The office of former President George W. Bush, in whose administration Dick Cheney served as vice president and Liz Cheney worked in the State Department, declined to comment about Trump’s remarks.
Trump continued his attacks Friday, calling Liz Cheney a “disgrace” and saying, “If she had to do it herself and she had to face the consequences of battle, she wouldn’t be doing it.”
Long history of violent rhetoric
Trump’s use of violent language dates back to his first presidential campaign, in 2015 and 2016, when he suggested a heckler deserved to be “roughed up” and said he’d like to punch another in the face.
Former Defense Secretary Mark Esper wrote in his memoir that while in office, Trump raised the idea of shooting protesters who took to the streets around the White House after the killing of George Floyd in 2020.
“Can’t you just shoot them? Just shoot them in the legs or something?” Trump asked, according to Esper.
He began his bid for the 2024 Republican nomination by telling the Conservative Political Action Conference gathering, “I am your retribution.” Days later, he said at a rally in Waco, Texas, that the 2024 election would be “the final battle.”
And throughout his campaign, he has described those convicted for their actions during the Capitol riot as “hostages.”
Harris has pointed to Trump’s actions and rhetoric — including in a speech she delivered this week from the Ellipse in Washington, the same site where Trump delivered his January 6, 2021, speech — as she tries to court independents and moderate Republicans.
“Donald Trump intends to use the United States military against American citizens who simply disagree with him. People he calls ‘the enemy from within.’ This is not a candidate for president who is thinking about how to make your life better,” Harris said in her Tuesday night remarks. “This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power.”

CNN,"Pennsylvania’s early-voting option is a mess, but very popular | CNN Politics","A cumbersome pre-election voting option in the largest battleground state caused frustration, long lines and claims of voter suppression earlier this week.
As former President Donald Trump and his proxies urged voters to cast their ballots early this election – an abrupt change from years of Republican attacks on early and mail-in voting across the country – several county offices in Pennsylvania faced a flood of people wanting to use the state’s “on-demand mail ballot voting” process.
In Bucks County, just outside of Philadelphia, voters waited several hours to apply for and submit their mail-in ballot on Tuesday, the last day for in-person early voting in the state, until a lawsuit filed by Trump’s campaign successfully extended the deadline.
The court case in Bucks County comes after a flurry of other lawsuits about mail-in ballots in the state challenging issues such as handwritten date requirements and whether to count provisional votes cast in-person by those who had their mail-in ballot rejected for technical reasons. The latter issue is before the US Supreme Court on emergency appeal.
Legal challenges to voting processes in the Keystone State are fueled in part by the lack of a single election authority in the state and compounded by a politically split state government which has been unable to iron out logistics in its relatively new – but popular – on-demand mail ballot voting procedure ahead of November 5.
In the previous presidential election, more than 3 million Pennsylvanians requested mail-in ballots and 85% – just over 2.6 million – voted by mail. To date, more than 2 million people have requested mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania and so far, 71% – over 1.5 million – have returned them.
Unlike in most other states – the secretary of state in Pennsylvania cannot issue binding guidance to all counties on election matters, resulting in a patchwork of interpretations and processes.
“All 67 counties are sort of free to interpret state statute and when there is a gap in the law and it’s not totally clear, that’s where those the 67 counties can start running in different directions,” Jon Sherman, litigation director for voting rights group Fair Elections Center, said in an interview.
In its statement announcing the newly extended deadline this week, Bucks County called on state lawmakers for “much needed reform and clarity in the election law and to codify what is being decided in courts.”
One key issue left unaddressed by Pennsylvania’s state legislature is its restrictive pre-processing policies for mail-in ballots: election officials are only allowed to start canvassing the mailed ballots at 7 a.m. on Election Day, leading to unnecessarily delayed results.
Republicans change their tune
No-excuse mail-in voting in Pennsylvania is fairly new: Act 77 was passed just five years ago, right before the pandemic, and has since survived attempts by Republican lawmakers to block it through the courts.
Perhaps unexpectedly, Republicans appear to embrace mail-in voting this election cycle. Trump has been actively encouraging voters to get their ballots in early and grassroots organizations are going door-to-door in swing states to “chase” mail ballots in an effort to increase voter turnout.
“There’s been a recognition among Republicans political elites that this is a more convenient method of voting for a lot of people, especially older people who tend to be more Republican,” said Dan Mallinson, associate professor of public policy and administration at Penn State Harrisburg.
But the process’ popularity among voters creates a challenge for election workers.
As in about a dozen other states, pre-election voting in Pennsylvania essentially means filling out a mail-in ballot in-person.
In one transaction, voters apply for, complete and submit their mail-in ballot at a designated election site before Election Day. It’s a convenient, albeit time-consuming, option for voters looking to cast their ballot before November 5. If everything goes right, the whole process can take up to 12 minutes per voter resulting in the long lines seen in Pennsylvania this week.
Coupled with voters’ inexperience with the process, on-demand mail ballot voting has become vulnerable to unsubstantiated claims about the procedures that go viral on social media.
In Allegheny County, election officials put out a statement on Wednesday debunking a video seen millions of times on social media alleging non-citizens cut the line and were allowed to vote at an on-demand voting site. In reality, the video showed a group of registered voters who needed the assistance of translators to cast their ballot, according to a county spokesperson.
The case filed by the Trump campaign on Wednesday morning, claimed Bucks County illegally turned “many” voters away before the 5 p.m. deadline on Tuesday, putting forward affidavits from three individuals who said they weren’t allowed to cast their vote despite arriving at election offices well before 5 p.m.
Videos on social media went viral showing at least one instance of police officers designating an end of mail-in ballot application lines early on Tuesday.
Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance appealed to voters on social media early Thursday morning, asking them to send him instances of people telling them to get out of line at election sites, reposting debunked claims of voter suppression at the hands of Democratic “operatives”.
“This is illegal, and @JoshShapiroPA should do something about operatives in his own party depriving people of their right to vote,” Vance wrote.
A senior official for the Harris campaign addressed the issue in Bucks County in a call with reporters on Thursday, urging people to look at the facts.
“A handful of people were allegedly turned away from early voting lines in Bucks County. The county responded by agreeing in court to additional days, not just hours, of early voting,” the senior official said.
“That is the system working, just as it should,” she added.",2024-11-01
CNN,"Vance suggests upper- and middle-class kids ‘become trans’ for college admissions, says Trump may earn ‘normal gay guy vote’ | CNN Politics","Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance suggested in an interview that aired Thursday that White upper- and middle-class children are incentivized to identify as transgender to gain admission to elite colleges.
“Think about the incentives,” Vance told prominent podcast host Joe Rogan. “If you are a, you know, middle-class or upper middle-class White parent and the only thing that you care about is whether your child goes into Harvard or Yale, like obviously, that pathway has become a lot harder for a lot of upper middle-class kids, but the one way that those people can participate in the DEI bureaucracy in this country is to be trans, and is there a dynamic that’s going on where, if you become trans, that is the way to reject your White privilege.”
“That’s the social signifier. The only one that’s available in the hyper-woke mindset is if you become gender nonbinary,” the Ohio senator added.
Studies have found that because of the discrimination, harassment and lack of support they generally experience in earlier grades, students who identify as transgender would be a lot less likely to have access to higher education in general, let alone an Ivy League school that is difficult to get into, compared with those people who identify with the gender that matches the sex they were assigned at birth.
Vance sat for the wide-ranging interview days after former President Donald Trump did the same – a nearly three-hour appearance that came after years of Rogan saying he would not have the former president on. In the closing days of the presidential election, Trump and Vance have used platforms from podcasts to rallies to make their closing argument to voters.
Vice President Kamala Harris has not appeared on the popular podcast, though Rogan wrote on X that he “really hope(s) we can make it happen” and that the Democrat’s campaign “has not passed on doing the podcast.”
Vance, describing a friend as a “gay Reagan Democrat” who rejects the ideology of progressive politicians, said he believes that the Trump-Vance ticket may earn what he described as the “normal gay guy vote.”
“Frankly, I wouldn’t be surprised if me and Trump won just the normal gay guy vote, because, again, they just wanted to be left the hell alone,” Vance said.
Vance also described a conversation he had with a “very conservative” woman from Mississippi while at the Paris Air Show on a congressional delegation trip about how she believed Paris was more conservative than some United States cities and her experience seeing a man’s genitalia in a miniskirt.
“Oh my God, this is not, this is not empowerment. This is not respecting lifestyle choices. We’re letting a grown man walk around in a mini skirt in broad daylight,” Vance said. “If that’s what you’re doing, you’re a pervert. And I want, I want all of us to say, whatever your political persuasion, just say, ‘No, that’s weird, right?’ You’re not allowed to walk down the street and flash children in the middle of the world’s or the America’s biggest city.”
Vance also said he believes most Americans are open-minded about what he described as “lifestyle choices,” but transgender athletes who compete in women’s sports cross a line.
He later suggested that Democrats want Americans to be in “poor health and overweight” because they would become more liberal.
“Have you seen all these studies that basically connect testosterone levels in young men with conservative politics?” Vance said. “Maybe that’s what’s going on. Maybe that’s why the Democrats want us all to be, you know, poor health and overweight is because that means we’re going to be – no, it means we’re going to be more liberal.”
The campaign did not elaborate on which studies Vance was referring to.
Here are other key moments from the interview:
Chinese hackers targeted Vance’s phone data
Vance on Thursday confirmed that Chinese government-linked hackers had targeted his and Trump’s phone communications by accessing major US telecommunications networks.
“Maybe they got some stuff. We’ll find out eventually. I try not to worry too much about sh*t I can’t control,” Vance told Rogan.
“Luckily, I’m a pretty boring guy, so I don’t think that they got really anything,” the Ohio senator said. “Apparently, they couldn’t get the encrypted messages that weren’t sent. So, I’m pretty careful about making sure I use Signal and iMessage and all that stuff.”
CNN previously reported that Chinese hackers had targeted people affiliated with the Trump-Vance and Harris-Walz campaigns as part of a much broader cyber-espionage effort aimed at high-level US targets. Phone communications of current and former senior US officials are coveted by foreign spies.
Vance, who said Trump’s phone was also apparently hacked, told Rogan that “the way that they hacked our phones is they used the backdoor telecom infrastructure that had been developed in the wake of the Patriot Act.”
He continued: “What I’ve been told is that that infrastructure was used by this Chinese hacker organization … and that’s how they got into the Verizon network and that’s how they got into the AT&T network.”
US law enforcement’s ability to conduct court-authorized surveillance of telecom infrastructure predates the Patriot Act and other post-9/11 national laws. But those laws strengthened those capabilities and the relationship between US law enforcement agencies and telecom firms.
The Chinese government has denied allegations that it hacked into US telecom infrastructure.
The cybersecurity industry dubs the Chinese hacking group in question “Salt Typhoon” and considers it a top-tier threat that is very difficult to detect. Investigation of the hacks is ongoing.
“It’s a pretty badass name,” Vance said. “If they have anything on me, I can’t be too pissed off at them. At least they named themselves Salt Typhoon.”
Vance doesn’t like idea of prosecutions for out-of-state abortions
Vance also said that he doesn’t like the idea of women potentially being prosecuted for getting an out-of-state abortion if the procedure is not legal in their home state.
“I don’t like the idea, to be clear, of people getting arrested for freely moving around the country,” he told Rogan.
The Ohio senator said he’s heard about the idea as a “threat” but has not seen it in practice.
As CNN previously reported, in 2022, Vance was “sympathetic” to the view that a national ban was necessary to stop women from traveling across state lines to obtain an abortion.
Rogan told vance that “the concept in the zeitgeist is that abortion had always been, you know, Roe v. Wade always been the law of the land, and then all of a sudden that was taken away and you have these religious men who are trying to dictate what women can and can’t do with their bodies.”
“Yeah. No, look, I mean, again, I, I understand that,” Vance responded. “I understand the, the, the pushback against that, but I, I think you can go, like, with so many other issues, you can go way too far about it, and it becomes trying to celebrate something that at, at the very best, if you grant, I think every argument of the pro-choice side, it is a neutral thing, not something to be celebrated.”
“I think there’s very few people that are celebrating, though,” Rogan said.
Vance told Rogan he understands the “autonomy value” of the pro-abortion rights argument that men shouldn’t be telling women what they should do with their body, but he emphasized that life also matters.
“That’s the balance that people are trying to strike,” Vance said.

CNN,The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2024 | CNN Politics,"With just over a month until Election Day, the same competitive races continue to dominate the Senate landscape, but there are a few significant changes to the order of CNN’s ranking of the seats most likely to flip.
And in the final weeks, the degree to which these 10 races – which are mostly playing out in states Donald Trump either won or narrowly lost in 2020 – move in the same direction as the presidential contest will likely determine which party wins control of the Senate.
Republicans – who are virtually a lock to pick up the West Virginia seat and would need to either win the White House or pick up one more seat for the majority – have an incentive to nationalize many of their targeted races. Well-funded Democratic incumbents, for the most part, are touting statewide and local accomplishments and their support for abortion rights.
Two states that are part of the Democratic “blue wall” – and also key White House battlegrounds – move up on this month’s rankings, which are based on reporting, as well as fundraising, polling and advertising data. Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are now in the middle of the pack of flippable seats, along with Michigan, which remains at No. 4.
The oddity of this year’s fight for the Senate is that Democrats have consistently led in the public polling of key races, but it’s Republicans who are poised to gain seats and, potentially, control of the chamber.
That’s a reflection of the Senate map – but also increasingly some post-Labor Day tightening as GOP spending picks up and voters get to know their candidates. Still, no public general election polling that meets CNN standards has shown the Republican nominee ahead in any of the seats that Democrats are defending, save for West Virginia.
And two GOP targets – Arizona and Nevada – are moving down the list because Republicans have not kept the races as competitive as elsewhere. Earlier this year, those two states were Nos. 4 and 5. Now, they’re at 7 and 8.
At the same time, Democrats are trying to expand the map in hopes of mitigating potential losses. As CNN first reported last week, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is making multimillion-dollar TV investments in Texas and Florida. DSCC Chairman Gary Peters has insisted that this is extra spending that won’t take money away from their defensive priorities. Texas remains at No. 9 on CNN’s ranking, while Florida fell off the list earlier this year in favor of the race in deep-blue Maryland.
Nebraska is a new state generating political buzz, but it hasn’t earned a place on the ranking. Still, independent Dan Osborn’s challenge to GOP Sen. Deb Fischer has prompted the National Republican Senatorial Committee to start spending here, and elections analysts have moved the race out of the solid Republican category.
There remain lots of unknowns in Nebraska, but we’ll be watching to see how that race – and the 10 others – develop over the next month.
1. West Virginia
West Virginia is essentially out of reach for Democrats, who had little chance of holding this seat without Sen. Joe Manchin running for reelection. Manchin, now an independent who caucuses with Democrats, is likely to be succeeded by Republican Jim Justice, the state’s two-term governor.
Justice has had his share of negative headlines, but in a state poised to back Trump by a significant margin, it’s hard to see a world in which Republicans don’t pick up this open seat.
2. Montana
Democrat Jon Tester, who’s running for a fourth term in a state Trump has twice carried by double digits, remains the most vulnerable Senate incumbent this year. Republicans feel confident their nominee, Tim Sheehy, has an edge – and both Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales and the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter have shifted their rating of the once toss-up race toward the GOP.
Democrats still see a path to victory for Tester, who has a proven history of defying the partisan lean of his state by communicating both what he’s done for Montanans and painting a contrast with his opponents.
Democrats are trying that playbook against Sheehy, trying to define the wealthy businessman and retired Navy SEAL, who moved to Montana in 2014, as an out-of-state carpetbagger who cannot be trusted. Recently unearthed audio recordings of Sheehy using racist stereotypes to refer to Native Americans has played into that message, with Democrats arguing that he’s alienating a crucial demographic in the state. In a debate earlier this week, Sheehy acknowledged his comments were “insensitive,” saying, “I come from the military as many of our tribal members do. You know, we make insensitive jokes and probably off-color sometimes.”
Tester’s campaign is now leaning into abortion rights on the airwaves – an issue that’s on the ballot in Montana this year. A recent ad features a self-described “life-long” Republican woman arguing that Sheehy “wants to take away personal freedoms.”
But Republicans are invoking transgender issues in an attempt to cast Tester as a liberal who’s been changed by his years in Washington, while Sheehy is trying to tie Tester to Kamala Harris – especially on immigration. Tester – who has not endorsed in the presidential race – tried to meet those attacks during their debate by pointing out that Sheehy would not have supported this year’s bipartisan border bill that Republicans blocked.
3. Ohio
Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is facing his toughest reelection in a state that has twice backed Trump by 8 points. Public polling still shows the three-term senator ahead of GOP nominee Bernie Moreno, although that is expected to tighten as more Republican voters come home to Moreno. Brown was at 47% to Moreno’s 43% in a late September New York Times/Siena College poll among likely Ohio voters – not far outside the margin of error. But the reassuring news for Democrats: Brown was winning 10% of Trump voters.
Democrats have seized on Moreno’s recent comments at a town hall suggesting that some suburban women were single-issue voters when it comes to abortion and questioning why women over 50 would care about the topic. Brown pointed to the remarks as evidence that his opponent is out of step with the 57% of Ohio voters who last year approved a ballot measure protecting reproductive rights. WinSenate, a Democratic outside group, also launched a new ad with a woman talking about the emergency abortion she underwent at 25 for an ectopic pregnancy, saying, “Our lives don’t belong in Bernie Moreno’s hands.”
(Moreno’s campaign said in a statement that he was “clearly making a tongue-in-cheek joke about how Sherrod Brown and members of the leftwing media like to pretend that the only issue that matters to women voters is abortion,” and that Moreno believes women “care just as much about the economy, rising prices, crime and our open southern border as male voters do.”)
The Senate contest in Ohio ranked as the most expensive congressional race on record, as of October 3, with total ad spending from both parties this cycle, including future reservations, exceeding $446 million, according to AdImpact. Brown – who announced raising $30.6 million in the third quarter – has continued to tout his work to pass the PACT Act to help veterans exposed to burn pits, while Moreno tries to nationalize the race by tying Brown to Harris and inflation and linking himself to Trump. The Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC tied to GOP leadership, is attacking Brown over transgender issues to try to cast him as out-of-step with the partisanship of the state.
4. Michigan
Michigan remains the most competitive open seat on this list. Democrat Elissa Slotkin has held a narrow edge in the race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow, but the absence of an incumbent and the competitiveness of the presidential race in the Wolverine State makes it one that could come down to the wire.
Slotkin, a third-term congresswoman, led Republican former Rep. Mike Rogers 47% to 42% among likely voters in a late September New York Times/Siena College poll, with Slotkin drawing 6% of likely voters who also said they would vote for Trump. Slotkin has a strong fundraising record – her campaign announced raising $18 million in the third quarter – but Republicans are pouring more money into this state, with the Senate Leadership Fund recently announcing a $22.5 million investment.
Slotkin has been running ads on abortion – an issue that has helped propel recent Democratic victories in the state. Her spots claim that Rogers’ past support for abortion restrictions makes him untrustworthy on the issue now. “I’m scared that Mike Rogers will continue to take away my rights,” says one woman in a spot who says she needed an abortion to save her life.
Rogers has been responding on air, speaking directly to camera while holding hands with his wife in one new spot, saying he respects Michigan voters’ decision on abortion rights and “won’t do anything to change it” in the Senate.
Rogers, the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, scored the endorsement of the state Farm Bureau’s PAC, which had previously backed Stabenow (the chair of the Senate Agriculture panel). Rogers, whom Democrats have attacked for living in Florida after he left Congress a decade ago, is running spots that tout his Michigan roots and public service. Rogers and Republicans are also attacking Slotkin and the Biden administration over plans to support the building of electric vehicles, using the misleading term “mandate.”
5. Pennsylvania
Democratic Sen. Bob Casey’s race against Republican challenger Dave McCormick moves two spots up on the list in light of heavy GOP outside spending, some tighter polling and the competitiveness of the presidential race in a state that is part of Democrats’ so-called blue wall of must-win states.
September polling from Marist, Quinnipiac University, the New York Times/Siena College/Philadelphia Inquirer, Franklin & Marshall, CBS News/YouGov and Fox News all gave Casey anywhere from a 5- to 9-point lead among likely voters. Polls from CNN and The Washington Post around the same time, however, showed no clear leader.
The two candidates, who met on the debate stage for the first time Thursday night, have been hitting the airwaves with competing messages, as have their allied outside groups. Democrats are going after McCormick on abortion, including one ad that features footage of him referring to himself as “pro-life.” The Senate Leadership Fund, which is adding $28 million to GOP sending here, and the pro-McCormick Keystone Renewal PAC have been attacking Casey over inflation and immigration.
McCormick’s tenure as the CEO of FreeMarkets – a Pittsburgh-based software company – has also been featured in ads on both sides. The Democratic group WinSenate is accusing him of outsourcing jobs and pointing to his management of the company to argue that “Connecticut Dave” – he owns a home in the Nutmeg State – “wants to buy our Senate seat.” McCormick is running ads featuring former FreeMarkets employees praising him and touting the company’s hiring policies.
6. Wisconsin
Wisconsin also moves up two spots on the list amid signs that some Republicans could be drifting home toward their party’s nominee, Eric Hovde, in his challenge to Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin.
The two-term senator maintained a modest edge over Hovde in a Marquette University Law School poll released this week – 51% to 45% among likely voters when third-party candidates are included and 53% to 46% in a head-to-head matchup. Baldwin had a similar 7-point lead in a New York Times/Siena College survey of the two-person race taken around the same time.
While Baldwin has repeatedly outraised Hovde, the Senate Leadership Fund is also pouring funds – $17 million – into the Badger State, and Hovde has plenty of his own money to pay for ads at the lower candidate rate if he chooses. (We’ll be eying his third-quarter fundraising filing for details about how much the Sunwest Bank CEO had loaned his campaign through September.) Ads from Hovde – whose campaign recently underwent a shakeup – have sought to tie Baldwin to Harris, attacking her over border security, fentanyl and transgender rights.
But Baldwin, who’s made an effort to visit the red, rural parts of Wisconsin, has a well-defined brand. She picked up the endorsement of the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation this week – a notable get for a Democrat running statewide. Much of Democratic advertising has played up Hovde’s past controversial comments and sought to cast him as a California carpetbagger – he owns property in Laguna Beach, even though he was born and raised in Wisconsin and his family’s company is a prominent state brand.
7. Arizona
Arizona is a conservative-leaning purple state, where Republicans should ordinarily be able to pick off a Senate seat – especially an open one. But in the race to replace retiring Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, Republican candidate Kari Lake seems to have hit a ceiling.
The 2022 gubernatorial nominee is well known in the state, but not necessarily for the right reasons. She still refuses to accept her loss for governor and, despite tethering herself to Trump, is underperforming his polling numbers.
Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego led Lake by 10 points among likely voters in a Marist poll and 13 points in a Fox News survey, both from mid-September. Lake was polling behind Trump in both surveys by 6 points and 8 points respectively.
Lake and the NRSC are blaming Gallego for inflation and immigration – pointing to his support for what they’re calling the “Kamala Inflation Act.” (Harris cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate for the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.) And while the Senate Leadership Fund hasn’t spent here, a Club for Growth-affiliated group is also airing attacks on the congressman. Gallego, a former member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, was on the airwaves for months introducing himself to voters statewide as a Marine veteran and is touting his support from law enforcement and Republican voters. He announced raising $21.7 million in the third quarter.
8. Nevada
Nevada moves down two spots on the list as Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen appears to be in a stronger position against Republican opponent Sam Brown in a state where Democratic prospects seem to have picked up since Harris ascended to the top of the ticket.
Rosen, who appeared at a Harris rally in Las Vegas earlier this week, led Brown by 10 points in a CNN poll in late August. Like Lake in Arizona, Brown – an Army veteran who first ran for office in Texas and lost the GOP primary for Nevada’s other Senate seat last year – also appears to be running up against a ceiling.
Rosen and Democrats are hitting Brown over his previous stances on abortion – which is on the ballot this year in Nevada. Brown, who says he supports current state law legalizing the procedure up to 24 weeks, has said he’d “close the door” on backing a national abortion ban.
Rosen has had a fundraising edge over her opponent, and this week, national Republicans canceled their remaining independent expenditures in the state in favor of running hybrid ads with Brown, which allows them to benefit from the lower candidate rate in the ultra-pricey Las Vegas media market — a strategy they’ve employed in races across the country to try to compete with well-funded Democratic candidates on the airwaves.
9. Texas
National Democrats’ decision to invest TV resources in Texas was the first major signal the party is putting money where its mouth is on the competitiveness of the Lone Star State this year. Democrats see Republican Sen. Ted Cruz as unpopular and his Democratic challenger, Rep. Colin Allred, as the man to beat him, even in a state that is still comfortably red at the presidential level.
The first hybrid ad between Allred and the DSCC features Kate Cox, the woman who had to leave the state to seek an abortion after her fetus had been diagnosed with a deadly condition, and Amanda Zurawski, who sued the state after she was denied an abortion when experiencing complications. “If you’re experiencing pregnancy complications in Texas, you’re in danger,” Zurawski says in the ad, “and it’s Ted Cruz and the anti-abortion extremists’ fault.”
Allred has also tried to flip the script on Republicans by accusing Cruz of “doing nothing to secure the border.” Cruz, in turn, is attacking Allred over a vote related to the inclusion of transgender athletes in women’s sports. “Boys and girls are different,” is how another ad from the Republican opens. “This election is about keeping Texas Texas,” Cruz has said.
Cruz only beat Democrat Beto O’Rourke by 3 points in 2018. But Democrats hope that Allred, a former NFL player who flipped a Dallas-area House seat the same year, is a more formidable challenger and can turn out more minority voters. (Allred would be the state’s first Black senator if he wins.)
Even Republicans acknowledge that Allred is running a good race, and the NRSC is investing here to help Cruz and the state party. Still, Democrats have not won a statewide election in Texas since 1994, so this remains an uphill battle for Allred.
10. Maryland
The race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin remains in tenth place this month as Angela Alsobrooks fights to keep this seat in party hands. Joe Biden won Maryland by 33 points in 2020, but Republican nominee Larry Hogan – a popular former two-term governor – has a supportive super PAC committing $18 million to tout his independence.
Alsobrooks, the Prince George’s County executive, led Hogan by 11 points in a recent Washington Post/University of Maryland poll. She’s become better known statewide and has made gains among voters who say they care about Democrats maintaining control of the Senate. The argument that Hogan would be another vote for Senate Republicans has been Democrats’ central pitch in deep-blue Maryland, especially on abortion rights and Trump.
Voters in the Post survey were split over whether Hogan would back his party’s leaders in the Senate. He’s winning nearly half of independents, as well as 18% of Democrats. And as he tries to combat Democratic attacks over abortion rights, he’s run ads about being “the ultimate girl dad” and “one of the few Republicans who never caved” to Trump. Hogan rejected the former president’s endorsement earlier this year, but Democrats quickly seized on Trump saying that he’d like to see Hogan win.
Maryland’s Future, the super PAC backing Hogan, is trying to localize the race by attacking Alsobrooks for improperly taking advantage of tax breaks she did not qualify for, as first reported by CNN. (Her senior adviser told CNN that she was unaware of the problem and that her attorneys are working with both the District of Columbia and Prince George’s County to resolve the issue.)

CNN,In pictures: Harris running mate Tim Walz | CNN Politics,"Vice President Kamala Harris selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, capping the Midwestern Democrat’s short but swift ascent from a relative unknown to a leading driver of the Democratic attacks on Donald Trump and the MAGA agenda.
Before Walz was elected governor in 2018, he served 12 years in Congress, representing a conservative-leaning rural district that, both before and after his tenure, has been mostly dominated by Republicans.

CNN,Analysis: Trump is already poisoning trust in yet another US election | CNN Politics,"If God was the vote counter, Donald Trump says he’d win in a landslide.
The Republican nominee suggested on Thursday that divine intervention in next week’s election would reveal him as the rightful winner of even Democratic bastions like California.
On one level, Trump’s comment shows how his false election fraud claims have entered the outer realms of absurdity.
But this goes beyond hyperbole. Trump — who altered reality for tens of millions of Americans by claiming he was cheated out of power four years ago — is creating a sinister threat to the 2024 election and spinning a legacy of fractured trust that could taint presidential votes long after he’s left the stage. The election fraud claims that Trump most notably supercharged in 2020 to salve his humiliation at losing to Joe Biden are already at high intensity this year.
After laying out the darkest closing argument in modern American history, Trump is now increasingly turning to poisoning public confidence in the election. In New Mexico on Thursday, he falsely claimed the state was actually in his column in 2016 and 2020. “I believe we won it twice,” he said. “If we could bring God down from heaven and he’d be the vote counter, we’d win this, we’d win California, we’d win a lot of states. … You have just got to keep the votes honest.”
In reality, Trump lost New Mexico twice, by 8 and 11 points, and his claims he could win Democratic strongholds like California but for vote fraud are wildly off base. But they are part of a clear and deliberate strategy that is unfolding before the eyes of millions of voters to create an impression that Tuesday’s election will be fraudulent. This might seed ground for legal challenges if Trump loses, and it also serves to crank up fury among his supporters already primed by past false fraud claims. Trump is also working in conjunction with the conservative media machine to create an impression that his victory is a certainty and that a win for Vice President Kamala Harris and Democrats can only be the result of fraud.
The ex-president’s increasing efforts to shatter the credibility of the 2024 election, as an apparent Plan B if he loses, coincide with a widening effort by GOP officials and “Make America Great Again” activists to position to undermine any Harris victory in courts, local election jurisdictions and even in state legislatures.
Comprehensive recent reporting by CNN has detailed these schemes.
- For instance, an investigation published on Thursday showed that some of the same activists who tried to overturn Biden’s victory in 2020 are building a step-by-step plan to undermine the results if Trump falls short again.
- Trump and Republican National Committee officials have increasingly floated claims about potential issues with mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania.
- House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Harris, a Maryland Republican, said that “it makes a lot of sense” to allocate North Carolina’s electoral voters before votes are tallied because of the risk that the aftermath of Hurricane Helene could make it hard for some voters to cast ballots. The congressman later said the comment was taken out of context, but it revived fears that some GOP state legislatures — acting on hyped-up claims of fraud or other reasoning — could ignore the will of voters and award election victories to Trump.
- Republicans have also made extensive efforts, including in the House of Representatives, to highlight what experts say is the almost non-existent problem of voting by non-citizens.
- In one case this week, Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin pushed an 11th-hour effort to remove 1,600 suspected non-citizens from the rolls despite concerns the move will sweep up and disenfranchise some American citizens. A divided US Supreme Court allowed it.
- CNN reported Thursday that a misinformation microphone wielded by X owner and Trump supporter Elon Musk has become impossible for election officials in key battleground states to counter.
This catalogue of challenges to the fairness of the 2024 election, taken together with Trump’s increasing, bellicose claims of corruption, is creating a surreal new reality, given that the United States is the world’s most important democracy and has long been regarded by outsiders as the gold standard of self-governance.
A former and possibly future president who trashes elections as a tool of power
There is nothing unusual about extensive litigation in election season by both parties, which maintain armies of lawyers to challenge voting arrangements, counting practices and even results every election cycle. The 2000 election between then-Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George W. Bush caused weeks of bitter legal fights over the close result in Florida, which was eventually resolved in the 43rd president’s favor by the US Supreme Court. Gore conceded that election, thereby guaranteeing an uncontested transfer of presidential power — a step Trump refused to take four years ago.
Declining to accept the result of elections has not exclusively been a Republican transgression. Former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, for instance, refused to concede her race against Republican Brian Kemp in 2018, citing voter suppression allegations, though the Democrat did accept her rival was elected.
But it is new to have a major presidential candidate slamming the fairness and legality of successive elections ahead of time and warning they will only accept results based on their arbitrary and often evidence-free evaluations of fairness.
Trump’s intentions shone through a Truth Social post on Thursday in which he seized on incidents in Pennsylvania to claim that the results in the crucial swing state are fraudulent. The cases concern a potential irregularity in Lancaster County involving around 2,500 voter registration forms. In York County, election officials have declined more than 700 “questionable” voter registration applications and referred them to the district attorney’s office for investigation, CNN’s Danny Freeman reported on Thursday.
Investigations are still pending and it’s possible fraud could be unearthed. But Trump is already off and running without waiting for the facts. “We caught them CHEATING BIG in Pennsylvania. Must announce and PROSECUTE, NOW! This is a CRIMINAL VIOLATION OF THE LAW. STOP VOTER FRAUD!” Trump wrote. “WE ARE ON THEM ALL THIS TIME! Who would have ever thought that our Country is so CORRUPT?”
Incidents in Pennsylvania show how the vortex of conspiracy theories created by Trump about US elections become self-fulfilling.
The alleged violations were discovered, which ought to underline how secure American voting really is. But instead, every new glitch becomes grist for yet another false claim.
Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on Wednesday that Trump’s claims of cheating in the commonwealth were “more of the same” from the ex-president. “Donald Trump wants to, again, use the same playbook, where he tries to create chaos and stoke division and fear, about our system. But again, we will have a free and fair, safe and secure election, in Pennsylvania, and the will of the people will be respected and protected.”
A dark new election tradition with a potentially devastating legacy
Trump’s assaults on the probity of American elections have made clear that a cycle of pre-election attempts to crush public confidence in the results has become as much of a presidential election tradition as primary season, the conventions and the historic moment when TV networks call the eventual winner.
The ex-president’s attempts to instill doubt in the system could also have a long-lasting legacy. Many polls show declining trust in the election system — and a new survey from CNN this week showed Trump’s antics have left the electorate jaundiced about his likely conduct next week. Just 30% of registered voters think Trump would accept the results of the election and concede if he loses, while 73% say that Harris would accept an election loss.
However, even if Americans may have concerns about their votes being counted, it’s not stopping them from casting ballots. More than 60 million Americans have already voted ahead of Tuesday’s election. And for all the tumult caused by Trump’s refusal to admit defeat and attempts to steal power after the 2020 election, the system did, eventually, ensure that the rightful winner of the presidency ended up in the Oval Office. The ex-president’s persistent and baseless claims of widespread fraud were thrown out by multiple courts at all levels including the Supreme Court.
Yet the longevity of a democracy rests on retaining the trust of the people. And if one of the candidates in a presidential election won’t accept that principle, the essential bargain between the governed and those who govern, which lies at the heart of the republic, is at risk.
For all America’s deep cultural and ideological divides, there was always a sense that elections could provide at least a temporary resolution to national disputes. That mythical trust in democracy was partially fractured in 2020 simply because Trump refused to admit defeat and then laid the foundation of his subsequent presidential campaign on the false premise that he won.
Gabriel Sterling, the Republican chief operating officer for Georgia’ secretary of state office, became a hero of democracy in 2020 with his clear denunciations of false fraud claims by the Trump campaign in his state. He is already warning that Americans need to recommit to bedrock values before next week’s election.
“We have had a history of over 200 years of the person who comes up short shaking the hand of the person who won and moving on,” Sterling told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Thursday.
One side, in perhaps the most fraught and portentous election in modern US history, will face this painful choice whenever this year’s result becomes clear. Trump has already signaled he’s unlikely to admit defeat whatever happens. And Harris, if she loses, will face the prospect of conceding to a rival she has called a fascist.
But such dilemmas represent the essence of democracy.
“We are going to have the most secure election in American history across the country, Georgia included,” Sterling said.
“We have to learn to accept outcomes.”",2024-11-01
CNN,Raffensperger says viral video of alleged voting fraud ‘obviously fake’ and likely foreign meddling in Georgia’s elections | CNN Politics,"Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on Thursday said the state had been targeted by election disinformation, pointing to a viral video of alleged voter fraud that he suggested could be the result of foreign meddling.
The original video, which emerged on the social media platform X on Thursday, had well over half a million views and purportedly showed a Haitian immigrant claiming he voted several times for Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential election. Even though the original post was deleted, the video continues to circulate on social media as proof of supposed voter fraud.
Raffensperger, the top election official in the battleground state, said the video was “obviously fake” and was intended to raise illegitimate concerns about Georgia’s voting process. He said he’s working with state officials and federal authorities to “combat” the video and “identify the origin of it.”
“Earlier today, our office became aware of a video purporting to show a Haitian immigrant with multiple Georgia ID’s claiming to have voted multiple times,” Raffensperger said in a statement. “This is false, and is an example of targeted disinformation we’ve seen this election.”
“CISA [Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency] is currently investigating,” Raffensperger said. “In the meantime, we ask Elon Musk and the leadership of other social media platforms to take this down. This is obviously fake and part of a disinformation effort. Likely it is a production of Russian troll farms.”
CNN reached out to the X account that appeared to have posted the video on Thursday to ask for information and context about the content. The account has been active on Twitter since 2009.
Former CISA director Chris Krebs also attributed the video to “more nonsense from Russian troll farms.”
“Expect a deluge of pure nonsense like this in the next several weeks,” he continued.
Amy Kremer, who has a seat on the Republican National Committee, shared the video on X, asking, “How did they get multiple IDs?” and saying it “is illegal & not okay.”
Gabriel Sterling, the chief operating officer in the Georgia secretary of state’s office, fired back at Kremer on social media for sharing the video.
“No responsible person would retweet this ridiculously obvious lie and disinformation. Those doing so are acting to further the efforts of America’s enemies and undermine the security of our nation. The judgement of those sharing this should be questioned in all things,” Sterling said on X.
Raffensperger said Thursday that “as Americans we can’t let our enemies use lies to divide us and undermine our faith in our institutions - or each other.”
Over half of Georgia’s voters have already cast their ballots, as early voting turnout has shattered previous records set in 2020 across the state.

CNN,White House works to Trump-proof Biden’s legacy ahead of tight election | CNN Politics,"On the day President Joe Biden announced he would not seek reelection, he convened his senior team at the White House, asking for a plan to “run through the tape” in his final six months in office, implementing key laws and cementing foreign policy, chief of staff Jeff Zients told political appointees on a call this summer.
Whatever Biden’s team accomplishes in its last months in office, should Donald Trump win back the White House, there is little that can’t be undone. Just as Biden spent his first hours in office reversing some of Trump’s biggest moves, rejoining international pacts and signing executive orders, so too can Trump cancel much of Biden’s agenda.
“The power of the presidency is such that it is quite difficult to Trump-proof agencies and programs from someone who is determined to break the guardrails and shift the direction of the country if the courts and Congress fail to play their proper role of constraining that overreach,” said Sen. Chris Coons, a Delaware Democrat and close Biden ally.
Here’s how the Biden White House is working to protect some of his key accomplishments from a potential second Trump administration:
Legislative wins
The cornerstone of Biden’s legacy – and its most durable feature – is a series of sweeping legislative wins designed to pour funding into rebuilding the nation’s infrastructure, expanding clean technology capacity and bolstering domestic manufacturing in critical areas like chip production. Taken together, the laws are designed to reshape key pillars of the US economy over the next decade.
Taken in isolation, each law is designed to deploy significant federal resources: The American Rescue Plan, a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 economic relief package signed in March 2021; the $1.2 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Law; the CHIPS and Science Act, a $200 billion law to boost American chip manufacturing; and the Inflation Reduction Act, a $750 billion health care, tax, and climate bill.
Together, that’s more than $4 trillion of investment, spending and tax credits.
Most of the American Rescue Plan money has been spent, with a small amount clawed back by Congress.
Funding for the CHIPS law and the bulk of the infrastructure bill was designed to be deployed through the 2024 fiscal year. A portion of the infrastructure funds was allocated to be spent after that period, primarily through awards to states for bridge, road and water projects. Funding distribution for the Inflation Reduction Act covers a 10-year period, but the bulk of the funds available must be deployed by the end of this fiscal year.
The vast majority of the funding made available through this fiscal year has already been announced, making any efforts to claw back those funds legally tenuous, if not outright impossible.
From the day each bill was signed, Biden implored his team to implement them and get funding out the door as quickly as possible, especially as Republicans have campaigned on dismantling or defunding key pieces of Biden’s signature accomplishments.
“We are moving as fast as we can, knocking down obstacles to progress when we see them – and I don’t think that has changed with the president stepping out of the race, that hasn’t changed with the election coming, and it won’t change,” a senior administration official said.
But there’s still about $288 billion in infrastructure funding that won’t be available until Fiscal Year 2025 or later, and $14.8 billion for the Inflation Reduction Act after Fiscal Year 2025. And about $10 billion of the funding already announced for CHIPS projects includes funding from Fiscal Years 2025 and 2026.
There are legal guardrails to ensure that remaining money continues to be spent in the next administration through the Impoundment Control Act that limits the White House from withholding funds already appropriated by Congress.
If Republicans control both the House and Senate, Trump could have the votes to override any Congressional check, though current and former officials point to the bipartisan support – and need – for much of funding that would carry over, particularly in the case of the infrastructure law. Still, there are other legal tactics a Trump administration could take to delay future funding through the act – and a recognition in the final months of the administration that the best strategy is to leave as little to chance as bureaucratically possible.
“There’s a lot of ways that an administration that really doesn’t want to implement a program can make it difficult – if nothing else, can require folks to sue to get money out the door,” a former Biden official said. “You’re just better off doing as much of that as you can ahead of time.”
Officials have repeatedly pointed to the bills’ increasing popularity as a signal of durability in future administrations, and House Speaker Mike Johnson recently indicated that he plans to use a “scalpel and not a sledgehammer” on the clean energy provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act.
But some provisions are seen as low-hanging fruit for conservatives looking to cut spending, namely the cap on insulin prices and some $80 billion in the Inflation Reduction Act to beef up tax enforcement. But for projects where shovels are already in the ground – or factories are already being built, especially in some deep-red regions – Biden administration officials expect Republicans will want to take credit for the investment, not reverse it.
Even so, they acknowledge their limited abilities to underwrite everything outlined in the law before January.
“The only thing that will help you is getting your people elected,” one senior administration official said.
Supporting Ukraine
The US has given more than $50 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since Russia’s invasion in February 2022.
The White House is working to get as much money and weaponry into Kyiv’s hands by January, a US official told CNN, acknowledging that whatever is unspent from the $61 billion in funding passed by Congress earlier this year is liable to be clawed back.
Biden has directed the Department of Defense to allocate all remaining funding “by the end of my term in office.” Democrats in Congress have shared the administration’s concerns that any of the billions in aid to Ukraine that have already passed could be slow walked or blocked if it isn’t entirely transferred to Ukraine by the time Trump is sworn in.
There is approximately $7.5 billion left under Presidential Drawdown Authority, which pulls equipment from US stocks, and roughly $2.12 billion for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which allows the US to purchase equipment and systems from US defense contractors.
Presidents have a lot of power when it comes to transferring weapons and aid to foreign countries, one Democratic senator warned.
“Until it is in the possession of our allies, the president could probably stop the transfer,” the senator said.
Recently, the White House has been working to spread support for Ukraine more broadly across allied countries. Last week, the Biden administration joined the G7 in moving forward with a $50 billion loan package for Ukraine, including $20 billion from the US, which was backed by frozen Russian assets.
Senior administration officials say that financing is structured to be immune to political winds in any of the participating countries.
There have also been efforts to give the NATO alliance more control over Ukraine assistance, with alliance defense ministers finalizing an agreement in June to give NATO a more centralized role.
European nations have also taken the lead on training and provision of a variety weapons systems to Kyiv, even US-made weapons like F-16 fighter jets.
While the future of aid is in question, the Biden administration believes US membership in the newly-expanded North Atlantic Treaty Organization should not be in question. Most members are on track to meet the bloc’s target of spending 2% of their economy on defense, neutralizing a frequent criticism by Trump.
The most recent National Defense Authorization Agreement, which provides funding for the US military, also prohibits any president from unilaterally withdrawing from NATO without approval from Congress.
Environmental rules and regulations
Biden’s climate and environmental regulations will likely be a major target of a Trump administration. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan told CNN in a recent interview his agency has worked hard to make its rules limiting pollution legally durable.
The EPA also got all its biggest climate rules done by April to avoid the Congressional Review Act, which makes it easier to reverse last-minute regulations made at the end of an administration and previously enabled Trump and Congressional Republicans to overturn some of Obama’s climate regulations.
In August, White House senior advisor for international climate policy John Podesta told CNN he expected around 90% of IRA grant funds for fiscal year 2024 to be out the door. About $103 billion in IRA funding – 92% of the law’s total – has been announced as of late October. That money will fund everything from clean energy rebates to helping coastal communities prepare for rising seas and slashing pollution from oil and gas operations.
The EPA alone is on track to obligate nearly $38.3 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act by the end of the year, making it harder to claw back.
However, the tens of billions in grant money is a small part of the IRA’s spending power. The bulk of the IRA’s climate provisions are uncapped, decade-long clean energy tax rebates. Those were initially priced at $391 billion by the Congressional Budget Office, but they have proved so popular with businesses and individual consumers that they have been revised by public and private groups to having a price tag anywhere from $500 billion to $1.2 trillion over the next 10 years.
House Republicans have voted to repeal some of the climate law’s biggest programs dozens of times. But administration officials and outside clean energy experts feel more confident that Republicans will leave some of the biggest tax credits in Biden’s climate law alone – because Republican districts are benefitting from them.
The vast majority of private investments companies have made to build new EV factories or build massive wind and solar farms – nearly 78% – has gone to Republican congressional districts, according to a CNN analysis of data from the nonpartisan Rhodium Group and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology this summer.
That flow of money to GOP districts could make it much harder for Republicans to repeal the IRA, Podesta told CNN this summer.
“I think there’s a growing understanding that that’s bad politics, not just bad policy,” Podesta said in August.
Judicial nominations
Biden has had a significant impact on the federal bench, nominating 259 federal judges, 213 of whom have been confirmed by the Senate. Of those, 136 are women and 129 are people of color.
Biden has appointed more than two times more women and four times as many people of color than Trump. That includes appointing Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court.
“The confirmation of judges has been a priority since day one of this administration and is unrelated to the election,” a senior administration official said. “It is about President Biden making a real and lasting impact on the federal courts.”
Trump named 234 judicial nominees during his term, as well as three Supreme Court justices, reshaping the ideological makeup of federal appeals courts and driving a generational shift to the highest court.

CNN,House GOP Whip Tom Emmer moves to lock in support for speakership amid crowded field | CNN Politics,"House speaker candidate Tom Emmer, the GOP whip, has moved to lock in support across the ideological and geographic spectrum in the conference, giving him what many House Republicans believe is an advantage heading into a secret-ballot election to nominate their candidate Tuesday, according to Republican sources.
But it’s hard to assess his chances fully since it’s a crowded field, with at least seven candidates working the phones all weekend to win a majority of support within the conference.
Even if Emmer were to win the nomination, Republican sources are uncertain he can get 217 votes on the floor, as he could face resistance from members of the hardline House Freedom Caucus skeptical of the GOP leadership team.
House Republicans are searching for a new GOP speaker nominee after Rep. Jim Jordan on Friday became the latest exit from the race. The chamber has been without a speaker for more than two weeks after Kevin McCarthy’s historic ouster this month.
Emmer, of Minnesota, said in a letter to colleagues Saturday that he was seeking the speakership with the goal of delivering “historic change.” McCarthy has endorsed Emmer for speaker, delivering an early boost for his candidacy.
McCarthy on Sunday urged his House colleagues to elect Emmer but stopped short of ruling out another speakership run himself.
“He’s been in the room with all of our successes,” the California Republican said of Emmer. “He sets himself head and shoulders above all those others who want to run.
“This is not a time for a learning experience as speaker. Tom would be able to walk into the job and do it on Day 1,” McCarthy said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”
McCarthy once again demurred when asked about returning to wield the gavel.
“I don’t need the title. I’m going to help in any way I can,” he said. “I’m supporting Tom Emmer, but I’m going to tell you, I’m still a member of Congress, and I’m going to lead in any capacity I can to help to protect America.”

CNN,These older women voters remember a time before Roe — and they’re rallying around Kamala Harris | CNN Politics,"In 1965, when Betty Gunz was a junior in college, she was kicked out of school and almost died after having an illegal abortion.
In the years since, she’s told the story of those days so many times that she no longer cries as she recounts being blindfolded in a strip mall parking lot, being given whiskey instead of anesthesia as the procedure was done on a kitchen table, and the hospital calling her parents to say their goodbyes after she developed sepsis and organ failure.
In 1977, she told that story in a committee hearing in a failed bid to stop North Carolina legislators from passing some of the first post-Roe abortion restrictions, which required parental consent for minors. In 2022, she talked about it again in interviews after the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision with local outlets here while standing outside the abortion clinic where she volunteers as an escort. And earlier this year, she marked the second anniversary of the ruling that overturned the federal right to an abortion by campaigning for Democrats, again describing what happened nearly 60 years ago.
“We had to fight for a long time,” Gunz, now an 80-year-old retired psychotherapist, told CNN during an interview in her Charlotte home. “And here we are, fighting it again.”
Vice President Kamala Harris has made reproductive rights — and former President Donald Trump’s role in appointing three of the conservative judges who overturned Roe v. Wade — a central part of her campaign pitch in a bid to harness women’s anger into electoral victories. While much of the focus has been on younger women, some female seniors say reproductive rights is also a top issue for them.
Unlike younger generations, who until recently may have taken federal abortion protections for granted, older women recall the era of illegal backroom abortions that preceded Roe. Some, like Gunz, consider themselves to be the lucky ones, because they survived and went on to have families and careers. Others described feeling angry and concerned about women’s broader place in society and the rights available to their daughters and granddaughters.
“You think, well, weren’t we vigilant enough?” said Diane Stevens, a 76-year-old abortion rights advocate who helped women get illegal abortions in the early 1970s as a member of the Jane Collective. Stevens, a Harris supporter, is now a clinic escort at a Charlotte abortion clinic and helps raise money for down-ballot Democratic candidates.
A poll of women voters released in June by KFF, a health research organization, found that 73% of those ages 65 and up said they think abortion should be legal in all or most circumstances, as did a similar number of women ages 30-49 and ages 50-64. The youngest cohort, those ages 18-29, were even more supportive: Eighty-seven percent said abortion should be legal in all or most cases.
A fight for the senior vote
Not all older women are motivated by abortion. Like the general population, older voters are more likely to cite the economy, immigration and protecting democracy as top issues ahead of reproductive rights. But in a race that is expected to be decided on the margins, boosting support among women and older voters could make a difference.
For months, polls have suggested that Harris could be the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the 65 and older voting bloc since Vice President Al Gore in 2000. North Carolina is one of five swing states — along with Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and Arizona — that has a higher concentration of seniors than the US average.
“It’s premature to say that Harris is likely to win seniors, but I certainly would not rule it out,” said Glen Bolger, a Republican pollster. “And in terms of the issue of abortion, there is certainly a segment of seniors, and more likely to be women, who do focus on abortion.”
The Trump campaign and the Republican Party are making an economic pitch to seniors and argued that they’ll maintain the support of the voting bloc because higher costs are hurting older Americans on fixed incomes. Trump has also pledged to block age increases for Medicare access and to end taxes on Social Security benefits.
“Seniors are supporting President Trump because he is the only candidate who will protect their Medicare benefits, bring down costs, and stop the migrant crime crisis that’s threatening communities across the country,” Republican National Committee spokesperson Anna Kelly said in a statement.
There are some signs in early voting data that women seniors are highly motivated to vote, said Tom Bonier, a Democratic strategist and CEO of the data firm TargetSmart. While early voting has dropped about 30% from the 2020 election, Democratic senior women are voting at higher rates than they did in 2020, and older women overall are outvoting their male counterparts by a wider margin.
“In the numbers, we can’t always answer the why, we can just answer the what,” he said. “The most common thing I hear is, ‘Look, we were alive pre-Roe, we know what it was like. We’re not going back there.’”
Not just a young women’s issue
On a recent Sunday afternoon, volunteers for Harris and North Carolina Democrats gathered at a parking lot in Cary, a suburb just outside Raleigh, to knock on doors.
MaryAnne Handy, a 69-year-old office manager from Chapel Hill, said it was her first time canvassing. She had lived through former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton not becoming the first female president and she didn’t want history to repeat itself.
“I made a pact with God that if he elected Kamala, I promised I would go back to church, which I haven’t been in 15 years,” she said. “He’s never let me down before.”
Handy, a Catholic, said that she believes life starts at conception but that the decision to end or keep a pregnancy is a personal one. When Roe was first overturned, she first considered what it meant for her granddaughters. But then she thought of herself, and the abortion she had in 1981 after suffering an ectopic pregnancy, a life-threatening condition when a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus.
“This is something that would have very adversely affected me,” Handy said. “I probably wouldn’t have any granddaughters.”
Last year, North Carolina lawmakers passed a 12-week abortion limit. Pregnancies can be terminated through the 20th week of pregnancy if caused by rape or incest, through the first 24 weeks if doctors determine the fetus has a life-limiting anomaly, and beyond that point, only in the case of a medical emergency.
Abortion bans in many states, including North Carolina, make exceptions for ectopic pregnancies, but patients have reported delays in care. Two Texas women are suing their hospitals, alleging they were denied prompt treatment for ectopic pregnancies that burst in their fallopian tubes.
Another Cary volunteer, 80-year-old retired research biologist Naomi Jean Bernheim, said that she’s been involved in politics at different points in her life — she said she was a Raleigh Young Democrat and phone banked in support of abortion rights for NARAL, now known as Reproductive Freedom for All, 30 or 40 years ago. Now she spends her free time putting Harris campaign signs along the sides of roads and highways — it’s the most involved she’s been with a presidential campaign, she said.
She described the overturning of Roe as a “shock.”
“I’ve had people yell at me, ‘Why is an old lady worried about it?’ But you’ve got all of these women who really believe in this,” Bernheim said. “To me, it’s not just a young woman thing, it’s every woman. I mean, what else will they take if they take this? What else is coming?”
Karen Taggart, a 49-year-old product manager from Morrisville, said she’s knocked on more than 650 doors since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris. When she talks to voters, she leads by asking them what issues are top of mind as they consider their options.
One of her own top issues was evident for those who answered their doors that Sunday: She wore a floral “Our Bodies, Our Vote” hoodie designed by Ulla Johnson for the Harris campaign store and a retro “Roe” hat she bought around when the Dobbs decision dropped.
“It’s so loaded with so many other issues,” she said. “It’s about bodily autonomy. This is my body. I get to choose what I do with it, period, end of story.”
Near the end of her shift, Taggart had a conversation with Mary, a 73-year-old Cary resident and Harris supporter who declined to give her last name.
“I feel like we’re taking a giant step backward,” she said of the Dobbs decision. “Women need to have the say.”
A return to states’ rights
It won’t be enough for Harris to motivate Democratic supporters.
Four years ago, Trump won 52% of voters 65 and older and 55% of White women nationally, while Biden won 57% of women overall, according to CNN exit polls.
In North Carolina, which gave Trump his narrowest margin of victory of less than 2 percentage points, the former president won 59% of seniors and 64% of White women, and Biden won 53% of women overall.
Carolyn, a 68-year-old from Mint Hill who declined to give her last name, wore a pink top and a matching “Make America Great Again” hat to vote early for the former president.
“I’m very independent-minded, so I’ll vote who I feel is going to do best for me,” she said. “I’m on Social Security. No tax on Social Security would be wonderful for me. And when I was working, no tax on overtime would have been wonderful for me.”
She said she doesn’t think Harris gives direct answers in interviews and hasn’t done enough to secure the southern border. On abortion, Carolyn said she was glad to see the issue returned to the state and agreed with Trump’s support of exceptions in cases of rape, incest or to protect the life of the pregnant person. Beyond that, there are contraceptives, she said.
“Birth control has been around forever and ever — I should know, I took birth control forever,” she said. “It’s not hard to pop a pill every day.”
Jeanne Gaffney, a 74-year-old retired nurse and self-described independent from Charlotte, also voted early for Trump, which she called a “very tough choice.” For her, it came down to the economy, immigration and foreign policy — specifically, which candidate she thought would be best at dealing with world leaders.
Her views on abortion were complicated. Though she backed the former president, she voted against Republican gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson, who has told supporters he supports further restrictions in the state and who has made derogatory comments about women.
Gaffney thought the state’s 12-week limit was “a little close” and would have preferred 16 weeks. She also opposed what she described as “extremes on both sides.” On a personal level, she said a distant family member died of an illegal abortion a century ago. But if abortion had been more readily available before Gaffney was conceived, she may not have been born, she said.
“So you see, it’s a very complex issue, and politicizing it doesn’t help,” she said, adding: “It’s sad for me that this issue, for some women … is the total issue, when there’s so many other things going on in this country that need to be addressed.”
For Gunz, there are issues other than abortion: income inequality, racism, public school funding, immigration reform and the state of US democracy. Abortion is just the one with which she has the most personal experience.
“This one’s not theoretical, so it’s up at the top of the list for me,” she said.",2024-11-02
CNN,Frustration grows as federal agency struggles to combat election lies spread by Americans | CNN Politics,"The federal agency tasked with protecting the nation’s elections systems has retreated from some of the key work it did to counter false and viral information about voting in the 2020 election, including dismissing or ignoring multiple internal and external policy proposals to combat disinformation, numerous sources familiar with the matter told CNN.
The Department of Homeland Security’s cybersecurity agency, or CISA, is charged with protecting election infrastructure from physical and cyberattacks, a task that has grown in importance since Russian intelligence agents conducted a wide-ranging effort to influence the 2016 election.
While CISA has actively called out foreign disinformation efforts this year, it has been less active in swatting down domestic election disinformation, according to interviews with election officials, a review of public records and sources in the federal government.
Agency officials no longer pass along to social media platforms viral online falsehoods flagged by election officials from both parties, as they did in 2020, following a lawsuit from Republican attorneys general that accused the agency of censorship.
A webpage that CISA aggressively maintained to debunk viral election rumors in 2020 has been sparsely updated. Some internal proposals to support election officials’ efforts to combat disinformation have made little headway. And one of the agency’s top experts on election-related disinformation has been marginalized and not fully utilized by the agency, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.
CISA Director Jen Easterly has emphasized in public remarks that it is not the agency’s job to police speech on social media platforms.
The agency has advised election officials on how to communicate clearly with voters and to prepare for security incidents. Easterly has also used her account on the social media platform X to push out facts about the voting process and has repeatedly gone on national television to discuss the security of the election process.
But inside CISA, sources told CNN there is frustration that the agency hasn’t done more to help election officials counter lies that can inspire violent threats against those officials.
A fear of appearing partisan or of infringing on free speech has shackled the agency’s approach to election-related falsehoods that Americans are freely sharing, the sources said.
In late September, Sen. Mark Warner, the powerful chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, sent Easterly a stern letter imploring her to do more to combat disinformation ahead of the election.
“I strongly urge you to use all the tools at your disposal” to support state and local election officials in the face of an “unprecedented rise in targeted disinformation campaigns,” the Virginia Democrat wrote.
CNN has requested comment from CISA on its response to the letter.
Some in the election community would also like to see CISA do more to combat falsehoods.
“I would like to see more a concerted effort from CISA on domestic information that affects election infrastructure,” an executive at a voting equipment company, who requested anonymity to speak candidly, told CNN. Voting vendors have faced violent threats over false claims that their machines rigged the 2020 election.
The executive pointed to recent viral falsehoods that voting machines had flipped votes in multiples states. What if a group of Americans spread those lies on a national scale and created chaos?
“If that does happen, if CISA is really focused on foreign malign influence, who is going to fight back against a coordinated effort?” the executive wondered.
CNN has requested comment from CISA on its response to the recent spate of baseless voting machine claims.
Social media platforms loosen guardrails
Four years after the 2020 election, when false claims of voter fraud fueled a violent effort to overturn the election, the information environment around elections has only grown more chaotic.
Disinformation remains rampant online. But since 2021, under pressure from Republican lawmakers, the social media industry has pivoted from many of the commitments, policies and tools it once embraced to help safeguard the peaceful transfer of democratic power.
After the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, platforms including Meta, Twitter and YouTube suspended thousands of accounts that spread election lies and removed posts glorifying the attack.
Under the ownership of billionaire Elon Musk, Twitter, now X, has emerged as one of the biggest sources of election conspiracy theories.
Election officials in battleground states have tried to relay accurate information to Musk in hopes that he would stop spreading conspiracy theories about voting, to little avail.
There is an acute concern among some senior US officials that the combination of false information and violent rhetoric that complicated the federal response to Hurricane Helene in September could surface in a much more potent way on or after Election Day.
“It got a lot of us worried,” a US official told CNN.
‘It’s another messenger’
Easterly and her top elections security adviser, Cait Conley, have traveled the country to offer support, security advice and training to election officials from both parties. They point out that state and local election officials are the best sources for accurate information. CISA has advised states on setting up their own websites to debunk disinformation.
CISA is one of multiple federal agencies involved in election security. The FBI investigates violent threats to election officials, while the Election Assistance Commission certifies voting equipment and educates voters about the process.
Directly countering false election narratives online and more consistently and forcefully promoting accurate information about voting are well within CISA’s remit, election officials and experts say. And CISA can do so without violating the First Amendment, they say.
“I think it’s valuable to have multiple levels of government saying, ‘That’s false,’” one senior state-level election official said. “It’s another messenger with a different microphone” that can hammer home the point to the American public, the election official said.
Not everyone agrees. Some election officials interviewed by CNN were skeptical about the federal government’s ability to debunk election lies that are part of a broader rise of misinformation in America.
“This is such a larger conversation than election administration,” said Stephen Richer, a top Republican election official in Arizona’s Maricopa County who has faced violent threats for saying the 2020 election was secure. “I tend to think that election administration and democracy is just a proxy war for the larger fight on an objective truth.”
In an interview with CNN, Conley touted CISA’s efforts to protect election officials from disinformation-fueled violence, in part by ramping up physical security resources to those officials
“Since January 2023, we’ve conducted nearly 1,200 physical security assessments of election facilities,” she said.
In many respects, CISA has increased its election security efforts since 2020. The agency now has a team of former election officials who provide physical and cybersecurity services to election offices around the country. CISA, the FBI and US intelligence agencies have rapidly debunked fake videos about voting spread by Russian operatives on X in the last month.
“It is irresponsible when domestic actors amplify those narratives,” Conley told CNN. “We are literally playing into the hands of our adversaries.”
But given the violent threats facing election officials across the country, many in the community are calling for a more robust response from all segments of society in combatting disinformation.
“The defenders and protectors of our democracy need to become much more aggressive, much more assertive,” Adrian Fontes, Arizona’s Democratic secretary of state, told CNN, referring to federal agencies and media outlets alike.
“It is worth protecting and it is worth protecting vigorously,” he said. “And if people get their feelings hurt because you’re calling them a liar, let them prove that their lie is true in court.”",2024-11-02
CNN,House nears third week without speaker as eight Republicans vie for gavel | CNN Politics,"A crowded field of Republicans are vying to earn the support of their conference to wield the gavel, throwing the chamber into even more uncertainty after three weeks without a speaker.
The conference is searching for a new speaker nominee after Rep. Jim Jordan on Friday became the latest to exit the race. The chamber has been without a speaker since House Republicans ousted Rep. Kevin McCarthy earlier this month.
Eight House Republicans are running for the position, including GOP Whip Tom Emmer, who is endorsed by McCarthy. Emmer has moved to lock in support across the ideological and geographic spectrum in the conference, giving him what many House Republicans believe is an advantage, according to GOP sources. He could face an uphill battle, however, against allies of former President Donald Trump who have been quick to criticize Emmer for voting to certify the 2020 election.
The speaker hopefuls spent the weekend working the phones to win their conference’s support ahead of a candidate forum Monday evening and secret-ballot election Tuesday.
Emmer spoke with Trump by phone over the weekend, a source familiar with the matter told CNN, and Emmer touted his “strong working relationship” with the former president on social media Monday.
“Thank you, Mr. President,” Emmer posted on X, alongside a video clip of Trump saying he’s “always” gotten along with Emmer. “If my colleagues elect me Speaker of the House, I look forward to continuing our strong working relationship.”
Texas Rep. Pete Sessions, another candidate for speaker, said Monday that he also spoke with Trump about his bid.
“He called me and we had a polite conversation. I believe that the president is interested in having somebody he can work with, and I think I’m one of those people,” he told CNN’s Manu Raju, adding that he did not ask for Trump’s endorsement.
These are the other GOP representatives running for speaker:
- Jack Bergman of Michigan, a retired 40-year veteran of the US Marines.
- Byron Donalds of Florida, a second-term member of the far-right Freedom Caucus.
- Kevin Hern of Oklahoma, chair of the conservative group known as the Republican Study Committee – which wields a large bloc of GOP members.
- Mike Johnson of Louisiana, the vice chairman for the House Republican Conference.
- Gary Palmer of Alabama, the chairman of the Republican Policy Committee.
- Austin Scott of Georgia, the seven-term ally of McCarthy who quickly dropped out of a last-minute challenge to Jordan last week.
Rep. Dan Meuser of Pennsylvania had also been in the running but dropped out of the race Monday evening.
Speaking to reporters, Meuser said, “I felt that it was in the best interest in the end.”
“We have great candidates, and I wrote up a plan of how to improve the speaker’s office – making it a members-first office, which in the end is a people’s first office – and a few of the candidates up there have adopted some of my ideas,” he said.
Frustrations and divisions have only intensified within the conference as Republicans search for a way to resolve the impasse. That, along with the GOP’s narrow majority, has made it increasingly unclear whether any candidate will be able to secure the 217 floor votes needed to win the gavel.
The House, meanwhile, remains in a state of paralysis amid the threat of a government shutdown next month and the Israel-Hamas war.
The government runs out of funding in less than a month, after narrowly avoiding a shutdown with a stopgap funding bill last month. A speaker will need to be involved in negotiations with the White House and the Senate, both of which are controlled by Democrats.
And there is momentum for a bill to give further aid to Israel’s war against Hamas. President Joe Biden has asked Congress for a $105 billion package that will include aid for Israel and Ukraine, which is said to be running out of munitions in its fight against Russia’s invasion.
The showdown over the speakership kicked off earlier this month when a bloc of hardline conservatives voted to oust McCarthy, a historic move that plunged the House into unprecedented territory. Then, in the aftermath of McCarthy’s ouster, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise’s speakership nomination met a swift downfall when the conference failed to come together on his bid.
On Friday, Republicans pushed Jordan out of the race after he failed to win the gavel for the third time in a floor vote earlier in the day.

CNN,Exclusive: GOP Senate candidate Hogan touts Trump endorsement in private fundraiser after repeatedly saying he didn’t want it | CNN Politics,"Maryland GOP Senate candidate Larry Hogan touted an endorsement from Donald Trump in a private donor call and suggested it helps him with the former president’s “hard core” supporters, after repeatedly stating that he did not want Trump’s endorsement.
On the call Wednesday, a local GOP donor asked Hogan about the public perception that Hogan and Trump “hate each other.” The former Maryland governor clarified that he did actually receive Trump’s endorsement, according to a video of the call exclusively obtained by CNN.
“Donald Trump actually endorsed me,” Hogan says, interrupting the donor and repeating: “Donald Trump actually endorsed me.”
Hogan, who was a popular GOP governor during Trump’s first term in the White House, has often clashed with the former president and once even considered a primary challenge against him. And the relationship between the two men has become a major question during this year’s Senate run.
“Governor Hogan was responding to a question about whether he and Former President Trump ‘hate’ each other. Governor Hogan rejects the notion of hatred in politics, and will attempt to work with anybody who is elected,” Blake Kernen, Hogan campaign spokesperson, said in a statement to CNN.
“As he said in the same answer, he will always be his own independent voice even if it angers some members of his party. As he reiterated yesterday on CNN, he won’t be supporting Former President Trump,” the statement said.
The Maryland Senate contest — once considered a sure bet for Democrats — became more competitive this year when Hogan jumped into the race, it still leans likely Democratic according to pre-election race ratings by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. Hogan was personally recruited by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell as an independent-minded centrist who could compete in a blue state like Maryland. He faces Democratic candidate Angela Alsobrooks on the ballot next week.
During the fundraiser call, Hogan said that while most Maryland Republicans are already behind him, there is a “small percent” of Trump supporters who may resent Hogan for his record of anti-Trump rhetoric. And he suggested that’s where the Trump endorsement comes into play.
“There is a small percent, it’s about 4 percent of the people, who are hard core Trump folks who may be mad at people because I didn’t support Trump,” he said, noting that their alternative in the Maryland Senate race is a “far left Democrat who’s against everything they believe in.”
And for those Trump supporters, Hogan said: “Trump did come out and endorse me, so for those hard-core folks, you just tell them that.”
Throughout his campaign, Hogan has said repeatedly that he would not seek Trump’s endorsement and wouldn’t accept it if Trump did try to support him. The former Maryland governor has also said he did not vote for Trump in 2016 or 2020 and would not vote for either Trump or Democratic nominee Kamala Harris in November.
After Trump endorsed Hogan this summer, Hogan told CNN’s Jake Tapper in early September that he “rejected” Trump’s endorsement.
“I actually rejected his endorsement when he tried to endorse me. I’m not supporting him, and no, I won’t be appearing with him,” Hogan said in the interview, when asked if he would appear with Trump at a campaign event.
Hogan told WTOP in June immediately after Trump’s endorsement that he didn’t think his campaign would “have any interest in accepting it.”
“It’s not something we’re going to be promoting, that’s for sure,” Hogan told WTOP.",2024-10-30
CNN,Harris isn’t ready to talk about who might serve in her potential administration | CNN Politics,"Kamala Harris has a packed schedule these days: multi-state campaign stops; briefings from advisers on issues at home and abroad; a steady stream of phone calls, meetings and interviews, all as she hopes that she will defeat Donald Trump in next week’s election.
But amid the flurry of activity in the final stretch of the 2024 campaign, there is one discussion the vice president has made clear to aides she will not entertain, even in private: who might serve in a future Harris Cabinet and administration. Wary of tempting fate, Harris has been explicit to advisers in the final weeks of the campaign that she is not interested in having those conversations, four sources told CNN.
“She has been pretty resistant to having those conversations,” said one senior Democrat familiar with the pre-election discussions with the vice president. “Her position has been very much: I’ve got to go win this thing.”
The vice president’s refusal to participate in those planning discussions in earnest is, at least in part, rooted in superstition. Harris, who once quipped that she’s “a little superstitious,” has long believed that no good can come from putting the cart before the horse, those familiar with her thinking said.
“She’s superstitious,” one longtime Harris associate told CNN. “She is a rational and logical and linear thinker and that means she focuses on immediately what’s in front of her and she resists the temptation to look too far down the line.”
That trait could be one of the few she shares with Trump. The former president, too, has voiced wariness at transition planning before winning an election, in part because he believes it could amount to bad luck for the final outcome.
But he’s taken his resistance to formal transition planning a step further, declining to take critical formal steps toward preparing for a transition, blowing past a pair of key deadlines and breaking with precedent in a way that outside experts warn could ultimately pose challenges for a peaceful transfer of power.
While Harris’ transition team has been operating out of government-provided offices in Washington, Trump’s transition team is working from Manhattan and the Willard Hotel in Washington. Representatives from both transition teams met with federal agency transition planners on the White House campus on Tuesday to discuss “post-election readiness,” a White House spokesperson said.
Unlike during previous campaigns, the Harris team has telegraphed virtually nothing about the names or profiles of officials who could fill top roles in a potential administration, even as some Democrats in Washington and media outlets are eagerly fueling speculation. When then-candidate Joe Biden was in the concluding weeks of his successful 2020 bid, names for several roles had already been floated.
Nor is the Harris team asking yet for lists of names to fill potential roles — though, in the past, those lists are often sent unsolicited to transition officials by groups or individuals hoping to make a stamp on future administration policy.
For a candidate who, over the course of her abbreviated campaign, has had to bridge divides between progressive and moderate Democrats, those decisions will inevitably be delicate ones. That, in part, is why Harris and her team believe they are best left until after Election Day.
Waiting until she first knows with certainty that a role will be hers before assuming the duties that come with that job was how she operated much earlier in her career, too. Those familiar with her rise in California say she stuck to a similar ethos when she was running for attorney general and district attorney.
It was also how she more recently conducted herself before her quick ascension to the top of the Democratic ticket over the summer. Even when speculation was running rampant that Biden might drop out of the 2024 race, Harris – as CNN reported at the time – was meticulously careful about not doing anything preemptive until the moment he shared his decision.
The resistance to engage in extensive pre-election discussions about staffing a potential administration has lent a degree of secrecy to the Harris transition effort, particularly for those Democrats who are eager to learn about open positions.
Sources tell CNN the transition team has been focused on building out infrastructure for vetting, including recruiting lawyers and putting processes in place that are ready to launch if Harris wins. And just as her campaign has been truncated, so too has the transition planning.
“There is no transition without a successful campaign and that is the top priority right now. The transition is focused on setting up the infrastructure necessary to be ready for the post-election period,” a transition spokesperson told CNN.
But behind the scenes, transition personnel are also preparing for various scenarios, including if the race remains too close to call days after Election Day. In that event, both Harris’ and Trump’s teams may start receiving briefings from the Biden administration following a measure passed in 2022 that lays out protocols for the transition period.
A Harris victory would trigger the first same-party transition since 1989, when President Ronald Reagan handed off the presidency to his vice president, George H.W. Bush. The relative rarity of a Democrat handing over keys to the White House to another Democrat injects some uncertainties into the process, most notably how much continuity Harris would bring to staffing decisions in her own administration.
Typically, departing political appointees are expected to submit resignation letters as the presidency transfers to a new officeholder. But if Republicans flip the Senate, there have been discussions of keeping on some Biden holdovers to limit prolonged battles over confirmation. And there has been talk about how a GOP-controlled Senate might impact who the team brings up for a nomination.
“They’re trying to stand up confirmation processes with an eye toward that prospect,” one source said.
Yet the extent to which Harris would retain members of the Biden administration is largely unknown. She would likely bring in her own roster of senior West Wing advisers, replacing those who had worked for years or decades with Biden. That includes her own selection for White House chief of staff.
Harris’ current chief of staff, Lorraine Voles, is not expected to transition over to assume the role of White House chief of staff, several sources said.
And there is an expectation that much of the Cabinet would turn over, allowing Harris to name her own nominees to top posts. Even in two-term presidencies, top Cabinet officials often leave their high-stress jobs after one term.
Biden’s Cabinet has experienced almost no turnover in four years. Yet it’s not clear whether Harris would consider existing Biden officials who might be eyeing higher-profile roles, potentially as the secretaries of state or treasury or as attorney general.
While Harris has maintained relationships with individual Cabinet and administration officials, some believe she will prefer to start anew with her own team. Harris has also said she would name a Republican to her Cabinet, but she has refused to speculate on who that might be or for what role.
If Harris is uninterested in mulling over names for top positions in her possible future government until she knows she has won the election, her transition team has been busy getting ready for the possibility of a sprint to Inauguration Day.
The transition work is being led by Yohannes Abraham, former ambassador to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Others, including Josh Hsu, the vice president’s former general counsel, and Dana Remus, a senior adviser and outside counsel to the campaign, have been involved in the work of the transition team, a source familiar with the process said.
If the election is called for Harris, the transition team is expected to spring into action, quickly forming agency review teams, naming key White House staff and members of the Cabinet, and presenting the vice president with a long list of decisions to make.",2024-11-01
CNN,"Elon Musk keeps up pro-Trump spending spree as Harris continues to dominate money race, new filings show | CNN Politics","Elon Musk plowed nearly $44 million in October into a super PAC working to restore Donald Trump to the White House – pushing the billionaire’s total donations to the group he established to benefit the former president to nearly $119 million, new campaign finance reports show.
The last-minute burst of spending by the world’s richest man comes as Trump’s Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, continues to lap the former president in fundraising, bringing in about $97 million – six times the amount collected by Trump in the first 16 days of October, according to reports the campaigns filed late Thursday night with the Federal Election Commission.
But both candidates and their aligned political operations went on a spending spree this month – burning through more than half a billion dollars combined during the first half of October as they jockey for advantage ahead of Election Day.
Here are some key takeaways from the filings:
Harris spent more than Trump, but heads into the election with more cash
Harris’ principal campaign committee spent nearly $166 million between October 1 and 16, exceeding the Trump campaign’s $99.7 million in expenditures during the same period. Roughly $130 million of Harris’ campaign spending went toward media expenses.
And the blistering fundraising pace Harris set after ascending to the top of the Democratic ticket at the end of July has given her a bigger financial cushion in the final days of the race. The nearly $119 million remaining in her campaign’s coffers is more than three times the dollars that Trump had remaining in his.
And data from AdImpact, which tracks political advertising, underscores how Harris has put that financial advantage to work on the airwaves in battleground states. Her campaign has spent about $488 million on advertising since President Joe Biden withdrew from the race, including on ads slated to run through Election Day. By contrast, Trump has spent about $284 million over the same period.
Musk aids Trump and Senate Republican candidates, too
Musk has emerged as a major financial figure in this year’s election – underwriting an unorthodox get-out-the-vote effort on Trump’s behalf in key battleground states – a role that the former president has largely ceded to outside groups. In recent days, Musk also offered splashy, $1 million daily sweepstakes for swing-state voters that has drawn scrutiny from the US Justice Department.
The new filings show the tech magnate made four donations totaling $43.6 million to his America PAC in the first half of October. He also wrote checks totaling $12.3 million to other super PACs mostly supporting efforts by Republicans to take control of the Senate.
Before this election, the Tesla CEO and X owner had made relatively modest donations to federal candidates, backing a mix of Democrats and Republicans. But he is deeply engaged in helping Trump win the presidency this time and has joined the Republican nominee on the campaign trail.
Thursday’s filings show that Musk’s super PAC drew other donors in October. Billionaire businessman Nelson Peltz gave $1 million to America PAC and members of the Michigan-based DeVos family, including Trump’s Education secretary, Betsy DeVos, also made six-figure donations.
Other big Trump donors
Other large donors backing Trump include Midwestern packaging magnate Richard Uihlein, who contributed another $6.5 million this month to the super PAC he steers – Restoration PAC, which has been spending heavily in support of Trump’s candidacy. Uihlein, whose family helped found Schlitz Brewing, has long backed conservative, anti-establishment candidates and has emerged as one of the biggest financial backers to pro-Trump efforts this cycle.
Uihlein’s wife, Elizabeth, donated $3 million in October to another pro-Trump group, Preserve America, which has been largely funded by billionaire Miriam Adelson, a physician and widow of casino mogul Sheldon Adelson. Ronald Cameron, who oversees poultry-producing giant Mountaire Farms, donated $2 million to Preserve America.
WhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum, meanwhile, became one of the latest tech figures to support Trump’s campaign, giving $5 million worth of stock in social media giant Meta to Make America Great Again, Inc., the main super PAC backing Trump, the new filings show. He had previously donated to a super PAC supporting Nikki Haley’s failed bid for the Republican presidential nomination.
MAGA, Inc., also took in $1 million apiece from Arkansas-based investor Warren Stephens and pharmaceutical heir Woody Johnson, who co-owns the New York Jets and served as Trump’s ambassador to the United Kingdom.
Big checks back Harris, too
Top donors to Future Forward, a super PAC supporting Harris, include Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, who gave $25 million to the group in the first half of October, bringing his total giving to the group to $38 million.
But a substantial portion of the nearly $90 million collected by the pro-Harris super PAC over the period – a total of $40 million – came from Future Forward’s nonprofit arm, which does not disclose its donors, obscuring from the public the identity of some of Harris’ backers.
The new filings also show that Liz Cheney, the former Wyoming congresswoman who has broken with her fellow Republicans to back Harris, isn’t just campaigning with the vice president. Cheney’s political action committee, Our Great Task, donated $2.5 million on October 8 to American Bridge 21st Century, a leading Democratic research and rapid response group working to help Harris.
Legal fees
Even as Trump raises money for his presidential campaign, his political operation continues to underwrite the former president’s legal bills.
Between October 1 and 16, Save America, the former president’s leadership PAC, spent $3.9 million on “legal consulting,” records show. The lion’s share of the money, nearly $3.3 million, went to Robert & Robert. Clifford Robert, the firm’s principal, is one of the lawyers representing Trump in his appeal of his civil fraud judgment in New York.",2024-10-25
CNN,These are the states where abortion rights will – or could – be on the ballot in November | CNN Politics,"This November, voters in at least 10 states will take to the polls to determine the future of abortion access in their state, after a nationwide effort by organizers to secure a wave of ballot measures aimed at restoring or protecting the right to an abortion — and some aimed at restricting it.
Abortion rights advocates hope the effort will restore the issue of reproductive health access to the people, after the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, eliminating the national right to an abortion.
Most of the proposed ballot measures aim to enshrine the right to an abortion in state constitutions. They follow a series of restrictive trigger laws that went into effect following the Dobbs decision, along with abortion policies that were handed down by politicians or decided by state supreme courts since the decision.
Anti-abortion organizers backed a handful of initiatives aimed at restricting abortion access, though similar restrictive measures have failed in the few states where votes have been held in the past couple of years.
Abortion measures on the ballot in November
Ten states — Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York and South Dakota — have already secured abortion measures on the 2024 ballot. All eyes are on Florida, which has served as a critical access point for people seeking services in a region of the country that is fast becoming an abortion care desert. A six-week abortion ban replaced the state’s 15-week ban on May 1.
Nebraska Secretary of State Robert Evnen announced in August that for the first time in the state’s history, two conflicting petition efforts made the same ballot. Now voters in Nebraska will vote on whether abortion rights will be enshrined in the constitution or whether the state’s current 12-week ban will be preserved.
After organizers secured the New York Equal Rights Amendment on the 2024 ballot, it was briefly struck from the ballot by a state judge. State Attorney General Letitia James appealed that decision, and a state appeals court restored the measure to the ballot in June.
A measure in Missouri that seeks to broadly protect reproductive care has made it onto the ballot, while an opposing measure to permanently ban abortion never made it out of the state’s legislative session.
States with potential abortion ballot measures
Organizers in states across the country have continued to work to secure funding, gather signatures and jump through the legal hoops necessary to secure abortion measures on the 2024 ballot.
In most states, the process entails collecting a certain number of signatures by a designated deadline, while others require the additional step of having the ballot language approved by a state court, according to campaign organizers. The abortion rights measures are largely backed by coalitions of reproductive health advocates, many of which have fundraised to secure the money to support the campaigns.
Organizers in Arkansas collected and submitted signatures for a proposed abortion rights measure, but the Secretary of State rejected their petition, saying the organizers did not correctly submit paperwork regarding paid canvassers. The state’s supreme court sided with the secretary, ensuring the measure will not be on the ballot this November.
Lawmaker proposed measures in Iowa and Missouri to restrict or exclude the right to abortion in state constitutions did not make it out of legislative sessions. Lawmakers in Pennsylvania proposed a measure barring the use of public funding for abortions, which is unlikely to pass the state legislature.
States that have voted on abortion post-Dobbs
Seven states have already seen a vote on abortion access since Roe v. Wade was overturned, and reproductive health advocates have been heartened by the overwhelming support for abortion access among voters. Every measure aimed at protecting abortion access has passed, while all measures to restrict it have failed.
While support for abortion access is considered a given in states like California, organizers say these votes offer an important layer of legal protection for patients and providers – and send a message to elected officials about what voters want.

CNN,What happens to Trump’s November sentencing? | CNN Politics,"Donald Trump has several legal tactics to try to stay out of state prison, but his best chance of success turns on the outcome of the presidential election.
The former president has already twice successfully delayed his sentencing past Election Day on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to influence the 2016 election by hiding a hush money payment to Stormy Daniels. His lawyers are gearing up for more legal fights ahead, but no tactic will influence his future more than how voters cast their ballots.
“It’s 50/50” that he gets sentenced in November, said Karen Friedman Agnifilo, a former top official at the Manhattan district attorney’s office and a CNN legal analyst. “If he loses the election, I think he gets sentenced, and I think he gets sentenced to prison. If he wins, I don’t think this goes forward.”
A victory on Election Day, she added, is “his get out of jail free card.”
For years, Trump’s legal playbook has been to seek delays. Often, he’s been successful. He was facing four criminal indictments by late 2023 and only one of those cases went to trial before the election.
Now his lawyers are sketching out several tactics to postpone his sentencing, currently scheduled for November 26, whether he wins or loses the presidential election. How the courts handle these last-ditch efforts will dictate an unprecedented moment in American history and whether and when a former US president serves time in prison.
“The uniqueness of this entire situation is beyond anything any founding father could have ever contemplated,” said retired New York state Judge Jill Konviser. “There’s no playbook here. You can’t look this up in a law book and find an answer to the query because it doesn’t exist.”
Previously, prosecutors have not objected to Trump’s bids to delay his sentencing before the election, which Judge Juan Merchan noted in agreeing to postpone Trump’s sentencing until late November. It isn’t clear what position prosecutors will take once all the votes are counted.
Immunity and removal
Merchan, who oversaw the hush money trial, said he will decide on November 12 – one week after Election Day – Trump’s motion to dismiss his conviction in light of the US Supreme Court’s decision on presidential immunity that limits what evidence can come before a jury.
If Merchan grants Trump’s motion, the charges would be dismissed, and he would not be sentenced.
If Trump loses on immunity, his lawyers are expected to ask Merchan to delay Trump’s sentencing so they can appeal. And if that’s not granted, his attorneys are planning to appeal the immunity decision to state appellate courts and potentially all the way to the US Supreme Court to ask the courts to delay Trump’s sentencing until all appeals are exhausted, which could take months.
Simultaneously, Trump is trying to move the hush money case out of state court and into federal court, where he thinks he has a better shot at an appeal.
Trump’s attorneys attempted this in 2023, and District Judge Alvin Hellerstein denied it. But following the Supreme Court ruling, Trump’s attorneys made a second attempt this summer. Hellerstein denied that request, too, finding Trump didn’t show “good cause” for why he should reconsider his 2023 ruling. He wrote, “Nothing in the Supreme Court’s opinion affects my previous conclusion that the hush money payments were private, unofficial acts, outside the bounds of executive authority.”
Trump’s attorneys appealed that ruling and the Manhattan district attorney’s office has three months to respond. The window provides Trump’s lawyers another avenue to try to move the sentence by arguing that Merchan can’t sentence Trump while an appeal on a question of removal is outstanding.
Their argument will hinge on a line in the law that says final judgment, in this case the sentencing, cannot proceed if a notice of removal is pending.
Federal law states that, “The filing of a notice of removal of a criminal prosecution shall not prevent the State court in which such prosecution is pending from proceeding further, except that a judgment of conviction shall not be entered unless the prosecution is first remanded.”
In previous court filings opposing an earlier effort to delay his sentencing, prosecutors argued that there isn’t a valid notice of removal pending because the judge found Trump didn’t have “good cause” to make one.
“But the district court did not enter a remand order here because defendant never filed a proper notice of removal,” the district attorney’s office wrote in September. At the time, Trump was trying to get the federal appeals court to delay or “stay” his sentencing so he could appeal the district court’s ruling. That was denied when Merchan agreed to postpone Trump’s sentencing.
Prosecutors wrote in September that sending the case back to Hellerstein would restore Trump’s motion seeking permission to ask for removal and not turn it into a notice of removal. “The mere pendency of such a motion neither removes the state criminal case nor stays any aspect of the state criminal proceeding. Only a properly filed notice of removal could have such effects.”
Mixed outcomes
If Trump wins the race for the White House but loses his argument to dismiss the case, then his attorneys are likely to shape their legal arguments about constitutional issues and challenge whether a state judge could sentence a former president and president-elect, which could tie the case up in courts for years.
In addition, they are likely to argue that Trump shouldn’t be sentenced until after his term is completed – four years from January.
If Trump loses the election and his effort to overturn his conviction, his lawyers will likely make similar legal arguments to keep him out of prison, but whether they carry the same weight with courts could be different if Trump is a convicted felon without the protections of the presidency.
And without the shield of the White House, Trump could face trial in his other criminal cases, including the Washington, DC, federal election subversion case. If Trump wins, his Justice Department is expected drop that case altogether.
Sentencing day
Sentencing a former president or potential president-elect has never happened before in American history, putting Merchan in a unique position if it does go forward.
“When you’re in the middle of a high-profile media case, everybody is watching you,” said Diane Kiesel, a retired New York Supreme Court judge who served alongside Merchan. “But you don’t want to change what your approach to handling the case would be just because everybody is watching you.”
“You want to be sure, for lack of a better phrase, that you’re not playing to the cameras. You’ve got to step back a lot and say to yourself, “Am I doing here what I would be doing if there were three people in the courtroom?’” said Kiesel.
Merchan could sentence Trump to no time, probation, conditional release, or prison. Trump faces between 1-1/3 to 4 years in state prison on each count, which is capped at 20 years. During the criminal trial, Trump violated the judge’s gag order 10 times, which is something he can take into consideration.
“Sentencing is hard for judges,” Konviser said. “Some judges have reputations as tough sentencers and some have reputations as lenient sentencers and it’s just my opinion that Judge Merchan is neither. He would fall into the middle: harsh where it should be and lenient where it should be,” she added.
As a senior citizen with no previous convictions, Trump’s lawyers are expected to argue that he should not be sentenced to prison. It’s unclear what position Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, will take.
“It’s just really difficult for Bragg, prosecutorially and politically, to bring this charge, get a conviction and then say, ‘But we’re fine with no prison time,’” said Elie Honig, a CNN senior legal analyst and former state and federal prosecutor. “I think it’s substantially more likely than not that Bragg asks for prison.”
If Trump is sentenced to incarceration, under New York law, he would ordinarily be taken into custody immediately. Convicted felons are housed at New York’s notorious city jail, Rikers Island, where sentences of less than one year are served. For longer sentences, they often are housed temporarily at Rikers until they are transferred to the prison they’re assigned to serve longer sentences.
That raises additional questions about US Secret Service protection for Trump, whether as president-elect or a former president.
How Trump’s lawyers would respond to jail time
If a prison sentence is handed down, Trump’s lawyers are expected to immediately ask Merchan to let Trump stay out of lockup in a secured location in the courthouse, so he can appeal the verdict and sentence, among other issues. It would be up to Merchan to decide whether to grant that, and if not, Trump’s attorneys could race to the state appellate courts to seek an emergency stay of the sentence.
Honig said it was likely that Trump would be granted bail pending appeal – and suggested the district attorney’s office might even agree to such a condition if the judge imposes a jail sentence.
“Prosecutors do sometimes agree to it and say, ‘Look, there’s reasons to let this person do his appeal first, and then make him serve the sentence if he loses,’” Honig said.
If the sentencing date is not moved, the courts could decide that Trump, if he’s elected, could begin serving the sentence after his term is up, when he will be 82.
And if Trump is successful at delaying his sentencing day indefinitely, it could be the ultimate coup for his legal strategy. But some lawyers say it would send the wrong message.
“Nobody is supposed to be above the law,” Agnifilo said. “I think it would certainly send a message to people that certain people are above the law, and you can get away with things if you are powerful enough.”",2024-11-01
CNN,Fact check: Trump falsely claims he never wanted to end the Affordable Care Act | CNN Politics,"Calling Vice President Kamala Harris “a liar,” former President Donald Trump claimed that he never wanted to terminate the Affordable Care Act – an accusation Harris has repeatedly levied against him on the campaign trail.
“Lyin’ Kamala is giving a News Conference now, saying that I want to end the Affordable Care Act. I never mentioned doing that, never even thought about such a thing,” the former president posted on X Thursday.
Facts First: Trump is trying to rewrite history. Repealing and replacing the landmark health reform law, popularly known as Obamacare, was among his top campaign promises when he first ran for president in 2016, and he spent the initial months of his term pushing Congress to pass legislation to do just that. Trump revived the idea early in the current campaign before backtracking. At September’s presidential debate with Harris, he called the Affordable Care Act “lousy” and said “we” are working on “things” to replace it.
Even before he ran for office, Trump was crusading on Twitter, now known as X, to repeal the law signed by his predecessor, Barack Obama.
During his 2016 campaign, he promised supporters that he would quickly dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Within hours of taking office in January 2017, he issued an executive order aimed at rolling back the law.
After the GOP-led House of Representatives passed a repeal bill in May 2017, Trump called them to the White House for a celebratory appearance and said Obamacare was “essentially dead.”
“This is a great plan. I actually think it will get even better. This is a repeal and replace of Obamacare. Make no mistake about it,” Trump said.
However, even though Republicans controlled Congress and the White House that year, they failed to unite behind a plan to do so, ending any serious attempts to completely jettison the Affordable Care Act. Trump spent the rest of his term chipping away at the law.
The former president revived the debate over the law’s fate in November 2023, when he wrote on his Truth Social platform that he’s “seriously looking at alternatives” and that the failure to terminate it “was a low point for the Republican Party, but we should never give up!”
Trump has recently tried to change his tack – promising to come up with a health care plan that’s better.
“What we will do is we’re looking at different plans,” Trump said at September’s debate, noting that he had “concepts of a plan.”
“If we can come up with a plan that’s going to cost our people, our population, less money and be better health care than Obamacare, then I would absolutely do it. But until then, I’d run it as good as it can be run,” he said.",2024-10-31
CNN,New House speaker once partnered with so-called ‘ex-gay’ conversion group | CNN Politics,"Speaker of the House Mike Johnson closely collaborated with a group in the mid-to-late 2000s that promoted “conversion therapy,” a discredited practice that asserted it could change the sexual orientation of gay and lesbian individuals.
Prior to launching his political career, Johnson, a lawyer, gave legal advice to an organization called Exodus International and partnered with the group to put on an annual anti-gay event aimed at teens, according to a CNN KFile review of more than a dozen of Johnson’s media appearances from that timespan.
Founded in 1976, Exodus International was a leader in the so-called “ex-gay” movement, which aimed to make gay individuals straight through conversion therapy programs using religious and counseling methods. Exodus International connected ministries across the world using these controversial approaches.
The group shut down in 2013, with its founder posting a public apology for the “pain and hurt” his organization caused. Conversion therapy has been widely condemned by most major medical institutions and has been shown to be harmful to struggling LGBTQ people.
At the time, Johnson worked as an attorney for the socially conservative legal advocacy group, Alliance Defense Fund (ADF). He and his group collaborated with Exodus from 2006 to 2010.
For years, Johnson and Exodus worked on an event started by ADF in 2005 known as the “Day of Truth” – a counterprotest to the “Day of Silence,” a day in schools in which students stayed silent to bring awareness to bullying faced by LGBTQ youth.
The Day of Truth sought to counter that silence by distributing information about what Johnson described as the “dangerous” gay lifestyle.
“I mean, our race, the size of our feet, the color of our eyes, these are things we’re born with and we cannot change,” Johnson told one radio host in 2008 promoting the event. “What these adult advocacy groups like the Gay Lesbian Straight Education Network are promoting is a type of behavior. Homosexual behavior is something you do, it’s not something that you are.”
In print, radio and on television, Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, frequently disparaged homosexuality, according to KFile’s review. He advocated for the criminalization of gay sex and went so far as to partially blame it for the fall of the Roman Empire.
“Some credit to the fall of Rome to not only the deprivation of the society and the loss of morals, but also to the rampant homosexual behavior that was condoned by the society,” Johnson told a radio host in 2008.
Johnson’s office did not respond to a CNN request for comment asking about his work with Exodus.
A close collaboration
Exodus International joined ADF’s Day of Truth event in 2006 and the groups worked together on promotional material for the event, including a standalone website which pointed users to Exodus’ conversion ministries. Documents on that website cited the since-repudiated academic work in support of conversion therapy. Exodus Youth, the group’s youth wing, promoted the event within its blogs.
Videos put out by Exodus and ADF on their standalone Day of Truth website featured two Exodus staffers speaking about how teens didn’t need to “accept” or “embrace” their homosexuality. The videos featured testimonials of a “former-homosexual” and “former lesbian.”
Documents on the website were not archived online but were saved by anti-conversion therapy groups such as Truth Wins Out in 2007 and 2008. The website featured a FAQ on homosexuality provided by Exodus and sold t-shirts saying, “the Truth cannot be silenced.”
One video featured Johnson, who was later quoted in a press release on Exodus International’s website ahead of the event, saying, “An open, honest discussion allows truth to rise to the surface.”
Johnson promoted the event heavily in the media – through radio interviews, comments in newspapers, and an editorial. In interviews, he repeatedly cited the case of a teen who went to school after the Day of Silence wearing a shirt that read, “Be ashamed. Our school has embraced what God has condemned” and “Homosexuality is shameful.” The teen was suspended and ADF represented him in legal action over the incident. The case was dismissed because the teen graduated, and the court found he no longer had standing to challenge the dress code.
“Day of Truth was really established to counter the promotion of the homosexual agenda in public schools,” Johnson told a radio host in 2008.
Those who worked to counter ADF and Exodus at the time, said the event was dangerous to confused youth.
“This directly harmed LGBTQ youth,” Wayne Besen, the executive director of Truth Wins Out and an expert on the ex-gay industry, told CNN. “This is someone whose core was promoting anti-gay and ex-gay viewpoints. He wouldn’t pander to anti-gay advocates, he was the anti-gay and ex-gay advocate.”
Randy Scobey, a former executive vice president at Exodus, who worked on the Day of Truth in the organization’s collaboration with ADF, called the event one of his biggest regrets.
“It was bullying those who were trying to not be bullied,” said Scobey, who now lives openly as a gay man. “That was one of the public ways that the Alliance Defense Fund worked with us.”
Ties between Exodus and ADF extended beyond the event.
ADF, which has since changed its name to the Alliance Defending Freedom, touted Exodus International in promotional brochures in 2004, crediting it as an organization that “played an instrumental role in helping thousands of individuals come out of homosexual behavior.”
Scobey recalled Johnson as quiet, but firm in his beliefs that homosexuality was wrong. He said Johnson and ADF provided crucial legal advice to Exodus and its “member ministries.”
“We worked with them behind the scenes a lot,” Scobey told CNN, saying the group offered them legal guidance over their ex-gay counseling. “They were very important to us as far as helping us to feel more secure legally and politically.”
Exodus International stopped sponsoring the Day of Truth event in 2010, saying it became adversarial and counterproductive.

CNN,"Who is Tom Emmer, the Minnesota Republican who withdrew from House speaker race hours after nomination? | CNN Politics","US Rep. Tom Emmer, the House majority whip who withdrew his bid for the speakership after it was thrown into immediate jeopardy Tuesday afternoon, has tried to balance an at-times moderate voting record while trying to appeal to the Donald Trump-aligned base of the Republican Party.
The move comes hours after the Minnesota Republican emerged as House Republicans’ new speaker nominee in the scramble to succeed Kevin McCarthy, who was removed from the role in a historic ouster on October 3. With a razor-thin GOP majority in the House, Emmer could only afford to lose four Republicans, and 26 voted against him behind closed doors. And despite a phone call with Trump over the weekend, the former president continued in recent days to post negative messages about Emmer on his Truth Social platform.
Several Republicans who opposed Emmer told CNN Tuesday they would not change their stance and called for a new candidate.
Emmer had recently faced criticism by the right-wing of the Republican conference for, among other things, voting for the bipartisan law to avoid a debt default and to codify same-sex marriage.
Perhaps most importantly, he voted to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election, a flagrant rejection of Trump’s oft-repeated falsehoods that the results were illegitimate.
But Emmer has a history of supporting the former president. In interviews and public comments, reviewed by CNN’s KFile ahead of the speakership vote, Emmer also refused to say Joe Biden won the election and bashed the press for calling the race in the wake of the 2020 election.
The Minnesota lawmaker was first elected to Congress in 2014 and became majority whip earlier this year. Emmer, who lost a race for Minnesota governor in 2010, was a state representative from 2004-2008. He sits on the House Financial Services Committee and is a former chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee.
As majority whip, Emmer has experience with keeping the GOP’s narrow majority in line. Republican Rep. Patrick McHenry, who is currently interim House speaker, told CNN in January that Emmer helped hammer out the negotiations between the 20 hardliners and the speaker’s office that eventually won McCarthy the gavel after 15 ballots.
McCarthy had backed the Minnesota Republican for speaker and urged the conference to elect him by the end of the week.
“This is not a time for a learning experience as speaker. Tom would be able to walk into the job and do it on day one,” he said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” Sunday.
Soon after McCarthy lost the speaker job, some members floated Emmer as a contender, but he quickly rallied around House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who later dropped out after the GOP failed to coalesce around him.
South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, told CNN earlier Tuesday that although he “didn’t agree with that vote,” referring to Emmer’s decision to certify the 2020 election, he he had not yet ruled out supporting him.
“Trust is something people are looking for,” Norman said, adding: “Tom’s honest.”

CNN,Missouri has one of the nation’s strictest abortion bans. Now it’s up to voters to decide whether to keep it | CNN Politics,"Missouri voters this election will decide whether to effectively undo their state’s near-total abortion ban – one of the nation’s strictest – with a ballot measure that aims to write reproductive freedoms into the state’s constitution.
It is one of 10 states voting on constitutional amendments to protect reproductive rights this election – and one of five that could see its vote overturn an abortion ban or restrictive abortion policy.
If passed, the Missouri ballot measure would establish the right to make reproductive care decisions – including about abortion – without interference up to fetal viability, around 22 to 24 weeks into pregnancy.
When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, ending the national right to an abortion, Missouri was the first state in the nation to implement an abortion ban. With no exceptions for survivors of rape or incest, it is one of the nation’s most restrictive abortion laws.
Missouri’s law outlines an exception for medical emergencies, but not fetal anomalies or other pregnancy complications. It also places abortion providers at risk of legal liability.
“For as long as I can remember, I wanted to be a mom. I’m lucky to have my son, but I wasn’t lucky with my second pregnancy,” a woman referred to only as “Erika,” from Kansas City, Missouri, says in a campaign ad in favor of the measure.
“There was a fetal anomaly and to protect myself I needed an abortion, but with Missouri’s total abortion ban, I wasn’t able to get the care I needed in Missouri. Instead, I faced cruel and inhumane barriers.”
Personal stories from women and doctors impacted by the ban have been central to the campaign to get the measure passed, says Erin Schrimpf, a spokesperson for Missourians for Constitutional Freedom, the group backing the measure.
“Those stories really resonate,” said Schrimpf. “We’re really focused on knocking on doors in these last few days. We’ve had over 2,500 volunteers since the start of petition gathering.”
Some of those volunteers have been doctors who are frustrated by the restrictions the state’s abortion policy has placed on them, Schrimpf said.
Because the measure specifically cites the right for people to make their own decisions about contraceptives, access to birth control is also on the ballot.
“When we were drafting the language, we did try to be thoughtful about areas in which the legislature has overreached in the past, or we anticipate may be in the future,” said Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains. “If you are a pregnant person or you want contraception in Missouri, we want you to be protected by the state’s constitution.”
The effort faced plenty of opposition, including from state leaders who have brought several legal challenges against the measure aimed at keeping it off the ballot.
In a final ruling in September, state Supreme Court judges ordered Republican Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft to put the measure back on the ballot and to “take all steps necessary to ensure that it is on said ballot,” the Associated Press reported.
Ashcroft, who campaigned on an anti-abortion rights stance in his unsuccessful gubernatorial run, said he will “always fight to protect Life.”
The pushback from anti-abortion leaders may have been a blessing in disguise, says Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains.
“The one thing about having politicians who try to subvert direct democracy is that people were fired up,” she told CNN. “It hasn’t felt like a challenge to us to get people to mobilize and get excited.”
When could voters see the abortion ban overturned?
If Missourians vote to approve the measure, it will take 30 days for the constitutional amendment to take effect, and then legal challenges need to be brought against the state’s current ban and prior abortion restrictions, Wales said.
The abortion ban has driven many doctors out of state, and as one of the last remaining abortion providers, Planned Parenthood intends to participate in litigation to repeal the state’s ban if the measure passes, Wales said.
“The 30-day window does give us the time to quickly begin the litigation process, and we will be explaining to the court immediately how the harm is impacting Missourians today,” Wales said. “I anticipate that it will be a few months before we’re able to reestablish abortion care.”
A legal challenge against the existing ban should be straightforward, according to Jamille Fields Allsbrook, an assistant professor at the Saint Louis University Center for Health Law Studies.
“If this constitutional amendment passes, the language is very clear that the intent is to allow abortion in the state of Missouri, and so a judge would have to really be reaching to say that somehow that language is not clear,” she said.
In the meantime, proponents of the measure say they’re confident they have voter sentiment on their side.
“It will be frustrating for Missourians who will feel like they voted, they had their voices heard, and it’s not an immediate change, but change is coming, and it will be sooner than you think,” Wales said.
The final push to get out the vote
For residents in Missouri, along with Arizona, Florida, Nebraska and South Dakota, where voters also have the opportunity to overturn their abortion bans or restrictive abortion policies, the stakes are high.
States with abortion bans have seen providers flee out of state and abortion clinics shutter. It will take work to restore access to those areas, even if abortion bans are overturned, Allsbrook said.
“You have the practical issue of opening clinics back up, and then you have to get those providers and patients back,” Allsbrook said. “So we’re talking about a long time, unfortunately, before we even get things back to where they were in 2022.”
But organizers in these states are hoping voters won’t feel intimidated, said Dawn Penich, communications director for Arizona for Abortion Access, the group backing the state’s abortion rights measure. She and other proponents are out making their final appeal to voters this week.
“We are on everyone’s televisions, we are on their streaming devices, we are in their mailboxes and at their doors,” Penich said.
Change in states with abortion bans won’t come overnight, she said, but for residents in these states, the first step is simple: vote.",2024-10-31
CNN,Supreme Court says Missouri can’t bar local police from helping to enforce federal gun laws | CNN Politics,"The Supreme Court declined to revive a controversial Missouri law on Friday that prohibits local law enforcement from helping federal officials enforce federal gun regulations.
The Justice Department had challenged the 2021 law – called the Second Amendment Preservation Act – arguing it interferes with the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause, which states that federal laws take precedence over state laws.
The state law imposes penalties – up to $50,000 – for assisting with the enforcement of federal laws that Missouri’s General Assembly believes may be unconstitutional, including those requiring the registration of certain dangerous weapons and others that require firearms dealers to keep records.
The statute does, however, allow state agencies to assist with enforcement of federal laws that have state analogues, such as those involving felony crimes.
A federal judge in the state blocked the law in March, siding with the Biden administration. An appeals court declined to put that ruling on hold, prompting Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey to turn to the Supreme Court.
Friday, the court rejected the state’s petition.
Justice Clarence Thomas said he would have allowed the law to go into effect. Justice Neil Gorsuch, joined by Justice Samuel Alito, wrote a short statement saying he agreed with the court’s order “under the present circumstances.”
In his emergency application to the high court, Bailey said that the federal government does not have the legal right known as “standing” necessary to challenge the state law.
“State governments cutting off state resources for federal enforcement is not an injury; it is a feature of a State’s settled Tenth Amendment authority,” Bailey told the justices.
The 24-page decision issued in March by US District Judge Brian Wimes ruled that the law is “invalidated as unconstitutional in its entirety.”
“State and local law enforcement officials in Missouri may lawfully participate in joint federal task forces, assist in the investigation and enforcement of federal firearm crimes, and fully share information with the Federal Government without fear of (SAPA’s) penalties,” Wimes wrote.
The law’s “practical effects are counterintuitive to its stated purpose,” added Wimes, a nominee of former President Barack Obama.
“While purporting to protect citizens, SAPA exposes citizens to greater harm by interfering with the Federal Government’s ability to enforce lawfully enacted firearms regulations designed by Congress for the purpose of protecting citizens within the limits of the Constitution,” he wrote.
Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar called the Missouri law “patently unconstitutional” in court papers opposing the emergency request.
“As this court has long recognized,” she wrote, “the Supremacy Clause precludes a State from nullifying federal law or interposing obstacles to the enforcement of federal law.”
US law enforcement officials previously told CNN that federal agents have encountered a number of issues in the state since the law went into effect because local authorities were worried about potentially violating it.",2023-10-20
CNN,"KFile: Kamala Harris pledged to prosecute oil companies over emissions. Now, she’s praising their record US production. | CNN Politics","When Kamala Harris ran for president in 2019, she repeatedly warned oil companies they should be prepared to face hefty fines and even criminal prosecution under a future Harris administration for their role in contributing to climate change.
Now, as the Democratic nominee, Harris is highlighting the country’s record oil and gas production. She rarely talks about climate change, and, despite having been a vigorous supporter of the Green New Deal, her campaign’s website is light on climate policy details.
It’s a stark shift that illustrates the delicate politics of energy — but also how Harris has abandoned a number of progressive positions she held before joining Joe Biden’s ticket in 2020.
As a presidential candidate in 2019, Harris pledged to eliminate the filibuster in order to pass a Green New Deal, with strict deadlines for reducing fossil fuel use. She also signed a pledge to hold all future energy projects accountable to a “climate test” and promised to cancel two pipeline construction projects opposed by environmental activists. She pledged to ban fracking and signed on to niche environmental proposals such as banning plastic straws. And she ran numerous ads on Facebook touting her plans to “take on” the oil lobby and pass a Green New Deal.
“You should be really prepared to look at a serious fine or be charged with a crime,” Harris said in November 2019 when a South Carolina town hall attendee asked whether she would investigate companies such as Chevron and Shell for their role in contributing to climate change.
Harris went on to compare the actions of major oil companies to Big Tobacco, accusing them of knowingly profiting from environmental damage while concealing the harm caused by their products.
“And, not unlike the tobacco companies, after years — ’cause they’d done the research — they knew the harm that their product was causing. They were making so much money that they kept that secret — same thing with these big oil companies. And they need to pay the price,” she said. “So yes is the answer.”
Harris made a similar promise when speaking with the liberal Mother Jones magazine a month earlier, saying, “Let’s get them not only in the pocketbook, but let’s make sure there are severe and serious penalties for their behaviors.”
Harris’s shift on energy and climate began after joining the Biden ticket in August 2020 as the vice presidential pick. That year, she reversed her position on wanting to ban fracking, something she’d staked out in a 2019 CNN town hall.
In August of this year, a few weeks after Biden ended his bid for reelection, the Harris campaign said she no longer supports the Green New Deal. She says that she would not ban fracking and that she no longer wants to ban plastic straws.
In a local interview last month in Pennsylvania, Harris once again was forced to defend her record on wanting to ban fracking when asked about a Republican ad that highlighted her past comments.
“So let me start by saying that that ad as you described it is absolutely a mischaracterization, which I think is intended to make people afraid,” Harris replied. “I will not ban fracking. I did not as vice president.”
Record US oil production
Campaigning in Philadelphia last month, Harris pointed to the Biden administration’s record on increasing domestic oil production, telling voters, “We have had the largest increase in domestic oil production in history because of an approach that recognizes that we cannot over rely on foreign oil.”
The US energy industry is currently producing more oil than any country in history, though energy advocacy groups have said the surge is driven by market forces, not Biden’s policies.
Meanwhile, the Biden administration has imposed regulatory fines on oil companies for environmental violations, including a $241.5 million settlement with Marathon Oil and a $40 million settlement with BP for air pollution charges. The actions target specific issues, such as methane emissions, but were driven more by regulatory enforcement than by the sweeping prosecutions Harris once proposed
At the same time, climate change is not a top priority for many voters. According to Gallup, only 50% of voters view climate change as “extremely” or “very important” to their vote, making it one of the least prioritized issues in this election cycle.
Mia Ehrenberg, a Harris campaign spokesperson, highlighted the Democratic presidential nominee’s support addressing for climate change and while also praising American energy production hitting record levels.
“As president, Kamala Harris will be pragmatic to address the threat of climate change and ensure America does not forfeit the clean energy economy and industries of the future. She is proud to have been the tie-breaking vote on the largest climate action in American history, while seeing American energy production of all kinds hit record levels. As Attorney General of California, she took on polluters to protect our environment and will do the same as president.”
A climate hawk
Archived material from Harris’s 2020 campaign found more than a dozen mentions of prosecuting Big Oil either for pollution or climate change. Citing climate change as an urgent threat, Harris said aggressive action was imminently needed.
In one November 2019 campaign event in Iowa, Harris blamed the fossil fuel industry for the climate crisis, comparing it to Big Tobacco companies’ history of pushing misinformation despite knowing the harm they were causing.
“They had done the studies and they knew of the harm that their product was creating, but they still pushed their product ’cause they were making a ton of money. That’s the same thing with Big Oil. They’ve known for a long time what they’ve been doing that is destroying this God-given planet,” she said.
At times, Harris highlighted her track record as California’s attorney general, pointing to legal actions she claims she took against oil companies.
During a CNN town hall on climate change in 2019, asked whether she would sue ExxonMobil, Harris responded, “I have sued ExxonMobil.”
However, this claim was incorrect. While Harris did initiate an investigation into ExxonMobil for allegedly misleading the public and shareholders about the risks of climate change, she never filed a lawsuit against the company.
As her campaign clarified to CNN, Harris’ legal action during her tenure as California attorney general did result in settlements with other oil companies.
For example, she secured a $14 million settlement from BP and Atlantic Richfield Company and an $11.5 million settlement with Phillips 66 and ConocoPhillips over violations related to underground fuel tanks. But a lawsuit against ExxonMobil was never filed, and her successor did not pursue one after she left office to join the Senate in 2017.",2024-10-15
CNN,Michigan autoworkers see more enthusiasm for Harris — but also more sexism and racism | CNN Politics,"Tonya Rincon just retired and is “learning to cook again.” But most new hobbies need to wait. Election Day is near, and Rincon is trying to help her union and Vice President Kamala Harris win the blue-collar battle for Michigan.
“I think it’s still about 50-50 among union autoworkers,” said Rincon, a member of United Auto Workers Local 900 and a 30-year Ford assembly worker.
Rincon long ago lost patience with supporters of former President Donald Trump in the Ford assembly plant just across the road from her union hall.
“They think the Democrats are going to mandate all electric vehicles and it is going to kill our jobs,” Rincon said in an interview near her home in Wayne. “They think they are going to benefit from the Trump tax cuts even though we don’t make enough money to benefit from the Trump tax cuts.”
With time running short, her focus as she volunteers to knock on doors is on workers who are open to voting for a Democrat. She says many see things differently since the dramatic July shift from President Joe Biden to Harris atop the Democratic ticket.
“There’s a little bit more enthusiasm among some of my female colleagues,” Rincon said. “Couple of my male co-workers are pretty ambivalent about Harris. We may have lost a tiny margin of support, because sexism is a real thing, you know. I don’t think they are going to switch to Trump. I think they just may stay home.”
Rincon is participating in our All Over the Map project, an effort to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in battleground states and are part of critical voting blocs.
We first met in June and learned quickly that Rincon speaks bluntly. Back then, she was candid about a low level of enthusiasm even among those planning to support Biden.
Now, as she volunteers to help elect Harris, she takes issue with male colleagues who would vote for Biden but are wavering about Harris.
“They are just sexist,” she said. “They are like, you know, ‘I’m not sure she can do it. I don’t think the country is ready for a female president.’”
Trying to win them over is critical for Harris in a state that’s so close and so crucial to her path to victory. It’s also important because the United Auto Workers leadership — which endorsed Harris over the summer — is trying to get more members to make voting decisions based on the issues that are key to labor.
“It’s a pretty easy decision to make if you compare the policies side by side,” Rincon said.
Rincon’s door knocking gives her unique insight on why the math of this campaign is so different and unpredictable.
At one house, she meets a younger voter who voted for Biden in 2020 but is supporting the Green Party’s Jill Stein this year because of anger at how the White House has handled the Israel-Hamas conflict.
“People got to go somewhere with their grief and anger,” Rincon said. “I can have a conversation. That’s all I can do.”
Then, a voter Rincon expects to be Republican but who shares support for Harris.
“There are some people who are just tired of the drama,” Rincon said. “People are just, ‘I want this to be over. I want to make politics boring again.’”
Her take two weeks out: “It’s really, really close.”
New energy for Harris — but also more division
Walter Robinson Jr. agrees it is close — and says there is more emotion on both sides since the July switch to Harris.
“It’s more energy and it’s probably more division,” said Robinson. He sees a net plus for Harris since the switch. In June, with Biden as the candidate, he shared Rincon’s view the Wayne plant was split 50-50.
“Right now, I would probably say it is about 60-40” for Harris, Robinson said. “More people have more energy about the Democratic candidate now.”
The tone of debate, he says, has taken a turn for the worse.
“They have been saying some very disparaging things about the vice president,” Robinson said of Trump supporters. Just about every day, Robinson said, he has to decide how much to push back.
“They parrot what (Trump) puts out there,” he said. “The sexist and the racist things. I call them out, but I’m not going to spend too much time because I know that I’m not going to change their mind.”
Robinson helps with UAW organizing just about every weekend, knocking on doors at labor households in the Detroit suburbs. As time runs short, he sometimes thinks about what it would mean to elect a woman of color as president.
“That’s another ceiling that shows we are kind of moving toward a more inclusive nation,” said Robinson, who is Black. “That would be good to see. If she wins, hopefully all hell doesn’t break loose.”
A Trump voter who doesn’t believe everything he says
Our return visit with 30-plus-year Ford worker Bill Govier was a reminder the Democratic ticket switch was not the only big candidate news this year. In June, Govier said he was intrigued by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
But Kennedy has now ended his third-party campaign and endorsed Trump.
“RFK joining Trump, effectively, I couldn’t script it any better,” Govier said. “I love the idea of Donald Trump being the commander in chief. I love the idea of how Donald Trump handles the nefarious characters in the world.”
Govier voted twice for Barack Obama but has turned anti-establishment in recent years. If Trump wins, Govier voiced hope he would bring Kennedy and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii into his administration. Both are former Democrats who frequently wander into conspiracy theories.
Govier said he has a hard time taking Harris seriously, saying, among other things, she laughs too much.
“What is it?” he said of the Harris message. “You’re the incumbent who wouldn’t do anything different or are you the underdog who wants change?”
Govier also supported Trump in 2016 and 2020. From the beginning, he says Trump critics have overreacted to what Govier insists are exaggerations, not outrages.
“He does it for effect,” Govier said. “I don’t believe that Trump really believes someone’s eating cats and dogs. I don’t believe that he’s going to call the National Guard out and, at gunpoint, round up every migrant and force them across the border. I don’t believe that for a second. But I do believe he sensationalizes things. That’s how he’s always talked. He’s always been that way.”
Why a longtime Democrat is voting Trump
Joseph Knowles has always been a Democrat. Until now.
“I’m independent now,” Knowles said in an interview at his home in Clinton Township, part of blue-collar Macomb County north of Detroit.
Knowles, who is Black, attended a Trump rally earlier this year.
“I took it from my mom, my auntie, my cousins, my sister — they came at me,” Knowles said. Relatives mentioned how Trump treats women, demeans Black people and conducted himself on January 6, 2021.
But Knowles said none of that matters to him.
“All I care about right now is how am I going to be able to take care of my wife and kids,” Knowles said.
Knowles is one of 1,100 UAW members recently laid off by Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler and Jeep.
He blames corporate greed and said the company is breaking a promise it made in contract negotiations with the UAW last year.
But he assigns “second blame” to Biden and his administration.
“Because of the EV mandates,” he said.
The Biden administration, which has laid out future electric vehicle sales targets for new cars, has not mandated anyone buy them. And there are currently more automobile manufacturing jobs in the United States than at any point of the Trump presidency. But his union supporters here routinely parrot Trump in saying the industry is devastated because of Biden administration clean-energy policies.
Knowles echoes another Trump line in voicing his support for mass deportation of undocumented immigrants.
“If it is done legally and they cross correctly, I have no problem with it,” Knowles said. “But if you do it the wrong way, I think you should get rounded up and just thrown out. I have no problem with that because it jeopardizes my way of providing for my kids if they take jobs.”
He has never voted Republican before. But he finds himself in a new place: struggling to explain being laid off to his four sons and ignoring or deflecting criticism from family members who are harshly critical of his plans to vote Trump.
“I’m desperate,” Knowles said. “So, I’m wanting to try anything right now to make sure I can fulfill my responsibility and to take care of my wife and kids. That’s all I care about.”",2024-10-21
CNN,In pictures: A historic race for the White House | CNN Politics,"In a span of just one month, the presidential election changed dramatically in the United States.
President Joe Biden pulled out of the race on July 21, a few weeks after a disastrous debate performance that had Democratic allies wanting him to step aside and “pass the torch” for the good of the party and the country. He threw his support behind Vice President Kamala Harris, who secured the Democratic nomination and is looking to become the nation’s first-ever female president.
Eight days before Biden dropped out, former President Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The shooting shocked the world and unified many Republicans around their nominee, who lost to Biden four years ago.

CNN,"Chinese citizen charged with illegally voting in Michigan, authorities say | CNN Politics","Michigan prosecutors charged a Chinese citizen with voter fraud and perjury after he allegedly cast a ballot in the 2024 election, authorities announced Wednesday.
Sources familiar with the matter told CNN that the 19-year-old Chinese man who allegedly voted is a student who lives in Ann Arbor, home to the University of Michigan. Authorities said the man isn’t a US citizen, and therefore can’t vote in federal elections.
The announcement from Michigan’s secretary of state and attorney general, and local prosecutors in Ann Arbor, comes as former President Donald Trump and his Republican allies spread concerns about mass voting by non-citizens. Experts say illegal voting by non-citizens is extremely rare, and when it does happen, it is usually caught quickly.
The Chinese man – a student at the University of Michigan – cast his ballot on Sunday and then reached out to local election officials later that day in an attempt to get the ballot back, according to a source familiar with the situation.
The man registered to vote at the polling place on Sunday, the source said. He used his university ID and other documents to demonstrate his residency in Ann Arbor while filling out a same-day voter registration forms, the source said. The Detroit News first reported the details.
The suspect is legally present in the US, the source added. If he is convicted, he could potentially be deported over the incident, legal experts said.
“Investigations in multiple states and nationwide have found no evidence of large numbers of noncitizens registering to vote. Even less common is a noncitizen actually casting a ballot. When it does happen, we take it extremely seriously,” Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Washtenaw County Prosecutor Eli Savit, both Democrats, said in a statement.
They also said that “any noncitizen who attempts to vote fraudulently in Michigan will be exposing themselves to great risk and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.”
Investigators in Michigan are still looking at whether this was an isolated incident, an accident or possibly part of an attempt by China to interfere in the 2024 election, and federal investigators are also looking into the matter, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.
Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel, who is also a Democrat, said in a statement that her office has launched an “independent, parallel investigation” into the situation.
Authorities did not identify the Chinese student accused of voting in the election. He is facing one count of illegally attempting to vote and one count of perjury – both felonies.
It appears that the student’s vote can’t be nullified after the fact and will be counted.
Washtenaw County Clerk Lawrence Kestenbaum told CNN ballots can’t be retrieved once they have gone through the tabulator. Unlike vote-by-mail, ballots cast at in-person voting locations don’t contain any identifying information about the individual voter, making it impossible to determine which one belonged to the student, Kestenbaum said.
“There’s a box of ballots underneath the tabulator and all of the ballots — they all look the same … there’s no way to go back and undo it,” Kestenbaum said in an interview.
Experts said this is a standard election procedure to maintain secrecy.
“An in-person ballot is placed in a tabulator or ballot box, intermingled with other ballots. This is to preserve secrecy, so you can’t go into the ballot later and confirm who a particular parson voted for,” said David Becker, a former Justice Department voting rights official and founder of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research.
After the charges were announced, Michigan GOP operatives and state lawmakers seized on the news to criticize Democrats for not requiring proof-of-citizenship to vote.
Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, an election law expert at Stetson University, said this is one of the “downsides” of the secret ballot, which was instituted to prevent vote-buying.
Earlier in US history, different color ballots were sometimes used for different political parties, making it easier to meddle in the process. The secret ballot for in-person votes ensures “no one can trace a particular vote to a particular voter,” Torres-Spelliscy said.
“Plucking out an improperly cast ballot is basically impossible because it looks like every other ballot cast by an eligible voter,” Torres-Spelliscy, a CNN contributor, said, adding that the Chinese national who voted in Michigan “swore under penalty of perjury that he was an American citizen, thus this explains why poll workers would give him a ballot.”
When asked about the incident in a regular scheduled briefing in Beijing on Friday, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said they had “noted the relevant report.”
“The Chinese government has always required Chinese citizens overseas to abide by local laws and regulations and not engage in any form of illegal activities,” spokesperson Lin Jian said.
“At the same time, we also ask the United States to investigate fairly and in accordance with the law, properly handle the relevant case, and effectively protect the legitimate rights and interests of the Chinese citizen involved.”",2024-10-30

CNN,Special counsel probe into Biden’s handling of classified documents appears to be nearing end | CNN Politics,"Special counsel Robert Hur’s interview of President Joe Biden is a sign that the classified documents investigation is nearing conclusion after casting a wide net that included dozens of witnesses during the ten-month long probe, multiple sources told CNN.
The White House announced this week that Biden was questioned by Hur and his team over two days in a voluntary interview that CNN has reported was scheduled weeks earlier. While the White House has declined to discuss details of the questioning, including whether Biden invoked executive privilege, the interview is the first public development in months.
One source told CNN that investigators have indicated they hope to wrap by the end of the year. As of now, it’s unclear if the probe will result in charges being filed, but sources familiar with the investigators’ line of questioning said they got the impression that’s unlikely, and there has been no discernible grand jury activity.
The Justice Department has said that Hur will produce a final report explaining his findings from the investigation, a standard part of a special counsel’s work.
“The breadth and depth of Hur’s work suggests that he is going to compile a detailed report to explain exactly how he conducted this investigation,” one source familiar with the investigation told CNN.
Hur was appointed in January to investigate after classified documents were found at Biden’s former office at the Penn Biden Center in Washington, DC, and at his Wilmington, Delaware, home.
Compared to special counsel Jack Smith’s investigation into classified materials found at former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence, including the indictment handed down in June, Hur’s probe into Biden has continued to operate quietly behind the scenes.
Still, the protracted length and exhaustive nature of the investigation has frustrated top Biden aides who expected it to wrap up months ago given the relatively small number of classified documents involved, according to a person familiar with the White House’s thinking.
That person said some Biden aides believe Attorney General Merrick Garland was overly cautious in selecting Hur, an appointee to two top Justice Department roles during the Trump administration, to ensure the investigation was politically unassailable.
Investigators working for Hur have interviewed a broad spectrum of witnesses — from longtime advisor and current counselor Steve Ricchetti, to former White House legal and communications aides, to a former low-level aide who helped pack up the vice president’s residence at the end of the Obama administration, sources familiar with the matter tell CNN.
Hur’s team also has reached out to people who worked in the Senate during the time Biden served in that chamber, sources said. That’s because some of the documents with classified markings date back to Biden’s time in the Senate, according to a statement from Biden’s personal attorney.
As part of the investigation, Hur has sought to examine the handling of classified documents during Biden’s time in the Senate, a period before many of the strict procedures now used for handling classified documents, according to sources.
That has caused Hur to confront the delicate issues of the Senate’s constitutional speech or debate protections, which limit the Justice Department’s ability to interview Senate staff without coordination with Senate lawyers, people briefed on the matter said.
It’s unclear whether and how the Senate and Justice Department’s discussions over Senate-related interviews have been resolved. A special counsel spokesman declined to comment on the idea of no charges or on any discussions with the Senate.
One person familiar with the investigation described members of Hur’s team as being professional but tedious in the level of detail they have sought in witness interviews. Investigators have asked about where staffers sat in the office, where they stored briefing books, and how they operated an office safe.
Another person described a lengthy interview with FBI agents and lawyers focused on understanding everything surrounding specific documents. Investigators appeared to be following a process that identified meetings connected to specific classified documents or notes recovered from Biden properties, the person familiar with the interview said. Everyone who attended a meeting or briefing connected the document is being interviewed, the person said.
Investigators appear to be trying to establish a chain of custody for the documents and the circumstances surrounding them to discern how the classified documents ended up in Biden’s office and home.
Another source said: “The central question in this case is: Did the vice president of the United States intentionally take classified documents for personal use?”
The challenge for investigators is how they assess culpability and the circumstances surrounding how the documents got to the Penn Biden Center and the president’s house in Delaware, the source said.
A lawyer for one witness also described Hur’s process as being slow and methodical. Investigators interviewed this lawyer’s client earlier this year, but recently came back and asked his witness for additional documents.
“They are certainly being sufficiently thorough, and there is a temptation to think they are doing some things twice,” the lawyer said.
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to say Tuesday if the president answered all questions posed to him or invoked executive privilege during the interview with Hur. Jean-Pierre also wouldn’t say if the Biden administration requested that the interview be postponed following Hamas’ attack on Israel over the weekend.
“He’s been very much focused on the issues of the – you know – horrific events that we have seen in Israel,” she said. “As president, he has to do multiple things at once, and that’s what you saw him do this weekend.”",2023-10-11
CNN,"As women outpace men in early turnout, Trump’s challenge to win over female voters comes into focus | CNN Politics","When Alex Cooper, the popular podcaster behind “Call Her Daddy,” released her widely discussed interview with Democrat Kamala Harris last month, she revealed she had invited the vice president’s Republican opponent, Donald Trump, to appear on her show as well.
“If he also wants to have a meaningful and in-depth conversation about women’s rights in this country, then he is welcome on ‘Call Her Daddy’ anytime,” Cooper told her millions of listeners, most of them women.
Trump’s campaign had received an offer to join the show, according to sources close to the former president, but ultimately decided to pass. Instead, Trump doubled down on a strategy of speaking directly to America’s young men through appearances on right-leaning, male-dominated online shows. He will end his campaign Tuesday having largely avoided podcasts, YouTube channels and daytime TV shows tailored toward female audiences.
And if Trump’s third White House bid falls short, his approach to courting women – who narrowly outnumber men and are more reliable voters – may be among his campaign’s most scrutinized strategies. Trump advisers and allies had argued throughout the late summer and early fall that his appeal among men would make up for the lack of support from female voters, but in recent weeks the widening gender gap has caused alarm for some Republicans.
“We’ve seen a women problem for all Republicans, up and down the ballot,” one Trump-aligned GOP operative told CNN. “It starts at the top.”
Trump’s uncertainty about how to appeal to women has been evident even in the final days of his campaign, leading to public disagreements with his staff over his messaging. At a rally in Green Bay, Wisconsin, on Wednesday, he recounted advice from aides urging him to drop his repeated promise to be women’s “protector” because they saw it as inappropriate.
“‘Sir, please don’t say that,’” he said he was advised. “Why? I’m president. I want to protect the women of our country. Well, I’m going to do it, whether the women like it or not. I’m going to protect them,” Trump told the crowd.
The Harris campaign quickly seized on the remarks, pairing the clip with Trump’s anti-abortion statements in a video that amassed over 2.4 million views on X. Harris followed up by highlighting the comments during a brief and rare news conference and later at a rally in Reno, Nevada, where she said Trump “simply does not respect the freedom of women or the intelligence of women to make decisions about their own lives.”
Her campaign also criticized Trump for asserting Thursday that former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. would work on “women’s health” in a second Trump administration.
Understanding the divide
Behind the scenes and on the phone with close allies, Trump will ask why women don’t like him, three sources familiar with the conversations said.
“He thinks women want someone who will keep them safe. Keep their children safe,” one of the sources said.
In North Carolina on Wednesday, Trump polled the women in his audience on whether they wanted him to protect them. He appeared pleased at the cheers he received.
But beyond his rallies, women do not appear to be responding to the former president’s attempts to reach them. The latest ABC News/Ipsos national poll showed Trump trailing Harris among likely female voters by 14-points – a margin that far outpaces his 6-point lead among men.
Adding to Trump’s challenges is a gender gap in early voting. In the seven most contested battleground states, women have cast 55% of ballots so far, while men account for 45%, according to Catalist, a Democratic-aligned data firm. This 10-point disparity representing nearly 1.4 million ballots, though slightly less than it was four years ago, nevertheless has Trump allies concerned.
“Early vote has been disproportionately female,” Charlie Kirk, president of Turning Point Action, a conservative group responsible for much of Trump’s ground strategy, posted on X. “If men stay at home, Kamala is president. It’s that simple.”
In a statement to CNN, Trump campaign spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Harris “may be the first woman Vice President but she has implemented dangerously liberal policies that have left women worse off financially and far less safe than we were four years ago under President Trump.”
“Women deserve a President who will secure our nation’s borders, remove violent criminals from our neighborhoods, and build an economy that helps our families thrive – and that’s exactly what President Trump will do,” Leavitt said.
The right appeal
For a time, Trump’s campaign expected they could win women over on key policy issues, specifically the economy, crime and Trump’s vow to keep transgender women from competing in female sports. However, the race for women’s votes grew more complicated with Harris becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, energizing female voters and leaving Trump scrambling for a new approach.
Over the past two weeks, the campaign has hosted a women’s tour, featuring several top allies. These events will continue through the weekend with popular female Trump supporters, including Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and former race car driver Danica Patrick. At a recent town hall on Fox News with an entirely female audience – an overt attempt to take on the concerns – Trump called himself the “father” of in vitro fertilization, an assertion that Democrats have roundly mocked.
Trump’s campaign and Republican supporters attempted to go on offense Thursday, capitalizing on remarks made by businessman Mark Cuban, a leading pro-Harris voice, who told ABC’s “The View” that the former president avoids “strong, intelligent women.” Top female Republican lawmakers and Trump’s female staff, including his campaign manager Susie Wiles, denounced the remarks on social media.
Trump has also relied on other White men to help reach female voters. Senior advisers have hoped for a boost from the endorsement from Kennedy, who has been stumping for Trump on the campaign trail and is expected be with the former president all day Friday. The hope was Kennedy could reach a subset of women, particularly health-conscious mothers who are distrustful of government and the medical industry. Women were more likely to support Kennedy than men, according to a recent Pew Research Center survey, though other polls haven’t shown a meaningful difference.
Trump’s challenges with female voters stretch back to his first term, when college-educated women began shifting away from him, driving Democratic gains in the House in the 2018 midterms. The Supreme Court’s reversal of Roe v. Wade in 2022, a decision Trump once celebrated, has only deepened women’s resistance to his platform. He has attempted to moderate his stance – taking credit for the court’s decision while distancing himself from the strict state abortion laws that followed that ruling – but polling hasn’t shown it to be effective. His selection of Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who once said abortion should be “illegal nationally,” as his running mate has only kept the issue front and center.
Trump’s inability to straddle the country’s deep divide proved unsustainable this summer. Forced to pick a side on a ballot measure to expand abortion access in his home state of Florida, Trump at first suggested he supported it. The blowback from the right was swift and severe. Leading women in the anti-abortion movement threatened to withhold their support from Trump and gave permission for others to do the same.
At the risk of losing women from within his base, Trump backtracked. He clarified that he intended to vote against the Florida amendment, effectively siding with the state’s existing six-week abortion ban. The episode provided Democrats new fire power for one of their most effective fundraising and mobilizing messages against the former president.
An opportunity for Harris
An appearance on “Call Her Daddy” might not have resolved Trump’s longstanding challenge with female voters. But his decision to avoid such platforms has left Harris with a prominent opening.
During her appearance on the podcast, she warned listeners about the potential rollback of rights under a second Trump term, saying, “The fight for reproductive freedom is, at its core, about the basic right any individual has to make decisions about their own body.”
Leavitt did not respond when asked why Trump didn’t accept the “Call Her Daddy” invite. Representatives for Cooper, the podcast host, did not respond to CNN’s request for comment.
Trump, meanwhile, has gone sharply in the other direction, remaining confined to a similar universe of online jokesters and bro-culture influencers: the Canadian pranksters known as the Nelk Boys, comedians Theo Vonn and Andrew Schulz, wrestler Mark Calaway aka The Undertaker, YouTube star-turned-boxer Logan Paul, LIV golfer Bryson DeChambeau, former NFL stars Will Compton and Taylor Lewan and video game streamer Adin Ross.
The capstone appearance of his podcast tour came in October when Trump sat down for a three-hour interview with comedian and actor Joe Rogan, host of one of the most popular shows on the internet.
The appearance delivered the desired result for Trump’s campaign – an extended performance in front of Rogan’s massive audience – and Harris has faced pressure to also join Rogan’s Austin-based show. Rogan recently divulged that his team had discussed the idea with the Harris campaign, but they hadn’t come to terms on the length or where to record it.
But Trump has resisted opportunities to branch out. He hasn’t also appeared on the campaign trail with his GOP primary rival, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who captured a notable share of female Republican voters through the winter and spring. Trump’s campaign was in talks with Haley’s team earlier this month to deploy her with the GOP nominee on the trail, but a Trump adviser told CNN it’s unclear if any such joint appearance will ultimately come together before Election Day.
Haley told Fox News this week that she hasn’t spoken to Trump since June but remained willing to engage.
Instead, Trump’s campaign once again recommitted to his approach with a male-dominated rally at Madison Square Garden that drew criticisms for misogynistic attacks by speakers on the former president’s past and present female opponents.
“This is not a time for them to get overly masculine with this bromance thing that they’ve got going,” Haley said in response to the New York City rally. “Fifty-three percent of the electorate are women. Women will vote. They care about how they are being talked to and they care about the issues. This is a time of discipline, and this is the time of addition.”

CNN,American Battleground: The fight to the finish — and what lies beyond the 2024 campaign | CNN Politics,"Editor’s Note: This is the conclusion of a five-part series that tells the story of the closing months of the 2024 presidential campaign, starting with the June debate between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. Read the first, second, third and fourth installments.
The Los Angeles Dodgers are hosting the New York Yankees in the World Series, inflatable ghosts and plastic skeletons are springing up in yards everywhere, and on the last Friday in October, almost half the country thinks the man with a solid chance to be the next American president is a fascist.
A new ABC News/Ipsos poll says 49% of registered voters agree that Trump fits the definition of “a political extremist who seeks to act as a dictator, disregards individual rights and threatens or uses force against their opponents.” Vice President Kamala Harris is with them.
“Do you think Donald Trump is a fascist?” Anderson Cooper asked her in a CNN town hall just two days earlier.
“Yes, I do. Yes, I do,” Harris said, “and I also believe that the people who know him best on this subject should be trusted.”
She is pushing into the final days of the race by pointing to a parade of former Trump insiders who have raised alarms against him ever occupying the White House again. They include Trump’s longest-serving chief of staff, John Kelly, who told The New York Times that Trump “never accepted the fact that he wasn’t the most powerful man in the world — and by power, I mean an ability to do anything he wanted, anytime he wanted.” Former Secretary of Defense James Mattis, former national security adviser John Bolton, and former Defense Secretary Mark Esper have raised red flags over Trump’s leanings. In a new book by celebrated journalist Bob Woodward, former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley calls Trump “the most dangerous person in this country” and “fascist to the core.”
As expected, Trump blasts them as disgruntled losers, and his defenders rush to the rescue. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham goes on the Sunday morning talk show circuit to say, “I was around him, I don’t think he’s a fascist!” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell pairs up with Speaker of the House Mike Johnson to issue a rare joint statement that reads in part, “Labeling a political opponent as a ‘fascist,’ risks inviting yet another would-be assassin to try robbing voters of their choice before Election Day.” They ignore Trump’s habitual smears against Harris in which he says, “She’s a Marxist, communist, fascist, socialist.”
Still, that all pales next to Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden in deep blue New York City on Sunday evening. His team bills it as the traditional closing argument for his campaign. It emerges instead as an ugly spectacle, with speaker after speaker flinging bigoted insults at Harris and her Democratic partners.
“She is the devil. She is the antichrist.”
“Her and her pimp handlers will destroy our country.”
“The whole f**king party — a bunch of degenerates.”
“We need to slaughter this ‘other’ people.”
There’s a joke about a Black man and a watermelon, a swipe at Jews, and more from comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who calls Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage.”
Mindful of the roughly 6 million Puerto Ricans in the mainland and Trump’s already strained relationship with the island, his team quickly says that quip “does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign.” The rest of the slurs at the Garden are left untouched, and when Trump is asked about the vitriol later, he sounds as if he were somewhere else. “The love in that room – it was breathtaking,” he says. “It was a lovefest, an absolute lovefest, and it was my honor to be involved.”
In the moment, Trump’s big event is almost tailor made to help Harris, reminding voters of the division, anger and petty vengeance that at times characterized his single term. The candidate’s speech straps neatly into the fury of the other speakers, as he too rips into Harris and the Democratic politicians standing with her. “They’re smart and they’re vicious,” he tells the seething crowd, “and we have to defeat them. And when I say the ‘enemy from within,’ the other side goes crazy. They are indeed the ‘enemy from within.’”
For weeks preceding his rally at the Garden, Trump has been suggesting, if elected, he would use the federal government and military to handle that “enemy” – hinting at targets among elected officials, media figures, judges and more. GOP lawmakers have scrambled to say he really means only radical, violent, criminal leftists. A Fox News interviewer says to the candidate that the enemy within is “a pretty ominous phrase, if you’re talking about other Americans.” Trump replies, “I think it is accurate.”
To dispel any confusion before making that infamous closing argument, Trump had hopped on Truth Social. “WHEN I WIN, those people that CHEATED will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law,” he writes, “which will include long term prison sentences…this legal exposure extends to Lawyers, Political Operatives, Donors, Illegal Voters, & Corrupt Election Officials.”
“He really wants to, in his mind, avenge the loss in 2020.” On “The Ezra Klein Show,” The New York Times’ Maggie Haberman, who has covered Trump for years, is explicit about one of his chief goals in this election. “He wants to exact payback on people he thinks deserve it. He’s been quite clear about that.”
CNN senior reporter Edward-Isaac Dovere can see the calculation on both sides of the political spectrum. “Yeah, a lot of his people love to hear him say ‘the enemy within,’” he says, “but she (Harris) is hoping… more people who are up for grabs will be turned off by it.”
Demonizing Harris
With just over a week until Election Day, several ballot drop boxes have been set on fire, some voting offices are installing bulletproof glass, Trump is raising baseless claims of Democrats stealing the election as rightwing websites echo him, and tens of millions of Americans have already cast ballots.
It is not clear who might benefit from the early surge. GOP pollster Frank Luntz insists the return rate of Republican ballots has “got Democrats worried as hell,” but he also allows that the early arrivals might be cannibalizing votes Trump would otherwise get on Election Day. Only a sliver of true “undecideds” is up for grabs, so Trump seems focused on agitating his base, which has helped pull him up from his slightly trailing position in the polls. CNN’s last national survey before Election Day has Trump and Harris deadlocked at 47%.
“I think the Trump camp feels very confident that their coalition is entirely built,” says Michael Duncan, co-host of the conservative podcast “Ruthless,” “and so it is less about closing the deal with undecided voters. It’s more about just turning out the voter coalition you’ve built.”
Conservative commentator Erick Erickson tells his YouTube audience, “This is a tied race technically, but in being a tied race the trajectory now points toward a Donald Trump victory and not a Kamala Harris victory.” He is convinced a primary force helping Trump is “Republican voters who do not like Donald Trump coming home to Donald Trump.”
After being battered by Harris for several weeks, Trump and his team brought those voters back into the fold with tried-and-true tactics: unleashing a scorching series of attacks on her character and experience. Now at seemingly every stop, he calls her “dumb” or “mentally disabled” or a dangerous “lunatic.” He rails that her “sinister forces” are intent on destroying the country by throwing open the border with Mexico, tolerating rampant crime, and in some unexplained way, unleashing “World War 3.”
He misleads about her policies. He calls her resume fiction, insisting she never worked at McDonald’s – a point he tries to drive home with a photo op of him serving fries at the fast-food chain. At a campaign rally where he bafflingly expresses admiration for the late golfer Arnold Palmer’s genitals, he says to the crowd, “You have to tell Kamala Harris that you’ve had enough, that you just can’t take it anymore. ‘We can’t stand you. You’re a sh*t vice president.’”
It’s crude, it’s rude, but for Trump’s campaign it is right on target.
“They were successful in defining her in their image in the months of September and October,” CNN’s Jeff Zeleny says, noting how virtually all of Trump’s commercials now are negative. “It’s a fear election at this point. Donald Trump is making people afraid to vote for her.”
Plenty of commentators, polls and political researchers say the economy is unequivocally the top issue, and it offers a natural line of attack for Trump. But the former president, always trusting his instinct most, keeps circling back to the genesis of his political creation. “I don’t think it’s the economy. I think it’s the border,” he says at a Pennsylvania forum on the concerns of older folks.
CNN’s senior political analyst Gloria Borger is not surprised Trump sees that as the core of his campaign. “He doesn’t like talking about the economy,” she says. “He thinks it’s quote ‘boring.’ Immigration is his go-to.”
In a campaign full of wild swings by Trump, his choice to once again go with his golden gut is a frustration for many Republicans inside and outside his campaign. It is also a reminder that, for all the posturing about his corporate acumen, Trump has spent most of his life as head of a small – albeit wealthy – family business where he’s been free of virtually all oversight. By many accounts, that unfettered experience and the freedom to indulge his whims served him poorly in office where witnesses say he constantly chafed at laws, rules and political realities that limited his presidential muscle and drove his admiration for foreign autocrats such as Russia’s Vladimir Putin and North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
“We know what Donald Trump wants,” Harris says in DC just outside the vice presidential residence. “He wants unchecked power.”
Now Trump’s freewheeling ways may also be a weakness for Harris to exploit, although many pundits believe as a woman of color she must move cautiously against her older, White male opponent.
“She’s judged differently,” says journalist Eva McKend, who is following Harris for CNN. “If she were out there talking about a celebrity’s genitalia, no one would think it was cute or endearing. People would have real problems with that. So that is why she may sound kind of rehearsed.”
Shortly after Harris assumed the Democratic candidacy, Republicans began accusing her of relying on teleprompters too much and sidestepping interviews. But as the race streaks to the wire, she is showing much more willingness to face tough journalists and step into hostile settings than Trump. She joined Fox News for a contentious sit down, she agreed to the “60 Minutes” grilling, and was amenable to another debate. Of the two contenders, Trump is now the one sticking to friendly forums and dodging tough questions.
Perhaps with reason. Trump’s at times ill-considered and off-color comments on the trail are creating a paradox as his team tries to lock in everything it can for the home stretch. “His campaign apparatus has never been stronger,” Zeleny says. “He has never been weaker, I think.”
Still, Trump consistently tries to lash Harris to the sitting president. CNN’s Laura Coates notes that while Harris is running a strong campaign, her affection for and allegiance to Biden are a challenge. “It is a very difficult needle to thread,” Coates says. “On the one hand, to be thought of as very distinct from Joe Biden, and on the other hand, be able to not be critical of the administration that you still are a part of.”
Harris and her team’s hopes depend on moving deliberately and with discipline. Her campaign stops and interviews, like Trump’s, are carefully selected by a phalanx of political pros. Unlike his, which often devolve into rambling, her moves and those of her surrogates are calibrated and executed with relative precision. In the battlegrounds, actress Julia Roberts is dispatched to her home state of Georgia. In Michigan, the rapper Eminem joins a Harris rally in his hometown of Detroit. The candidate sits down with Oprah, appears with Beyonce, and chats with radio host Charlamagne tha God about the reluctance of young Black men to vote for her. Former first lady Michelle Obama makes a passionate appeal for men in general to consider the health of the women in their lives. “If we don’t get this election right,” she says, “your wife, your daughter, your mother, we as women, will become collateral damage to your rage.”
The campaign is checking off boxes and going so full bore, CNN’s Dovere notes of former President Barack Obama, “there was a day when he recorded 21 videos for Harris in one day – 21 videos. That means they are putting them out to different channels in ways that will probably never come across to you or me.”
Trump wants his campaign organization to do its job, but he is counting on his own outsize personality, instinct and committed followers to carry him to victory. Harris is betting on hard work.
“They are confident in the strength of their ground game,” McKend says from her observations of the Harris team on the trail. “You have to remember, even before Vice President Harris became their nominee, they had extensive infrastructure in place in the battleground states in terms of the get-out-the vote operation, registering voters – there was a plan.”
That plan, however, is slamming up against an unpredictable opponent. As Trump’s 2020 campaign communications director Erin Perrine puts it, “Donald Trump is a political anomaly. He is not a political rule. Nobody else can run like Donald Trump.”
In speeches and interviews for weeks, Trump has proven it by citing false statistics, making unfounded accusations and claiming unearned honors by the score. When he is plainly caught, his supporters often retreat to the adage all politicians lie.
That’s probably true, says CNN fact checker Daniel Dale, who notes that Harris has been caught in some falsehoods too. But he adds, “There are a few key differences between Trump and other politicians. One is frequency, just the sheer quantity of lies from Trump just vastly exceeds anything we see from literally anyone else in national politics. Two is the sheer triviality of a lot of this stuff. Trump is telling lies about the tiniest things for no apparent reason sometimes.”
Some of his falsehoods play out badly in the waning weeks of the campaign. When Trump raises claims that the Biden-Harris administration is failing to provide timely aid to flood-ravaged communities in the wake of Hurricane Helene, Republican governors along the path say that’s not true. Some of his statements are laughably false. At a Univision town hall, Trump is asked about his supporters storming the US Capitol after the last election, beating police officers and calling for the hanging of then-Vice President Mike Pence. He previews what will be his response to the Madison Square Garden event when he replies, “That was a day of love.”
The torrent of falsehoods is not the only peculiar baggage Trump carries into the homestretch. At a town hall in Pennsylvania, a couple of people require medical attention, and Trump suddenly announces, “Let’s not do any more questions. Let’s just listen to music… Who the hell wants to hear questions, right?” Then for more than a half hour, he dances onstage while he plays DJ, calling for tunes from The Village People, Sinéad O’Connor, and ironically, a song from “Cats.”
In previous weeks, Trump has befuddled campaign watchers with musings about electric boats, sharks and what to do when sinking. He has declared to women voters, “I will be your protector,” and labeled himself the “father of IVF” – while simultaneously admitting he just recently learned what in vitro fertilization is. He has frequently drifted off into baffling stream-of-consciousness riffs that leave audiences scratching their heads. He explains that he’s just processing many radically different ideas all at once in an intellectual maneuver he has dubbed “the weave.”
Such moments spur Harris to call Trump “unstable” and “unhinged.” He has been attacking her mental capacity for weeks, culminating in the claim she is “totally bonkers.” It is worth noting this accusation of mental impairment is a pro forma slur from Trump. He raised it against Biden in 2024 and 2020, and against Hillary Clinton in 2016. For himself, Trump has repeatedly claimed he “aced” a cognitive test, while refusing to ever release the results of such an exam. Indeed, while Biden and Harris have released comprehensive medical assessments, Trump has been so protective of his own medical records there is still no definitive answer to the questions: How tall is he and how much does he weigh?
Amid all that turmoil and with time running out, both camps are also strategizing for what might follow the final vote. There are deep concerns that getting clear results from the election could be complicated and time consuming.
“We’ve seen the largest explosion of pre-Election Day litigation in our nation’s history,” CNN legal analyst Norm Eisen says. Republicans have filed well over 100 lawsuits challenging which ballots should be counted, and how the results will – or won’t – be certified. Democrats have filed suits too, pushing back on Republican moves they feel are aimed at suppressing the vote. And Eisen suspects we are nowhere near the end of the legal action. “We know from 2020 that they have a propensity – Trump and his allies – for filing baseless litigation. And Trump has already refused to say that he will accept the election results without qualification.”
That and the potential for violence, whoever wins, is casting a dark cloud over everything.
The closing arguments
Framed by the October night, American flags and with the White House glowing behind her, Harris steps to a podium in the 52-acre park called the Ellipse. She is there to reach out to those presumably dwindling undecided voters. Senior adviser Stephanie Cutter was wearing a four-leaf clover necklace when she said, “If they were going to vote for Trump they would have voted for him. So they are open to us.”
“We know who Donald Trump is,” Harris announces to the assembled crowd as she makes her way through what may be the most important speech of her life. “He is the person who stood at this very spot nearly four years ago and sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol to overturn the will of the people in a free and fair election – an election that he knew he lost!” The crowd roars.
Harris lays out her closing argument just as Trump did two days earlier. Despite issuing sharp warnings about her opponent, her message is decidedly more upbeat than his, full of promises and hope for a future of inclusion, mutual respect and unity.
“This election is more than just a choice between two parties and two different candidates,” she says. “It is a choice between whether we have a country rooted in freedom for every American or ruled by chaos and division.”
In half an hour, it is over. Some version of that choice has been raised by both candidates repeatedly throughout the campaign, and although last-minute rumbles may shake the land, both sides have now made their cases. For practical purposes, only the voting remains.
What lies ahead
On Tuesday, the winner of this turbulent, seemingly endless campaign will be decided, although it may take days or weeks for that decision to reveal itself. But even when the votes have all been tallied, the suspicion, resentment and fears raised among the country’s citizens will surely remain unresolved.
Political history shows that for decades voters have been reaching for some sort of elusive change in the way their government operates. Some want to slip back into the standards of the past, ostensibly simpler years when communities were more homogenous, economic advancement seemed more predictable and “wokeness” was not a word. Opponents find that notion stifling and too focused on favored classes. Others want the nation to vault forward to a progressive era, where social norms are reconfigured and a new sense of society arises – which, again, the other side finds intolerable. And still others remain somewhere in the murky middle.
Across the spectrum, many dread that democracy as Americans know it is no longer up to fulfilling either dream or closing the chasm between the disagreeing camps. Too many residents of red states feel economically abandoned, politically disenfranchised and socially ridiculed by their urbanized cousins. Too many blue staters feel angry at the recalcitrance of their relatives beyond the city limits and robbed of the power of their votes by an electoral system that gives Wyoming’s 600,000 residents as many US senators as California’s 39 million.
Churches, schools, libraries, hospitals, sports arenas, farmers markets, offices, public parks, gas stations, restaurants and more have become flashpoints for aggrieved souls exhausted by the constant sense of conflict, as partisans flood the media with fresh calls to fight. The divisions have Balkanized states, fractured communities, driven friends to stewing silences and families to slamming doors. For many on all sides, this extraordinarily contentious election has made them feel like strangers in their own land, where nothing seems familiar and the comfort they once knew has slipped away.
Each party has its answers for the future and ideas about who belongs in this country and who doesn’t, about which rights are inviolate and which are up for grabs, and about what it means to be a patriot. In a nation of some 337 million people, it is inevitable that disputes over such matters will arise.
But among all those people, this election has also underscored endless similarities: the near universal desire for decent homes, secure families, adequate education, health care, employment, respect, freedom and hope, which historically have always been best addressed by people united not just in name but also in deeds.
All of that suggests any success from this election may come not from the triumph of the winners, but from their treatment of everyone else – the attention given to the concerns, fears, beliefs, and grief of those whose choice comes up short. Perhaps only with that generosity and “the better angels of our nature,” which Abraham Lincoln invoked at his inauguration in 1861, will Americans finally be able to leave this bitter election behind and walk away from the battleground we have made.",2024-11-01
CNN,23 Nobel Prize-winning economists call Harris’ economic plan ‘vastly superior’ to Trump’s | CNN Politics,"More than half of the living US recipients of the Nobel Prize for economics signed a letter that called Vice President Kamala Harris’ economic agenda “vastly superior” to the plans laid out by former President Donald Trump.
Twenty-three Nobel Prize-winning economists signed onto the letter, including two of the three most recent recipients.
“While each of us has different views on the particulars of various economic policies, we believe that, overall, Harris’ economic agenda will improve our nation’s health, investment, sustainability, resilience, employment opportunities, and fairness and be vastly superior to the counterproductive economic agenda of Donald Trump,” the economists write in the letter obtained by CNN.
The letter serves as a stamp of approval for Harris less than two weeks from Election Day on the issue voters consistently rank as the most important in surveys: the economy. Voter struggles with inflation and an overall dour view of the state of the US economy have long served as a clear vulnerability for the Democratic candidate in the race, with incumbent President Joe Biden struggling for months to highlight his administration’s economic policy before he stepped aside and Harris coalesced party support to become the party nominee.
The letter was spearheaded by Joseph Stiglitz, a Columbia University professor and 2001 winner of the prize, and marks the second major foray into the campaign by a group of Nobel laureates.
Stiglitz also led an effort in June, with 15 fellow Nobel winners, to highlight what the signatories said would be a “destabilizing effect” of a second Trump term on the US economy. The group said at the time that then-candidate Biden’s economic agenda was also “vastly superior.”
Trump dismissed the group’s letter at the time, and his campaign slammed those who signed on as “worthless out of touch” economists.
But the new letter, which began to come together after Harris detailed her economic vision late last month, includes seven new signatories and represents a wide cross-section in the field in terms of areas of expertise and approach to economics.
The expanded group includes two of the three most recent laureates – Simon Johnson and Daron Acemoglu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. They received the prize, along with James Robinson of the University of Chicago, last week for their research into how institutions shape which countries become wealthy and prosperous.
The letter is intentionally brief at just 228 words, which reflects both an effort to secure consensus across a broader spectrum of economists and a desire to elevate that consensus with precision, according to a person familiar with the process. The letter was drafted to incorporate feedback from the initial effort.
It also marked an effort in the final days of the campaign to elevate what those involved viewed as an acute risk posed by Trump both in his economic proposals, but also, in their view, of the potential instability he would pose in an area where certainty and stability are paramount.
The letter points to Trump’s tariff and tax policies as inflationary and likely to balloon the federal deficit – a widely held view among economists. But it also issues a stark warning.
“Among the most important determinants of economic success are the rule of law and economic and political certainty, and Trump threatens all of these,” the economists write.
Despite the warnings and forecasts from economists across the political spectrum, Trump has been steadfast in his pledge to wield threats of sweeping tariffs as a cornerstone of his economic agenda.
Trump, in a recent Bloomberg interview at the Economic Club of Chicago, said his tariff plans would “have a massive effect, a positive effect.”
“The most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff,” Trump said. “It’s my favorite word.”
Trump has promised broad tax cuts beyond his 2017 tax law and promised to abolish taxes on tips, overtime and social security benefits, which analysts say would cost trillions, all as he pointed to tariffs and economic growth as the way to pay for the loss in revenue.
Economists view tariffs as effectively a tax on consumers who buy imported goods.
He has pledged large-scale de-regulation and, as part of the effort, unleash a surge in oil and gas drilling. He has also pledged to deport all illegal immigrants in the US in the “largest deportation operation” in the country’s history.
Trump has long held an edge when it comes to which candidate voters believe would best handle the economy as voters grapple with widespread discontent over the state and direction of the US economy.
Trump and his allies have sought to press that advantage in campaign events and in their advertising with a specific focus on the high prices that have weighed down American consumers for much of the last few years.
But Harris has steadily chipped away at Trump’s advantage on the issue in recent weeks, according to polling, and Harris campaign advisers see an opening to cut into Trump’s strength on the issue in the closing days of the campaign.
Those efforts have been bolstered by a steady stream of economic data that has boosted the confidence among US economic policy makers that they have successfully tamed inflation without pushing the broader economy into a recession.
The Federal Reserve has started cutting interest rates. Employment data for September showed hiring picked up, a dropping unemployment rate and strong wage growth.
Retails sales also remain durable.
The economic picture, at least based on the macroeconomic data, is one that appears robust.
Harris, as part of her economic agenda, has moved to address voter concerns about prices, the cost of housing, the cost of child and elder care and pushed for tax cuts targeting middle-and lower-income Americans.
She has also signaled support for the industrial policies championed by Biden designed to bolster US manufacturing for critical industries.
The contrast between the two candidates on the economy is central to the messages both campaigns are pushing in the final days of the race.
For the signatories of the letter, Harris’ message is the clear preference.
“Simply put, Harris’s policies will result in a stronger economic performance, with economic growth that is more robust, more sustainable, and more equitable,” the economists write.",2024-10-23
CNN,CNN Polls: Harris and Trump locked in close races in Arizona and Nevada as pool of persuadable voters shrinks | CNN Politics,"In the critical Southwest battlegrounds of Arizona and Nevada, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump run near even in the race for the White House, according to new CNN polls conducted by SSRS. The findings come as large numbers of voters report having already cast ballots and the pool of those open to changing their mind shrinks.
Harris holds 48% support among likely voters in Arizona, according to the poll, to 47% for Trump. In Nevada, 48% of likely voters support Trump and 47% back Harris. Those 1-point margins fall within each poll’s margin of sampling error, finding no clear leader in either state.
The surveys find voters’ views largely set on who would better handle top issues, while on a range of key attributes, neither candidate has convinced a critical mass of voters that they’re the better choice. Voters in both states have at best a narrow preference for which candidate cares more about people like them, shares their vision of the country or would put the country’s interests above their own self-interest.
The Nevada poll suggests little change in the state of the race there since late August, but in Arizona, the new results point to a shift in Harris’ favor. The new poll finds Harris improving there with core Democratic constituencies such as women, Latino voters and younger voters. The shift is notably concentrated among women, who now break for Harris by 16 points, while men continue to favor Trump by a 14-point margin.
Harris’ edge with women is a bit tighter in Nevada (51% support her, 46% Trump). That closer margin is largely driven by the relative lack of a gender gap among White likely voters in the state: Trump has a 15-point lead over Harris among White men (56% to 41%) and a 12-point lead among White women (54% to 42%).
Hispanic likely voters in Nevada split about evenly between Harris and Trump (48% support Harris, 47% Trump). Harris does hold a wide lead there among voters younger than 35, though: 53% support her versus 39% for Trump.
Independent voters in both states split roughly evenly between Harris and Trump. In Arizona, 45% support Trump to 43% for Harris, a 6-point improvement in support for the vice president since August. In Nevada, independent likely voters divide 46% Harris to 43% Trump, about the same as in August.
The Democratic nominees for US Senate in each state appear to have the upper hand. In Arizona, Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego bests Republican Kari Lake 51% to 43% among likely voters in the race to succeed retiring independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, and in Nevada, Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen leads in her reelection bid against Republican challenger Sam Brown 50% to 41% among likely voters.
Further down the ballot, a vote in Arizona to establish a fundamental right to an abortion in the state’s constitution has broad support: 60% of likely voters say they would vote in favor of it, and just 39% would oppose it.
Both states have robust early and mail-in ballot voting, and according to the poll, 55% of likely voters in Arizona and 42% in Nevada say they have already voted. In both states, more registered Republicans have cast ballots so far than registered Democrats. In Arizona, that still translates into a Harris advantage among those banked votes (53% of those who say they already voted support her compared with 44% for Trump), but in Nevada, those who’ve already voted tilt in the former president’s favor (52% Trump to 46% Harris).
Though both candidates are making late campaign stops across Arizona and Nevada, more than 9 in 10 likely voters in both states say they have already made up their minds about who they’ll support. In both states, 92% say they are locked in, with 8% potentially persuadable.
Likely voters in Arizona and Nevada are closely divided when asked to weigh the importance of the candidates’ stances on the issues against their leadership traits and approach to the presidency, with just over half prioritizing issue positions (53% in Nevada, 52% in Arizona), and just under half leadership traits (47% in Nevada, 48% in Arizona).
Harris supporters across both states largely say leadership traits are more important (55% in Nevada, 54% in Arizona), while most Trump backers (59% in Nevada, 58% in Arizona) say they prioritize the candidates’ stands on the issues that matter.
In both states, the polls find now-familiar divides on which issues each candidate is more trusted to handle, echoing trends that have been largely consistent in national and state polling throughout the fall. Likely voters trust Trump over Harris to handle immigration (by a 14-point margin in Arizona and 15 points in Nevada), the economy (by 11 points in Arizona, 9 points in Nevada) and foreign policy (by 8 points in Arizona, 7 points in Nevada). Harris is more trusted on abortion and reproductive rights in both states (by 16 points in Arizona, and 21 points in Nevada) and also holds a 5-point edge in Arizona on protecting democracy, with Nevada voters about evenly split (46% trust Harris, 45% Trump).
In Arizona, likely voters are split over which candidate cares more about people like them (45% say Harris does, 41% Trump). But the vice president has the advantage as more honest and trustworthy than Trump, 44% to 35%, and, by a narrow margin, on putting the country’s interests above her own (46% say Harris, 41% Trump). The former president holds narrow leads on bringing the change the country needs (45% Trump, 40% Harris) and sharing voters’ vision of the country (44% Trump, 39% Harris).
In Nevada, likely voters give Harris the advantage on honesty (44% to 36%) and caring about people like them (46% to 40%), and call Trump more likely to bring needed change (47% to 41%). They’re about evenly split on which candidate would put the country’s interests ahead of their own (46% say Harris, 44% Trump) and on who shares their vision (44% each).
Roughly one-fifth of voters in each state say that neither Harris nor Trump can be described as honest and trustworthy, higher than the shares who reject both candidates on any other issue or personal trait.
In both states, confidence that ballots will be accurately cast and counted has grown since late August. Roughly 8 in 10 likely voters in Nevada (81%, up 10 points since August) and three-quarters in Arizona (76%, up 8 points) say they are at least somewhat confident that ballot casting and counting will be done accurately. That increase comes more from Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (up 19 points in Nevada, 12 points in Arizona) than from Democrats and Democratic leaners.
Despite those increases, Republicans and Republican leaners remain far less trusting of the ballot process than are Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents in both states. In Arizona, 69% of Democratic-aligned likely voters say they are very confident in the system, but that drops to 21% among Republican-aligned voters. The gap is even wider in Nevada, where 71% of Democratic-leaning likely voters are very confident compared with 16% of Republican-aligned likely voters.
Interviews were conducted October 21-26, 2024, online and by telephone with registered voters, including 781 voters in Arizona and 683 in Nevada. Likely voters include all registered voters in the poll weighted for their predicted likelihood of voting in this year’s election. Results among likely voters in Arizona have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points; it is 4.6 points among likely voters in Nevada.",2024-10-29
CNN,"Michigan young voters enthused for Harris, but their level of support is still a big question | CNN Politics","The campus art museum doubles as a voting hub. There are voter registration tables seemingly everywhere. Even the sleeves at the campus coffee shop have a message: “Wolverines: Let’s Vote Early.”
So Jade Gray bristles a bit at this hypothetical: What if Kamala Harris comes up just short in battleground Michigan?
“If she comes up short in Michigan, I don’t think it’s because of young voters,” said Gray, a former co-president of the University of Michigan College Democrats who graduated in May. “I think it’s probably because we waited too long to make a switch of the candidate.”
Voters aged 18-29 are a vital piece of the Democratic coalition. They were crucial to Joe Biden’s 2020 Michigan win and in the dramatic state-level gains the party made in 2022. But young voters’ level of support is a big question for 2024 because of anger and disappointment with how the Biden-Harris administration has handled the Israel-Hamas conflict.
“I don’t think there is any blame to put on young people or people of color or Muslim voters in this election cycle, and I quite frankly don’t really want to hear about that,” Gray said in an interview. “I think that you got to put that on campaigns, and you have to put that on the elected officials that are running for office. I sure hope she doesn’t come up short in Michigan, because I don’t really want to be talking to people about how young people should have done more when I feel like we’re doing a lot.”
The conversation with Gray and Anushka Jalisatgi, also co-president of the College Democrats last school year, was our third in 11 months. Both are part of a CNN project, called All Over the Map, designed to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in battleground states and are part of crucial voting blocs.
In the two prior conversations, both said Biden’s age was a concern for many young voters who felt little connection to the octogenarian president. Now, with Harris as the Democratic nominee, the energy and enthusiasm difference is obvious.
Gray now works as a digital organizer for a progressive group.
“I have noticed a significant shift in activity, across the board,” Gray said.
Jalisatgi is back on campus as a first-year law student, and just switched her voter registration to Michigan.
“A lot of my out-of-state friends are switching their registration to Michigan because it is a battleground state,” Jalisatgi said.
And while Gray and Jalisatgi have moved on, the College Democrats are in high gear for election crunch time. A Harris campaign official stopped by a meeting during our latest visit and a crowded room of students spent time phone banking after getting a pep talk from the state’s Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer.
“The work that you are doing is so important and I am energized by what I see happening with all these Dem clubs on campuses. You are kicking a**. So, we just got to keep rolling through,” Whitmer said over a video link.
Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell stopped by in person, and warned against overconfidence.
“I’m going to look you all in the eye and tell you, neither candidate is winning in Michigan right now.”
No encampment on campus, but tensions still high over Israel-Hamas conflict
The almost everywhere-you-look focus on registration and early voting at the Ann Arbor campus is remarkable.
One registration table we stopped by on our latest visit was in a familiar spot: on the same campus path where students last semester built an encampment to air their grievances at Israel, at the Biden administration and at school officials they were pushing to divest from companies that do business with Israel.
The school will not allow a new encampment, so it is harder to gauge how much the raw anger of last semester has carried over to the new school year – and into voting decisions.
“A lot of that energy, because it can’t happen in a physical space – it’s still occupying a lot of online space,” Gray said.
Jalisatgi sees it directed less at Harris and more at university officials.
“People still very much care that this is ongoing and that the university is complicit in contributing to it,” Jalisatgi said. “I’m seeing universities putting out a lot of new free speech guidelines, new regulations for how they want to curb free speech or how they want to regulate it.”
The Ann Arbor College Republicans would not let CNN into a meeting they held during our recent visit.
Member Max Scheske, a junior, said attendance and energy are up some as the election draws close. But he also said the group was pretty evenly divided when it comes to enthusiasm for Donald Trump.
“We certainly do have our, you know, ‘Trump is basically Jesus’ wing of the club,” Scheske said. “But we do have a very sizeable, you know, very critical of Trump.”
Scheske describes himself as libertarian and Trump as a populist. “So, he is kind of hit or miss with me,” Scheske said.
There are Harris yard signs and posters and placards all around Ann Arbor. Signs of Trump support are much harder to find. On campus, Scheske said Trump’s unequivocal support for Israel makes it harder to win over Democrats critical of the Biden-Harris administration’s defense of the Jewish state.
“If it was up to me, he would not have been the Republican nominee,” Scheske said.
‘We feel a sense of betrayal’
The biggest risk for Harris is that young voters stay home, skip the presidential line on the ballot, or vote third party.
In May, Wayne State student Summer Matkin was leaning third party. Biden was the Democratic nominee then, and she had concerns both about his age and the Israel-Hamas conflict.
Now, she calls Harris “the safest option” even though she is frustrated the bloodshed in the Middle East continues.
There were signs of trouble for Harris, though, when we stopped by a meeting of the Wayne State Syrian Students Association.
The roughly 20 students in the room did not want to be quoted by name or have their faces captured on camera. But when asked if they would have a hard time voting for Harris, nearly every hand in the room went up.
Likewise, Wahbeh Nuseibeh, a 26-year-old Wayne State student, said he would not vote for Harris in 2024 after voting for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020.
“We feel a sense of betrayal,” said Nuseibeh, who is Palestinian.
“I’m not voting for Kamala Harris. I cannot in good conscience,” he said. In his view, his tax dollars pay for bombs shipped to Israel “to kill my friends and family overseas.”
Nuseibeh will likely choose a third-party option.
“Donald Trump is a threat to our democracy and a threat to our society,” he said in an interview at a Yemeni coffee shop in majority Arab American Dearborn just outside Detroit.
Maya Siegmann will cast her vote for Harris, though she found the vice president’s debate answers far too vague.
“She didn’t directly answer most of the questions and seemed to go around them or could not give a real answer,” Siegmann said. “And when the topic of the Israel-Hamas war came up, there wasn’t really a solid response as to how she would solve it.”
Siegmann is active in the Hillel campus Jewish organization at Wayne State and just got back from a summer in Israel. There, she said, she was asked a lot about public opinion in the United States.
“The response was basically that the propaganda war, the social media war, the news war that Hamas and Israel are fighting, Hamas is winning right now,” Siegmann said.
Last year was tense on campus and as both the October 7 anniversary of Hamas’ attack on Israel and then the US election draw near, Siegmann said she is mindful that emotions could get high again. She is a proud Jew and fervent supporter of Israel, but she is also critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his conduct of the war.
But she says such nuance can get quickly lost when passions get high.
“I worry that when it does come up, because we have different classes, like policy classes, that it will be an argument and less a discussion.”
The campus has a large Arab and Muslim population, and Siegmann said this semester she is making more of an effort to get to know classmates better.
“These are people I am going to be with until I complete my degree or degrees,” she said. “So I want to kind of form that solid groundwork so that I can build off that.”",2024-10-02
CNN,Supreme Court rules Pennsylvania may count back-up votes when mail ballots are rejected | CNN Politics,"The US Supreme Court on Friday left in place a Pennsylvania court ruling that is expected to expand options for voters whose mail-in ballots are rejected for technical reasons to have their votes counted, in a defeat for Republicans in a critical battleground state.
There were no noted dissents.
For Pennsylvania voters who made a mistake in how they prepared their mail-in ballots, it could ensure they have a backup option to have a provisional ballot counted.
It’s unclear how many Pennsylvania voters will benefit because not every county notifies voters of defective mail ballots. But both sides in the appeal before the Supreme Court characterized the dispute as affecting potentially “thousands” of votes at a minimum.
Conservative Justice Samuel Alito wrote a brief statement – which was joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch – essentially arguing that the court couldn’t give the Republicans who brought the appeal what they had sought even if it wanted to.
The case, Alito wrote, “is a matter of considerable importance.” But, he wrote, “even if we agreed with the applicants’ federal constitutional argument (a question on which I express no view at this time), we could not prevent the consequences they fear.”
Republicans had asked the Supreme Court in an emergency appeal this week to block a state court ruling that allowed provisional ballots to be counted in cases where voters failed to enclose them in “secrecy” sleeves before mailing them in.
Though the case was technically limited to two voters in a single county, the Republican National Committee had framed the dispute as having much wider implications, asking the court to either pause the lower court’s ruling or, alternatively, to segregate the ballots at issue statewide.
Ari Savitzky, senior staff attorney at the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project, which had represented the voters, called the ruling a “win for democracy and the rule of law.”
“The court rightly rejected this eleventh-hour attempt to discount the votes of Pennsylvanians and interfere in the state’s electoral process. The bottom line is that voters deserve to have their voices heard,” he said.
Following the ruling, Republican National Committee spokesperson Claire Zunk told CNN in a statement, “While we are disappointed in the Supreme Court’s ruling, we have secured three major victories for election integrity in Pennsylvania just this week: we won extended early voting in Bucks County; we won signature verification and observer access in Erie County; and we won - for the fifth time - the dated ballot case in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.”
The high court’s decision came on the heels of another order on Wednesday in which a conservative majority allowed Virginia to purge an estimated 1,600 voters from its registration rolls. Republicans said those registrants were self-identified noncitizens. Voting rights groups said at least some eligible US citizens were ensnared. The Virginia order drew sharp criticism from voting and immigrant rights groups in part because the court offered no explanation for its decision.
‘Naked’ and other defective mail-in ballots
The initial lawsuit was focused on sleeveless, so-called “naked ballots.” But both the ACLU and the RNC suggested in their briefs that the case could affect other types of defective mail-in ballots, such as those missing required signatures and dates on the envelope.
Different counties in Pennsylvania have different procedures for dealing with defective mail ballots, some more forgiving than others. That patchwork of rules makes it difficult to say with certainty how many ballots were at stake in the case. In its appeal, the RNC said the case could potentially affect “tens of thousands of votes in a state which many anticipate could be decisive.” In its response, the ACLU said “potentially thousands” of ballots were in play.
Four years ago, President Joe Biden beat former President Donald Trump in Pennsylvania by more than 80,000 votes. Polls indicate that, this year, Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are in a dead heat.
The suit was filed by two voters in Butler County who submitted mail-in ballots but failed to enclose those ballots in the secrecy sleeve before placing them in an outer mailing envelope. A machine scanner identified the problem and the voters received an automated message alerting them that their vote would not be counted.
The voters showed up at their precincts during the state’s primary election and attempted to cast provisional ballots but learned those votes would also not be counted. County election officials said state law barred them from voting because they had already submitted a mail-in ballot, even though that ballot was defective.
Pennsylvania’s top court sided with the voters, ruling that election officials were correct to toss the mail-in ballots but “erred in refusing to count” the provisional ballots. Pennsylvania law, the state’s high court ruled, requires provisional ballots “be counted if there were no other ballots attributable to the electors. There were none.”
Republicans told the US Supreme Court that Pennsylvania’s courts usurped power reserved to the state legislature by allowing voters to cast provisional ballots after their mail-in ballots were tossed out. That’s because state law bars election officials from counting a provisional ballot if a mail-in ballot is “timely received by a county board of elections.”
“That,” Republicans told the Supreme Court, “should be the end of the case.”
But Democrats who intervened in the case, voting rights groups and state and county election officials said that reading of the law would lead to the “absurd” result that some residents could be blocked from casting a vote because of a technical error – despite the fact that the state had in a place a provisional ballot system that was intended to serve as a backup.
Just under the surface of the Pennsylvania dispute were several broader legal fights dealing with when the Supreme Court can intervene in a state election fight – questions that could have nationwide implications.
The RNC had argued that Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court violated the so-called Purcell principle, which generally warns courts against getting involved in last-minute election disputes over state law. But the voting rights groups noted the Supreme Court had previously framed Purcell as a check on federal – not state – courts.
Also at issue was whether the Supreme Court had the power to review the case at all, given that it involved a state court reviewing state law. The RNC relied on an untested legal theory that the US Constitution gives state legislatures vast power to set election rules without oversight from state courts. The Supreme Court declined to take up that theory in a 2023 decision involving North Carolina’s redistricting, but it also didn’t close the door on reviewing state court decisions about state law if they “transgress the ordinary bounds of judicial review.”
Chief Justice John Roberts didn’t explain in his opinion in that case what those words mean. The RNC appeal appeared to be at least in part an effort to test the limits of the definition of “ordinary bounds.”

CNN,A Gen Z pop star kicked off Harris’ campaign. Puerto Rican musicians may bring her to the finish line | CNN Politics,"In September, Latin music superstar Nicky Jam appeared onstage with Donald Trump. Donning a red MAGA hat, the reggaeton singer told a Las Vegas rally that he was supporting the former president.
On Tuesday, he withdrew his endorsement – joining a chorus of famous Puerto Ricans who have condemned comments made by a comedian at Trump’s New York City rally earlier this week assailing the US island territory.
“Puerto Rico should be respected,” Nicky Jam told his 43 million Instagram followers.
While Jam didn’t endorse Harris in his post, Jennifer Lopez, Ricky Martin, Marc Anthony, reggaeton star Don Omar, “Despacito” singer Luis Fonsi and global superstar Bad Bunny are among the celebrities of Puerto Rican descent who have shown support for the vice president or her platform since Sunday. Lopez is also participating in a rally alongside Harris in Las Vegas on Thursday.
Harris campaign officials had always planned for star-studded events in the homestretch of the presidential election. But the influx of Latino artists denouncing Trump and showing up for Harris with voting already underway is the October surprise that the campaign didn’t see coming.
Together, those stars have a combined 390 million global followers on Instagram alone – more than the US population.
In a razor-thin race, celebrity support can move the needle, experts say, especially among a demographic with which polls have shown Trump closing the gap with Harris – Latino men – and especially at a time when both campaigns are vying for the Puerto Rican vote in battleground Pennsylvania, where there’s a sizable portion of Latino voters.
The Trump campaign has sought to distance itself from Hinchcliffe, with campaign spokesperson Danielle Alvarez saying in a statement after the rally, “This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign.”
Unexpected support
The support from Bad Bunny – born Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio – came as a surprise to the Harris team, according to a campaign official.
Harris campaign officials had been in talks with Bad Bunny’s team and were cautiously optimistic he would back the vice president’s plans for Puerto Rico, according to a source familiar with discussions, but they didn’t expect him to weigh in Sunday, sharing on his social media a video of Harris’ plans for the island.
Bad Bunny has not generally weighed in on politics. A representative for the star told CNN that his repost of Harris’ video on Instagram was “not an endorsement” but that he is “supporting” the vice president because “Benito’s political focus has always been on Puerto Rico.”
For months, an endorsement from Bad Bunny had been at the top of the Harris campaign’s wish list, due to his influence on young male Latino voters, according to another source familiar with the campaign’s Hollywood outreach.
“They are cultural validators,” said one source close to the campaign, adding that actions from Latino artists garner coverage in Spanish media and help open discussions among the Latino community.
Another source described Latino celebrities weighing in for Harris as another way for the campaign to break through among Latinos at a time when polls suggest waning enthusiasm.
Harris pollster Matt Barreto, who focuses on Latino voters, argued that endorsements can help mobilize voters.
“Any sort of celebrity, influencer, famous person has the ability to attract attention and attract eyeballs,” Barreto said. “That, by itself, is a big positive. These are people who are recognized. To some extent, they are trusted.”
While celebrities alone get attention for name recognition, Barreto argued that voters need a reason to listen to them. That, he said, is one reason Sunday’s inflammatory comments about Puerto Rico has resulted in a snowball effect that has reached Latinos nationwide.
“This was all natural, and it helped amplify what the average person on the street was feeling,” he said.
“This is a very unique moment that will be talked about after the campaign and after the election for a long time. It is so much more powerful than the Latino community and, in any community, when you have celebrities and influencers and everyday people all reacting in real time similarly to such an offense,” he added.
A Hollywood political strategist who has been working with many A-listers this election cycle agrees that authenticity is key, especially as the reach of celebrities and is evolving.
“A few years ago, celebrities took the approach of more is more. That’s not it. You have to focus on the right people in the right places and align the people with the right issues and the right message,” the strategist said. “Followers need to believe it.”
Both campaigns utilize the power of celebrity
Ever since Harris’ campaign kicked off with Charli XCX’s lime green stamp of approval, Hollywood’s influence has been in the spotlight.
The British pop star’s “kamala IS brat” endorsement catapulted Harris into Gen Z territory at the very start of her campaign this summer, validating her candidacy among legions of young voters and turning the vice president into a pop culture meme icon.
Charli XCX’s endorsement came as a surprise to the Harris campaign, but it leaned in hard, flooding TikTok with lime green, coconut tree emojis and music from another Gen Z pop star, Chappell Roan, in an effort to reach younger voters.
Taylor Swift’s September endorsement of Harris, moments after the presidential debate, also came as a surprise to the vice president’s campaign. Both Harris and Trump swiftly pounced on the “Swiftie” fanbase, showcasing the pop superstar’s immense reach: The Harris campaign created Harris-Walz friendship bracelets inspired by the singer, while the Trump campaign released Eras Tour-inspired T-shirts.
The list of celebrities and musicians backing Harris has only grown – ranging from music legends Stevie Wonder and Bruce Springsteen, who have performed at Harris events in Georgia, to the stars of Marvel’s “Avengers” movies, who backed the vice president on social media Thursday.
And as Election Day nears, the Harris campaign is bringing in more A-listers to mobilize people to vote, including a long-anticipated appearance by Beyoncé last week.
“We’ll use all the tools at our disposal,” a senior campaign official previously told CNN.
Trump later mocked his opponent for having a “dance party with Beyoncé,” suggesting that Harris was more focused on celebrities than on everyday Americans.
But the former president, too, is enlisting celebrity support during this critical time. On Wednesday night, hall of fame Packers quarterback Brett Favre returned to Green Bay, Wisconsin, to join Trump’s latest rally. TV psychologist Dr. Phil McGraw delivered remarks at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday, as did tech magnate Elon Musk.
As CNN previously reported, a recent Harvard study found that celebrity endorsements do play an influential role in promoting civic participation.
As voters get out to the polls, a wide range of stars have made recent endorsements. Some have been predictable like Oscar winner and longtime environmental activist Leonardo DiCaprio, who spoke about Harris’ commitment to climate change and said that Trump “continues to deny the facts.” Others have been more surprising, like Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former Republican governor of California who announced his support for Harris, calling Trump “unpatriotic.”
“I don’t really do endorsements. I’m not shy about sharing my views, but I hate politics and don’t trust most politicians,” Schwarzenegger wrote Wednesday on X. “I will always be an American before I am a Republican.”
Representatives for Schwarzenegger did not respond to CNN’s request for comment on whether his post came organically or was done in coordination with the Harris campaign.
A celebrity publicist told CNN that, like the past two elections, many of his left-leaning clients have been driven to take a stance against Trump, even more so than to show support for another candidate.
“A lot of it has been driven by Trump. When it comes down to it, do you all want Trump to be the president or not? That’s a very motivating thing,” the publicist said. “The Trump phenomenon is far more powerful as an organizer than most things.”
But on the other side of the aisle, Trump has more public celebrity supporters than ever before.
His longtime Hollywood fans include Jon Voight, Kelsey Grammer and Roseanne Barr, and country singers such as Jason Aldean and John Rich are also backing him. But this year, actors, including Dennis Quaid, Zachary Levi and Mel Gibson, have publicly endorsed Trump, as have athletes such as Mike Tyson and Kansas City Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker, and astronaut Buzz Aldrin.
Trump has been unique in his multifaceted celebrity approach, targeting hugely popular social media stars and podcasters, who arguably wield more influence than most Hollywood celebrities. His hour-and-a-half livestream with 24-year-old gamer Adin Ross garnered millions more eyeballs than any traditional news network could, as did his recent conversation with podcaster Joe Rogan, which currently has more than 40 million views.
“I wouldn’t over-index celebrities, but in a really close election in certain states and districts where elections are going to be won by less than 500 voters, you want to play all of your cards,” the Hollywood political strategist said.

CNN,Sen. Bob Menendez pleads not guilty to charge alleging he conspired to act as a foreign agent of Egypt | CNN Politics,"Sen. Bob Menendez pleaded not guilty in federal court Monday to a charge alleging he conspired to act as a foreign agent of Egypt.
The New Jersey Democrat personally entered his plea before district Judge Sidney H. Stein.
Menendez, his wife Nadine Arslanian Menendez, and three other co-defendants were indicted last month on corruption-related offenses and are accused of accepting “hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes” in exchange for the senator’s influence. Menendez and the others pleaded not guilty to those charges. A trial date has been set for May.
In a statement released by his office after his arraignment, Menendez dismissed the charge “as outrageous as it is absurd.”
“I have been, throughout my life, loyal to only one country — the United States of America, the land my family chose to live in democracy and freedom,” he said, adding later: “I will not litigate this case through the press, but have made it abundantly clear that I have done nothing wrong and once all the facts are presented will be found innocent.”
The additional charge unveiled early this month in a superseding indictment filed against Menendez, who was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at the time of the alleged actions, adds a new dimension to the case by alleging a US senator was working on behalf of another country.
Prosecutors allege Nadine Menendez and businessman Wael Hana failed to register as agents working on behalf of Egypt and conspired to have the senator act on behalf of Egypt. Nadine Menendez and Hana both pleaded not guilty to the superseding indictment last week.
Menendez stepped down as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee last month when he was initially charged but has rejected calls to resign as New Jersey’s senior senator.
It is illegal for a member of Congress or any public official to act as foreign agent.
The senator stressed his loyalty to the US in a statement earlier this month, arguing that the new charge goes against his “long record of standing up for human rights and democracy in Egypt and in challenging leaders of that country.”
The new charge carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. Menendez and his wife are now facing as much as 50 years in prison if convicted.

CNN,In pictures: Trump running mate JD Vance | CNN Politics,"Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump’s vice presidential pick, formally accepted the nomination in July during his keynote speech at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.
“Tonight is a night of hope — a celebration of what America once was and, with God’s grace, what it will soon be again,” Vance said.
Vance was announced as Trump’s running mate earlier in the week. The 40-year-old is in his first term as a senator from Ohio.
The venture capitalist and author of the best-selling memoir “Hillbilly Elegy” was elected in 2022 after receiving a boost from Trump in a contentious Republican primary.
It was a reversal from just six years earlier. Vance was a key voice in the “Never Trump” movement during the 2016 election and has a well-documented history of opposing Trump publicly. But he earned Trump’s endorsement in 2022 after a concerted yearlong effort to embrace a new image as a leading MAGA proponent.",2024-07-15
CNN,"Conservative justices suggest South Carolina GOP gerrymandering was based on politics, not race | CNN Politics","The Supreme Court’s conservatives expressed doubt at oral arguments Wednesday that South Carolina GOP lawmakers engaged in impermissible racial gerrymandering when they redrew congressional lines for a House seat to benefit Republicans.
The case is one of several racial and political gerrymandering-related lawsuits that could impact which party controls the House after next year’s congressional elections.
The district at issue was reworked in 2020 to benefit the GOP and current incumbent, Rep. Nancy Mace – one of the eight Republicans who voted to oust Kevin McCarthy as House speaker last week.
The South Carolina State Conference of the NAACP and a Black voter named Taiwan Scott say the use of race dominated the decision-making process and that the state worked to intentionally dilute the power of Black voters. A federal court agreed, referring to the revised map as “bleaching.”
Several of the conservative justices on Wednesday suggested that map drawers had taken politics into consideration, not race.
Chief Justice John Roberts said those challenging the map had “no direct” evidence that race had predominated in the decisionmaking process. He said that there were no “odd-shaped” districts drawn and that there existed a “wealth of political data” that would justify the chosen boundaries. He said the challengers had only presented “circumstantial evidence” and suggested the court would be “breaking new ground” in its voting jurisprudence if it were to side with them.
Justice Samuel Alito repeatedly suggested that a lower court had made serious legal error in invalidating the map by relying upon erroneous expert testimony. He said the Supreme Court could not “rubber-stamp” the district court’s finding and he noted that the individual charged with drawing the maps had years of experience and had worked for both Democrats and Republicans.
Alito contended that there was “nothing suspicious” if a map drawer is aware of race as long as it is not a predominant factor when drawing lines.
Justice Neil Gorsuch said there was “no evidence ” that the legislature could have achieved its “partisan tile in any other way.”
For their part, the liberals on the court suggested that the Republican-controlled South Carolina Legislature adopted the maps by considering race as a predominant factor, in violation of the equal protection clause of the US Constitution.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor said that Republicans were launching “pot shots” at the experts who claimed the maps could only be explained by race. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson noted that the challengers are not required to produce a “smoking gun” to prove their point.
The dispute comes as the justices this year ordered Alabama to redraw its congressional map to account for the states’ 27% Black voting population. That decision, penned by Roberts, came as a welcome relief to liberals who feared that the court was poised to make it harder for minorities to challenge maps under Section 2 of the historic Voting Rights Act. A federal court approved a new map last week that significantly boosts the Black population in a second district, which could lead to the pickup of a Democratic seat next year.
The South Carolina case raises different questions rooted in the Constitution concerning when a state crosses the line between permissible partisan goals and illegal racial discrimination.
The state chapter of the NAACP and Scott are challenging the state’s 1st Congressional District, located along the southeastern coast and anchored in Charleston County. Although the district consistently elected Republicans from 1980 to 2016, in 2018 a Democrat was elected in a political upset.
Two years later a Republican candidate, Mace, regained the seat in a close race. When the state House and Senate began considering congressional reapportionment in 2021, the Republican majorities sought to create a stronger GOP tilt in the district, one of seven in the state. A new map could make the seat more competitive.
After an eight-day trial featuring 42 witnesses and 652 exhibits, a three-judge district court panel in January held that District 1 amounted to an unconstitutional racial gerrymander in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment because race was the predominant factor in the district’s reapportionment plan.
“To achieve a target of 17% African American population,” the court said, “Charleston County was racially gerrymandered and over 30,000 African Americans were removed from their home district.” The court referred at one point to the “bleaching” of Black voters out of the Charleston County portion of the district.
“State legislators are free to consider a broad array of factors in the design of a legislative district, including partisanship, but they may not use race as a predominant factor and may not use partisanship as a proxy for race,” the court concluded.
South Carolina Republicans, led by state Senate President Thomas Alexander, appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, arguing that the maps had not been drawn impermissibly based on race, but instead with politics in mind.
The person who devised the map testified in federal court that he was instructed to make the district “more Republican leaning,” but that he did not consider race while drawing the lines. He did, however, acknowledge that he examined racial data after drafting each version and that the Black voting-age population of the district was viewed during the drafting process.
“If left uncorrected, the panel’s holding would place States in an impossible bind by exposing them to potential racial gerrymandering liability whenever they decline to make majority-white, modestly-majority Republican districts majority-Democratic,” argued John Gore, a lawyer for the Republicans.
Mace filed a friend-of-the-court brief with the high court in support of the Republicans, charging that the lower court “ignored one of the most important traditional districting principles – the preservation of the core of existing districts.”
Joined by other GOP members of Congress from South Carolina, Mace argued that constituent services, voter education and the seniority of long-serving members of the House are “vital interests” and that the lower court was “bent on destroying the legislatures’ duly enacted and carefully negotiated map.”
Lawyers for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund told the justices in court papers that the state impermissibly used race as a predominant factor when drawing the district.
“Using race as the predominant means to sort voters is unconstitutional even if done for partisan goals,” they argued.
They said the lower court made clear that the state “intentionally exiled more than 30,000 Black Charlestonians from CD1 predominately because of their race.”

CNN,"CNN Polls: Harris has a narrow edge in Michigan and Wisconsin, while she and Trump remain tied in Pennsylvania | CNN Politics","Vice President Kamala Harris maintains a narrow advantage in two of the three “blue wall” states that collectively represent her clearest path to an Electoral College victory over former President Donald Trump, according to new CNN polls conducted by SSRS.
In Michigan, Harris holds a lead over Trump by 48% to 43% among likely voters. Harris also leads Trump in Wisconsin, where 51% support her to 45% for Trump. But the race is tied in Pennsylvania (both with 48% support), the largest electoral prize of the three states and a central piece of either candidate’s hopes of winning the White House. All three states broke in Trump’s favor in 2016, but President Joe Biden won them in 2020.
Of the seven states rated as tossups by CNN, Michigan and Wisconsin are the only two where voters’ ballots still include Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. – the former independent candidate who suspended his bid for the presidency and threw his support behind Trump. In Michigan, Kennedy holds 3% support, and he stands at 1% in Wisconsin. Support for third-party and independent candidates overall runs highest in Michigan, with 6% of likely voters there saying they back a candidate other than Harris or Trump.
There is less support for independent and third-party candidates among those likely voters who express the highest motivation to turn out. Among those likely voters who say they’re extremely motivated to vote in Michigan, 51% support Harris to 45% for Trump. In Wisconsin, they break 52% Harris to 47% Trump, and in Pennsylvania, they divide 50% for Harris to 47% for Trump.
The overall results are nearly identical to the last round of CNN polling in these three states, conducted in late summer, when Harris led Trump by 50% to 44% in Wisconsin and 48% to 43% in Michigan, with Harris and Trump tied at 47% in Pennsylvania.
The vast majority of blue wall state voters have locked in their choices. Just 8% of likely voters in Pennsylvania, 7% in Michigan and 6% in Wisconsin say they haven’t made a choice or could change their minds before Election Day.
Harris runs much closer to Trump on trust to handle the economy and further ahead of him on handling democracy in both Michigan and Wisconsin, where she also holds wider advantages on key attributes than in Pennsylvania, differences that help to explain her stronger showing in the upper Midwest states.
Her deficit against Trump on trust to handle the economy – a perennial top election issue and a Trump strength throughout the 2024 campaign – is more modest in those states: Just 4 points separate the two in Michigan and 3 points in Wisconsin, differences that are within each poll’s margin of sampling error. By contrast, Harris trails Trump by 8 points on the issue in Pennsylvania. Harris also holds an 8-point advantage over Trump on trust to protect democracy in Michigan and Wisconsin, compared with a narrow 4-point margin in Pennsylvania.
Likely voters in Michigan and Wisconsin also give Harris a relatively broad advantage on perceptions that she’s more honest and trustworthy: She leads Trump on this attribute by 17 points in Wisconsin and 16 points in Michigan, compared to a 7-point margin in Pennsylvania. And those voters in Michigan and Wisconsin also say that Harris is the candidate more likely to put the country’s interest above her own: Wisconsin likely voters say that by a 10-point margin and Michigan likely voters do by an 8-point margin. In Pennsylvania, that’s an issue where likely voters are about evenly split (46% Harris to 45% Trump).
These voters in Michigan and Wisconsin are more likely than those in Pennsylvania to say Harris cares about people like them, by 9 points in the upper Midwest states compared with just a 3-point difference in Pennsylvania.
In each of the three states, the percentage of likely voters who say they’re backing Harris is higher than the percentage who say she shares their vision for the US, while Trump’s overall support tracks more closely with his standing on this question. That could suggest that some voters are backing Harris less out of enthusiasm for her platform than out of concerns about Trump’s character.
Across Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, a majority of voters who say that leadership traits outweigh issues in their votes are backing Harris. And in each state, roughly 4 in 10 of her supporters say they’re voting more to oppose Trump than to support her, higher than the share of Trump voters who say they’re casting their vote predominantly in opposition to Harris.
Harris’ narrow leads in Michigan and Wisconsin are driven in part by relatively strong performance among White voters and White voters without college degrees, two groups which traditionally break Republican. White voters in both states split almost evenly (48% Trump to 44% Harris in Michigan, and 48% each in Wisconsin, which has a larger White population than the other two states). Trump’s margin among White voters without college degrees in those two states state lags behind his margin with the same group in Pennsylvania (Trump leads 54% to 37% in Michigan, 54% to 43% in Wisconsin and 61% to 34% in Pennsylvania).
Harris holds a wider lead among Black voters in Michigan (83% Harris to 12% Trump) than she does in Pennsylvania (76% Harris to 21% Trump). She has significant advantages with likely voters who hold college degrees across all three states (59% to 36% in Wisconsin, 56% to 36% in Michigan and 59% to 37% in Pennsylvania).
The tighter race in Pennsylvania is reflected across urban and rural voters within the state: Harris’ lead among likely voters who say they live in an urban area in Pennsylvania (53% to 38%) is much smaller than in Michigan (61% to 31%) or Wisconsin (70% to 28%), while Trump’s lead among rural likely voters is highest in the Keystone State (68% to 30%, compared with 61% to 31% in Wisconsin and 56% to 35% in Michigan).
Suburban likely voters, though, break broadly for Harris in all three states (55% to 40% in Pennsylvania, 52% to 40% in Michigan and 51% to 45% in Wisconsin). The suburban vote represents about half of likely voters in Pennsylvania, compared to 37% in Michigan and 28% in Wisconsin.
All three states feature competitive Senate races in seats Democrats are defending. The polls find close races for all three. Michigan Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin tops Republican former Rep. Mike Rogers 48% to 42% among likely voters. Pennsylvania’s Democratic Sen. Bob Casey holds 48% support to Republican Dave McCormick’s 45% in a race with no clear leader. And in Wisconsin, there also is no clear leader in the Senate race, with Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin holding 49% support to Republican Eric Hovde’s 47%.
Compared to Southern and Western battlegrounds, the blue wall states have less of a history of voting early or by-mail, and only about a third or fewer voters across these three say they have already cast ballots. In Michigan, 36% of likely voters say they’ve either mailed in a ballot or voted early, with Wisconsin at 34% and Pennsylvania at 26%. This is the first presidential election in which Michigan has held in-person early voting, and turnout soared in the first few days of statewide early voting over the weekend.
Those who say they have already cast ballots are included in each poll’s group of likely voters, and across all three states they break heavily in Harris’ favor (61% to 35% in Michigan, 60% to 38% in Wisconsin and 57% to 40% in Pennsylvania). Should those Pennsylvania numbers hold, they would reflect a significant shift in Trump’s favor compared with by-mail ballots cast in the 2020 election: Biden carried 76% of those votes to Trump’s 23%, according to the state’s election results.
Three-quarters or more of likely voters in each of the three states polled say they’re at least somewhat confident that the votes in their state will be accurately cast and counted in this year’s election. A near-universal 95% or more of Harris supporters in each state express confidence, compared with roughly 6 in 10 Trump supporters in each state.
Interviews were conducted October 23-28, 2024, online and by telephone with registered voters, including 726 voters in Michigan, 819 in Pennsylvania and 736 in Wisconsin. Likely voters include all registered voters in the poll weighted for their predicted likelihood of voting in this year’s election. Results among likely voters in Michigan and Pennsylvania have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.7 percentage points; it is 4.8 points among likely voters in Wisconsin.",2024-10-30
CNN,LeBron James endorses Kamala Harris in presidential race against Trump | CNN Politics,"Basketball superstar LeBron James threw his support behind Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential bid Thursday evening, emphasizing that “the choice is clear” just days ahead of Election Day.
Sharing a video with clips of offensive remarks from former President Donald Trump, the Los Angeles Lakers player said in a post on X: “What are we even talking about here?? When I think about my kids and my family and how they will grow up, the choice is clear to me. VOTE KAMALA HARRIS!!!”
The video featured soundbites of Trump’s disparaging rhetoric over the years, including the former president warning that the country would end up “like Detroit” if Harris is elected and saying that undocumented immigrants are “poisoning the blood of our country.” The video concluded with written words: “Hate takes us back.”
James’ post marks the latest high-profile endorsement of Harris, who has received support from Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Bad Bunny and Arnold Schwarzenegger, among other celebrities.
James has previously backed Democratic candidates, including endorsing Hillary Clinton in 2016, and was an outspoken critic of Trump during his time in office.
James famously calling the then-president a “bum” for uninviting fellow basketball player Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors from visiting the White House. In 2020, he also brushed off Trump’s criticism of athletes who took a knee during the national anthem ahead of games following the killing of George Floyd. He instead told at the time voters to “see what leadership that we have at the top of our country” and urged them to head to the polls.
James was also actively involved in the last presidential election, founding More Than A Vote — a voting rights organization focused on combatting voter suppression — along with other athletes. The organization then recruited several thousand poll workers in primarily Black electoral districts and helped Floridians struggling to pay off outstanding fees and fines associated with their felony convictions so they could register to vote.
Following President Joe Biden’s victory in 2020, which James celebrated, his organization focused on the wave of GOP-led bills aimed at restricting voter access and launched a campaign to mobilize Black voters in off-year and municipal elections.
Ahead of Election Day, the Harris and Trump campaigns are utilizing the star power of celebrities. Retired NFL quarterback Brett Favre campaigned with Trump in Wisconsin on Wednesday while the vice president’s Friday rally in Milwaukee will feature rappers Cardi B, GloRilla and Flo Milli.",2024-10-31
CNN,Analysis: What happens if there’s a tie in 2024? Be ready for a ‘contingent election’ | CNN Politics,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.
When Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suspended his presidential campaign, he did it in the most complicated way.
Get your head around this: Kennedy will take himself off the ballot in certain key states, but he is encouraging supporters to vote for him in safe red and blue states so that he can feature in a “contingent election” if former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris tie.
In the battleground states, Kennedy said he’s supporting Trump.
Could Kennedy actually feature in a “contingent election?” Short answer: No. He could not take part unless he won electoral votes, something that does not seem to be mathematically possible. Perhaps he’s envisioning an elector going rogue and supporting him in defiance of voters, but Kennedy did not share details of his thinking.
For the facts about contingent elections, read on.
With two presidential candidates fighting over a mere 538 Electoral College votes, a tie scenario is more than possible. It’s actually kind of surprising there has only been one tied election so far, in 1800, between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr.
That tie was the result of a failure of coordination by Democratic-Republicans, but it led to the nation’s first “contingent election,” decided in the House of Representatives.
Could a tie actually happen this year?
Yes. While a tie is not a likely outcome, it is something to be ready for. Here is one plausible scenario for the 2024 election:
If Harris wins Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada and a single electoral vote in Nebraska, all of which Joe Biden won in 2020, but she loses Pennsylvania and Georgia, there’s a tie, 269-269.
The website 270 to Win also has more tied-election scenarios.
Unlike every other state, Maine and Nebraska award two electors to the statewide winner and one to the winner of each congressional district. Those individual, competitive electoral votes in Maine and Nebraska become hugely consequential in potential tie scenarios.
Make your own 269-269 scenario with CNN’s interactive election map.
What happens if there’s a tie?
If there’s a 269-269 tie, or if a third party or independent candidate wins electoral votes and keeps a candidate from reaching an Electoral College majority of 270, the next step is the same. It’s called a “contingent election.”
According to the 12th Amendment, enacted in the wake of that divisive 1800 election, if no candidate gets a majority of the Electoral College votes, the new Congress, which would have just been sworn in on January 3, chooses the president. The Senate would choose the vice president.
When would a ‘contingent election’ occur?
According to an analysis by the Congressional Research Service, a contingent election would occur on January 6, immediately after members of Congress met to count electoral votes and determined that no candidate had a majority.
There is a lot of information from that CRS report in this story. While it dates back to 2017, it’s still a valuable resource.
How would the process work?
The nation would clearly be divided. Lawmakers could be torn between supporting their preferred candidate and the one their state’s voters preferred.
In a contingent election, the House selects the president and the Senate selects the vice president. House members can only choose from among the top three finishers in the Electoral College for president, and senators can choose from among the top two finishers for vice president. Kennedy would presumably need to win electoral votes – win a state or a congressional district in Nebraska or Maine – in order to be an option in a contingent election. There’s no chance of that happening at the moment.
Rather than voting as individuals, each state delegation in the House would get one vote, although how the state delegations select their preferred candidate is not spelled out. A simple majority, 26 state delegation votes, would appoint the new president.
If state delegations in the House did not select a president by Inauguration Day, January 20, the new vice president selected by the Senate would become temporary president. It is possible the Senate could select a vice president when the House is deadlocked, because in the Senate each senator would get one vote.
If the Senate had not selected a vice president by January 20, the presidential succession plan in the 20th Amendment temporarily takes effect. First in line after the vice president is the speaker of the House, currently Mike Johnson, although it could be a different Republican or a Democrat if Democrats win a majority in the House this November.
Does either side have an advantage?
If the Electoral College already benefits smaller and more rural states, the contingent election process – in which each state, regardless of population, has an equal vote – gives them a huge advantage.
California and Texas get the same say as Delaware and Wyoming in a contingent election. Plus, Washington, DC, which gets three votes in the Electoral College, would be cut out of the contingent election.
There’s nothing to require state delegations to honor the winner of their state’s vote. And in closely divided states, the results in single seats, perhaps determined by gerrymandered congressional maps, could swing a delegation’s vote.
Heading into the 2024 election, Republican lawmakers held a majority in 26 states, compared with Democrats, who held the majority in 22, with ties in Minnesota and North Carolina. Republicans in North Carolina have changed the state’s congressional map, however, and it is likely to have a majority-Republican congressional delegation in January. Republicans are likely to maintain their advantage next year, especially if voters are so split that they deliver a national tie at the top of the ticket.
In Arizona, for instance, who is to say that a potential majority of Republican members of Congress would vote for the Democratic candidate, even if Harris pulled out a narrow win there? Would Alaska’s Democratic member of Congress, assuming she wins reelection, vote for the Democrat for president even though her state is likely to go for Trump in November?
Why does this bizarre tie-break system exist?
It’s actually meant to be an improvement. The way the Electoral College was first assembled, electors voted for two candidates. Whoever got the most votes was president and whoever got the second-most votes was vice president.
By the time political parties were forming – Federalists and Democratic-Republicans in 1800 – electors needed to coordinate to cast more votes for their presidential pick than their vice presidential pick.
In the 1800 election, a rematch of 1796, Jefferson’s Democratic-Republicans beat incumbent President and Federalist John Adams.
But the Democratic-Republicans were poorly coordinated or bad at counting and foolishly cast equal numbers of votes for their presidential pick, Jefferson, and his running mate, Burr.
Out of pique, when the early version of the contingent election rolled around, the Federalists, who still controlled the House at that time, backed Burr. Despite the intervention of Alexander Hamilton, a noted Federalist, it took 36 rounds of voting to finally elect Jefferson.
By 1804, the 12th Amendment was being ratified.
Has a contingent election happened in the years since the tied election of 1800?
Yes. In 1824, multiple candidates got votes in the Electoral College but none of them received a majority, triggering a contingent election.
Amazingly, from today’s perspective, all of the candidates who got Electoral College votes that year were from the same Democratic-Republican political party, although they were split into regional sects.
Andrew Jackson won 40% of the popular vote and got the most votes in the Electoral College with 99 of the 131 needed for victory. But the House ultimately picked his top rival, John Quincy Adams, whose father lost that 1800 election.
Jackson would have his revenge with a victory four years later, and John Quincy Adams would round out his career as the only former president to be elected to Congress, the body that made him president.
Another contingent election occurred with the 1836 race, but just for vice president. Virginia’s electors did not like Robert M. Johnson, the running mate of election winner Martin Van Buren, and withheld their votes for him in the Electoral College. The Senate later elevated Johnson to the vice presidency in a contingent election.
What about the disputed election of 1876?
In 1876, when there was a contested outcome, the contingent election system was bypassed.
That year, at the height of Reconstruction, the issue was not that no person got a majority in the Electoral College, but rather that three Southern states – Florida, Louisiana and South Carolina – sent multiple slates of electoral votes to Washington, DC, after the state elections were disputed. And in Oregon, there was a dispute over one elector.
Congress created a special bipartisan commission, with one more Republican than Democrats, to determine which candidate should get the 20 disputed electoral votes. They ultimately gave the votes to Republican Rutherford B. Hayes even though Democrat Samuel Tilden got more popular votes.
Hayes then largely ended Reconstruction, perhaps as part of a secret deal that gave him the White House.

CNN,Florida asks Supreme Court to allow its anti-drag law to take effect | CNN Politics,"Florida’s attorney general on Tuesday asked the US Supreme Court to allow a law that a federal court judge says amounts to a crackdown on drag shows to go back into effect while legal challenges play out.
Attorney General Ashley Moody said the law – dubbed the state’s “Protection of Children Act” – was designed to “prevent the exposure of children to sexually explicit live performances.” The 2023 law makes it a misdemeanor to knowingly admit a child to an sexually explicit adult live performance that would be obscene for the “the age of the child present.”
The district court judge blocked the law pending appeal, holding it likely violated free speech and due process protections and that it was unconstitutionally vague. The 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals declined Florida’s emergency application for a stay of the district court’s injunction, triggering the state’s ask to the Supreme Court for relief.
The law was originally challenged by a popular Orlando restaurant – Hamburger Mary’s – that hosts drag brunches and claimed that the new legislation resulted in a loss of business.
Florida asked the justices to scale back the state-wide injunction so that it would only apply to the restaurant. “Florida is now unable to enforce its statue at all, to the detriment of Florida’s children and the State’s sovereign prerogative to protect them from harm,” Moody argued.
Moody additionally said that Hamburger Mary’s is not impacted by the law because its shows are not sexually explicit.
The law was a priority for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is running for the 2024 Republican nomination for president.
The governor, upon signing the law in May, said that the state “is proud to lead the way in standing up for our children.”
“As the world goes mad, Florida represents a refuge of sanity and a citadel of normalcy,” he said in a statement at the time.
The justices are expected to ask for a response from the restaurant before issuing an order.",2023-10-24
CNN,Promises Donald Trump has made so far in his campaign for a second term,"Promises Donald Trump has made so far in his campaign for a second term
Editor's Note: CNN's What Matters newsletter connects the dots of the ever-changing political landscape. Click here to sign up for free.
Since launching his third bid for the White House, former President Donald Trump has insisted on the campaign trail that life was better under his administration, and he has vowed to reverse many of the policies enacted since he left office. His successor's sweeping climate change agenda, new restrictions on guns and protections for transgender people would all be on the chopping block, he has said.
In rolling back the calendar to before January 2021, Trump also wants to pick up where his administration left off on many of his first-term priorities, and his ideas will sound familiar to anyone who paid attention to his first campaign eight years ago. He has said he plans to finish building the wall between the US and Mexico that he first promised in 2016, remove all undocumented individuals, implement more tariffs on imports and increase American energy production.
His quest to pick up new support has also led him to dangle promises to specific audiences, including proposing in Las Vegas to eliminate income taxes on tipped wages. He has also floated ambitious but vague ideas to position America for the future by embracing flying cars, promoting cryptocurrency and promising to build 10 new ""Freedom Cities.”
But an urge for vengeance is also coursing through Trump's bid to return to Washington, and he is plotting retribution against the systems, institutions and people he believes have wronged him. He and his allies have suggested Trump in a second term could unleash the Justice Department on his political enemies, purge the federal government of disloyal bureaucrats and consolidate power in the executive branch.
In this election, Trump faces Vice President Kamala Harris, who became the Democratic nominee after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. (See Harris’ campaign promises here.)
Economy
Trump has promised to extend the cuts from his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, notably the TCJA’s individual income tax breaks. The former president has also talked about reducing the corporate tax rate to 15%, from 21% – but only for companies that make their products in the US.
“I will make the Trump tax cuts the largest tax cut in history,” the former president said earlier this year at the Black Conservative Federation’s Honors Gala in South Carolina. “We’ll make it permanent and give you a new economic boom.”
I will make the Trump tax cuts the largest tax cut in history.”
In September, Trump said he would push for legislation that would end taxes on overtime pay.
“That gives people more of an incentive to work,"" Trump said at a rally in Arizona. ""It gives the companies a lot, it’s a lot easier to get the people.”
This summer, during a campaign stop in Las Vegas, Trump also pledged to end taxes on tips, a move targeted to appeal to hundreds of thousands of people working in the city.
The former president has also promised to stop taxing Social Security benefits. He has yet to outline a proposal to replace the lost revenue, which could harm the popular entitlement program, as well as Medicare and the federal budget.
He has also proposed a government efficiency commission as a way to reduce government spending and announced that Tesla CEO Elon Musk has agreed to lead it. The commission will “develop an action plan to totally eliminate fraud and improper payments within six months,” Trump said in September remarks at the Economic Club of New York.
The former president has also announced plans to get rid of the $10,000 limit on state and local tax, or SALT, deductions that he signed into law as part of his 2017 tax cuts. Reversing this cap would largely affect higher-income people in high-tax blue states who itemize their deductions.
In an early October speech, Trump promised to make the interest paid on car loans fully tax deductible. He also vowed in an October video to end the double taxation on Americans who live abroad. This move could stop some Americans living abroad from having to pay taxes to both the US and to the country where they live. He has not provided details on how such relief would work.
Trump has also pledged to repeal Biden’s tax hikes, “immediately tackle” inflation and end what he called Biden’s “war” on American energy production. He has promised to rescind all unspent funds from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which put in place a wide array of climate measures and funneled about $80 billion over 10 years to the Internal Revenue Service.
In an effort to address housing affordability, Trump has floated a ban on mortgages for undocumented immigrants, claiming that they push up housing costs. CNN has reported that undocumented immigrants, however, make up a tiny portion of the mortgage market.
To help “working Americans” catch up on credit card debt, Trump promised in September to temporarily cap interest rates on credit cards at 10%. The average credit card rate is just under 21%, while the average rate on retail store cards is a record high 30.45%.
At a late October rally in New York City's Madison Square Garden, he also said he would support a tax credit for family caregivers. He has not outlined details about who would be eligible, how large it would be and whether the cost would be covered.
Trade
In February, Trump pledged to impose “stiff penalties on China and other trade abusers.”
“It’s called you screw us, and we screw you,” Trump said at a South Carolina rally.
Under his proposed “Trump Reciprocal Trade Act,” the former president said if other countries impose tariffs on the US, the country would impose “a reciprocal, identical” tariff right back.
It was the same pledge Trump made in a campaign video in 2023: to impose the same tariffs that other countries may impose on the US on those countries. The goal, the former president said then, is to get other countries to drop their tariffs.
It’s called you screw us, and we screw you.”
As part of a larger strategy to bring jobs back into the US, Trump also said he would implement his so-called “America First” trade agenda if elected. By setting universal baseline tariffs on a majority of foreign goods, the former president said Americans would see taxes decrease as tariffs increase. His proposal also includes a four-year plan to phase out all Chinese imports of essential goods and stop China from buying up America and US companies from investing in China.
Trump also said in February that he would consider imposing a tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports if he’s reelected. He has also called for adding a tariff of at least 10% on all imports from all countries. At an August campaign event in North Carolina, he suggested that the across-the-board tariff could be as high as 20%.
In September, Trump floated a 100% or 200% tariff on cars made in Mexico. He claimed this would stop Chinese companies from building auto plants in Mexico as a way to avoid US tariffs, which he could impose by executive action.
Trump has also repeatedly expressed interest in ending the federal income tax, pointing to the late 19th century, when the US relied on tariffs to fund federal spending.
“When we were a smart country, in the 1890s … this is when the country was relatively the richest it ever was. It had all tariffs. It didn’t have an income tax,” Trump said in late October.
Earlier in October, Trump announced that if he wins the White House again, he would invoke the six-year renegotiation provision of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which was signed into law in January 2020 as a replacement for NAFTA.
The former president has particularly focused on China, vowing in a January 2023 campaign video to restrict Chinese ownership of US infrastructure such as energy, technology, telecommunications and natural resources. Trump also said he would force the Chinese to sell current holdings that may put national security at risk. “Economic security is national security,” he said.
Immigration
Trump has made immigration and the border a central campaign issue, successfully pressuring Republicans to reject a major bipartisan border deal earlier this year and making a trip to the southern border in February, where he touted his previous hard-line immigration policies.
In a Des Moines Register op-ed published roughly a week before winning the Iowa caucuses in January, Trump vowed to use the “Alien Enemies Act to remove known or suspected gang members, drug dealers, or cartel members from the United States.”
“We will shift massive portions of federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement — including parts of the DEA, ATF, FBI, and DHS,” he wrote.
In a video posted on Truth Social in late February before his border visit, Trump also promised to “carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history.”
We will shift massive portions of federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement — including parts of the DEA, ATF, FBI, and DHS.”
In October, Trump said he would use the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to create a federal program to expedite the removal of undocumented gang members if he’s reelected. He also warned that ""if they come back into our country, they will be told it is an automatic 10-year sentence in jail with no possibility of parole.” CNN has reported that Immigration and Customs Enforcement already deports individuals who pose a national security or public safety threat once ordered removed by an immigration judge.
Later that month, Trump promised to create a “compensation fund” for victims of crimes committed by migrants by using assets seized from gangs and drug cartels.
Also in October, during a rally in Arizona, Trump promised to hire 10,000 new Border Patrol agents, provide a 10% salary raise and offer a $10,000 retention and signing bonus. His comments came months after Senate Republicans, at his urging, blocked a bipartisan border measure that would have cleared the way for more Border Patrol agents.
Separately, this summer, Trump proposed “automatically” giving green cards to foreign nationals who graduate from US colleges — comments that break from his efforts to curb both legal and illegal immigration while in office.
After the Israel-Hamas war began last October, Trump also promised to terminate the visas of “Hamas’ sympathizers.”
“We’ll get them off our college campuses, out of our cities and get them the hell out of our country, if that’s OK with you,” he added.
Drug cartels
The former president has also made waging “war” on drug cartels a priority for his second term. If elected, Trump said in his November 2022 campaign announcement that he would ask Congress to ensure that drug smugglers and human traffickers can receive the death penalty for their “heinous acts.”
Trump also vowed to “take down” drug cartels by imposing naval embargos on cartels, cutting off cartels’ access to global financial systems and using special forces within the Department of Defense to damage the cartels’ leadership.
At an August campaign event in Arizona, Trump also vowed to impose a “10-year mandatory minimum sentence for anyone guilty of human smuggling, a guaranteed life sentence for anyone guilty of child trafficking, and a death penalty for anyone guilty of child or woman sex trafficking.”
Education
Trump announced plans in a September 2023 campaign video to close the Department of Education and send “all education and education work and needs back to the states.”
“We want them to run the education of our children, because they’ll do a much better job of it,” he added.
The former president has also promised to “put parents back in charge and give them the final say” in education. In a January 2023 campaign video, the former president said he would give funding preferences and “favorable treatment” to schools that allow parents to elect principals, abolish teacher tenure for K-12 teachers, use merit pay to incentivize quality teaching and cut the number of school administrators, such as those overseeing diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.
We want them to run the education of our children, because they’ll do a much better job of it.”
Trump reaffirmed plans to close the Education Department in a conversation on X with Musk in August, during which the tech billionaire proposed the commission to look for ways to cut government spending.
“This is where I need an Elon Musk. I need somebody that has a lot of strength and courage and smarts. I want to close up the Department of Education, move education back to the states,” Trump said.
Trump also said in that 2023 campaign video that he would cut funding for schools that teach critical race theory and gender ideology. In a later speech, Trump said he would bring back the 1776 Commission, which was launched in his previous administration to “teach our values and promote our history and our traditions to our children.”
The former president said he would charge the Department of Justice and the Department of Education with investigating civil rights violations of race-based discrimination in schools while also removing “Marxists” from the Department of Education. A second Trump administration would pursue violations in schools of both the Constitution’s Establishment and Free Exercise clauses, which prohibit the government establishment of religion and protect a citizen’s right to practice their own religion, he said.
Trump has also promised to fund free online classes with funds seized from private university endowments.
Health care
Last November, Trump promised to replace the Affordable Care Act, known colloquially as Obamacare, in a series of posts on Truth Social. A Trump-backed effort to repeal and replace Obamacare failed in 2017 after three Republicans senators joined with Democrats to vote against the bill.
“Getting much better Healthcare than Obamacare for the American people will be a priority of the Trump Administration,” he said.
“It is not a matter of cost, it is a matter of HEALTH. America will have one of the best Healthcare Plans anywhere in the world. Right now it has one of the WORST!,” he continued. He also doubled down on his vow during a speech in early January. But when asked during September’s debate with Harris about whether he has a plan to replace Obamacare, he replied, “I have concepts of a plan.”
Getting much better Healthcare than Obamacare for the American people will be a priority of the Trump Administration.”
Trump also vowed in a June 2023 campaign video to reinstate his previous executive order so that the US government would pay the same price for pharmaceuticals as other developed countries. Some of the former president’s pharmaceutical policies were overturned by Biden.
On the abortion issue, Trump said in April that he would not sign a federal abortion ban and has taken the position that laws should be decided by states.
“The states will determine by vote or legislation or perhaps both, and whatever they decide must be the law of the land,” Trump said in an April recording posted to his Truth Social platform.
Trump also said in May that he did not support banning birth control. He previously said that he was “looking at” contraceptives when asked if he supported restrictions.
In August, Trump announced plans to make either the government or insurance companies pay for in vitro fertilization treatments. He did not specify how the treatments would be paid for.
The former president also praised medical marijuana ahead of some states voting on the issue this fall. In a September social media post, he pledged that, if elected, he’d “continue to focus on research to unlock the medical uses of marijuana to a Schedule 3 drug, and work with Congress to pass common sense laws, including safe banking for state authorized companies, and supporting states rights to pass marijuana laws, like in Florida, that work so well for their citizens.”
In late October, Trump promised that he’d let Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has pushed vaccine conspiracy theories, “go wild on health,” suggesting his former political rival would take a role in his potential administration that would include policies related to food and medicine.
Gender care
“I will revoke every Biden policy promoting the chemical castration and sexual mutilation of our youth and ask Congress to send me a bill prohibiting child sexual mutilation in all 50 states,” Trump said at the 2023 Conservative Political Action Conference last March.
Trump added in a campaign video that he would issue an executive order instructing federal agencies to cut programs that promote gender transitions, as well as asking Congress to stop the use of federal dollars to promote and pay for gender-affirming procedures. The former president added that his administration would not allow hospitals and health care providers to meet the federal health and safety standards for Medicaid and Medicare if they provide chemical or physical gender-affirming care to youth.
Justice system
Trump has promised to use the Department of Justice to attack critics and former allies. In several videos and speeches, the former president also laid out plans to gut the current justice system by firing “radical Marxist prosecutors that are destroying America.”
“I will appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family,” Trump said in June 2023 remarks. “I will totally obliterate the Deep State.”
Trump said in a campaign video last year that he would reinstate a 2020 executive order to remove “rogue” bureaucrats and propose a constitutional amendment for term limits on members of Congress.
I will appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family.”
To address what he labeled the “disturbing” relationship between technology platforms and the government, the former president said in a January 2023 video that he would enact a seven-year cooling off period before employees at agencies such as the FBI or CIA can work for platforms that oversee mass user data.
Trump added in multiple campaign releases that he would task the Justice Department with investigating online censorship, ban federal agencies from “colluding” to censor citizens and suspend federal money to universities participating in “censorship-supporting activities.”
In a September 2023 speech at the Family Research Council’s Pray Vote Stand Summit in Washington, DC, Trump also touted plans to continue appointing conservative judges.
“I will once again appoint rock-solid conservative judges to do what they have to do in the mold of Justices Antonin Scalia; Samuel Alito, a great gentleman; and another great gentleman, Clarence Thomas,” he said.
Trump has also pledged to “appoint U.S. Attorneys who will be the polar opposite of the Soros District Attorneys and others that are being appointed throughout the United States.”
In a September 2023 speech in Washington, DC, Trump also announced that he would appoint a task force to review the cases of people he claimed had been “unjustly persecuted by the Biden administration.” Trump noted that he wanted to “study the situation very quickly, and sign their pardons or commutations on day one.”
It’s a move that could lead to potential pardons of many rioters from the January 6, 2021, insurrection – which he suggested he would do at a CNN town hall in May 2023.
At the Libertarian Convention in May, Trump also promised to release Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the online black market Silk Road who is serving a life sentence in prison for money laundering, drug trafficking and computer hacking. Trump declined to commute Ulbricht’s sentence during his presidency.
*Only promises on judge appointments and congressional term limits are similar to prior campaigns
Crime
Trump said in two February 2023 campaign videos that if “Marxist” prosecutors refuse to charge crimes and surrender “our cities to violent criminals,” he “will not hesitate to send in federal law enforcement to restore peace and public safety.”
Trump added that he would instruct the Department of Justice to open civil rights investigations into “radical left” prosecutors’ offices that engaged in racial enforcement of the law, encourage Congress to use their legal authority over Washington, DC, to restore “law and order” and overhaul federal standards of disciplining minors to address rising crimes like carjackings.
Addressing policies made in what Trump calls the “Democrats’ war on police,” the former president vowed in a campaign video that he would pass a “record investment” to hire and retrain police, strengthen protections like qualified immunity, increase penalties for assaulting law enforcement officers and deploy the National Guard when local law enforcement “refuses to act.”
The former president added that he would require law enforcement agencies that receive money from his funding investment or the Department of Justice to use “proven common sense” measures such as stop-and-frisk.
Foreign policy
Trump has continued his attacks against member countries of NATO, a European and North American defense alliance. At a South Carolina rally earlier this year, Trump said he would not abide by the alliance’s collective-defense clause and would encourage Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” if a member country didn’t meet spending guidelines.
“NATO was busted until I came along,” Trump said. “I said, ‘Everybody’s gonna pay.’ They said, ‘Well, if we don’t pay, are you still going to protect us?’ I said, ‘Absolutely not.’ They couldn’t believe the answer.”
The former president has also previously pledged to end the war in Ukraine, though he’s offered no details on how he would do so. “Shortly after I win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled,” Trump said at a New Hampshire campaign event last year, adding in another speech that it would take him “no longer than one day” to settle the war if elected.
NATO was busted until I came along. I said, ‘Everybody’s gonna pay.’ They said, ‘Well, if we don’t pay, are you still going to protect us?’ I said, ‘Absolutely not.’”
Trump further addressed his strategy of stopping the “never-ending wars” by vowing to remove “warmongers,” “frauds” and “failures in the senior ranks of our government,” and replace them with national security officials who would defend America’s interests. The former president added in a campaign video that he would stop lobbyists and government contractors from pushing senior military officials toward war.
In addition, Trump has said he would restore his “wonderful” travel ban on individuals from several majority-Muslim countries to “keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country” after Biden overturned the ban in 2021.
New cities and flying cars
Trump said in multiple campaign videos that he would spearhead an effort to build so-called “Freedom Cities” to “reopen the frontier, reignite American imagination, and give hundreds of thousands of young people and other people, all hardworking families, a new shot at home ownership and in fact, the American Dream.”
In his plan, the federal government would charter 10 new cities on federal land, awarding them to areas with the best development proposals. The former president said in a campaign video that the Freedom Cities would bring the return of US manufacturing, economic opportunity, new industries and affordable living.
In the March 2023 video, Trump added that the US under a second Trump administration would lead in efforts to “develop vertical-takeoff-and-landing vehicles for families and individuals,” not letting China lead “this revolution in air mobility.” The former president said these airborne vehicles would change commerce and bring wealth into rural communities.
Electric vehicles
Trump has promised to roll back new car pollution rules at the Environmental Protection Agency that could require electric vehicles to account for up to two-thirds of new cars sold in the US by 2032. Biden’s electrical vehicle-related policies, Trump claimed at a Michigan rally last September, “spell the death of the US auto industry.”
“On day one, I will terminate Joe Biden’s electrical vehicle mandate, and I will cancel every job-killing regulation that is crushing American autoworkers,” Trump added.
When pressed on whether he would keep Biden’s $7,500 tax credit for EV purchases, Trump told Reuters in late August, ""I'm not making any final decisions on it.”
""I'm a big fan of electric cars, but I'm a fan of gasoline-propelled cars, and also hybrids and whatever else happens to come along,"" he said.
Energy
Trump has promised to reduce energy prices by increasing domestic production. In several campaign appearances, he has laid out plans to end delays in federal drilling permits and leases.
“We’re going to ‘drill, baby, drill’ right away,” Trump told a crowd of supporters in Des Moines, Iowa, during a victory speech after winning the state’s Republican caucuses in January.
At a South Carolina rally in February, he pledged to remove limits on American natural gas exports.
The Washington Post has also reported that Trump, during an April meeting at Mar-a-Lago, pledged to roll back some of Biden’s climate policies if oil executives raised $1 billion for his campaign.
As for other energy sources, Trump has also changed his tune on the expansion of offshore wind farms, which he had touted at the start of his presidency as part of a broader push to “unleash the forces of economic innovation to more fully develop and explore our ocean economy.”
In May, Trump described wind farms as “horrible” and accused turbines of killing birds and whales, adding that he would “make sure that ends on day one.”
Trump has also promoted US cryptocurrency mining, an industry that has grown significantly more reliant on fossil fuels. Bitcoin mining is energy-intensive because servers require enormous amounts of power to solve a complex series of algorithms to verify transactions in order to receive the cryptocurrency as a reward.
At a cryptocurrency conference in July, the former president promised to make it easier for cryptocurrency mining companies to operate in the US.
“If crypto is going to define the future, I want it to be mined, minted and made in the USA,” Trump said, adding that he would create a “strategic national bitcoin stockpile.”
He also vowed to fire Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who has pushed to regulate the industry.
Second Amendment
“I will take Biden’s executive order directing the federal government to target the firearms industry, and I will rip it up and throw it out on day one,” Trump said at the 2023 National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action leadership forum last April.
The former president also promised in the speech that the government would not infringe on citizens’ Second Amendment rights. In May, he said would sign legislation forcing states to recognize a concealed carry permit from any jurisdiction.
Equity
“I will create a special team to rapidly review every action taken by federal agencies under Biden’s ‘equity’ agenda that will need to be reversed. We will reverse almost all of them,” Trump said in a campaign video.
Trump added in multiple campaign videos that he would revoke Biden’s equity executive order that required federal agencies to deliver equitable outcomes in policy and conduct equity training. If elected, Trump said he would also fire staffers hired to implement Biden’s policy, and then reinstate his 2020 executive order banning racial and sexual stereotyping in the federal government.",2024-11-01
CNN,Analysis: The electorate is changing. Here’s what that means for Trump and Harris. | CNN Politics,"There’s a reason Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are intensifying efforts to reach beyond their party’s traditional supporters in the final weeks of this razor-thin campaign.
Extending a pattern that stretches back decades, White voters without a college degree, the cornerstone of the modern GOP coalition, have declined by a little more than 2 percentage points as a share of eligible voters since 2020, falling below 40% of the eligible voting pool for the first time ever, according a new analysis of the latest Census Bureau data by demographer William Frey shared exclusively with CNN.
While those working-class Whites are shrinking, Frey found that both Whites with at least a four-year college degree and voters of color have each increased since 2020 by about a single percentage point as a share of eligible voters. Those increases also continue long-term trends that have seen well-educated Whites grow to represent more than 1-in-4 eligible voters and people of color rise past 1-in-3.
These trends help explain why the former president has devoted so much effort to reaching beyond his traditional base of White voters without a college education to attract more Black and Latino voters, especially men. And, in turn, the trends help explain the emphasis the vice president is placing on attracting more college-educated White voters who have previously leaned toward the GOP — a priority she underscored by barnstorming across populous white-collar suburbs outside Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee with GOP former Rep. Liz Cheney on Monday.
The impact of these incremental shifts in the composition of the major voter groups can easily be outweighed by changes in the preferences of those groups. Trump, for instance, is counting on gains among Latino voters, especially men, to neutralize the anticipated benefits for Democrats as Latinos increase their share of the vote, particularly in closely contested Arizona and Nevada.
But the cumulative impact of these shifts in the electorate’s basic composition is undeniable. Trump, for instance, in each of his two presidential campaigns won nearly as big a share of White voters without a college education as Ronald Reagan did in 1984, according to exit polls. Yet because those working-class Whites had fallen from about two-thirds of voters in 1984 to around two-fifths now, Trump only won about 47% of the total vote in each of his two campaigns, while Reagan captured nearly 59%.
Even this year, in a race so close, small shifts in the electorate’s composition across the most competitive states could make a difference. For instance, the fact that non-college Whites, according to Frey’s analysis, have fallen as a share of the eligible electorate since 2020 considerably more in Michigan and Wisconsin than in Pennsylvania may help explain why most analysts consider the Keystone State more difficult than the other two for Harris.
Shifts in racial and educational levels are not the only important changes Frey, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Brookings Metro think tank, has tracked in the make-up of eligible voters between 2020 and 2024. He also found that women will comprise nearly 52% of all eligible voters, which should help Harris. But his analysis shows that number actually represents a very small shift in the eligible electorate since 2020 toward men, which at the margin might benefit Trump. Frey also finds that Generation Z will make a big jump in their share of eligible voters, from about 1-in-10 last time to more than 1-in-6 this year. That increase underscores the stakes in Harris’ attempt to max out her support among younger women and Trump’s determined attempts to court young men.
Frey’s analysis finds that the White voters without a college degree are declining as a share of eligible voters not only in the nation overall but specifically across almost all of the seven battleground states. (North Carolina is the sole swing state where he found that they had increased as a portion of eligible voters since 2020.)
That decline is rooted in an ongoing process of generational replacement. Compared to younger generations, America’s older cohorts are much more heavily White and also much less likely to hold at least a four-year college degree. As those older Whites age out of the electorate, and more diverse and better-educated generations grow into it, the composition of the eligible voter pool inexorably transforms.
“Whites are a shrinking part of the population and a part of that population which is shrinking even more are the people who don’t have college education,” said Frey.
While these blue-collar Whites are receding in both the Rustbelt and Sunbelt electorates, different kinds of voters are replacing them across the two regions, Frey found.
These blue-collar Whites represent a much larger share of the total electorate in the Rustbelt than the Sunbelt: Frey found that in 2020 they comprised around half of eligible voters in both Michigan and Pennsylvania and nearly three-fifths in Wisconsin.
But Frey found that since 2020, they have declined more rapidly than almost anywhere else in Michigan (falling by nearly 3 percentage points) and Wisconsin (dropping by more than 3 percentage points). In Michigan, he found a slight increase in minority voters among the eligible voter pool, while in Wisconsin those non-White voters, who were already a smaller share of eligibles than in the other Rustbelt battlegrounds, actually declined even further.
In both states, the big gainers since 2020 are Whites with at least a four-year college degree: Frey found they increased more than 2 percentage points as a share of eligible voters in Michigan and over 4 points in Wisconsin.
In Pennsylvania, the shift isn’t as dramatic: Frey found that the non-college White share of eligible voters dropped since 2020 by about 1.5 percentage points, about half as much as in the other two former “blue wall” states. A small increase in the minority population made up most of that difference, with college-educated Whites increasing only very slightly.
Across the Sunbelt battlegrounds, blue-collar Whites are a smaller share of the eligible voters: about 1-in-3 in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada and just over 2-in-5 in North Carolina. Arizona and Georgia saw big increases since 2020 in the minority share of their eligible voter population, Frey found, while non-Whites actually declined somewhat in North Carolina and remained almost unchanged in Nevada. College-educated Whites increased as a portion of eligible voters in Nevada and Arizona, while falling slightly in Georgia and essentially holding steady in North Carolina.
After these shifts, the minority share of the eligible voting population will remain much higher in the Sunbelt than Rustbelt states, with voters of color representing about one-third of the eligible voter population in North Carolina, a little more than two-fifths in Arizona and more than 45% in both Nevada and Georgia.
In both the Rustbelt and Sunbelt, the winning modern demographic formula for Democrats since the 1990s has been to maximize their support among non-White voters and grow their support among college-educated Whites, while holding down their losses among the blue-collar Whites, with a particular focus on women in each group. In the Trump era, the dominant GOP demographic strategy has been to maximize their support among working-class voters without a college degree, particularly men. That strategy has broadened from a nearly exclusive focus on White working-class voters in Trump’s 2016 race to his more panoramic attempt this year to attract non-college-educated Black and Latino voters as well, especially men.
Manuel Pastor, director of the Equity Research Institute at the University of Southern California, says the contrasting strategies of Harris and Trump in the campaign’s final days illuminate “the task of reinvention that each party faces” as a result of the electorate’s ongoing racial and educational reconfiguration.
Trump, Pastor notes, has responded to the relentless increase in the electorate’s diversity by stressing “really a more male-leaning, masculine approach that is helping to make inroads with Latino males and, to a lesser extent, Black males.” (Trump is devoting a comparable effort to courting younger White men, especially those without college degrees, appearing on podcasts and other media sources where they congregate.)
And while Harris is expending enormous defensive effort on holding as many Latino and especially Black men as possible, she’s also accepting the shifting composition of the party’s coalition more explicitly than President Joe Biden did in 2020 and throughout his presidency, Pastor believes.
Biden, he notes, embodied an almost nostalgic desire to hold onto the Democrats’ mid-20th century base of White working-class voters, but Harris, the daughter of two academics herself, has leaned more comfortably into the party’s modern identity as a coalition primarily of often economically struggling minorities and more comfortable college-educated suburbanites.
“Where Democrats have made inroads is with college-educated Whites who are offended by Trump’s language around immigrants, around his dalliance with right-wing neo-fascist groups and language, with the threats around ‘the enemy within’ — all of the stuff Harris is trying to make sure to get into the conversation” in these final days, Pastor said.
Patrick Ruffini, a Republican pollster who specializes in demographic trends, said the offsetting gains of Democrats with well-educated Whites and Trump with blue-collar non-Whites should be understand as inextricably linked components of the same dynamic. “Trump doing better among working class minorities is a function of Democrats doing better among college educated voters,” Ruffini, the author of the recent book “Party of the People” about the shifting GOP coalition, wrote in an email. “As the electorate polarizes on education, the nonwhite working class will not be immune from these trends and will gravitate towards Trump more than your standard issue Republican. I think he is broadening the coalition, not necessarily with a lot of intentional effort, but because of natural dynamics in the electorate,” he added.
Democrats need to remain at least competitive among working-class White voters, particularly in the Rustbelt battlegrounds, where historically they have been able to win a significantly higher percentage of them than in the South (where far more of those voters are staunchly conservative evangelical Christians). But anywhere in the country, the most realistic goal for Democrats among these working-class Whites — especially against Trump’s formidable appeal to them — is to hold down their losses.
The groups that Harris needs to give her winning margins are the non-White and college-educated White voters (especially women in each case). The fact that both of those groups are increasing in the electorate, while Trump’s best cohort is shrinking, may give Harris a small swell in her sails. “The growing parts of the population are leaning Democrat, even in this time” when so many voters are discontented with conditions in the country, Frey said. The fact that women are likely to cast more ballots than men in all the swing states, he believes, will provide a small lift to Harris as well.
But many analysts point out these demographic changes can easily be overcome if Trump can reduce the Democratic margins among the groups she’s likely to win, or expand his own lead among his best groups. For instance, the fact that members of Gen Z are growing in the electorate should benefit Harris, given that Democrats have won big majorities among young people in every election since 2004, the first when millennials entered the electorate in large numbers. But while Harris is posting huge advantages among Gen Z women, Trump may somewhat blunt the impact of this generational transition if he can run as well among Gen Z men as polls show is now possible.
Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute and author of the recent book “The Politics of Gen Z,” says almost everything about Trump’s messaging on cultural, racial and gender issues profoundly alienates the vast majority of Gen Z women. “I think Gen Z women, including White women, are very committed to an inclusive democracy,” she said.
But while young men may not entirely endorse Trump’s most vituperative and vitriolic messages about racial and cultural change either, she said, they are less likely to find such statements disqualifying amid their concerns about their economic prospects. (Among younger generations, far more women than men are earning four-year and post-graduate college degrees.) Some younger men may also find Trump’s swaggering persona attractive, she noted, viewing him almost as an “anti-hero.”
“For young people in general, there are huge amounts of economic anxiety,” Deckman said. “But I think the difference is that Gen Z women are more likely to prioritize social issues whereas Gen Z men tend to vote more on pocketbook issues.”
These cross-currents among the electorate’s youngest cohort underscores a larger point: At such a fluid moment in US politics, the shift in the electorate’s composition doesn’t so much portend the result of this year’s election as define the assignments that each side faces in attempting to assemble a winning coalition.
One other factor is critical to any discussion of how demographic change may influence the balance of power between the two parties this year. The composition of the actual voters who turn up on Election Day is shaped not only by the share of eligible voters each group represents, but also, of course, by their turnout rates.
College-educated White voters consistently turn out at much higher rates than any other group. In the 2020 election, nearly 9-in-10 eligible White adults with at least a four-year college degree voted, compared to just under 2-in-3 Whites without a college degree and about 3-in-5 non-White voters, according to calculations from Census data provided to me by Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political scientist who studies voter participation.
As a result, the college-educated Whites tend to comprise a slightly larger share of the actual than eligible electorate while the relationship is reversed for the other two groups. Analyzing Census data, Frey and McDonald both found that in 2020 college-educated Whites cast just over 3-in-10 votes, while people of color cast just below 3-in-10. The White voters without a college degree remained the electorate’s largest group, but they cast slightly less than 40% of all votes — the first time they had fallen below that threshold among actual voters. (Census data indicates that these blue-collar Whites fell below a majority of the nation’s electorate for the first time in 2008, when Barack Obama was elected the nation’s first Black president.)
A similar pattern is evident along gender lines. Eligible female voters have turned out at a higher rate than eligible male voters in every election since 1980, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. (Before that, men voted at higher rates than women.) That gap can be substantial: using Census data, Frey has calculated that in the presidential elections since 2004, turnout among eligible women has always exceeded the rate among men by at least 3.3 percentage points, reaching as much as 4 points in some cases.
As a result, according to Frey’s analysis of Census data, in all of the seven swing states, women in 2020 comprised a larger share of actual than eligible voters. They represented about 52% of actual voters last time in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Nevada, 54% in North Carolina and around 55% in both Arizona and Georgia, he found. (Nationwide, Frey’s analysis of Census data showed women casting 53% of all ballots, slightly more than their 52% share of the eligible electorate.) One rule of thumb among Democrats is that they usually triumph when they win women by at least as large a margin as Republicans win men; these data indicate Harris could survive even if Trump wins men by slightly more.
Young people, of course, consistently turn out at much lower rates than older voters, even though their participation has trended upward in the Trump era. Potentially worrisome for Trump is that the gender gap in turnout rates is even greater for young women and men than it is among the older generations, the Rutgers Center has found. Younger non-White men, who have expressed the most receptivity to Trump in minority communities, have an especially meager turnout record.
Other sources of data about the composition of the electorate in 2020 paint slightly different pictures than the Census data Frey uses. The Pew Research Center’s validated voters study put Whites without a college degree at 42% of all voters, while the analysis by Catalist, a Democratic targeting firm, figured them at 44%. Each of those analyses placed both the college-educated Whites and non-Whites just a tick lower than the Census data. Pew, the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN, and the AP/VoteCast project with NORC found that women represented just a slightly smaller share of all voters last time than the Census did; Catalist concluded they represented even more.
Still, all these data sources agree on the same basic pattern over the differing periods that they cover. Consistently they find Whites without a college degree shrinking as a share of actual voters at a rate of about 2 percentage points every four years, with non-Whites posting the greatest gains and college-educated Whites increasing more slowly, though also steadily growing. And they agree that women now consistently cast the majority of votes in presidential elections.
No one, of course, can entirely predict how many voters from each of these groups will turn out this year. But this history clearly shows it is likely that the changes in the composition of the eligible electorate Frey has documented will closely track the shifts in the configuration of the actual electorate. Most of the experts I spoke with believe it’s a good bet that, just as with the eligible population, Whites without a college degree will continue to shrink as a share of actual voters by about 2 percentage points, while people of color and college-educated Whites will each slightly rise.
These glacial shifts in the nature of the American electorate typically leave their mark over decades, rather than from election to election. But this may be a butterfly effect election where even the smallest flutter in the environment could tip the balance between two political coalitions that are utterly antithetical in their vision for America’s future, but also almost exactly equal in size.",2024-10-22
CNN,Jennifer Lopez says ‘every Latino in this country’ offended by Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally | CNN Politics,"Jennifer Lopez, campaigning with Kamala Harris on Thursday in Nevada, said Donald Trump’s campaign had offended “every Latino in this country” with his Sunday rally at Madison Square Garden, where a comedian mocked Puerto Rico.
The pop star and actress’ comments at Harris’ rally in Las Vegas came as outrage continues to reverberate over the pro-Trump comedian calling the US island territory of Puerto Rico — where Lopez’s parents were born — a “floating island of garbage.”
“At Madison Square Garden, he reminded us who he really is and how he really feels,” Lopez said of Trump. “It wasn’t just Puerto Ricans who were offended that day, OK? It was every Latino in this country, it was humanity and anyone of decent character.”
Harris’ stop in Las Vegas with Lopez came during a swing through the hotly contested Western battlegrounds of Arizona and Nevada — where CNN polls released earlier this week showed exceedingly close races with no clear leader.
The vice president has deployed a growing list of celebrities and musicians with huge social media followings in the race’s closing days, as her campaign seeks to turn out key constituencies — including Black voters in Georgia and Latinos out West. That list ranges from music legends Stevie Wonder and Bruce Springsteen, who have performed at Harris events in Georgia, to the stars of Marvel’s “Avengers” movies, who backed the vice president on social media Thursday.
But the most impactful support might come from Puerto Rican stars like Lopez, who have grown more vocal since Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally.
“This is our country, too,” Lopez said Thursday night.
At one point, she fought back tears.
“You know what? We should be emotional. We should be upset. We should be scared and outraged. We should. Our pain matters. We matter,” Lopez said. “Your voice and your vote matters.”
Other Puerto Rican celebrities have also been critical of Trump in recent days.
Bad Bunny, one of the world’s biggest Latin music stars, shared Harris’ platform for Puerto Rico on social media on Sunday. And reggaeton star Nicky Jam, who had previously appeared onstage with Trump, withdrew his endorsement of the former president, saying, “Puerto Rico should be respected.”
Trump has long sought to make inroads with Black and Latino men. In the critical swing state of Pennsylvania, in particular, a sizable portion of the rapidly growing Latino population is of Puerto Rican heritage.
Harris’ campaign on Thursday launched a Spanish-language ad, aimed at reaching Latino voters, that highlighted comedian Tony Hinchcliffe’s remark at the Trump rally.
“Puerto Rico is an island of scientists, poets, educators, stars and heroes,” the narrator of the ad says in Spanish. “We’re not trash, we’re more.”
The Trump campaign has sought to distance itself from Hinchcliffe, with Trump campaign spokesperson Danielle Alvarez saying in a statement after the rally, “This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign.”
And Trump’s campaign has sought to turn attention to another “garbage” remark — pointing to President Joe Biden’s comment on Tuesday night that many interpreted as referring to Trump supporters as “garbage.” (The White House and Biden quickly tried to clean up the comment, saying that the president was referring to “supporter’s,” as in the comedian, and the rhetoric at the Madison Square Garden rally.)
Harris, in Las Vegas, said Trump is “all about hate and division.” She said if he is elected again, he would reinstate a policy that led to migrant families being separated at the US-Mexico border.
Lopez repeatedly said Harris “gets it” — and said she understands what it means for immigrant families to chase the American dream, because her parents were also immigrants.
She also said she believes “in the power of women.”
“Women have the power to make the difference in this election,” Lopez said.
The singer’s comments came the same day Harris seized on Trump’s remark in Wisconsin the night before that he will protect women, “whether the women like it or not.” He said he would protect them “from migrants coming in” and “from foreign countries with missiles and lots of other things.”
The vice president told reporters on Thursday that Trump’s comment is “very offensive to women, in terms of not understanding their agency, their authority, their right and their ability to make decisions about their own lives, including their own bodies.”
She pointed to Trump’s appointment of three conservative Supreme Court justices who helped undo Roe v. Wade’s national abortion rights protections. Trump said earlier this month he would veto a national abortion ban, but has waffled on the issue in the past, and many Republican-led states have imposed their own restrictive laws.
Polls show this year’s election could see a historic gender gap, with a majority of men backing Trump and women supporting Harris — a reality that helps explain Harris’ emphasis on an issue that has proven potent with voters, particularly women, since the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision.
As she campaigned in Reno, Nevada, on Thursday, Harris again raised Trump’s remarks, which she called “outrageous.”
“This is someone who simply does not respect the freedom of women or the intelligence of women to make decisions about their own lives,” she said.

CNN,Lawsuit to block Trump from Colorado 2024 ballot survives more legal challenges | CNN Politics,"A judge has rejected three more attempts by former President Donald Trump and the Colorado GOP to shut down a lawsuit seeking to block him from the 2024 presidential ballot in the state based on the 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist ban.”
The flurry of rulings late Friday from Colorado District Judge Sarah Wallace are a blow to Trump, who faces candidacy challenges in multiple states stemming from his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection. He still has a pending motion to throw out the Colorado lawsuit, but the case now appears on track for an unprecedented trial this month.
A post-Civil War provision of the 14th Amendment says US officials who take an oath to uphold the Constitution are disqualified from future office if they “engaged in insurrection” or have “given aid or comfort” to insurrectionists. But the Constitution does not spell out how to enforce the ban, and it has been applied only twice since the 1800s.
A liberal watchdog group called Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed the Colorado case on behalf of six Republican and unaffiliated voters. The judge is scheduled to preside over a trial beginning October 30 to decide a series of novel legal questions about how the 14th Amendment could apply to Trump.
In a 24-page ruling, Wallace rejected many of Trump’s arguments that the case was procedurally flawed and should be shut down. She said the key question of whether Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold has the power to block Trump from the ballot based on the 14th Amendment “is a pivotal issue and one best reserved for trial.”
Wallace also swatted away arguments from the Colorado GOP that state law gives the party, not election officials, ultimate say on which candidates appear on the ballot.
“If the Party, without any oversight, can choose its preferred candidate, then it could theoretically nominate anyone regardless of their age, citizenship, residency,” she wrote. “Such an interpretation is absurd; the Constitution and its requirements for eligibility are not suggestions, left to the political parties to determine at their sole discretion.”
Wallace also cited a 2012 opinion from Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, when he was a Denver-based appeals judge, which said states have the power to “exclude from the ballot candidates who are constitutionally prohibited from assuming office.” She cited this while rejecting Trump’s claim that Colorado’s ballot access laws don’t give state officials any authority to disqualify him based on federal constitutional considerations.
Trump already lost an earlier bid to throw out the case on free-speech grounds.
The current GOP front-runner, Trump denies wrongdoing regarding January 6 and has pleaded not guilty to state and federal charges stemming from his attempts to overturn the 2020 election. His campaign has said these lawsuits are pushing an “absurd conspiracy theory” and the challengers are “stretching the law beyond recognition.”
In a statement on Saturday, the Trump campaign criticized Wallace and her rulings, saying she “got it wrong.”
“She is going against the clear weight of legal authority. We are confident the rule of law will prevail, and this decision will be reversed – whether at the Colorado Supreme Court, or at the U.S. Supreme Court,” a Trump campaign spokesperson said. “To keep the leading candidate for President of the United States off the ballot is simply wrong and un-American.”
The 14th Amendment challenges in Colorado and other key states face an uphill climb, with many legal hurdles to clear before Trump would be disqualified from running for the presidency. Trump is sure to appeal any decision to strip him from the ballot, which means the Supreme Court and its conservative supermajority might get the final say.
In recent months, a growing and politically diverse array of legal scholars have thrown their support behind the idea that Trump is disqualified under the “insurrectionist ban.” The bipartisan House committee that investigated the January 6 attack recommended last year that Trump be barred from holding future office under the 14th Amendment.
The Colorado challengers recently revealed in a court filing that they want to depose Trump before trial. Trump opposes this request, and the judge hasn’t issued a ruling.",2023-10-21
CNN,"Fact check: Trump, on a lying spree, made at least 40 separate false claims in two Pennsylvania speeches | CNN Politics","Former President Donald Trump is on a lying spree.
As Election Day draws nearer, the Republican presidential nominee has made false claim after false claim on a dizzying variety of subjects. He has both come up with new falsehoods on pressing issues, most notably the federal response to Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton, and repeated old favorites about subjects he has been railing about since his 2016 presidential campaign.
We went through the speeches Trump made at his two Wednesday campaign rallies in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania, one in Scranton and one in Reading. In those two addresses alone, he uttered at least 40 separate false claims.
Here is a fact check.
FEMA and migrants: Trump falsely claimed of the Federal Emergency Management Agency: “They have no money. You know where they gave the money? To illegal immigrants coming in.” He also said, “They spent all their funds; they have no funds to take care…”
This is false in two ways. FEMA does have money for the immediate responses to Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton, though a string of recent disasters has depleted its disaster relief fund; the fund had about $11 billion remaining as of Wednesday. And FEMA did not give all of its disaster relief money to undocumented people; rather, as mandated by Congress, FEMA also administers an entirely separate pool of money for sheltering migrants.
FEMA and employees: Trump added another false claim about FEMA, saying: “They have no workers, they have no nothing.” FEMA has more than 20,000 employees.
Harris and the response: Trump falsely claimed that as desperate people tried to survive Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, Vice President Kamala Harris “didn’t send anything or anyone at all” to help them. There were extensive federal and state rescue and relief efforts in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Helene. It’s true that some residents died and others were stranded for days, but the state was not ignored by Harris or the Biden administration; North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, has repeatedly thanked President Joe Biden for his assistance.
Schools and transgender children: Trump told a slightly vaguer version of his usual false story about schools supposedly obtaining or performing gender-affirming surgeries for transgender children behind their parents’ backs, saying, “Your child go goes to school, and they take your child. It was a ‘he.’ And comes back a ‘she.’ And they do this…And often without parental consent.”
There is no evidence that US schools have sent children into gender-affirming surgeries without their parents knowing or performed gender-affirming surgeries on site; Trump’s own presidential campaign could not provide a single example of any of this ever happening. Even in states where gender-affirming surgery is legal for people under age 18, parental consent is required before a minor can undergo such a procedure.
Trump’s opponents and the election: In Reading, Trump falsely claimed of his election opponents: “They are cheatin’ dogs, I will tell you that.” In Scranton, he falsely claimed, “Their first meeting is: ‘How do we cheat?’” This is all nonsense. There is no basis for the claim that Trump’s opponents are election cheaters.
Harris’ previous presidential campaign: Trump repeated his false claim that, when Harris ran for president in 2020, “she was the first one to drop out, of like 22 people” in the Democratic primary. In fact, 13 other Democratic candidates dropped out of that primary before Harris exited in December 2019 – including the sitting or former governors of Washington, Montana and Colorado; the sitting mayor of New York City; and sitting or former members of the House of Representatives and Senate.
Harris and the press: Trump falsely claimed of Harris: “She doesn’t do any interviews.” Trump is entitled to argue that Harris has not done a sufficient number of interviews as the Democratic presidential nominee, but the assertion she doesn’t do “any” is wrong; Harris has done multiple interviews in recent weeks. Notably, Harris did an interview with the CBS News show “60 Minutes,” which aired Monday, while Trump backed out of his own interview with the show.
Harris-Walz and the Supreme Court: After correctly noting that Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, recently expressed support for getting rid of the Electoral College, Trump falsely claimed, “They want to add… they’re thinking about – first time I heard this number – 25: they want to have 25 Supreme Court justices.” There is no basis for the claim that Harris or Walz is pushing for a 25-justice Supreme Court.
Walz and menstrual products in schools: Trump disparaged Walz as “Tampon Tim,” then said, “You know why they call him that? ’Cause they sell tampons, with special legislation, in boys’ locker rooms.” Trump’s claim is false. The law Walz signed in 2023 requires schools to provide free menstrual products in bathrooms, not the sale of menstrual products in locker rooms – and all 18 public school districts that responded to CNN’s questions about the law say they do not provide the products in boys’ bathrooms. You can read more here.
Wind power: Trump repeated a familiar nonsensical story about how the use of wind power means people “can’t watch” television if “there’s no wind tonight.” Using wind power as part of a mix of power sources does not cause power outages when the wind isn’t blowing, as the federal Department of Energy explained on its website even during the Trump administration.
The Biden administration and electric vehicles: Trump falsely claimed that under a Biden administration electric vehicle mandate, “everybody’s got to have an electric car almost immediately.” There is no Biden administration requirement that consumers must buy an electric car or give up their existing gas-powered cars, “almost immediately” or otherwise. The Biden administration has made a push to get automakers to reduce emissions and adopt electric vehicles, but there is not a mandate for consumers; the tailpipe rules for automakers that were unveiled by the administration earlier this year aim to have electric vehicles make up 35% to 56% new vehicles sold in 2032.
The Paris climate accord and emissions: Trump repeated his false claim that under the Paris climate accord, the US “had to pay a trillion dollars” while some other countries didn’t have to pay.
Trump’s “trillion” figure is a wild exaggeration. Under the Obama administration, the US paid $1 billion of a $3 billion commitment it originally made in 2014. After Trump pulled the country out of the Paris accord, the US paid nothing to the global finance goal. And while Biden pledged $11.4 billion annually from the US, this level of funding hasn’t materialized. That’s because Congress, responsible for appropriating the nation’s budget, has allocated only a fraction of that – roughly $1 billion in 2022.
Harris’ comments on fracking: Trump said, “Listen to Kamala in her own words very recently,” then played two video clips in which Harris said she was in favor of banning fracking. But those clips are from 2019, beyond any reasonable definition of “very recently.” Harris has said during the 2024 campaign that she no longer favors banning fracking.
Venezuela, prisons and migration: Trump falsely claimed, “In Venezuela, many countries, they’re emptying their prisons into our country.” This is false. Trump has never corroborated this claim about Venezuela, let alone “many countries,” and experts have told CNN, PolitiFact and FactCheck.org that they know of no evidence for it.
“We have no evidence that the Venezuelan government is emptying its prisons or mental health institutions to send them outside the country, in other words, to the U.S. or any other country,” Roberto Briceño-León, founder and director of the Venezuelan Observatory of Violence, an independent organization that tracks violence in the country, said in an email to CNN in June, after Trump made similar claims.
Venezuela, criminals and migration: Adding another colorful story about Venezuela, Trump falsely claimed that “they take the criminal gangs from Caracas off the streets and they bus them into the United States and drop them.” This is false. There is no evidence of Venezuelan authorities somehow busing gang members into the US.
The world prison population: Trump repeated his false claim that “the prison population all over the world is down, because they put them in our country.” The recorded global prison population increased from October 2021 to April 2024, from at least about 10.77 million people to at least about 10.99 million people, according to the World Prison Population List compiled by experts in the United Kingdom.
“I do a daily news search to see what’s going on in prisons around the world and have seen absolutely no evidence that any country is emptying its prisons and sending them all to the US,” Helen Fair, co-author of the prison population list and research fellow at the Institute for Crime & Justice Policy Research at Birkbeck, University of London, said in June, when Trump made a similar claim.
The number of migrants: Trump, speaking about migration, falsely claimed that “21 million people – plus – came into our nation” under the Biden-Harris administration. Through August, the country had recorded about 10.3 million nationwide “encounters” with migrants during the Biden-Harris administration, including millions who were rapidly expelled from the country; even adding in so-called “gotaways” who evaded detection, estimated by House Republicans as being roughly 2 million, there’s no way the total is “21 million.”
Harris, migrants and criminals: Trump, criticizing Harris on immigration, again wrongly described a set of statistics that was released in September. He falsely claimed in Scranton, “You saw that last week: 13,099 murderers allowed to come in, through them.” He falsely claimed in Reading that “as we speak she has – and this was just announced last week – 13,099, so over 13,000 illegal alien convicted murderers, roaming free in our country.”
This 13,099 figure includes people who are incarcerated in federal, state and local prisons and jails – and it includes people who entered the country over decades, including during Trump’s administration, not just under Biden and Harris. You can read more here.
Harris’ record as attorney general: Trump falsely claimed that when Harris was attorney general of California, “she said under no circumstances” will people be prosecuted for the crimes of child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon or the rape of an unconscious person. Harris did not say anything like that; Trump was grossly mischaracterizing a debate over the language Harris’ office used to summarize California ballot initiatives.
Trump’s border wall: Trump repeated his false claim that “I built over 500 miles of wall” on the southern border. Official government data shows 458 miles were built under Trump – including both wall built where no barriers had existed before and wall built to replace previous barriers.
Trump’s crowds: Trump falsely claimed of his rallies: “We never have an empty seat.” There have been empty seats at numerous Trump rallies over the years – including hundreds at this very rally in Reading. And at many Trump rallies, some once-filled seats empty out during his speeches when supporters leave.
Trump’s crowd in Butler: Trump falsely claimed there were “over 100,000 people” at the rally he held Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania, at the same site where a gunman had attempted to assassinate him in July. CNN affiliate KDKA in Pittsburgh reported that the Secret Service put the crowd at 24,000 people, while the Trump-supporting sheriff of Blair County, Pennsylvania, James Ott, said in his speech at the rally itself (more than three hours before Trump took the stage) that he was looking out at “21,000-plus people.”
Trump’s response to the assassination attempt: Trump, speaking of his response to the attempted assassination in July, falsely claimed, “I said as I was getting up – before I even got up – I said, ‘How many people were killed?’ Because, you know, it was wall to wall people, and I said, ‘How many people were killed?’ They said, ‘We think three, sir,’ and I said, ‘That’s not good.’”
Trump’s rally microphone picked up what was said by Trump and Secret Service agents while he was on the ground and just after, and he did not ask, before or after he got up, how many people were killed. It’s possible he did so after he was whisked off stage (and, of course, possible he was genuinely misremembering what happened in such a traumatic moment).
Trump and firefighters: Trump falsely claimed, “We got the firefighters endorse us, you probably heard.” But the actual recent national news was that the International Association of Firefighters had decided not to endorse any candidate in the race; while Trump is free to argue that this was a victory for him, given that the union endorsed Biden in 2020, it was not an actual endorsement. And while there were some people in the Scranton crowd holding “Scranton Firefighters for Trump” signs, the Scranton chapter of the union also has not issued an endorsement. The president of the chapter told the Scranton Times-Tribune that none of the people he saw holding the signs were active or retired local firefighters.
Trump and classified documents: Speaking of the criminal case against him over his post-presidency retention of classified documents, Trump repeated his false claim that “I had the Presidential Records Act; I was totally allowed to do it.” The Presidential Records Act says that, the moment a president leaves office, the National Archives and Records Administration gets custody and control of all presidential records from their administration. (Trump’s case was dismissed by a federal judge in July on other grounds, that the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith was unconstitutional; Smith has appealed.)
The New York Times and the Russia investigation: Trump, calling claims about his 2016 campaign’s connections to Russia a “scam,” repeated his false claim that The New York Times “admitted they were wrong” about the coverage that won its journalists a Pulitzer Prize along with journalists from The Washington Post.
“The claim is completely false,” Times spokesperson Charlie Stadtlander said in an email to CNN in 2023, when Trump made a similar claim; Stadtlander noted that “the award was upheld by the Pulitzer Prize Board after an independent review” and said the Times’ reporting “was also substantiated by the Mueller investigation and Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee investigation into the matter.”
The New York Times and the 2016 election: Trump repeated a false claim he made during his presidency, saying of The New York Times’ coverage of the 2016 election: “Remember in 2016 they had to do an editorial apologizing to their readers because they said, ‘He’s going to lose’…and then I won?”
As the Times noted in 2017 in response to such Trump claims, it did not apologize for its 2016 election coverage. It did publish a post-election letter, from then-executive editor Dean Baquet and publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr., that said the election had raised several questions, including this: “Did Donald Trump’s sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters?” But the letter did not include an apology, to Trump or anyone else.
Trump and the defeat of ISIS: Trump repeated his false claim that “we defeated ISIS in four weeks; it was supposed to take four or five years.” The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency.
Military equipment surrendered to the Taliban: Trump repeated his false claim that “we gave $85 billion worth” of US military equipment to the Taliban. Trump’s figure is a massive exaggeration; the Pentagon has estimated that the equipment abandoned to the Taliban by Afghan forces upon their 2021 collapse was worth about $7.1 billion – a chunk of the roughly $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021.
Biden and foreign income: Trump repeated his false claim that “Biden got a lot of money from China.” After years of investigation by House Republicans, there is still no evidence Biden has received any Chinese money.
Chris Wallace and a question about the Biden family: Trump told his familiar false story about how he had asked Biden at a 2020 presidential debate why the wife of a mayor of Moscow had paid Biden $3.5 million – in fact, the money was sent to a firm connected to the president’s son Hunter Biden, not to the president – but moderator Chris Wallace, then of Fox News and now of CNN, had interjected to say, “Well, please don’t ask him that question.” Wallace never did that. As the transcript shows, Wallace interjected during this debate exchange to try to get Trump to allow Biden to answer Trump’s question about the payment, not to stop Trump from asking.
Inflation: Trump repeated his false claim that inflation under Biden and Harris is “the worst inflation in the history of our country.” Trump could fairly say that the US inflation rate hit a 40-year high in June 2022, when it was 9.1%, but that was not close to the all-time record of 23.7%, set in 1920, and the rate has since plummeted; the most recent available inflation rate at the time Trump spoke here was 2.5% in August.
Mortgage rates: Trump falsely claimed that young people can’t buy a house because interest rates are higher than 10%: “It’s not 10%, it’s 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 percent.” This is false. The average rate on a standard 30-year fixed mortgage was 6.12% in the week ending October 3, according to mortgage financing provider Freddie Mac, and 6.32% in the week ending October 10.
Trump’s tax cut: Trump repeated his false claim that “I gave you, as you know, the largest tax cut in the history of our country.” Expert analyses have found that his 2017 tax cut law was not the largest in US history, either in percentage of gross domestic product or in inflation-adjusted dollars.
Tariffs on China: Trump repeated two of his regular false claims about tariffs on imported Chinese products. He falsely claimed that China “paid hundreds of billions of dollars” in these tariffs during his presidency, then falsely claimed that before his presidency, “nobody ever brought in 10 cents, not one other – not 10 cents, you check those records.”
We’ve checked, and the truth is that the US was generating billions per year in revenue from tariffs on China before Trump took office; in fact, the US has had tariffs on Chinese imports since the 1700s. Second, US importers pay these tariffs, not China, and study after study has found that Americans bore the overwhelming majority of the cost of Trump’s tariffs.
The 1890s and tariffs: Touting the supposed benefits of tariffs, Trump falsely claimed that in the 1890s, when the US had very high tariffs, “Our country was the richest it ever was.” The US is far richer today than in the 1890s; per capita gross domestic product is now many times higher than it was then.
The trade deficit with China: Trump repeated his frequent false claim that the US trade deficit with China has averaged “$500 billion” per year. The US has never had a $500 billion trade deficit with China even if you only count trade in goods and ignore the services trade in which the US traditionally runs a surplus with China; the all-time record, about $418 billion, was set under Trump in 2018.
Harris and taxes: Trump played a deceptively edited video showing “The View” co-host Meghan McCain saying to Harris in 2019, “Everything from a 70 to 80% tax rate,” and Harris responding, “I think that’s fantastic.”
This video cuts out key words from the exchange; Harris was not specifically endorsing high tax rates when she made the “fantastic” comment.
Here’s the transcript of the 2019 exchange:
McCain: “Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the new darling of the party. She officially has more Twitter followers than Nancy Pelosi. She was on ‘60 Minutes’ this weekend proudly calling herself a radical. And she’s promoting policies like saying that every single carbon emission in the country, every car, should be eliminated within the next 11 years, everything from a 70 to 80 percent tax rate. Do you agree that she could possibly – and this ideology, of the socialist left – could splinter your party?”
Harris: “No. You know, I think that she is challenging the status quo. I think that’s fantastic. I think that – you know, I used to teach, before, especially before – in the last few years – and the thing that I always loved about teaching was when you teach, it requires you to defend the premise. And it requires you to re-examine the premise. And question, is it still relevant? Is it – does it have impact? Does it have meaning? And I think that she is introducing bold ideas that should be discussed. And I think it’s good for the party, I frankly think it’s good for the country. Let’s look at the bold ideas. And I’m eager that we have those discussions. And when we are able to defend status quo, then do it, and if there are – you know, if there’s not merit to that, then let’s explore new ideas.”
Biden’s documents case: Trump falsely claimed in Reading that, in an investigation into Biden’s handling of classified documents, “Biden was essentially convicted” and in Scranton that “they ruled on him, they said he’s guilty.” Biden was not convicted, “essentially” or not, and was not found guilty; in fact, Biden was not even charged with a crime. The special counsel in the case, Robert Hur, wrote in his public report that “the evidence does not establish Mr. Biden’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,” adding that “several defenses are likely to create reasonable doubt as to such charges.”
A supposed Biden gaffe: Mocking Biden’s gaffes, Trump falsely claimed, “But the worst was when he was in New Hampshire and he said, ‘It’s great to be in Florida.’ That’s palm trees.” This never happened. Biden has certainly made various geographic gaffes, as has Trump, but he never said he was in Florida when he was actually in New Hampshire.",2024-10-10
CNN,Trump transition team co-chair endorses Kennedy anti-vax theories and says he would be able to access health data | CNN Politics,"The co-chair of the Trump-Vance transition team on Wednesday night endorsed vaccine conspiracy theories pushed by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and suggested the activist and Trump ally would be given federal data in order to check vaccines’ safety if former President Donald Trump is elected.
Speaking to CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on “The Source,” Howard Lutnick, who said he recently spent two and a half hours with Kennedy, also said Kennedy is “not getting a job for (the Department of Health and Human Services),” which is contrary to a claim the activist made earlier this week in which he said Trump promised to give him “control” of several public health agencies, HHS among them. Lutnick also said tech entrepreneur Elon Musk would “help” rather than serve in the government if Trump wins.
“He says, ‘If you give me the data, all I want is the data, and I’ll take on the data and show that it’s not safe.’ And then if you pull the product liability (protections), the companies will yank these vaccines right off, off of the market,” Lutnick said.
Lutnick added, “Let’s give him the data. I think it’ll be pretty cool to give him the data. Let’s see what he comes up with. I think it’s pretty fun.” But vaccines that are currently approved and authorized for use in the US have been proven safe and effective and are continually monitored for risks and side effects.
Lutnick also pushed debunked conspiracy theories that vaccines are behind autism in children. Although it is still unclear what causes autism, the scientific consensus is that vaccines do not.
Following backlash over his remarks, Lutnick sought to clarify his position on vaccines by posting on X: “To be clear, my wife and I trust our doctors and following their advice have vaccinated our children and ourselves. However, not everybody trusts such advice or the FDA. We would be doing everyone a service if the government respected Bobby Kennedy’s request to make the full data available.”
As one of the leads on Trump’s transition team, Lutnick is spearheading the personnel search and lining up potential candidates should Trump win a second term. He speaks to the former president on a near-daily basis and has already interviewed dozens of candidates. Lutnick could hold serious sway over which prospective candidates get in front of Trump as they vie for key positions in the federal government.
Kennedy on Monday told supporters that Trump has promised to give him sweeping power over multiple agencies if the former president wins the election.
“The key that I think I’m – you know, that President Trump has promised me is – is control of the public health agencies, which are HHS (Department of Health and Human Services) and its sub-agencies, CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), FDA (Food and Drug Administration), NIH (National Institutes of Health) and a few others, and then also the USDA (Department of Agriculture), which is – which, you know, is key to making America healthy,” Kennedy said in a video obtained by CNN.
Trump has previously told CNN he would consider appointing Kennedy to a role in a potential second administration. Following Kennedy’s endorsement in August, Trump committed to including Kennedy on a panel that would investigate the rise in diagnoses of chronic diseases should he return to the White House.
Kennedy serves on Trump’s transition team and has been campaigning as a surrogate for him in key battleground states since exiting the presidential race.
He has been one of the leading proponents of anti-vaccine conspiracy theories in the United States. He made false attacks on the safety and efficacy of vaccines and sharp criticisms of public health and agriculture policy a centerpiece of his presidential campaign.
In his interview with Collins, Lutnick said Musk wouldn’t enter the government because he can’t sell SpaceX. Instead, he would write software to give to the government.
“He’s not coming into the government,” Lutnick said. “He can’t sell SpaceX and Tesla. He’s going to be adjacent to it. Think adjacent to it and writing software for the government. And then giving the software to the government. So helping the government. It’s going to be amazing.”

CNN,"Analysis: Your election questions, answered | CNN Politics","A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.
The November 5 general election approaches, and Americans have some questions.
When CNN asked what was confusing about the system or what to expect in the weeks to come, submissions rolled in.
While many of the questions seemed more like vituperative venting about the presidential candidates, others were constructive and interesting. They ranged from questions about the Electoral College to specific inquiries about why ballots in some counties look the way they do.
I’ve taken the liberty of editing some of these questions for both style and length. I just included first names and state of residence based on the submissions. If we didn’t get to your question in this go-round, stay tuned or ask something new. We’ll add answers to new questions weekly until the election and also send them out to the What Matters newsletter audience. More recent questions are listed first.
Polls are good for some things and not so good for others. They’re bad at showing precisely who will vote and how, but they’re good at showing us what is motivating voters. They can also be useful in showing us the direction a race is heading if there is a definitive trend in one direction.
This particular presidential race is incredibly tight, according to the polls. CNN’s polling editor Ariel Edwards-Levy has a helpful guide on how to use polling information. Read her story: What the polls have told us about the 2024 election.
Probably not. The rules are different in each state. When CNN reached out to all 50 states about this very question in 2020, all but five responded, and of those, it was only possible to change an already cast mail-in vote in six states. In battleground Michigan, one of the few states where changing a mail-in vote is possible, the deadline for changing, or “spoiling,” a ballot has already passed.
Only the 50 states and Washington, DC, get electoral votes. It took the 23rd Amendment, enacted in 1961, to get electoral votes for Washington, DC. People from US territories are US citizens, and they can vote in the presidential election only if they are living in one of the states or Washington, DC.
Granting statehood to US territories is not a major, current topic of discussion in the US, even though Puerto Rico, with more than 3 million residents, is larger than several US states. Puerto Rican voters did vote in favor of a nonbinding referendum in 2020 and are considering the issue in another referendum on Election Day this year. Becoming a state requires legislation in the US Congress.
This question is in reference to Donald Trump floating the idea of ending the federal income tax and replacing it with revenue from tariffs, as well as his pledge to stop taxing Social Security benefits if he wins the White House. But presidents don’t have absolute power.
The income tax was established by the 16th Amendment to the Constitution, and Congress has the power to levy taxes. Changing the tax code would require legislation passed through Congress.
There have been faithless electors in US history. In 2016, for instance, there were seven rogue votes from both red and blue states for Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and former Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, among others.
In 2020, the US Supreme Court ruled that states can punish faithless electors. Most states have laws that require electors to support the winner in their state, according to the Library of Congress.
The system has multiple stopgaps and, despite what Trump and Elon Musk say, there are a lot of people on both sides of the political aisle who work very hard to ensure US elections are fair and accurate.
Poll watchers – both Republicans and Democrats – will be present in polling places on Election Day observing what’s going on. Many Americans’ votes are counted by machine, but they fill out a paper ballot, which can be accessed in case of a recount.
Election machines should not be connected to the internet, according to election officials. There are audits of election machines to make sure they work. The courts are available to hear challenges in the event that one side or the other suspects a problem. They can hear evidence and take testimony under oath.
When you cast a ballot, you’re also expressing your faith in the system that it will be counted. But the process is meant to be transparent and accountable.
You can usually verify that you did vote. When you vote, that’s usually recorded by your city or state, and you can frequently check your state government website to see in which elections you’ve participated.
If you’re voting by mail, you can usually track the progress of your ballot online, like your online food order or your package in the mail.
If you’re voting in person, the vast majority of Americans will use paper ballots, which are processed by voting machines and kept for audits or recounts.
And note: If you’re nervous about the process, it might be a good time to volunteer to work at an election site and see how the process works.
There were a lot of questions along these lines. We do cover negative news about Vice President Kamala Harris.
What I’d say is that if you’ve seen the top attack ad against Harris from Trump and his allies over her past support of certain rights for transgender people, it is based on CNN reporting. CNN’s KFile has also uncovered Harris’ earlier positions on oil companies and immigration.
And as Democrats have begun to grow nervous about her campaign, we have covered those developments.
Presidents get too much credit for good economies and too much blame for bad economies. In this weird election, the economists say the economy is good, but voters say it’s not great.
In a capitalist economy like the US, the president does not directly control prices, although there are levers they can pull. Presidents can impose tariffs without help from Congress. This is Trump’s plan, although experts warn it will raise prices, not lower them.
Harris has promised to go after corporations for price gouging, but it’s not clear if that will lead to the dropping of prices in a broad way – and the plan could backfire, according to some economists. Short answer: It’s hard for presidents to drive down prices.
Everyone should be paying attention to Ron’s question. Neither party or candidate is actively talking about this, even though the government has warned that Social Security will not be able to pay full benefits as soon as 2035. The political parties will soon have to take this seriously.
Right now, both sides are simply promising to protect Social Security benefits. It could require raising the retirement age or raising taxes, two things that voters don’t seem to want to hear much about.
Note: The long list of tax breaks Trump has promised, including pledging to stop taxing Social Security benefits, could worsen the program’s finances and lead to cuts to those benefits in six years, according to a recent analysis from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan government watchdog. It did not do a detailed analysis of the impact of Harris’ platform on Social Security, CNN’s Tami Luhby reports, because it said the changes would be minimal.
There actually is just such a protection in the 14th Amendment, which prohibits anyone who took part in an insurrection from serving in Congress or being an “officer of the United States.” Multiple states pursued removing Trump from their primary ballots based on this clause.
But in March, the US Supreme Court unanimously rejected Colorado’s effort to disqualify Trump from its ballot. A slimmer majority of five conservative justices ruled that for a person to be removed from a ballot for being an insurrectionist, Congress must first pass legislation.
The current Republican majority in the House is not going to pass legislation declaring Trump an insurrectionist. And if he is reelected, Trump has promised to fire the special counsel currently prosecuting him for election interference.
It could take a while, depending on the number of mail-in ballots cast in some states and how close things are.
CNN did not project that President Joe Biden would win the 2020 election until four days after Election Day. If the election is close in one or more decisive states, it could be longer. In 2000, for instance, the disputed results in Florida carried on for 36 days until the Supreme Court ended a recount.
In 2016, on the other hand, things were relatively close in some key states and Hillary Clinton conceded the day after Election Day. Trump is unlikely to ever concede. Harris has talked about the importance of a peaceful transfer of power.
The 2000 example, in which Republican and ultimate winner George W. Bush was ahead after the initial count, brings up a good point. We can expect that if Trump loses he will contest the results since he has alleged voter fraud in every election in which he was a candidate. However, we should also expect that in the event of a close result in which Harris trails, Democrats will also explore legal avenues.
Rules on how and when a recount is triggered or can be requested vary from state to state. This year, according to a new law, states have until December 11 to ascertain a winner in order to guarantee their electoral votes are counted.
When I asked CNN’s director of election analytics Jennifer Agiesta about all of this, she noted that some states have taken measures since 2020 that will make their counting a bit faster. Her response is below:
Two of the states we projected last in 2020 are good examples: In Georgia, after changes to laws around preelection voting, a lot more people who vote before Election Day do so early in person rather than by mail, which means there are fewer mail ballots to count, which should speed things up.
In North Carolina, they no longer accept by-mail ballots after Election Day, so there is more known about what’s left to count there. And we expect a lot fewer people to vote by mail generally, since we’re not in the middle of a pandemic, so that also ought to speed things up.
The time it takes to process the by-mail ballots is the thing that slows it all down. Pennsylvania, of course, hasn’t made it easier for election officials to get those ballots ready to count before Election Day, so the count will likely keep going there for a while.
It is not possible for noncitizens to vote in this election. Congress outlawed noncitizen voting in 1996.
If a noncitizen voted, the person would be breaking the law and probably would be deported. While Trump has alleged for years that there is an epidemic of noncitizen voting, there is zero evidence to back that up.
Every state except North Dakota requires voter registration. Each vote is paired with a registration. States routinely scrub their voter rolls. There are some few instances of people who are noncitizens becoming registered to vote, but it’s usually an error. When states identify noncitizens accidentally on their rolls, they are removed.
The conservative Heritage Foundation tracks prosecutions for noncitizen voting. There have been 25 in the past 20 years. Critics argue that Trump’s insistence there is noncitizen voting is a scare tactic.
While there are very few cities in California, Maryland and Vermont and in Washington, DC, that allow noncitizens to vote in local elections, those are the exceptions to the rule. No noncitizen can vote for president.
In order to answer Sheila’s question, I called Nicole Unzicker, director of the Board of Elections in Butler County, where Sheila lives.
It turns out that a paper version of the ballot used for mail-in voting shows all of the candidates in one line. However, for in-person voting on the Dominion system used there, the text for the first ballot question is large and long. That means in-person voters must scroll to see all of the presidential candidates when they get to the president question.
Unzicker said the order of candidates is always alphabetical, but the first listed candidate is rotated between the county’s roughly 300 precincts. So both Harris and Trump should be on the bottom half of the scroll for an equal number of voters.
With long and large wording for ballot initiatives, the scroll is a known issue, according to Unzicker. She said her office created a video that plays for voters in line and also has instructions at each voting station.
It’s important to remember that ballots are different within states and even counties depending on which offices are up for election. For information on your state, check out CNN’s Voter Handbook.
There were a lot of questions about the Electoral College, which should frustrate people on both sides of the aisle. There will be more Trump voters in California than in Texas and more Harris voters in Texas than in New York.
You’d need to change the US Constitution to eliminate the Electoral College. And that’s not impossible. The 12th Amendment changed the process early in US history.
But enacting a constitutional amendment is a long, arduous, two-step process.
First, an amendment can be proposed by a two-thirds majority vote in both the House and the Senate, or two-thirds of states can propose an amendment by requesting a constitutional convention.
Second, once an amendment is proposed, it must be ratified by either three-quarters of the state legislatures or conventions called in each state.
It’s a difficult enough process that the most recent amendment, the 27th, was ratified 32 years ago. It focused on congressional compensation. The 26th Amendment, which made 18 the official voting age, was ratified more than a half-century ago, in 1971.
There have been multiple attempts to eliminate the Electoral College in US history, most recently in 1969, when a bill passed the US House with overwhelming support but was filibustered in the Senate.
States have also changed the system by moving to pick their electors as proxies for the popular vote in states rather than as a group of electors who can vote however they wish.
There is an effort to simply ignore the Electoral College and honor the popular vote winner. Multiple states have agreed to a National Popular Vote compact, whereby they would award their electoral votes to the national popular vote winner. The agreement only kicks in when states representing a majority of electoral votes sign on. They’re still about 61 electoral votes short.
I’m certainly not going to be the person who defends the Electoral College here. But I will point out your vote only seems irrelevant because there is a strong majority in your state. States change.
Remember when Florida was THE swing state? It wasn’t that long ago.
Remember when Ohio was a major swing state? Both are now essentially red.
Democrats have been salivating over Texas and North Carolina for years, trying to turn them blue. While two of the past six elections ended with a Republican getting fewer votes but winning the White House, there is some serious conjecture that this year could see Trump win the popular vote and lose the Electoral College.
That would be a plot twist to drive his conspiracy theories.
None of this is to endorse the Electoral College or justify using something from the era of slavery in today’s America. But it is also true that politics is always changing.
Let’s not use the term “uneducated,” which is pejorative. Harvey’s use of all caps is evidence that term is loaded.
There is a definite divide in this country between voters on the basis of what level of education they attained. Those with college degrees may be more likely to support Harris. Those without college degrees may be more likely to support Trump.
I wrote recently about the Democratic strategist Doug Sosnik’s argument that education level is the best predictor of how a person will vote. We will have to see if that plays out on Election Day.
A recent report by the Lumina Foundation found that about 14% of Americans have a graduate or professional degree and about 23% stopped after earning a bachelor’s degree. About 9% have an associate degree, and about 8% have a post-high school certification of some kind.
This is more of a comment than a question, but it’s worth exploring. Presidents are limited to two terms, so why not members of Congress? Because of the Supreme Court.
The court ruled in 1995 that imposing term limits on members of Congress would require a constitutional amendment. The decision barred states from imposing their own term limits on their members of Congress.
There is talk of lawmakers passing a law to reform the Supreme Court and impose term limits on justices, but that is in its early stages and currently lacks overwhelming support.
When Congress tried with a Republican majority in the mid-’90s to propose a term limits amendment for members of Congress, it failed repeatedly.
There are a few ways to look at this, either in the popular vote or the Electoral College.
In the Electoral College, the closest election was relatively recent, in 2000. Bush got 271 electoral votes, one more than he needed to win the White House. Al Gore got a little more than 500,000 more total votes. The tightest possible margin in Florida, 537 votes, essentially decided the election. But there was also a narrow Bush win in New Hampshire too. Every state counts!
The election of 1876 between eventual-winner Rutherford B. Hayes and Samuel Tilden was decided by a single electoral vote, but only after the electoral votes of three states were disputed. A special commission ultimately awarded them to Hayes even though Tilden got more popular votes.
There are closer popular vote margins. These include 1960, when John F. Kennedy defeated Richard Nixon by about 119,000 ballots in the popular vote, and 1880, when James Garfield defeated Gen. Winfield Hancock despite getting fewer than 2,000 more popular votes. But neither of those was close in the Electoral College.
I’m not including the election of 1800, even though it resulted in a tie in the Electoral College. For starters, many state legislatures picked electors in early American elections, so it’s hard to say who got more popular votes. Second, the tie was between two running mates. They simply did not coordinate in the Electoral College.
Not only do Republicans not currently hold the presidency, but Congress actually passed a law in 2022 making clear that the vice president’s role in counting electoral votes is only ceremonial. They also changed the bar by which lawmakers can challenge a state’s electoral votes.
That said, CNN has reported that much of what special counsel Jack Smith accused Trump and his campaign of engineering after his 2020 loss is still in play for 2024. These include unfounded allegations of large numbers of undocumented immigrants casting ballots, something for which there is no evidence. They are also filing many preelection lawsuits, setting the groundwork to file lawsuits challenging the results if they don’t go Trump’s way. Read more about GOP challenges to mail-in voting.
Trump supporters have a different view, but this is a good question about strategy. While the general mood about the economy has improved, it’s still quite dim. More than half the country, 52%, said in a recent Gallup poll that they feel worse off than they did four years ago.
It might be bad politics for a candidate to tell people who are having trouble affording things that they’re wrong about the way they feel. If you listen to Harris, she does say a lot of the things you suggest above, that inflation is coming down, but she also clearly wants to appeal to the Americans who are having trouble affording groceries, who can’t afford to buy a house and who feel like there’s a lot more work to be done.

CNN,Analysis: One of the most important jobs in American politics has turned into a nightmare | CNN Politics,"Winning a majority party’s nomination for speaker of the House of Representatives usually elevates a lawmaker into the pantheon of American political leaders.
But such is the toxicity of the GOP three weeks after the ouster of Speaker Kevin McCarthy that the nominee expected to emerge on Tuesday may never get the top job.
The nomination is an assignment to what may be an impossible political mission to unite a conference that might never be reconciled. And even if the nominee wins the gavel, the next speaker has a reasonable chance of a tenure even shorter than McCarthy, who lasted nine months.
But this is about more than the plight of a Republican Party that often looks like it’s tearing itself apart. If the dysfunctional House GOP majority cannot get its act together, the US government could run out of funding before Thanksgiving week – and millions of Americans could pay the price.
As lawmakers returned to Washington on Monday, there was a growing sense of rising public frustration about a House that has been paralyzed for three weeks, as global crises boil and the shutdown deadline approaches.
Florida Rep. Vern Buchanan said his constituents “think all of us are incapable.” Buchanan, who is supporting fellow Sunshine State lawmaker Byron Donalds for speaker, added: “People are very angry and upset.”
The hopefuls lined up on Tuesday at the start of rounds of secret balloting that will produce a party nominee for speaker following the failures of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan to replace McCarthy. But there is no guarantee the candidate who emerges from secret balloting will be able to get the required majority in the full House – given the extreme splits in the GOP between some of the far-right hardliners who helped eject McCarthy and more moderate lawmakers in battleground districts.
Because of their tiny majority, almost every Republican must back the nominee for him to become speaker – a longshot in a conference that is deeply divided. Ex-President Donald Trump has been fielding calls from top candidates seeking his endorsement but joked on Monday that only divine intervention could end the crisis.
“I said there’s only one person who can do it all the way,” Trump said in New Hampshire. “You know who that is? Jesus Christ. If Jesus came down and said, ‘I want to be speaker,’ he would do it.”
A new GOP speaker could find it impossible to unite the party
The fact there were so many candidates on Tuesday tells its own tale – namely that no one is strong enough to clear the field and whoever emerges may not have a strong base of support.
There are signs House Majority Whip Tom Emmer has been making progress, but as a member of a House leadership team distrusted by the right-wing House Freedom Caucus, his candidacy may suffer the same liabilities as those of Scalise and McCarthy. Another possible nominee is Donalds of Florida, a member of the House Freedom Caucus and one of the few Black Republicans in Congress. But Donalds may be too radical for moderate Republicans in districts that voted for President Joe Biden. There’s been palpable anger among such members – on whom the majority rests – that the lawmakers who voted out McCarthy have escaped punishment. A speaker from the far-right may be too much for them to accept.
But the identity of the new Republican speaker – when he eventually emerges (there’s not one woman among the current candidates) – may be less important than the dire situation he will confront. The House GOP has now spent three weeks failing to select a new leader – time that would have been better spent staking out a position on a new government funding deal needed to prevent the government from closing down in mid-November. Even if a new speaker is selected by the end of this week, there’s barely three weeks before the Thanksgiving break to get a deal with a Democratic-run Senate and the White House to avoid yet another governing debacle on the GOP majority’s watch.
The funding showdown will represent one of the most difficult tests ever for a new speaker. The likelihood that this leader will be a compromised figure at risk of losing his job at any moment at the head of a rebellious conference makes the position even more vulnerable.
As former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, himself a notoriously polarizing figure, said on Fox News this weekend: “They got big decisions coming down the road. There’s a very real danger that they’ll elect somebody and three of four or five weeks from now, you’re going to have a group of people blow up and decide to go back into the same mess.”
The risk of such a scenario is raised by the fact that any new speaker will face the same kind of impossible choices that confronted McCarthy when he narrowly averted a government shutdown last month. Knowing that he couldn’t satisfy extreme demands for spending cuts from hardliners with a Democratic Senate and the White House, McCarthy was forced to use some Democratic votes to pass a stopgap funding bill. And it cost him his job.
The growing pressure to fill the speaker’s chair might be a motivating factor for the GOP to finally end the stalemate. But the risk is that a compromise candidate will not have spent the years building a powerbase – inside the Capitol and on the critical fundraising circuit – and may therefore not be an effective leader of a fractious conference.
The fact that party leaders can only lose four votes and still pass a bill on party lines has highlighted the huge splits inside the conference and underscored that there is no reliable Republican majority for any legislation in the House right now.
Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky, for instance, said the leadership crisis “shows that we’re not functioning as a majority. And when you lose that, you lose the ability to govern.”
How Americans could pay the price for the House’s dysfunction
The 2024 elections are still more than a year away, but the spectacle of a House brought low by its own divisions augurs poorly for the GOP. The party cannot enact its agenda, has no chance of showing voters it can be an effective majority, and cannot even use its power to jam Democrats into taking tough political votes that may come back to haunt them – as a majority party might generally do at this point in the political cycle.
But House Republicans are not just harming themselves. If the leadership limbo goes on much longer, the damage could spread countrywide and go global.
A government shutdown could harm countless Americans – including members of the armed services that could go without pay. And the paralysis in the House means that lawmakers cannot vote on sending emergency aid to Israel amid its war with Hamas. Biden’s request for a new $60 billion aid package for Ukraine is also not going anywhere. Domestically, vital appropriations bills on everything from farming to energy and foreign operations are stalled.
“I think House Republicans know that this is very detrimental to the country. Look at what is going on … over in Israel, what’s happening in Ukraine, and all the other things we know are happening in the world, including in our own country,” Rep. Larry Bucshon told CNN’s Brianna Keilar on Monday. The Indiana Republican also warned the party was hurting itself ahead of the critical funding showdown.
“I think it does put us at a disadvantage. We don’t have someone who is the speaker of the House to negotiate with the White House, with Senate Democrats who are in the majority. … It does put us at a political disadvantage.”
“Also practically for the country, it’s not a good thing.”",2023-10-24
