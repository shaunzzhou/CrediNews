Who can vote in US elections, and what steps must you take to do so?
So you want to cast a ballot on Election Day? Or maybe vote by mail? It helps to know the rules.
The federal government sets some basic standards: U.S. citizens age 18 or older are eligible to vote. But each state can adopt additional voting requirements and restrictions. For example, many states disqualify voters serving a prison sentence for felony crimes.
Many states also require people to register to vote in advance of Election Day, so poll workers can check names off a list when people show up to vote. The majority of states also ask voters to show some form of identification, so carrying an ID may be important.
Here’s a look at some of the most common rules and requirements when it comes to casting a ballot.
What’s the age requirement to vote?
The 26th Amendment to the Constitution sets the voting age at 18. You must be at least that old by Election Day, which this year is Nov. 5.
States may allow people to register to vote while age 17, or in some cases 16, so long as they turn 18 by Election Day.
What’s the citizenship requirement to vote?
A 1996 U.S. law makes it illegal for noncitizens to vote in elections for president or members of Congress. Violators can be fined and imprisoned for up to a year. They can also be deported. When people register to vote, they confirm under penalty of perjury that they are U.S. citizens.
No state constitutions explicitly allow noncitizens to vote. Many states have laws that prohibit noncitizens from voting for state offices such as governor or attorney general. There are ballot measures in several states this November asking voters whether to explicitly add such a prohibition to the state’s constitution.
Some municipalities in California, Maryland and Vermont, as well as the District of Columbia, do allow voting by noncitizens in some local elections such as for school board and city council. In Arizona, voters must prove their citizenship to participate in local and state races.
Do you have to register to vote?
North Dakota is the only state that does not require people to register to vote before casting a ballot. Elsewhere, people must register their names and addresses with election officials. That can be done in-person at state or local election offices or state motor vehicles offices. Many states also allow voter registrations to be mailed or submitted online.
About 20 states allow people to register on Election Day and then immediately cast a ballot.
The remaining states require some sort of advance registration, with deadlines ranging from three to 30 days before an election. Many of the states with voter registration deadlines more than two weeks ahead of the election are located in the South.
Do you need identification to vote?
About three-quarters of states ask for identification from voters at the polls. Twenty-one states request a photo identification, such as a driver’s license or government-issued card, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Fifteen additional states accept nonphoto identification, such as a utility bill or bank statement that lists a person’s name and address.
If voters don’t have identification, they may still be able to vote. In some states, voters can sign an affidavit of identity. In other states, they can cast a provisional ballot that is counted if election workers later verify their signature or if they return later with identification.
States that don’t require proof of identify use other means to verify voters, such as signatures or asking for home addresses.
People voting absentee or by mail could face additional requirements, such as getting a witness to sign their absentee ballot envelope.

What’s the residency requirement to vote?
Federal law prohibits states from imposing a residency requirement longer than 30 days before an election. But it’s up to voters to designate the address where they reside.
Students who live in one state but attend college elsewhere typically have the choice of voting at their home address or college address. But they still must follow state identification requirements. Some states do not accept student IDs as identification.
Can people convicted of crimes vote?
In all jurisdictions except Maine, Vermont and the nation’s capital, people convicted of felony crimes lose the right to vote while incarcerated.
In half the states, felony voting restrictions extend after incarceration, often including their time on probation or parole, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In some states, convicted felons lose their voting rights indefinitely for certain crimes.

Manager of a key Nevada swing county goes on medical leave ahead of election
RENO, Nev. (AP) — The manager of a key swing county in northern Nevada is out on medical leave, a departure announced just days before the election.
Washoe County has received attention in recent weeks after turnover at the top of the elections office there. Now, with the departure of Manager Eric Brown, both elections and county government operations will be overseen by deputies during what is expected to be a very close election in this politically important county.
The county confirmed Tuesday that Brown is on leave for a planned medical procedure and will be out through late November. Assistant County Manager Dave Solaro will step in until Brown returns.
County officials are trying to quell any concerns that the shuffling of staff would affect operations in Nevada’s second most-populous county. County spokeswoman Bethany Drysdale said that Solaro served as the interim manager for several months before Brown was hired in 2019 and that he has been with the county for more than two decades.
“(Solaro) joins the rest of the county team in wishing Manager Brown well and looks forward to taking on the tasks at hand during the short period of time,” she said in an email to The Associated Press.
Last month, the county announced that Registrar Cari-Ann Burgess requested medical leave to deal with stress. But Burgess said she was forced out after refusing to go along with personnel changes sought by Brown’s office. She said she asked repeatedly to stay, even providing a doctor’s note vouching for her health, and has hired a lawyer.
Overseeing the office now is Burgess’ deputy — the fifth person in four years to run the county election operation. The turnover is one symptom of a county that is closely divided politically and has been buffeted by election conspiracy theories since Republican Donald Trump lost the state to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.
The county has maintained that it’s “focused on conducting a smooth and fair election.”
George Guthrie, a spokesman in the Registrar of Voters office, said in an interview Tuesday before Brown’s medical leave was disclosed that employees in that office appeared to be in good spirits while working hard.
“Election time is go-time for us. This is our Superbowl. The primary is the playoffs,” Guthrie said. “Our people are locked in, working long hours, 12-hour days and weekends.”",2024-10-29

Colorado teen fights kidney failure after eating McDonald’s Quarter Pounders
A 15-year-old high school freshman is hospitalized with severe complications of food poisoning after eating McDonald’s Quarter Pounder hamburgers three times in the weeks before a deadly E. coli outbreak was detected.
Kamberlyn Bowler, of Grand Junction, Colorado, had to be flown 250 miles to a hospital near Denver in mid-October, where she received dialysis for 10 days in an urgent effort to save her kidneys.
She is one at least 75 people sickened and 22 hospitalized in the outbreak tentatively traced to contaminated onions. In Mesa County, where Kamberlyn lives, 11 people have fallen ill and one person died. Federal health officials have said that slivered onions used on the burgers are a likely source of the outbreak.
The ordeal left Kamberlyn’s mother, Brittany Randall, worried about her daughter’s health and shaken at the idea that a burger could potentially cause so much harm.
“It’s pretty scary to know that we put so much faith and trust that we’re going to be eating something that’s healthy and for it to be broken,” said Randall.
She is moving to sue the fast-food chain after Kamberlyn was infected with the E. coli O157:H7 bacteria confirmed in the outbreak.
That bacteria produces a dangerous toxin that can cause a severe kidney disease complication known as hemolytic uremic syndrome, according to medical experts. Many children are hospitalized for weeks and some go on to require kidney transplants, said Dr. Myda Khalid, a kidney specialist at Riley Hospital for Children in Indiana who is not involved in Kamberlyn’s care.
“Time is critical,” Khalid said. “We have to get through this window and we have to get through it with a lot of care,” she said.
The condition can be fatal, but most children eventually recover, she said.
Kamberlyn said she ate McDonald’s Quarter Pounders with cheese, extra pickles -- and onions -- three times between Sept. 27 and Oct. 8. She said the burgers were easy to grab during a football halftime and while watching a school softball game.
She started feeling sick in the days after and experienced fever, vomiting, diarrhea and painful stomach cramps.
“I couldn’t get out of bed,” she recalled. “I couldn’t eat. I couldn’t drink. I was surviving on Popsicles. I felt like crap.”
Randall, who works as a jail guard, has three older children and thought that her young daughter might just have the flu. But when Kamberlyn texted to say she had blood in her stool and urine and was vomiting blood, Randall said she knew it was serious.
On Oct. 11, Kamberlyn went to a hospital in Grand Junction. Doctors said she likely had a stomach bug. She was sent home, with instructions to stay hydrated. By Oct. 17, she was feeling no better and returned to the emergency room. That time, tests showed Kamberlyn had acute kidney failure, her mother said. She was flown to Children’s Hospital Colorado in Aurora, near Denver, where she remained on Tuesday.
Chris Kempczinski, McDonald’s chairman, president and CEO, apologized for the outbreak Tuesday on a conference call with investors.
“Nothing is more important to us than the safety of our customers,” Kempczinksi said. “The recent spate of E. coli cases is deeply concerning, and hearing reports of how this has impacted our customers has been wrenching for us.”
Randall said her daughter’s future health — and medical costs — are uncertain.
“The hospital bills are racking up,” she said. “And I’m a single mom and I just don’t know that I can necessarily afford all of what’s coming after all of this. And I don’t know what the future looks like, either.”

AP,Oklahoma death row inmate had three 'last meals.' He's back at Supreme Court in new bid for freedom,"Oklahoma death row inmate had three ‘last meals.’ He’s back at Supreme Court in new bid for freedom
Oklahoma death row inmate had three ‘last meals.’ He’s back at Supreme Court in new bid for freedom
OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) — Oklahoma has set execution dates nine times for death row inmate Richard Glossip. The state has fed him three “last meals.” Glossip has even been married twice while awaiting execution.
Somehow, he’s still here, even after the Supreme Court rejected his challenge to Oklahoma’s lethal injection process nine years ago.
Now, in another twist, Oklahoma’s Republican attorney general has joined with Glossip in seeking to overturn his murder conviction and death sentence in a 1997 murder-for-hire scheme. This unlikely turn has put Glossip’s case back at the Supreme Court, where the justices will hear arguments Wednesday.
The court’s review of Glossip’s case comes amid a decline in the use of the death penalty and a drop in new death sentences in recent years. At the same time, though, the court’s conservative majority has generally been less open to efforts to halt executions.
It’s exceedingly rare for prosecutors to acknowledge they, or perhaps their predecessors, made serious mistakes that led to the imposition of death sentences.
But that’s precisely what Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond did, in calling for Glossip to get a new trial.
Prosecutors in at least three other death penalty cases in Alabama and Texas have pushed for death row inmates to be given new trials or at least spared the prospect of being executed. The inmates are: Toforest Johnson in Alabama, and Melissa Lucio and Areli Escobar in Texas. In another similar case, the justices refused a last-minute reprieve for Marcellus Williams, whom Missouri executed last week.
“All of these cases are telling the public that the death penalty system, as it is currently being used, cannot be trusted to end up in a fair and just result,” said Robin Maher, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center.
Glossip has always maintained his innocence in the 1997 killing in Oklahoma City of his former boss, motel owner Barry Van Treese, in what prosecutors have alleged was a murder-for-hire scheme. Another man, Justin Sneed, admitted robbing and killing Van Treese but testified he only did so after Glossip promised to pay him $10,000. Sneed received a life sentence in exchange for his testimony and was the key witness against Glossip.
Drummond has said he does not believe Glossip is innocent, but the attorney general contends he did not receive a fair trial. Among Drummond’s concerns are that prosecutors knew Sneed lied on the witness stand about his psychiatric condition and his reason for taking the mood-stabilizing drug lithium. Drummond also has cited a box of evidence in the case that was destroyed, including motel receipts, a shower curtain and masking tape that Glossip’s attorney, Don Knight, said could have potentially proven Glossip’s innocence.
“The highest elected law enforcement officer in Oklahoma has said that Richard Glossip did not get a fair trial,” said Knight, a veteran death penalty trial attorney who has consulted on hundreds of capital cases. “As far as I know that’s unprecedented.”
Despite Drummond’s doubts about the trial, an Oklahoma appeals court upheld Glossip’s conviction, and the state’s pardon and parole board deadlocked in a vote to grant him clemency.
At the Supreme Court, Glossip has high-powered lawyers on his side, including two former solicitors general, Paul Clement and Seth Waxman, who are arguing he deserves a new trial. An attorney appointed by the Supreme Court to defend the Oklahoma court ruling will argue that Glossip should be put to death.
More than a half-dozen states also have weighed in on the case, asking the Supreme Court to uphold Glossip’s conviction, arguing that they have a “substantial interest” in federal-court respect for state-court decisions.
Among those who support Glossip’s efforts to get a new trial are a group of nearly two dozen current and former state and federal prosecutors who wrote in a brief with the court that they were troubled by the actions of law enforcement officers in the case, including what they characterized as the key witness, Sneed, being “coached” to implicate Glossip by a police detective.
Glossip’s case provides a vivid illustration of the seemingly endless legal twists and turns that can accompany death penalty cases. In 2015, he was being held in a cell next to Oklahoma’s execution chamber, waiting to be strapped to a gurney and injected with drugs that would kill him.
But the scheduled time for his execution came and went, and behind the walls of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, prison officials were scrambling after learning one of the lethal drugs they received to carry out the procedure didn’t match the execution protocols.
“That’s just crazy,” Glossip, now 61, said at the time after learning of the drug mix-up, which ultimately led to a nearly seven-year moratorium on executions in Oklahoma.
The case also has been trying for members of the Van Treese family, the relatives of the victim who was beaten to death with a baseball bat in a room of the motel he owned. Their attorney wrote in a brief to the high court that they want to see Glossip’s conviction and sentence upheld.
“In this case, the Van Treese family has waited patiently for justice for 10,047 days,” lawyer Paul Cassell, a former federal judge, wrote on behalf of the family. “And yet, they are now witnessing the spectacle of their case being stalled by the Attorney General for their home state confessing an error where none exists.”
Among those who remain convinced of Glossip’s guilt in orchestrating Van Treese’s murder for hire is former Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater, who reviewed Glossip’s case multiple times and who urged the state’s Pardon and Parole Board to reject clemency for him even though the original case was prosecuted by his predecessors.
“I went through that case more than once and looked at everything that was there, and there was nothing that caused me to have any question about the integrity of that conviction and that death sentence,” Prater said.
A decision is expected by early summer.

AP,Japan's new Prime Minister Ishiba vows to push a strong defense under the Japan-US alliance,"Japan’s new Prime Minister Ishiba vows to push a strong defense under the Japan-US alliance
Japan’s new Prime Minister Ishiba vows to push a strong defense under the Japan-US alliance
TOKYO (AP) — Japan’s new Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba pledged to stick to the vital Japan-U.S. alliance while calling for it to be more equitable after he took office Tuesday vowing to tackle a slow economy and regain public trust before an upcoming election.
Shigeru Ishiba replaced Fumio Kishida, who stepped down to pave the way for a fresh leader after scandals dogged his government.
In a show of Japan’s respect to its most important ally, the United States, Ishiba spoke by telephone with President Joe Biden early Wednesday and told reporters he reassured Biden of his plan to further strengthen the Japan-U.S. alliance that Biden and Kishida have significantly elevated.
His new Cabinet emphasizes defense and a majority of its members, including Ishiba himself, are unaffiliated with factions led and controlled by Liberal Democratic Party heavyweights, and none is from the late Shinzo Abe’s faction that has been linked to damaging misconduct.
Speaking to reporters at the prime minister’s office for the first time following a palace ceremony, Ishiba called for stronger military cooperation with like-minded partners. He has been vocal about his wish to form a NATO-like alliance in the region.
He said that one of his policy’s main goals was to protect Japan as “the security environment surrounding us is the toughest since the end of World War II.”
Ishiba renewed his proposal of a more equal Japan-U.S. security alliance, including joint management of U.S. bases in Japan and having Japanese bases in the United States, which would require changes to a bilateral forces agreement. He called the current alliance “asymmetrical.”
“The measure would contribute to further strengthen the Japan-U.S. alliance,” Ishiba said. “I’ve advocated the idea for more than 20 years and obviously it’s not going to happen suddenly just because I became prime minister.” He also said he hadn’t assigned the matter to his Cabinet as an urgent task. “But I will not give up and will steadily work on it.”
He said Wednesday that he did not raise the issue on his call with Biden but would find the chance to do so later.
Ishiba said he told Biden that he will strengthen Kishida’s defense and diplomatic policies while bolstering networks that include South Korea and other like-minded countries. Japan’s national security strategy adopted by Kishida’s government in 2022 calls for accelerating a Japanese military buildup.
Ishiba earlier said he would call for a snap election on Oct. 27 and named former Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi to head the party’s election task force. On Tuesday, he said he intended to dissolve the lower house on Oct. 9 so his new administration could obtain “the people’s verdict” as soon as possible.
During Tuesday’s parliament session, opposition leaders criticized Ishiba for announcing such a plan before even becoming prime minister and allowing only several days for his policies to be examined and discussed before a national election. They delayed the vote required to approve his new post for about half an hour, despite not having the power to affect it, signaling a rocky beginning for Ishiba.
Ishiba appointed several ministers who voted for him in the party leadership poll, including two former defense ministers with whom he had worked closely — Takeshi Iwaya as foreign minister and Gen Nakatani as defense chief. He retained Kishida’s top confidante, Yoshimasa Hayashi, as chief Cabinet secretary and appointed Katsunobu Kato as finance minister.
Only two of the 19 ministers are women: actor-turned-lawmaker Junko Mihara as children’s policy minister and Toshiko Abe as education minister. The government is under pressure to increase the number of women in public office. Women now account for only 10% of the lower house, placing Japan near the bottom of global gender-equality rankings.

Congress passes temporary bill to avoid shutdown as lawmakers punt spending decisions to December
WASHINGTON (AP) — Congress on Wednesday passed a temporary measure that keeps government agencies funded into December, avoiding a shutdown for now while punting final spending decisions until after the Nov. 5 election.
The Senate approved the measure by a vote of 78-18 shortly after the House easily approved it. The bill generally funds agencies at current levels through Dec. 20. But an additional $231 million was included to bolster the Secret Service after the two assassination attempts against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Money was also added to aid with the presidential transition, among other things.
The bill now goes to President Joe Biden’s desk to be signed into law.
“This bipartisanship is a good outcome for America,” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said moments before the vote. “I hope it sets the tone for more constructive, bipartisan work when we return in the fall.”
House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., billed the measure as doing “only what’s absolutely necessary,” a statement directed at members of his own conference concerned about spending levels.
Still, it was a no-go for some Republicans, which forced House GOP leadership to rely on Democratic votes to pass the bill through a process that requires at least two-thirds support from voting members. The final vote was 341-82, with Republicans supplying all the no votes in both chambers. Johnson said the only alternative to the continuing resolution at this stage would have been a government shutdown.
AP AUDIO: Congress moving swiftly to fund government and avert shutdown before heading home to campaign
Congress is moving quickly to avoid a government shutdown just weeks before the Nov. 5 election. AP correspondent Donna Warder reports.
“It would be political malpractice to shut the government down,” Johnson said. “I think everyone understands that.”
The House floor was largely empty during debate on the measure. Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, was the lone critic among the speakers, saying, “We end up in a vicious circle every year, the same vicious circle.”
Lawmakers in both chambers are anxious to return to their home states and districts to campaign, smoothing the path for passage of the temporary funding fix. But more arduous fiscal negotiations await them at the end of the year.
Under terms of a previous deal to avoid a federal default and allow the government to continue paying its bills, spending for defense and nondefense programs would rise 1% next year.
The Senate has been charting a course to go above that level, while House Republicans have been voting for steep cuts to many nondefense programs, and they have attached policy mandates to the spending bills that Democrats overwhelmingly oppose. So a final agreement will be difficult to reach.
In the meantime, the temporary bill will mostly fund the government at current levels, with a few exceptions like the funding infusion for the Secret Service.
The $231 million for the Secret Service does come with strings attached. It’s contingent upon the agency complying with congressional oversight. The bill also allows the Secret Service to spend its allocations faster if needed.
“Everybody understands that’s critically important right now,” Johnson said of the Secret Service money.
Trump thanked lawmakers for the extra Secret Service funding at a campaign event Wednesday. He had earlier called on Republicans not to move forward on a spending bill without also including a requirement that people provide proof of citizenship when registering to vote. That legislation failed in the House last week.
In a recent letter, the Secret Service told lawmakers that a funding shortfall was not the reason for lapses in Trump’s security when a gunman climbed onto an unsecured roof on July 13 at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and opened fire. But acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr., also made clear the agency had “immediate needs” and that he’s talking to Congress.
“The Secret Service has asked for this additional funding. It’s absolutely essential as they deal with the increased threat environment,” said Sen. Susan Collins, the top Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee.
The continuing resolution is needed because Congress is nowhere close to completing work on the dozen annual appropriations bills that fund much of the federal government. The House has passed five of the 12 bills, mostly along party lines. The Senate has passed zero.
Republicans blame the impasse on Senate Democrats for not putting the dozen appropriations bills on the Senate floor for a vote, where they then could be reconciled with the House bills during negotiations. But Democrats counter that House Republicans are acting in bad faith, bogging the process down by undercutting the agreement that former Speaker Kevin McCarthy negotiated with the White House over spending caps for the 2024 and 2025 budget years.
Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democratic member of the House Appropriations Committee, said her party will accept nothing less than the 1% increase specified in that agreement. Also, if Republicans seek more than that for defense, there must be “dollar for dollar parity for nondefense,” she said.
The White House called on both chambers to pass the stopgap bill, while cautioning that it did not provide adequate funding to help communities recover from natural disasters and failed to include enough funding for health care provided through the Department of Veterans Affairs.
Johnson warned that when the temporary extension expires in December, he will not support a massive, catchall bill to fund the government, referred to as an omnibus, so another stopgap may be needed that would allow the new president and Congress to have the final say on fiscal year 2025 spending levels.
“I have no intention of going back to that terrible tradition,” Johnson said.
Sen. Patty Murray, the Democratic chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, urged House Republicans not to “follow the loudest voices on the far right” in the negotiations for the full-year bill.
“You cannot strike a deal to govern with people who do not really want to govern,” Murray said.",2024-09-25
AP,House approves GOP resolution condemning Biden and Harris over Afghanistan withdrawal,"House approves GOP resolution condemning Biden and Harris over Afghanistan withdrawal
WASHINGTON (AP) — House Republicans on Wednesday voted to condemn President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for the disastrous U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, capping their work in Washington with legislation that carried no legal weight but drove a political point ahead of the November elections.
The resolution passed 219 - 194 with 10 Democrats and all Republicans voting in favor. It condemned Biden, Harris and other officials in the administration for “decision-making and execution failures throughout the withdrawal from Afghanistan” as well as blamed them for the deaths of 13 U.S. service members who were killed by a suicide bomber at Kabul’s airport during the final days of the evacuation.
On the campaign trail, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who as president negotiated the withdrawal deal with the Taliban, has repeatedly blamed Harris for the chaotic and deadly evacuation while she was serving as Biden’s vice president. Harris, now the Democratic candidate for president, has shot back that Trump is to blame for his role in the deal and that she agrees with Biden’s decision to end America’s longest war.
Republicans have used their House majority to make Trump’s case in recent weeks, releasing a report that mostly blamed Biden. On Tuesday, the House Foreign Affairs Committee also advanced contempt of Congress charges against Secretary of State Antony Blinken following a contentious back-and-forth with the Cabinet secretary over an appearance to testify on the withdrawal.
“Three years ago, the world witnessed one of the most devastating policy disasters in American history. The Biden-Harris administration withdrew all U.S. forces from Afghanistan with no plan, no care and no remorse,” Rep. Michael McCaul, the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said on the House floor Wednesday.
“As a result, 13 brave U.S. servicemembers and over 170 Afghan civilians were murdered and 45 U.S. servicemembers and countless others were injured,” added McCaul, a Texas Republican.
Most assessments have concluded Trump and Biden share blame for the collapse that concluded the 20-year war, which saw Taliban fighters take over Afghanistan again before the last American troops even flew out of the Kabul airport. Over 2,000 U.S. troops were killed in Afghanistan.
The reviews, including the 18-month House investigation led by House Republicans, have not pinpointed any instance where Harris had a particular impact on decision-making on the withdrawal.
The main U.S. government watchdog for the war points to Trump’s 2020 deal with the Taliban to withdraw all U.S. forces and military contractors as “the single most important factor” in the collapse of U.S.-allied Afghan security forces and Taliban takeover. Biden’s April 2021 announcement that he would proceed with the withdrawal set in motion by Trump was the second-biggest factor, the watchdog said.
Democrats on Wednesday faulted House Republicans for rushing the resolution to the House floor and criticized it as an attempt to further politicize blame for the withdrawal.
“Republicans are trying desperately to clean up a candidate, a candidate that truly has a flawed record — Trump’s record — on this withdrawal,” said Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.",2024-09-25
AP,"Colorado accidentally put voting system passwords online, but officials say election is secure","Colorado accidentally put voting system passwords online, but officials say election is secure
DENVER (AP) — Voting system passwords were mistakenly put on the Colorado Secretary of State’s website for several months before being spotted and taken down, but the lapse did not pose an immediate threat to the upcoming election, said state election officials Tuesday.
The passwords were only one of two that are needed to access any component of Colorado’s voting systems, and are just one part of a layered security system, said Jack Todd, spokesperson for the the Secretary of State’s office, in a statement. The two passwords are “kept in separate places and held by different parties,” he said.
“This is not a security threat,” said Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold in an interview on 9News Tuesday evening. She said her office is investigating, that not all of the passwords in the spreadsheet were active and there is no reason to believe there’s been a security breach.
Griswold said workers are changing passwords, looking at access logs and chain of custody books.
She frequently calls Colorado the gold standard for election security, though there have been some hiccups in the past. The error has brought criticism from the chairman of the Colorado Republican Party at a time of heightened scrutiny of the country’s election systems, though U.S. elections remain remarkably reliable.
Colorado law requires that election equipment is surveilled and stored in secure rooms — access to which is guarded, tracked and logged. Colorado voters fill out paper ballots, which are audited after the election.
Election officials learned last week that the spreadsheet, which held the passwords in a hidden tab, was available online. Once the lapse was discovered, Todd said, they acted immediately and informed the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.
The executive director of the Colorado Clerks Association, Matt Crane, told 9News that while the lapse was concerning, the association was satisfied with the Colorado Secretary of State’s response.
Chairman of the Colorado GOP, Dave Williams, sent a letter to the department Tuesday demanding that, among other things, the secretary of state confirm that the exposed passwords have since been changed.
Earlier this month, a Colorado county clerk, Tina Peters, was sentenced to nine years behind bars for a data-breach scheme based in false claims about voting machine fraud in the 2020 presidential race.",2024-10-29
AP,"Rare dime bought by Ohio farm family and hidden for decades fetches $500,000 at auction","Rare dime bought by Ohio farm family and hidden for decades fetches $500,000 at auction
TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) — An extraordinarily rare dime whose whereabouts had remained a mystery since the late 1970s has sold for just over $500,000.
The coin, which was struck by the U.S. Mint in San Francisco in 1975, depicts President Franklin D. Roosevelt and is one of just two known to exist without its distinctive “S” mint mark.
Three sisters from Ohio inherited the dime after the death of their brother, who had kept it in a bank vault for more than 40 years.
The coin sold for $506,250 in an online auction that concluded Sunday, according to Ian Russell, president of GreatCollections, an auction house based in Irvine, California.
The only other known example of the “1975 ‘no S’ proof dime” sold at a 2019 auction for $456,000 and then again months later to a private collector.
The mint in San Francisco made more than 2.8 million special uncirculated “proof” sets in 1975 that featured six coins and were sold for $7. Collectors a few years later discovered that two dimes from the set were missing the mint mark.
Russell said the sisters from Ohio, who wanted to remain anonymous, told him that they inherited one of those two dimes but that their brother and mother bought the first error coin discovered in 1978 for $18,200, which would amount to roughly $90,000 today. Their parents, who operated a dairy farm, saw the coin as a financial safety net.",2024-10-28

WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker Mike Johnson is calling on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to fire his country’s ambassador to the U.S. as Republicans criticize Zelenskyy’s visit to an ammunition plant in Pennsylvania, a swing-state, as a political stunt.
The Republican speaker’s demand Wednesday came as Zelenskyy addressed the United Nations in New York on the eve of his visit Washington, where he has plans to brief lawmakers on Capitol Hill about the war effort before meeting with President Joe Biden at the White House.
“The tour was clearly a partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats and is clearly election interference,” Johnson wrote in a letter to Zelenskyy.
Johnson, who is close to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, said no Republicans were invited to the plant tour on Sunday, which he said was arranged by Ambassador Oksana Markarova.
An Army official said it was standard procedure to invite House and Senate members who represent the district where such industrial plants are located. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal discussions, said that in this case interested congressional members from the area attended.
Joining for the visit were the state’s Gov. Josh Shapiro, Sen. Bob Casey and the district’s Rep. Matt Cartwright, all Democrats. The plant is located in Scranton, Biden’s hometown.
The speaker’s stern demand for the swift removal of Markarova, a well-received diplomat in Washington who has been a fixture on Capitol Hill since the outset of the war — even sitting as a guest in the House visitor’s gallery during pivotal speeches — comes at a daunting time for Ukraine as Zelenskyy works to ensure U.S. support for the war effort in an election year.
While Biden and Democrats in Congress have largely stood with Ukraine since the Russian invasion in 2022, sending billions in U.S. aid to buy weaponry and support services, Republicans have split deeply. Trump has turned the GOP toward a new America First movement that generally prefers to limit U.S. involvement overseas, and he often speaks admirably of Russia and its president, Vladmir Putin.
Johnson said that support for ending Russia’s war against Ukraine “continues to be bipartisan, but our relationship is unnecessarily tested,” noting comments from the Ukrainian government about the top of the Trump-Vance presidential ticket.
Trump in his own speech Wednesday lashed out at Zelenskyy and said the people of Ukraine are “dead” and the country itself “demolished,” raising fresh questions about the level of U.S. support the former president would provide to help Ukraine fight Russia if he returned to the White House.
Later Johnson, who said he won’t be meeting Thursday with Zelenskyy at the Capitol, said the ambassador “crossed the line” and the situation requires “immediate attention and action.”
Zelenskyy visited the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant to thank the workers who are producing one of the most critically needed munitions for his country’s fight to fend off Russian ground forces.
The Scranton plant is one of the few facilities in the country to manufacture 155 mm artillery shells and has increased production over the past year. Ukraine has already received more than 3 million of them from the U.S.
“It is in places like this where you can truly feel that the democratic world can prevail,” Zelenskyy wrote on X.
“Thanks to people like these — in Ukraine, in America, and in all partner countries — who work tirelessly to ensure that life is protected.”
Zelenskyy is far from the first foreign leader to visit U.S. plants producing and selling arms to their country, in tours that did not incur Republican protests. The U.S.’s NATO partners in Europe increasingly have made a point of such visits to demonstrate the jobs and money that U.S. alliances bring home to Americans.
Zelenskyy also has met exclusively with Republicans on some past trips while in the U.S. In July, he visited Utah to speak at the National Governor’s Association and was welcomed by the state’s Republican Gov. Spencer Cox, the group’s outgoing chairman. During the visit Zelenskyy also met with Utah’s congressional delegation, all Republicans.
The Scranton visit sparked swift reprisals from the Republicans.
Rep. James Comer, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee, announced Wednesday he was opening an investigation into whether the Biden-Harris administration used taxpayer-funded resources to fly Zelenskyy to Pennsylvania as a campaign event for Vice President Kamala Harris, who is the Democratic nominee for president.
“The Committee seeks to determine whether the Biden-Harris Administration attempted to use a foreign leader to benefit Vice President Harris’s presidential campaign and, if so, necessarily committed an abuse of power,” he wrote in letters to Biden, the White House counsel and others in the administration.
The Pentagon said the flight was funded by the Defense Department for senior officials from the departments of Defense and State “conducting official business related to U.S. security assistance to Ukraine.” The flight stopped at Newark Liberty International Airport, “where they linked up with President Zelensky before continuing to Wilkes-Barre International Airport in Pennsylvania,” the Pentagon said.
Senate Republicans, even those who had supported aid for Ukraine, roundly criticized Zelenskyy on Wednesday. “He really messed up,” said Sen. Markwayne Mullin, an Oklahoma Republican.
However, Sen. Roger Wicker, the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee and a firm backer of Ukraine, suggested that Zelenskyy’s visit was not as partisan as it appeared. Wicker was planning to meet with the Ukrainian president at the Capitol on Thursday.
“If President Zelenskyy came to Mississippi, he would be accompanied by Republican officials because that’s who the people in their wisdom elected,” he said.

AP,Congressional Democrats push resolution that says hospitals must provide emergency abortions,"Congressional Democrats push resolution that says hospitals must provide emergency abortions
WASHINGTON (AP) — A resolution introduced by Congressional Democrats would make clear that U.S. emergency rooms need to provide emergency abortions when a woman’s health or life is at risk, despite strict state abortion bans.
Legislators cited a report by The Associated Press that found more than 100 pregnant women have been denied care since 2022 in introducing the two-page proposal on Thursday.
“It’s an outrage,” Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat of New Jersey who introduced the House resolution, said of the AP’s findings. “Lives are at risk and despite clear federal law and additional guidance from the Biden administration, states across the country are refusing to treat pregnant women in emergencies.”
The resolution has little chance of passing a Republican-controlled House in an election year. Democratic Senator Patty Murray of Washington announced on social media that she would introduce a Senate version of the resolution next week.
Federal law requires that patients who show up at emergency rooms receive stabilizing treatment for medical emergencies. But since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the national right to an abortion and states enacted strict abortion bans, confusion and conflict have emerged when pregnant women have sought help in emergency rooms in states like Texas, Idaho and Florida.
Women suffering from preterm rupture of membranes or dangerous ectopic pregnancies, for example, have been sent home without treatment or, in the worst cases, left to miscarry in public bathrooms.
The U.S. Supreme Court was given the chance to settle the debate of whether the federal law applies to emergency abortions earlier this year but failed to do so. Instead, the conservative majority court issued a narrow order that temporarily allows doctors in Idaho to perform emergency abortions, despite the state’s abortion restrictions, and sent the case back to the lower courts.
Texas, meanwhile, is suing the Biden administration over its guidance around the law that says emergency rooms must perform abortions if a woman’s health or life is at risk. The case could also end up before the Supreme Court.
The AP’s reports found violations involving pregnant women across the country, including in states like California and Washington which do not have abortion bans. But there was also an immediate spike in the number of complaints involving pregnant women who were denied care in states like Texas after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022.
The story of one Black woman who was charged with a felony after miscarrying at home, prompted Rep. Emilia Sykes, D-Ohio, to introduce the resolution Thursday. Ohio doctors would not terminate her non-viable pregnancy because of the state’s abortion law at the time.
“Let me be clear: women should be able to access reproductive health care for when they need it, whenever they need it but especially if they are in a life or death situation.”",2024-09-12
AP,Jobs report on eve of election will be among the most distorted in years,"Jobs report on eve of election will be among the most distorted in years
WASHINGTON (AP) — Four days before Election Day, the government will issue its final snapshot of hiring and unemployment in the United States after a presidential race in which voter perceptions of the economy have played a central role.
Yet Friday’s report will include some of the most distorted monthly employment figures in years, with job growth having been held down temporarily in October by hurricanes and worker strikes.
So just as voters, politicians and Federal Reserve officials are looking for a clear read on the economy, they instead will get a muddied one. The report arrives as Republican allies of Donald Trump, seeking to cast doubt on the economy’s health, have sought to undercut confidence in the credibility of the monthly jobs reports.
Trump and his supporters have repeatedly attacked the Biden-Harris administration for the spike in inflation that peaked two years ago before steadily cooling. Despite healthy job growth, few layoffs and low unemployment, Trump has also charged that the United States is a “failing nation” and has vowed that his plan to implement sweeping tariffs on all imported goods would restore millions of manufacturing jobs.
Typically, the monthly jobs data helps clarify how the economy is faring. But economists estimate that Hurricanes Helene and Milton, combined with the effects of the ongoing strike by Boeing machinists, will have reduced hiring last month by a significant number — roughly 60,000 to 100,000 jobs, most of them only temporarily.
All told, economists have estimated that Friday’s report will show that just 120,000 jobs were added in October, according to the data provider FactSet. That is a decent number, though less than half of September’s unexpectedly robust 254,000 gain. The unemployment rate is expected to remain at a low 4.1%.
Once the impact of the hurricanes and strikes are considered, those figures would still point to a solid job market, one that has shown surprising durability, buoyed by healthy consumer spending, in the face of the Fed’s high interest rates.
“This is a really incredibly resilient economy,” said Jane Oates, a former Labor Department official during the Obama administration. “People are spending. That’s what’s keeping this economy going.”
Yet there may be other effects that the government has a harder time measuring. The Labor Department, for example, has said it thinks the strike by Boeing machinists, along with a smaller walkout by some hotel workers, reduced job growth by 41,000 in October. But some of Boeing’s suppliers may also have shed jobs as the strike cut into their sales. It’s not clear how much of an impact those job losses might have had on the October employment figures.
At the same time, the hurricane might have cost fewer jobs than economists expect. A worker would have to lose pay for an entire pay period — often two weeks — for their job to be considered lost in the government’s data. Though many workers in North Carolina were likely out of work that long, it’s not clear that in Florida, which has had more experience with hurricanes, employees would have missed that much work, Oates said.
Economists at UBS noted that the big amusement parks in Orlando — Walt Disney World, Sea World and Universal — were closed only for two days after Hurricane Milton hit. And in some states, people will be hired as part of the cleanup and rebuilding efforts.
Friday’s jobs report will be the last major snapshot of the economy before the Fed’s next meeting Nov. 7, two days after the election. Most economists expect the Fed to reduce its benchmark rate by a quarter-point, after an outsize half-point cut in September.
If the jobs report suggests that hiring stayed healthy in October excluding the effects of the hurricanes and strike, Republican political figures may question its credibility again. Last month, when the government reported that hiring had jumped unexpectedly in September, Sen. Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, made the baseless charge that the report was “fake.”
Yet no mainstream economists share such skepticism. Other indicators — such as the number of people seeking unemployment benefits, data that is compiled mostly by the states — also point to a still-solid job market.
“I’ve been horrified by the degree to which politicians have made that argument,” said Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter. The Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, which produces the jobs report, “is the most transparent government agency on the planet,” she said.
Trump and other critics have seized on the revisions that are often made to the government’s initial estimates as evidence for their false claim that the Biden-Harris administration has manipulated the data. In August, the BLS said it expected to downgrade its estimate of total jobs in the United States as of last March by 818,000, or about 0.5% of the total. During the presidential debate in September, Trump asserted that the revision reflected “fraud” in the employment data. Yet under his own administration, the BLS revised job counts downward in 2019, by 514,000.
Erica Groshen, a senior economic adviser at Cornell University and a former commissioner of the BLS, explained that such revisions are “not a bug; they are a feature” of the government’s data-gathering.
“BLS wants to get as much timely information out there as possible, but it also wants to have the information be as accurate as possible,” Groshen said.
The way it does that is to release early data, based on surveys of tens of thousands of businesses. Revisions are subsequently made based on late-arriving data from more companies and from actual job counts derived from unemployment benefit agencies.
Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, has often sought to undercut positive hiring data by arguing that all the jobs created in the past year have gone to immigrants.
That claim rests on the fact that the number of “foreign-born” people with jobs, as BLS refers to them, increased 1.2 million in September from a year earlier, while the number of native-born workers with jobs fell by about 800,000.
Yet the “foreign-born” category includes people who have been in the United States for years, including from childhood, and who are now citizens, as well as recent immigrants, both authorized and unauthorized.
More significantly, native-born Americans have been retiring in droves, one reason why so many employers have often had difficulty filling jobs. As the huge baby boom generation ages, the proportion of Americans ages 65 and older has jumped to 17.3%, up from just 13.1% in 2010, according to Census Bureau data.
And the unemployment rate for native-born Americans, at 3.8%, is actually lower than the jobless rate for foreign-born workers, at 4.2%.",2024-10-30

A to-do list, size matters and a ‘petty tyrant': Key moments from Kamala Harris’ speech
WASHINGTON (AP) — Kamala Harris on Tuesday sought to remind Americans what life was like under Donald Trump and then offered voters a different path forward if they send her to the White House, in a speech billed as her campaign’s closing argument.
“I will always listen to you, even if you don’t vote for me,” she said, speaking before a massive crowd that spilled from the grassy Ellipse near the White House to the Washington Monument.
Some key moments from her half-hour speech:
The location of the speech reinforced her message
Harris chose to speak from the Ellipse on purpose. It’s the same spot in Washington where Republican Donald Trump helped incite a mob that attacked the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. But the vice president didn’t devote much of her speech to the violence of that day, instead using the field between Constitution Avenue and the White House more as a backdrop — a quiet reminder of the different choices Americans face.
“Donald Trump has spent a decade trying to keep the American people divided and afraid of each other,” she said, adding that he wants back into the White House “not to focus on your problems, but to focus on his.”
Kamala Harris, the prosecutor, argued her case
Harris spent years working as a prosecutor. She was California’s attorney general before she became a U.S. senator. And she often says on the campaign trail that she’s only ever had one client — the people. In her speech, she talked about her past work taking on scammers, violent offenders who abused women and children, and cartels that trafficked in guns and human beings.
She said she’d bring with her to the White House an instinct to protect.
“There’s something about people being treated unfairly, or overlooked, that just gets to me,” she said.
It’s me, Hi. I’m the presidential nominee. It’s me.
One week before the election, Harris allowed that “I know many of you are still getting to know who I am.”
The Democratic nominee has been running for only three months in a compressed campaign launched after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. Harris still is confronting voters who say they want to learn more about her and how she will govern. So she spent some time Tuesday talking about her career, her goals and background.
“I’ll be honest with you: I’m not perfect. I make mistakes. But here’s what I promise you: I will always listen to you, even if you don’t vote for me.”
To-do list for Day One at the White House
Harris devoted a good chunk of her speech to talking about policies she’d enact if she were to win the White House, including helping first-time homeowners with down payments and aiding the so-called “sandwich generation” of adults who are caring for young children and older parents by allowing elder care to be funded by Medicare. She said she’d work to pass a bipartisan border security bill that tanked last year after Trump encouraged congressional Republicans to let it die.
And she said she would work to bring back abortion protections. “I will fight to restore what Donald Trump and his hand-selected Supreme Court justice took away from the women of America,” Harris said. The Supreme Court, with three Trump-appointed justices, overturned federal protections of abortion in 2022. Abortion has since become one of the most motivating issues for the Democratic base in the 2024 election.
“On Day One, if elected, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list,” she said. “When elected, I will walk in with a to-do list.”

Size matters on the campaign trail — especially to Trump
The Ellipse is a grassy expanse between the White House and the Washington Monument that has long played host to political events and national traditions like the annual holiday tree lighting. On Tuesday, the space was packed. Crowds spilled onto the National Mall back toward the Washington Monument, where giant screens and speakers were set up for people to hear and see from afar.
The cheers of the boisterous crowd could be heard from the White House driveway. Harris’ campaign said it was her biggest rally to date. She’s already packed stadiums and other venues with supporters during her rallies. Harris loves to needle Trump about crowd size — a particular preoccupation for the Republican leader, who claimed the campaign had to bus people in Tuesday to fill the space.
Harris has called Trump ‘unhinged’ and ‘unstable.’ Now she’s adding ‘petty tyrant’
Harris boiled down criticism of Trump into two words: “petty tyrant.”
She warned Trump is a man governed by grievances, one who would focus on himself and his “enemies list” when he got into the White House. She harked back to the nation’s founding when Americans fought for freedom, then sped through decades of hard-fought civil rights battles.
“They did not struggle, sacrifice and lay down their lives only to see us cede our fundamental freedoms. They didn’t do that only to see us submit to the will of another petty tyrant,” she said. “These United States of America, we are not a vessel for the schemes of wannabe dictators.”
Meanwhile, a Biden complication emerges
Just moments before Harris was to speak, Biden was on a campaign call reacting to a comic who called Puerto Rico garbage during a Trump rally last weekend. The president said, “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.”
He’d joined a national call organized by the advocacy group Voto Latino. Biden urged those on the call to “vote to keep Donald Trump out of the White House,” adding, “He’s a true danger to not just Latinos but to all people.”
Biden’s remarks were quicky seized on by Republicans who said he was denigrating Trump supporters, a distraction for Harris when she is trying to reach out to GOP voters.
Biden quickly sent out a social media post seeking to clarify his remarks.
“His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable,” Biden said of Trump. “That’s all I meant to say.”
There’s still plenty to come after what Harris called her ‘closing argument’
The event was framed as a campaign finale meant to lay out in stark terms the choice for voters next week. But it’s far from Harris’ last campaign event. She’ll be hitting all the key battleground states as she makes her last pitch to voters.
She will headline events in Wisconsin, North Carolina and Pennsylvania on Wednesday, and on Thursday she will have rallies in Arizona and Nevada. More events are expected before Election Day.
The campaign is looking to pick up voters across many different demographics in the hope that a swing vote here and there may add up to a win in a razor’s-edge race with Trump.",2024-10-30

MACON, Ga. (AP) — Sabrina Friday scanned the room at Mother’s Nest, an organization in Macon that provides baby supplies, training, food and housing to mothers in need, and she asked how many planned to vote. Of the 30, mostly women, six raised their hands.
Friday, the group’s executive director, said she tries to stress civic duty, an often difficult proposition given the circumstances of her clients.
“When a mom is in a hotel room and there’s six or seven people in two beds and her kids are hungry and she just lost the car, she doesn’t want to hear too much about elections,” Friday said. “She wants to hear how you can help.”
Macon is the largest city in Bibb County, where the majority of residents are Black and one in four of its population lives in poverty. When Joe Biden became president four years ago, he promised to tackle the pernicious gap in racial equity — and in few places is the stubbornness of that challenge as politically significant in this state that could swing the presidential election.
Located about 80 miles (130 kilometers) south of Atlanta, Bibb County is the kind of place where Vice President Kamala Harris would need to run up her margin in order to defeat Donald Trump in this year’s election, a strategy that helped Biden win the state four years ago as he promised to lift up Black Americans. It won’t be easy: Bibb County never recovered all the jobs lost during the pandemic, and Labor Department data show it had more jobs in 2019 under Trump than it does now.
Trump, the former president, sees himself as having an opportunity with Black voters, particularly men. But he and Harris have one thing in common: Each will have a difficult time persuading people to turn out who typically sit out elections. More than 47,000 people in Bibb County were eligible to vote in 2020 and didn’t, a figure roughly four times Biden’s margin of victory across the entire state. Eligible voters are defined as legal residents who are 18 or older, according to Census figures.
AP AUDIO: In battleground Georgia, some poor people see no reason to vote. That decision could sway election
Not every America eligible to vote is excited about casting a ballot. All some mothers in Macon, Georgia are thinking about is feeding their children. AP correspondent Donna Warder reports.
The Biden-Harris administration can claim to have addressed three of the four crises it pledged to fix. The pandemic largely receded three years ago, the economy has improved and there is a genuine commitment of several hundreds of billions of federal dollars to tackle climate change. But racial inequality — as measured by the Federal Reserve — has worsened.
At Mother’s Nest, Linda Solomon, 58, said she and her daughter aren’t voting “ because nothing changes "" no matter who sits in the White House. “Why you gonna vote and ain’t nobody doing nothing?”
While Harris has excited Black voters in and around Atlanta, with its wealthier and better-educated electorate, interviews in Bibb County suggest voters living in far worse circumstances are not moved by the historic nature of her candidacy. Democrats won the county by a 2-1 margin in 2020, and Republicans are increasingly confident they can erode Democrats’ historic advantage of winning roughly 90% of all Black votes.
Janiyah Thomas, Black media director for the Trump campaign, said in an email exchange that “Black voters in rural America hold the key to America’s future, and President Trump is the only candidate who has proven he can deliver real results.”
Thomas said Black unemployment hit historic lows during Trump’s first term, although it ultimately hit a record low of 4.8% in April 2023 under Biden. But the Black unemployment rate is now at 5.6%, more than two percentage points higher than the unemployment rate for white workers and higher than the rate for Asian and Hispanic workers.

Thomas said get-out-the-vote efforts are focused on low-propensity voters, adding that they are using traditional canvassing methods as well as TikTok and outside groups. She estimated the efforts will reach 15 million doors across the battlegrounds.

The Harris campaign is relying on having staff on the ground. It has six people in its Macon office and has been canvassing across the region, including lower-income and rural areas. The campaign believes lower-income voters receive most of their news and information on mobile devices and can be reached by its $200 million digital ad push.
While campaigning, Harris has focused on the middle class, and she has offered plans for small businesses and home buyers.
In places like Macon, that could prove a difficult sale. The clients at Mother’s Nest are not business owners or homebuyers anytime soon, and even Harris’ plan to take on grocery chains for price gouging doesn’t resonate with a population living in food deserts.
The outlook of those patrons falls in line with other Black registered voters. They have an overwhelmingly positive view of Harris, but only about half of them believe the outcome of this presidential election will have “a great deal” or “quite a bit” of impact on them personally, according to a recent poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
But the more nonurban parts of Georgia are only part of the electoral puzzle. It’s a dramatically different story in Atlanta and its vote-rich suburbs where enthusiasm runs high for both Harris and Trump, although often divided by race.
A viewing party of the presidential debate drew scores of well-to-do residents to Buckhead Art & Company in an affluent uptown neighborhood. Many of the dozens of attendees, including the owner and hostess, Karimah McFarlane, were part of the Howard University graduate network. The party had a panel discussion that urged attendees to focus their efforts on getting young Black men to vote. The first thing every guest encountered was the voter registration table, complete with information on Georgia’s system and various deadlines.
McFarlane explained that Atlanta has attracted small business owners and others because of the business-friendly atmosphere. What can be less friendly is the voting system, with some newcomers particularly puzzled by how to vote absentee.
Across town, a voter registration drive at Spelman College targeted first-time voters. Hosted by the members of Harris’ sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha, and their Alpha Phi Alpha brothers from Morehouse College, the event began drawing would-be registrants an hour before sign-ups started. At its peak, dozens of students crowded the tables set up outside the student union and bookstore. The organizations could not campaign for, or endorse Harris, but students spoke freely.
Caleb Cage, 21, a religion major at Morehouse, said he’d seen the excitement rise for the vice president “especially among people in my particular demographic, young people.” Cage is voting absentee in his home state of Maryland.
He said he had heard about young Black men taking their support to Trump and his response was to remember what the vote means. “To reiterate the sentiments of our Morehouse brother, Sen. Raphael Warnock, a vote is a prayer for the future world you want to see. That’s extremely important for young people.”
But, even on a storied historically Black college campus, there was an awareness that the messages that are invigorating college students might not hit others. Elise Sampson, 20, a junior political science major at Spelman and member of the sorority co-sponsoring the registration drive, said economic disparities needed to be part of the discussions.
“It comes down to an accessibility issue,” she said. “When people don’t feel heard and represented, it is hard to want to participate in a political system that doesn’t hear and represent you.”
Malcolm Patterson, a 21-year-old junior finance major at Morehouse from Marietta, Georgia, was at the event to support the activity, adding he was already registered.
“This is my first presidential election,” Patterson said. “It’s important for us to vote on the future we hope to see,” he said.
Poor voters are hidden figures in the election
Even with 2020’s record number of ballots cast, more than 75 million people eligible to vote did not cast ballots, according to a study by the Center for Inclusive Democracy at the University of Southern California.
AP VoteCast, a survey of both voters and nonvoters, showed that nonvoters in 2020 tended to be poorer, younger, less educated, unmarried and minorities. The data, collected by the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, also found that among voters in 2020, 15% reported having a household income under $25,000 in the previous year, compared with roughly 3 in 10 nonvoters. Put those characteristics against a population of 27 million adults who live below poverty, according to the census, and the figures suggest that people on the lower rungs of the economic ladder probably make up a significant subset of all nonvoters.
Georgia was an unlikely cauldron of election turmoil
In 2020, the turnout of people eligible to vote in Georgia was 66.3%, nearly matching the national figure of 66.8%, according to the Center for Inclusive Democracy, with the lowest turnouts among Black and Latino voters.
The Republican-controlled legislature has sought changes aimed at redressing complaints fueled by Trump’s false claims of voting fraud in 2020. (Trump is facing criminal charges in the state for his actions trying to overturn the result.) That includes requiring a hand count of all ballots cast, though a Georgia judge has blocked that at least for now. Another change requires homeless voters to use the address of the county voter registration office rather than where they live, which could add to the impoverished nonvoter numbers.
A microcosm of demographics and census
A majority of Bibb County’s 150,000-plus residents are minorities and over 60% are unmarried. Four in 10 are younger than 30 and nearly half have a high school education or less. The poverty rate is above 25%, more than double the state and national averages.
In interviews with dozens of single moms, grandmothers and some men, it was clear that the campaigns are not addressing their problems.
Solomon came to Mother’s Nest with her grown son and daughter and grandchildren. None of them vote, she said. Her son can’t because of a criminal record but she and her daughter won’t because, “If you ain’t got nothing, nobody has time for you whether you are Black or white. If you’re poor, you’re poor and they ain’t got time.”
Friday, who started the center in 2022, slips in comments on voting and why it’s important, not just nationally but locally, where issues are decided that impact the families directly.
“You’d be surprised that a lot of them just don’t want to because they’ve given up,” she said.
Dr. Tiffany Hall hosted a dental clinic and heard the challenges of the attendees first hand, including how most can’t get preventive dental care until issues become emergencies.
Tynesha Haslem, 36, listened intently. In an interview, she said she remembered voting — she believes during one of Barack Obama’s elections — but voting has not been a priority in a “horrible” life.
She lost the car she had earlier this year and she and her sons spend nights in a hotel. She is not registered to vote now but even if she wanted to, it is unclear that she could because of a felony conviction on her record from 2016 for attacking an ex-boyfriend. Her top priority is getting a job “hopefully in customer service,” she said.
Nonvoters have basic, urgent needs the campaigns don’t address
Cars began lining up, for more than a mile, near the Unionville Missionary Baptist Church for a food and clothing giveaway. The first flurry came in a steady flow for an hour, grabbing canned goods and other produce packaged the night before by church members.
Levita Carter, 55, was one of the church members and also a teacher in the school system. “Our children are coming to school hungry,” she said. “They don’t have sufficient food. They don’t have sufficient clothing.”
Carter’s message to people using the food pantries and Mother’s Nest: “Our vote counts right here. We need to start small in our town and our place and get some people in place right here that can affect change here before we can even get to voting for president.”

GOP lawmakers seek investigation of consulting firm over its work in China
WASHINGTON (AP) — A group of Republican lawmakers is demanding a federal investigation into the U.S. consulting firm McKinsey over its work with the Chinese government and state-owned enterprises, even as the company reportedly is revamping its China business to reduce risks.
A letter — signed by Rep. John Moolenaar of Michigan, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Sen. Joni Ernst of Iowa — asks the Justice Department to investigate whether McKinsey’s $480 million contracts with the Defense Department comply with federal law when the consulting firm also advised China’s national and provincial governments and state-controlled businesses. The three accuse McKinsey of misrepresenting its relationship with the Chinese government.
“McKinsey’s activities pose a serious risk to U.S. national security and may have failed to meet McKinsey’s obligations under federal law,” according to the letter dated Thursday.
McKinsey declined to comment on the letter but has in the past defended its practices in China. It has said it follows the “most rigorous and comprehensive client service policy in our industry.”
The consultancy also has said it does not work for the ruling Chinese Communist Party or the central government but mainly with multinationals and private Chinese businesses.
The lawmakers’ scrutiny over McKinsey’s dealings with Beijing comes as the U.S. and China are becoming increasingly competitive, prompting American politicians to reexamine business ties to ensure Beijing and its military would not get stronger with U.S. help. Beijing also has grown wary of American companies.
The Biden administration has imposed export controls to block China’s access to advanced computer chips and limited U.S. investments in China in areas such as microelectronics, quantum information technologies and artificial intelligence. Last month, a Republican congressional report raised red flags that partnerships between American and Chinese universities could aid Beijing in developing critical technology for military advances.
U.S. companies, which have built experience in China over the past several decades, now are readjusting to the new geopolitical reality. The Wall Street Journal this week reported that McKinsey has cut back on government-linked clients in China and reduced the workforce there by nearly 500 people, or about a third.
The letter by Republican lawmakers accused McKinsey of helping China “rapidly develop its military and economy” through its consulting services. It said McKinsey failed to disclose its work with the Chinese government while acquiring U.S. defense contracts, which amounted to more than $480 million since 2008 and granted McKinsey “access to classified or otherwise sensitive national security data.”
Bob Sternfels, McKinsey’s global managing partner, told the Senate Homeland Security Committee’s subcommittee on investigations in February that “we’ve never worked for the Chinese Communist Party or the central government in China, to the best of my knowledge.”
The letter asserted that McKinsey may have misrepresented its relationship with the Chinese government, citing public information and documents.",2024-10-18

Volpe slam sparks comeback after Freeman homer, Yanks beat Dodgers 11-4 to force World Series Game 5
NEW YORK (AP) — Fifteen years after little Anthony Volpe watched the Yankees parade with the World Series trophy, he saved their season and kept alive hopes for an improbable title.
New York had moved closer to getting swept in the World Series when Freddie Freeman hit another first-inning home run.
Volpe, a New York native whose family idolizes the pinstripes going back generations, turned on a knee-high slider and perhaps reshaped the Series, too. His third-inning grand slam sparked the Yankees to an 11-4 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Tuesday night that forced a Game 5.
“The place was shaking. I felt the ground literally shaking,” Yankees catcher Austin Wells said.
Wells and Gleyber Torres added homers for the Yankees, who broke open the game with a five-run eighth.
New York, which had scored just seven runs in the first three games, had some of its swagger back. Wells spoke after the game wearing a “Fully Operational Death Star” Yankees T-shirt, referring to general manager Brian Cashman’s 2018 quip.
Fans in the sellout crowd of 49,354 chanted Volpe’s name during the ninth inning.
“It’s like you finally got to see the top blow off Yankee Stadium in a World Series game,” Aaron Boone said after his first World Series win as New York’s manager. “When Anthony hits that ball, it was like fun to see Yankee Stadium erupt.”
Wells said the dire situation after Monday’s loss had relieved the pressure.
“Why not go out tomorrow and have fun?” he described as the mood.
Freeman homered for his sixth straight Series game when he deposited a slider from rookie Luis Gil into the right-field short porch following Mookie Betts’ one-out double. He became the first player to homer in the first four games of a World Series and his streak of long balls in six straight games is one more than Houston’s George Springer 2017 and ’19.
“I’ll look back on it after hopefully we win and get this thing done tomorrow,” Freeman said. “Pretty cool. Obviously, hopefully I can keep it going tomorrow.”
Game 5 is Wednesday night, with the Yankees ace Gerrit Cole and the Dodgers’ Jack Flaherty meeting in a rematch of Game 1.
Seeking to become the first team to overcome a 3-0 Series deficit, New York surged ahead 5-2 on Alex Verdugo’s RBI grounder in the second and Volpe’s drive against Daniel Hudson.
“All it takes is just one swing,” Yankees captain Aaron Judge said.
Volpe sent Hudson’s first pitch into the left-field seats.
“I pretty much blacked out as soon as I saw it go over the fence,” Volpe said.
A Gold Glove shortstop in his second big league season, the 23-year-old Volpe also doubled and became the first player in Series history with a grand slam and a pair of stolen bases in one game. He was 8 when the Yankees last won the Series.
Volpe scored New York’s first run when he walked after falling behind 0-2 in the second inning. He made a baserunning blunder when he headed back to second to tag up and failed to score on Wells’ double off the center-field wall — pounding his own leg in anger. Verdugo followed with an RBI grounder.
“They’re going to fight,” Betts said. “If you made it this far, you have a resilient team that’s going to fight the whole time.”
Los Angeles closed within 6-4 in a two-run fifth that included Will Smith’s homer off Gil and an RBI grounder by Freeman. Despite a sprained right ankle, Freeman beat a relay to avoid an inning-ending double play on what originally was ruled an out but was reversed in a video review.
Wells hit a second-deck homer in the sixth against Landon Knack, and Verdugo added another run-scoring grounder in the eighth — capping an 11-pitch at-bat — ahead of Torres’ three-run homer off Brent Honeywell.
Tim Hill, winning pitcher Clay Holmes, Mark Leiter Jr., Luke Weaver and Tim Mayza strung together five innings of one-hit scoreless relief with seven strikeouts, and the Yankees avoided what would have been their first losing Series sweep since 1976.
“As far as outcomes, to have six guys in your ’pen that are feeling good, rested, I feel good about that,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said.
Twenty-one of the previous 24 teams to take 3-0 Series leads went on to sweeps, all but the 1910 Philadelphia Athletics against the Chicago Cubs, the 1937 Yankees against the New York Giants and the 1970 Baltimore Orioles against the Cincinnati Reds. All three of those Series ended in five games.
The 2004 Boston Red Sox, sparked by a stolen base by Roberts, are the only team to overcome a 3-0 deficit in any round, beating the Yankees in the AL Championship Series.
Judge drove in his first run of the Series with an RBI single in the eighth and is 2 for 15 in the four games. Dodgers sensation Shohei Ohtani also is 2 for 15 after going 1 for 4 with a single, his first hit since partially separating his left shoulder in Game 2.
New York stopped a seven-game Series losing streak against the Dodgers dating to 1981. The Yankees got their first seven RBIs from the bottom three hitters in their batting order, Volpe, Wells and Verdugo, who had entered 4 for 32 with three RBIs in the Series.
Volpe was interviewed after the game by former Yankees captain Derek Jeter, now a Fox broadcaster.
“It’s my dream, but it was all my friends’ dreams, all my cousins’ dreams, probably my sister’s dream, too. But winning the World Series was first and foremost. by far. Nothing else compares. So still got a lot of work to do,” Volpe said.
Former Boston star David Ortiz, also a Fox commentator, gave Volpe a shirt.
“I’ve got it in my locker,” Volpe said. “I can’t wear it. It’s got him and Red Sox stuff on it.”
UP NEXT
Cole allowed one run over six-plus innings in the opener -- Kiké Hernández tripled in the fifth as right fielder Juan Soto took a poor route, then scored on Smith’s sacrifice fly. Flaherty gave up two runs in 5 1/3 innings, a two-run homer by Giancarlo Stanton.

AP Decision Notes: What to expect in Louisiana on Election Day
WASHINGTON (AP) — Louisiana voters will decide which presidential candidates will receive their eight electoral votes in the Nov. 5 election. Also on the ballot are races for the U.S. House and a pair of statewide ballot measures.
The state has been reliably Republican in presidential contests since 2000, and much of the state — outside larger metropolitan areas such as New Orleans and Baton Rouge — has gone for the GOP. Fewer and fewer Louisiana residents are registered Democrats, while the number of GOP voters has grown.
Four of the state’s six U.S. House districts are considered safe for Republicans. A fifth is the New Orleans-anchored 2nd District, which has been safe for Democrats. A new wrinkle is the 6th District, a second majority Black district at the heart of a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in May. Two members of the House GOP leadership, Speaker Mike Johnson and Majority Leader Steve Scalise, are up for reelection.
Louisiana is unique in that the Nov. 5 election is an open primary for non-presidential races. That means the state has not yet held primaries to whittle down the field of candidates for office other than president.
To win a seat on Nov. 5, the top candidate must receive at least 50% of the vote, plus one. If no candidate reaches that mark, the top two vote-getters will go on to a Dec. 7 runoff that is known as Louisiana’s general election. All but one of the contests have at least three people running.
Votes for Democrats may be concentrated in the earliest and latest counts on election night. At the beginning of the night, mail ballots and early in-person votes are centrally tabulated and released as one precinct, usually as the first report. Mail ballots have traditionally skewed toward Democratic candidates, though the gap has been growing smaller. Toward the end of the night, vote counts from New Orleans and East Baton Rouge — Democratic strongholds — tend to come in after many other parishes. The question tends to be what impact those early and late bursts of votes for Democrats will be in an increasingly Republican state.
The AP does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it has determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race has not been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why.

AP,Federal judge orders ex-North Dakota lawmaker to jail for violating release terms,"Federal judge orders ex-North Dakota lawmaker to jail for violating release terms
FARGO, N.D. (AP) — A federal judge on Tuesday ordered a once-powerful former North Dakota lawmaker to report to jail for allegedly violating terms of his temporary release as he awaits sentencing for a child sex crime.
U.S. District Judge Daniel Hovland said in his ruling that former state Sen. Ray Holmberg, 80, of Grand Forks, must surrender to the U.S. Marshals Service in Fargo by 1 p.m. Friday.
Holmberg was indicted in October 2023 and pleaded guilty in August to intent to engage in illicit sexual activity. He admitted in the plea agreement that he had paid young male masseuses and had sexual contact with some of them during multiple visits to the Czech Republic, though he said he did not know for certain how old they were.
Holmberg, a Republican, served more than 45 years in the North Dakota Senate before resigning in 2022 amid a federal investigation.
At the August hearing, Hovland allowed Holmberg to remain released, with restrictions, until a later sentencing hearing, citing his age and health concerns. But federal prosecutors said in court documents that Holmberg violated terms of release several times, including accessing social media sites and traveling to a Fargo home without permission.
“Since the entry of a guilty plea on August 8, 2024, Holmberg’s overall conduct does not equate with a good faith effort to fully adhere to all of the conditions of his release while awaiting sentencing,” Hovland wrote in his ruling.
Holmberg’s attorney, Mark Friese, declined comment.
A sentencing date has not been set. Holmberg could face up to 30 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.",2024-10-29

Husband-and-wife food bloggers show how two chefs can navigate the home kitchen and stay happy
NEW YORK (AP) — Husband-and-wife food bloggers and podcasters Sonja and Alex Overhiser have a new cookbook that uses a simple step to keep the kitchen a less heated place for two chefs: clear, alternating roles.
“A Couple Cooks: 100 Recipes to Cook Together” lays out ingredients and directions for a wide array of dishes, like any other cookbook, but also divides the cooking tasks — one home chef is designated a square, the other a triangle — so neither is overwhelmed or resentful.
“Everything is more fun together, we think. And so we found that about cooking,” says Sonja Overhiser from their home in Indianapolis. “You’ll stay doing it if you’re doing it with someone else.”
So to make their Meatballs with Fire-Roasted Marinara, one chef preheats the oven and then starts to make the marinara sauce, while the other prepares the meatballs. They come together at the end to coat the cooked meatballs with the sauce and add Parmesan cheese and basil.
“We’re hoping to break down that factor where people are intimidated by being in the kitchen, where all they want to do is wash dishes because they’re afraid they’re going to burn something,” says Alex Overhiser.
The Overhisers — known online as A Couple Cooks — use this formula throughout their new cookbook, which mixes a few fan favorites with new spins on dishes. But they intend their division of labor to be a suggestion.
“You can always change it up,” says Sonja. “It’s really just kind of an idea of the way that the dance can be performed. There are many other interpretations of that.”
College sweethearts to partners
“A Couple Cooks” leans on the pair’s extensive work as recipe developers and food explorers. There are sections on everyday dinners, romantic ones, breakfasts, large gatherings, sides, sweets, appetizers and snacks, bakes and drinks.
“We wanted to encapsulate all of those different occasions, whether it’s a date night, whether it’s having a dinner party, whether it’s having a snack and a drink at the end of a long day, whether it’s baking something fun together on the weekend,” says Sonja.
The college sweethearts — she is a classically trained musician and journalist; he is a photographer — have been cooking together since 2008, steadily building their repertoire. At the beginning, they were eating frozen food, spaghetti and Hot Pockets.
Their first book, “Pretty Simple Cooking,” was named one of the best vegetarian cookbooks by Epicurious and one of the best healthy cookbooks of 2018 by Mind Body Green.
Their new one is for two cooks, but any kind of two — parent and child, grandparent with grandkid, college roommates, newlyweds or even a neat date idea. The idea is to take the stress out and enjoy partnerships.
“You really can use food as a bonding moment,” says Sonja.
The dishes include tastes from Italy, Spain, France, Greece and Thailand, among others. Ingredients are easy to find and swaps are offered for gluten-free or vegan eaters. Wine pairings are suggested, courtesy of Alex’s knowledge.
One dish they are obsessed with is pizza, having honeymooned in Italy and fallen in love with artisanal versions. When they came home, they wanted to recreate it and say a homemade option is the perfect date dish for two.
Their no-cook sauce uses crushed fire-roasted tomatoes, olive oil, grated garlic, salt and oregano. Toppings include mozzarella, red onion, pepperoncini and pecorino Romano.
Tahini and miso
The Overhisers have a knack for using flavors in unexpected ways, like their banana baked oatmeal that has a maple drizzle with tahini.
“Tahini adds this really kind of nutty intensity to that maple drizzle on top. It’s something we tried once and we’re like, ‘Wow, this tastes incredible,’” says Sonja. “Just kind of adding a surprising element to a recipe makes it so much more fun to eat when it’s unexpected for your palate.”
Or take their vegan risotto, which adds a miso-rosemary broth to asparagus, peas and pine nuts. The couple say they put their heads together to try to make a romantic vegan meal, not an easy task since so many have dairy or meat.
“It’s like how do we get to make this where you don’t say, ‘Oh, I miss my chicken broth,’” says Alex. (“And my Parmesan,” adds Sonja.) “That miso-rosemary broth, you can just drink it alone as a delicious soup it’s so good. And it adds this complexity to the broth, which when you mix it to the rice for your risotto, it’s just outstanding.”
They say they’ve been trained to look out for the user and make things easy for the home cook to understand and organize. That has now extended to the kitchen ballet of two cooks.
“We think our flavors are there and exciting, but we’re also really always thinking about how is someone actually executing this in their kitchen,” says Sonja.

Congress targets Chinese influence in health tech. It could come with tradeoffs
WASHINGTON (AP) — A California biotechnology company that helps doctors detect genetic causes for cancer is among those that could be cut out of the U.S. market over ties to China, underscoring the possible tradeoffs between health innovation and a largely bipartisan push in Congress to counter Beijing’s global influence.
The competition between the world’s superpowers is hitting Complete Genomics, whose employees, some in white lab coats stitched with U.S. flag arm patches, spin samples in test tubes and huddle around computers in San Jose. Its founder and chief scientific officer said he’s frustrated that geopolitics is interfering with science.
“It’s just a loss for the research and for the industry,” Radoje Drmanac said.
The U.S. House this week overwhelmingly passed the BIOSECURE Act, which cites national security in preventing federal money from benefiting Complete Genomics and four other companies linked to China. They work with U.S. drugmakers to develop new medications or help doctors diagnose diseases.
It is part of a sweeping package of bills aimed at countering China’s influence and power, especially in technology, that Congress largely backed this week. The biotech measure, which cleared the House with a 306-81 vote, now heads to the Senate.
Supporters say the legislation is necessary to protect Americans’ health care data, reduce reliance on China in the medical supply chain and ensure the U.S. gains an edge in the biotech field, which both countries call crucial to their economy and security.
Opponents say the bill, which would ban China-linked companies from working with firms that receive U.S. government money, would delay clinical trials and hinder development of new drugs, raise costs for medications and hurt innovation.
Rep. Brad Wenstrup, an Ohio Republican and the bill’s sponsor, said House approval was the first step in protecting Americans’ genetic data and reversing the trend of relying on Beijing for gene testing and basic medical supplies.
“For too long, U.S. policy has failed to recognize the twin economic and national security threats posed by China’s domination of particular markets and supply chains,” he said.
Rep. James Comer, a Kentucky Republican who chairs the House Oversight Committee, said it’s necessary to protect U.S. interests before these companies “become more embedded in the U.S. economy, university systems and federal contracting base.”
Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., argued that the legislation, which he opposed, should not name specific companies without due process, saying, “If one of these five companies does not belong on the list, too bad, Congress doesn’t like you, and that’s that.”
Drmanac of Complete Genomics, a subsidiary of China-based company MGI, said the privacy of Americans’ personal information is not a concern because his company’s instruments are only connected to local U.S. servers.
The company also has argued that Congress should broadly apply data protection standards and requirements rather than targeting a small subset of companies.
Some analysts see the issue as more about industry competition than protecting people’s personal information from the Chinese government.
“You want to make sure that American pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies are on an even footing in terms of their ability to compete both inside the U.S. market and then also abroad,” said Andrew Reddie, a public policy professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies the intersection of technology, politics and security and founded the Berkeley Risk and Security Lab.
Complete Genomics is listed in the legislation along with BGI, MGI, WuXi AppTec and WuXi Biologics. MGI is a spinoff of BGI, a heavyweight genomics company based in China that offers genetic sequencing services for research purposes in the U.S.
BGI Group called the bill “a false flag targeting companies under the premise of national security” and said, “We strictly follow rules and laws, and we have no access to Americans’ personal data in any of our work.”
MGI said the bill would “serve only to stifle competition and foster a monopoly in DNA testing.”
WuXi AppTec and WuXi Biologics work as contractors providing research, development and manufacturing services for U.S. drugmakers. Such services are considered crucial for American pharmaceutical companies to develop and make new drugs.
WuXi AppTec said it and others in the industry are concerned about the bill’s impact on biotechnology innovation, drug development, patient care and health care costs. It urged the Senate not to move forward without addressing “these serious consequences.”
In filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, dozens of U.S. biotech companies have flagged the BIOSECURE Act as a concern, saying it could have major effects on the pharmaceutical supply chain because of the industry’s extensive partnerships with Chinese companies.
Drugmaker Eli Lilly says its third-party suppliers are “sometimes the sole global source for a component” but it has been working to move some development and manufacturing closer to home, which typically takes several years “due to scientific and regulatory complexity and the need to ensure process and product quality.”
BIO, the largest advocacy group for U.S. biotech companies and research institutions, supports the bill, saying it reinforces the industry’s national security imperative.
The bill, which gives U.S. companies eight years to break ties with Chinese firms, has provided “a reasonable timeframe” for the decoupling, group CEO John Crowley said.

Biden announces $3B to reduce carbon emissions at US ports, ‘the linchpin to America’s supply chain’
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Biden administration is awarding nearly $3 billion to boost climate-friendly equipment and infrastructure at ports across the country, including Baltimore, where a bridge collapse killed six construction workers in March and disrupted East Coast shipping routes for months.
President Joe Biden announced the federal funding Tuesday during a visit to the city’s main port, saying the money will improve and electrify port infrastructure at 55 sites nationwide while supporting an estimated 40,000 union jobs, reducing pollution and combating the climate crisis. The presidential visit, a week before Election Day, was intended to highlight efforts by Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to promote clean energy while protecting and creating jobs.
“Ports are the linchpin to America’s supply chain,’' Biden said in a speech at Dundalk Marine Terminal, near the site of the March 26 bridge collapse that closed commercial shipping traffic for nearly three months. A small blue and white sign near the site reminded passersby, “Project funded by President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act,’' the 2022 law approved with only Democratic votes.
While the grant announcement appeared timed to help Harris’ campaign for president, Biden seemingly ignored those concerns as he followed Maryland Democratic Gov. Wes Moore to the outdoor podium, flanked by metal ship containers. “I think he may be the best governor in the country,” Biden said of Moore, bypassing a chance to praise Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.
Biden used his speech to repeatedly criticize former President Donald Trump, and he took an indirect swipe at a controversy Trump is facing after appearing at a weekend rally in New York where racist comments were made about Puerto Rico. Biden emphasized that federal funding for ports includes Puerto Rico. At one point, he even reminded himself with a laugh, “Don’t get going, Joe. Slow up.”
The Port of Baltimore, one of the busiest on the East Coast, is a major hub for the import and export of motor vehicles and farm equipment. More than 20,000 workers support port operations, including unionized longshoremen and truckers.
The Baltimore port and others across the country “keep goods moving — keep the economy strong,″ Biden said. “And they employ over 100,000 union workers, from Teamsters to longshoremen. But for too long, they’ve run on fossil fuels and aging infrastructure, putting workers at risk and exposing nearby communities to dangerous pollution.″
The new funding will help ports and communities across the country cut operating costs and keep consumer prices down, “while slashing carbon pollution and supporting an estimated 40,000 new, good-paying jobs to support clean energy manufacturing all across America,’' Biden said.
“This is about environmental justice,’' he added, citing studies that show higher childhood asthma, cancer and lung and heart disease in residents who live near U.S. ports.
Grants announced Tuesday include $147 million for the Maryland Port Administration to buy and install cargo-handling equipment and trucks to transition the port into a zero-greenhouse-gas-emission facility.
The Maryland port is among 55 ports across 27 states and territories that will receive nearly $3 billion through the Clean Ports Program administered by the Environmental Protection Agency. Ports receiving money include the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the Detroit-Wayne County Port Authority, the ports of Savannah and Brunswick, Georgia, as well as Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Oakland, California.

Protecting people and the environment “doesn’t come at the expense of a booming economy,” EPA Administrator Michael Regan said before Biden’s visit, offering an implicit rebuke to Trump and other Republicans who have complained that strict environmental regulations hinder the economy. “In fact, healthy communities and a strong economy go hand in hand,” Regan said.
The grant announcements, which follow $31 million in federal funds to rehabilitate a section of Baltimore’s Dundalk Marine Terminal, come a week after the owner and manager of the cargo ship that caused the deadly bridge collapse agreed to pay more than $102 million in cleanup costs to settle a lawsuit brought by the U.S. Justice Department.
The settlement does not cover any damages for rebuilding the bridge, a project that could cost close to $2 billion. The state of Maryland has filed its own claim seeking those damages, among others.
Funding though the Clean Ports program will slash more than 3 million metric tons of planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions equivalent to energy use by nearly 400,000 homes for one year, Regan said. It also will cut 12,000 short tons of nitrogen oxides and other harmful pollutants, he said.
John Podesta, senior White House adviser for international climate policy, said the grants will help fulfill a promise by Biden and Harris to “rebuild our nation’s infrastructure and tackle the climate crisis ... and uplift the communities who’ve borne the brunt of pollution.”
In February, the EPA announced two separate funding opportunities for U.S. ports, a competition to directly fund zero-emission equipment and infrastructure and a separate competition for climate change and air-quality programs. More than $8 billion in requests from applicants across the country were received.
Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California hailed the grant announcement, which includes more than $1 billion for seven California ports. The Port of Los Angeles will receive $411 million, the largest award in the country.
“California’s ports move the goods that power our economy,” Padilla said Tuesday, noting that state ports process about 40% of all containerized imports and 30% of U.S. exports. The EPA grants will help decarbonize the U.S. supply chain “to produce cleaner air in neighboring communities and meet our climate goals while creating green jobs,” Padilla said.

The AP has called winners in elections for more than 170 years. Here’s how it’s done
WASHINGTON (AP) — One question will be asked over and over on election night: Who won?
The Associated Press will answer that question for nearly 5,000 contested races across the United States and up and down the ballot, from president and state ballot measures to a variety of local offices.
The AP has compiled vote results and declared winners in elections for more than 170 years, filling what could otherwise be a critical information void of up to a month between Election Day and the official certification of results.
What goes into determining the winners? A careful and thorough analysis of the latest available vote tallies and a variety of other election data, with the ultimate goal of answering this question: Is there any circumstance in which the trailing candidate can catch up? If the answer is no, then the leading candidate has won.
Analyzing the vote
Race calls are based on provable facts, primarily from the AP’s vote count, which is compiled from state and local election offices around the nation.
As more and more ballots are tabulated starting on election night, the AP will monitor the incoming vote at the county level and analyze who is in the lead and what areas the votes are coming from.
At the same time, the AP tries to determine throughout the night how many ballots are uncounted and from what areas. State and local election officials don’t immediately know by election night exactly how many ballots were cast in every contest. Determining how many remain has become more complicated because of the growing number of ballots cast by mail that may arrive after Election Day, which is Nov. 5 this year.
This means there are usually no official and exact tallies of the outstanding vote to rely on once the vote counting gets underway. As a result, the AP estimates the turnout in every race based on several factors and uses that estimate to track how much of the vote has been counted and how much remains.
The AP also tries to determine how ballots counted so far were cast, and the types of vote — such as mail ballots or Election Day in-person — that remain.
That’s because the method a voter chooses often speaks to whom they voted for. Since the issue of voting by mail became highly politicized in the 2020 election, most mail votes nationally have been cast by Democratic voters, while most in-person Election Day votes have been cast by Republicans.
In many states, it is possible to know which votes will be counted first from past elections or plans announced by election officials. In some others, votes counted so far are clearly marked by type.
This helps to determine if an early lead is expected to shrink or grow. For example, if a state first counts votes cast in person on Election Day, followed by mail-in votes, that suggests that an early Republican lead in the vote count may narrow as more mail ballots are tabulated. But if the reverse is true and mail ballots are counted first, an early Republican lead could be the first sign of a comfortable victory.

Finding clues from election data
The AP’s analysis to determine the winners is also greatly informed by other election data, especially the long-standing voting trends in a given area. Past election results over time show that states and counties with a long history of lopsided Republican or Democratic victories tend to continue the same voting patterns from one election to the next.
Even in closely contested races, comparing current vote patterns with those in past races can provide important clues.
For example, if a Democratic candidate is performing a few percentage points better across all counties that have reported votes in a state a Democrat previously won by a narrow margin, that could be a sign of a more comfortable Democratic victory. But if the Republican is performing a few percentage points better, that could point to an exceedingly close race or even a flipped result.

Large changes in an area’s voting patterns that differ substantially from statewide trends are certainly possible but tend to take root over a time frame of multiple elections. This helps analysts understand whether one candidate’s lead is an expected result or a sign of tight race. It also helps determine whether the remaining uncounted ballots are from areas that would likely benefit one candidate over another.
Demographic data can also shed light on the vote count. For example, shifts that differ from statewide patterns might be explained by a shift among a specific group, such as Hispanic voters or white voters without college degrees.
Harnessing AP VoteCast
Another tool available to the AP’s decision teams is AP VoteCast, a comprehensive, 50-state election survey that provides a detailed snapshot of who voted in an election and what was on their minds when they voted. Data from AP VoteCast makes it possible in some cases to call non-competitive or less competitive races as the polls close or shortly afterward with the initial release of votes.
When considering poll-close calls, the AP will only declare a winner if AP VoteCast data confirms the expected result in that contest based on past vote history and other preelection data.
When does the AP call a race?
In almost all cases, races can be called well before 100% of the votes have been counted. The AP’s team of election journalists and analysts will call a race as soon as a clear winner can be determined. That may sound obvious, but it is the guiding principle that drives the organization’s election race-calling process.
The AP’s race calls are not predictions and are not based on speculation. They are declarations based on an analysis of vote results and other election data that one candidate has emerged as the winner and that no other candidate in the race will be able to overtake the winner once all the votes have been counted.
Why might the AP not declare a winner?
The AP may delay calling a winner if the vote results go against the expected outcome of the contest as indicated by the available election data. In other words, if the vote results show a large lead for one candidate but some combination of the past vote history, demographic data or AP VoteCast data point to a different outcome, the AP would carefully review the vote results before making any determination.
In competitive races, AP analysts may need to wait until additional votes are tallied or to confirm specific information about how many ballots are left to count.
The AP may declare that a race is “too close to call” if a race is so close that there’s no clear winner even once all ballots except for provisional and late-arriving absentee ballots have been counted.
Competitive races where votes are actively being tabulated — for example in states that count a large number of voters after election night — might be considered “too early to call.” The “too close to call” designation is not used for these types of races.
The AP may also decide not to call a race if the margin between the top two candidates is less than 0.5 percentage points unless it determines that the margin is wide enough that it could not change in a recount.
Things that don’t affect a call
AP race calls are never made based on lobbying from campaigns or political parties or announcements made by other news organizations, or on candidate victory speeches. Although it will never call a winner based on a concession speech, in some cases, a concession is the final piece of the puzzle in confirming that there will be no recount in a close race.

FACT FOCUS: A look at the false information around Hurricanes Helene and Milton
Back-to-back hurricanes that brought death and devastation to parts of the South were made worse by a wide range of false and misleading information, some of which still circulates even though they have been conclusively proven false.
Coming in the closing weeks of a hard-fought presidential election, the false information became political fodder, particularly in swing states hit hard by Hurricane Helene and then Hurricane Milton. Former President Donald Trump has pushed a litany of false claims at campaign events and on social media with his supporters helping give voice to the information.
Federal, state and local officials, including several Republicans, have condemned the false information, noting that it has made it more difficult to address the needs of those hurt by the hurricanes.
Here’s a look at the facts around some of the most pervasive misinformation.
The government cannot create or manage hurricanes
CLAIM: The government used weather technology to create Hurricanes Helene and Milton, deliberately targeting Republican voters.
THE FACTS: Both hurricanes were natural phenomena. Humans do not have the technology to control such vast weather systems. Hurricanes are hitting many of the same areas they have for centuries.
Fully developed hurricanes release massive amounts of heat energy — the equivalent of a 10-megaton nuclear bomb every 20 minutes, according to National Hurricane Center tropical analysis chief Chris Landsea.
“If meteorologists could stop hurricanes, we would stop hurricanes,” said Kristen Corbosiero, a professor of atmospheric and environmental sciences at the University at Albany. “If we could control the weather, we would not want the kind of death and destruction that’s happened.”
Historical efforts to control hurricanes have failed. For example, between the 1960s and ‘80s, the federal government toyed with the idea of making storms bigger in size but weaker in intensity. But tests were inconclusive and researchers realized if they made storms larger they would put more people at risk. A 1947 attempt by General Electric and the U.S. military in which dry ice was dropped by Air Force planes into the path of a hurricane in an attempt to weaken it also didn’t work.
The federal government was falsely accused of a lack of response following Helene
CLAIM: The federal government did not respond to Hurricane Helene and intentionally withheld aid to victims in Republican areas.
THE FACTS: Both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, have actively supported recovery efforts.
Biden approved major disaster declarations for Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia, allowing survivors to access funds and resources to jumpstart their recovery immediately. The White House announced that the president spoke by phone on Sept. 29 with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp; North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper; Scott Matheson, mayor of Valdosta, Georgia, and Florida Emergency Management Director John Louk. Kemp confirmed on Sept. 30 that he spoke to Biden the night before and that the state was getting everything it needed.
Harris visited FEMA headquarters in Washington on Sept. 30. She called Helene’s devastation “heartbreaking” and vowed that she and Biden would make sure the impacted communities “get what they need to recover.”
The president and vice president have both been to areas impacted by Helene.

Federal officials do not have plans to seize some hard-hit communities
CLAIM: The federal government plans to seize and bulldoze some especially hard-hit communities like Chimney Rock, North Carolina, and prevent residents from rebuilding on their own property.
THE FACTS: That’s not true, according to local officials. Shortly after Chimney Rock was devastated by Helene’s floods, posts began circulating on social media claiming the federal government planned to seize all of the community’s property through eminent domain and not let residents return or rebuild. Some versions of the claim suggested authorities weren’t even going to allow residents to reclaim the bodies of storm victims, or that communities were being seized as part of a federal scheme to gain control of valuable lithium mines nearby.
Far-right extremists and white-supremacist groups picked up the claim on platforms like Telegram and sought to link false claims about the lithium mines to efforts to fight climate change by boosting electric vehicles, which use lithium in their batteries. Officials from both parties who represent the area and are overseeing recovery efforts said none of that is true.
FEMA cannot arbitrarily seize private property or condemn whole communities, and the federal government has no plans to seize mines or force entire towns to relocate.
“I encourage you to remember that everything you see on Facebook, X, or any other social media platform is not always fact. Please make sure you are fact checking what you read online with a reputable source,” U.S. Rep. Chuck Edwards, a North Carolina Republican, wrote to his constituents in a message debunking several viral claims about the storm.
FEMA assistance of $750 is a starting point for those in need. It does not have to be repaid
CLAIM: Hurricane survivors will only get a $750 loan from FEMA, which will seize their land if they don’t pay it back.
THE FACTS: That’s not true. Keith Turi, acting director of FEMA’s Office of Response and Recovery, said that this figure refers to help the agency can give someone in an affected area for immediate needs, like clothing or food.
FEMA wrote on its “Hurricane Rumor Response” page that such payments are called Serious Needs Assistances and can be used while the agency assesses an applicant’s eligibility for additional funds.
The maximum amount for initial Serious Needs Assistance was raised to $770 on Oct. 1. Serious Needs Assistance is a grant that does not need to be repaid. Jaclyn Rothenberg, a FEMA spokesperson, confirmed in an X post that the agency does not “ask for this money back.”
Certain FEMA grants may need to be paid back, although this is less common. For example, if a survivor receives duplicate benefits from insurance or another source.
FEMA is not short of hurricane assistance because it went to other causes
CLAIM: FEMA doesn’t have enough money for hurricane victims because it is being used to help immigrants in the country illegally or going to foreign funding for Israel and Ukraine.
THE FACTS: That’s incorrect. FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell said Wednesday on MSNBC, “There is the money in my budget — the Disaster Relief Fund — to continue the response efforts for Hurricane Helene and Milton.” She added that the agency will need to assess how much money will be left to continue recovery projects and respond to future storms this season.
FEMA’s disaster relief fund gets replenished every year by Congress and is used to pay for recovery from hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and other disasters. Congress recently replenished the fund with $20 billion — the same amount FEMA got last year. About $8 billion of that is set aside for recovery from previous storms and mitigation projects. It funds foreign military aid separately.
No money from FEMA’s fund has been diverted to support border issues or international concerns and is only being used for disaster-related efforts, according to the agency.
The helicopter that blew supplies around a North Carolina distribution center was attempting to make a delivery
CLAIM: The federal government is flying unmarked helicopters into Hurricane Helene staging zones and purposely destroying aid meant for victims in western North Carolina.
THE FACTS: These claims are based on a video that showed a helicopter flying above a parking lot where hurricane aid was being collected. As it hovered above the area, it kicked up debris and supplies at the site and toppled canopies.
The North Carolina National Guard said in a statement issued on Tuesday that the video shows one of its helicopters attempting to make a generator delivery requested by a local civilian organization to power their supply distribution site. As the helicopter descended into a Burnsville parking lot being used for assistance efforts, it kicked up debris and supplies at the site and toppled canopies. The landing was aborted for safety reasons.
Megan George, a dog trainer and former Coast Guard veteran who first posted the video, told The Associated Press that she did not intend for it to be used as proof of government maleficence, but rather as documentation of a dangerous situation about which she wanted answers.
According to the National Guard statement, the helicopter’s crew has been grounded until an investigation into the incident is complete.

AP,A year ago Kevin McCarthy was booted as House speaker. Mike Johnson is trying to avoid that fate,"A year ago Kevin McCarthy was booted as House speaker. Mike Johnson is trying to avoid that fate
A year ago Kevin McCarthy was booted as House speaker. Mike Johnson is trying to avoid that fate
WASHINGTON (AP) — One year since Kevin McCarthy was booted from the House speaker’s office after Congress voted in a bipartisan way to prevent a federal government shutdown, the new House Speaker Mike Johnson finds himself courting, but so far avoiding, a similar political fate.
Johnson is leading the House this week to vote on legislation to fund the government and ensure no interruption in federal services, but he’s similarly abandoning demands from his own hard-right Republican colleagues and relying on Democratic votes and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries to push the package to bipartisan approval.
While Johnson appears to be in no imminent threat of being ousted — the way McCarthy lost his position in a historic vote last fall when eight hardline Republicans engineered a motion to vacate the speaker — the new leader’s ability to hold on to the speaker’s gavel for the long term is not at all certain.
“It’s a tough job,” said McCarthy, who is now retired from Congress and watching from the sidelines.
The government funding vote provides a notable capstone to what has been an extraordinary and tumultuous session of Congress with the House Republican majority that swept to power in January 2023, as lawmakers now prepare to face voters.
The outcome of November’s election will determine the White House and control of Congress, and may very well decide Johnson’s political future. Colleagues are weighing whether to keep Johnson or try someone else as their leader ahead of internal party voting expected later in November after the election.
“The vast majority support Speaker Johnson — it’s a shame that we’ve got like 10 people that always hold this over his head,” said Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, among the more centrist Republicans.
“He’s a good man. He’s got a great heart,” Bacon said. “I think he’s learned a lot this year.”
On the job for the past 11 months, Johnson had been an unlikely choice for the speaker’s gavel. The Louisiana congressman was a relatively unknown low-rung party leader, first elected to office in 2016 alongside Donald Trump, when he emerged as Republicans’ last-ditch consensus choice to replace McCarthy.
Republicans had fought behind closed doors over who should become their new speaker after they took the historic step of ousting McCarthy — passing over their Majority Leader Steve Scalise, their GOP Whip Tom Emmer and hard-right Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, among others — before Johnson stepped up and won support, with Trump’s blessing.
Johnson, a lawyer, had led one of Trump’s main legal cases challenging President Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 election and could play a prominent role in the 2024 election amid potential legal challenges to the outcome.
As the new speaker, Johnson inherited a bitterly divided House GOP majority and worked quickly to pick up the pieces. He cleaned out the speaker’s staff at the Capitol, moved in his own team — and closely aligned himself with Trump, throwing his support behind the indicted former president’s bid to retake the White House.
Johnson prioritized several House initiatives, from the Biden impeachment inquiry to the House impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, that aligned tightly with Trump’s agenda.
But the annual spending fights over the federal budget always loomed over Johnson’s term. With the Sept. 30 deadline signaling the end of the fiscal year, the House GOP’s ultraconservative flank agitated for the speaker to push for spending cuts, even if it meant throwing the government into a shutdown.
Trump urged the House Republicans to take a hardline approach.
“I wish he would take Trump’s advice,” said Rep. Ralph Norman, R-South Carolina, a member of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, who said of Johnson: “He’s risk averse.”
But with a very slim majority that leaves Johnson with just a few votes to spare on any issue, he needs almost unanimity from his own ranks to pass legislation over the objections of Democrats. He already survived one attempt from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to boot him from office this year.
Ahead of Wednesday’s expected vote on the spending plan, Johnson defended his decision, saying it would have been “political malpractice” to lead the government into a federal shutdown weeks before the election.
Johnson said he had tried to run what he called “the best play” he could, which was attaching a bill called the SAVE Act, which would prevent immigrants who are in the U.S. without legal status from voting in the nationwide elections, even though that’s already the law and experts say it rarelyhappens.
But that approach from the speaker failed, voted down by more than a dozen Republicans along with almost all Democrats. A similar dynamic played out on several other bills to fund the various agencies when lawmakers opposed the steep budget cuts or the specific policy provisions as too extreme.
“So we have to go with the next available thing,” Johnson said at his weekly press conference Tuesday.
Johnson described the temporary government funding bill, which will keep operations going until Dec. 20, as bare bones, with no add-ons — except for $231 million for the U.S. Service in the aftermath of the two assassination attempts on Trump this election season.
He insisted he and Trump are “on the same page” on the strategy and have spoken “at great length” about the situation. And Johnson vowed House would hold the line against extra spending next time, in December, when the next round of funding will be needed.
“There’s no daylight between us,” Johnson said of Trump.
One key difference between the situation McCarthy faced and this week’s vote is that last year Congress was also considering funding to help Ukraine buy weapons as it battles the Russian invasion, something Trump and the hard-right flank did not support, and it was eventually dropped from the final bill.
Extra war funding is not included in this week’s temporary bill either, but Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is expected on Capitol Hill later this week as he presses Congress to ensure ongoing support.
“I actually think Kevin McCarthy would have done much better,” said Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., an ultraconservative who opposes most of the spending bills.
Massie said he thinks “the only way Mike Johnson gets reelected speaker is he gets a lifeline from Trump, should Trump win the White House.”
As for the eight House Republicans who dislodged McCarthy, they’ve had their own political journeys since then — one, Rep. Bob Good of Virginia, a former chairman of the Freedom Caucus, lost his primary bid for reelection.
McCarthy, meanwhile, is not necessarily eying any comeback, but fundraising for the House majority and showering Republicans in tight reelection contests with money to run their campaigns — and opposing those who crossed him.

AP,Don't count on a recount to change the winner in close elections this fall. They rarely do,"Don’t count on a recount to change the winner in close elections this fall. They rarely do
Don’t count on a recount to change the winner in close elections this fall. They rarely do
WASHINGTON (AP) — With the American electorate so evenly divided, there will be elections in November close enough that officials will have to recount the votes. Just don’t expect those recounts to change the winner. They rarely do, even when the margins are tiny.
“The (original) count is pretty accurate because the machines work — they work very well,” said Tammy Patrick, a former election official in Arizona who is now with the National Association of Election Officials. “We have recounts and we have audits to make sure we got it right.”
There have been 36 recounts in statewide general elections since America’s most famous recount in 2000. That year, Republican George W. Bush maintained his lead over Democrat Al Gore in Florida — and won the presidency — after a recount was stopped by the Supreme Court.
Since then, only three of those statewide recounts resulted in a new winner, and all three were decided by hundreds of votes, not thousands. That’s according to an Associated Press review of statewide recounts using data from the AP vote count, state election offices and research by FairVote, a nonpartisan organization that researches elections and advocates for changes in the way elections are conducted.
Most states allow recounts when the margin between the top candidates falls within a specific margin, such as 0.5 percentage points, even when that means the number of votes separating them is actually in the thousands or even tens of thousands. But there is no precedent for a recount changing the winner in a race with margins that big, at least not since Congress made sweeping changes to U.S. election law in 2002.
The most recent statewide race overturned by a recount was in 2008 in Minnesota. Republican Sen. Norm Coleman led Democrat Al Franken by 215 votes in the initial count, out of more than 2.9 million ballots cast. After a hand recount, Franken won by 225 votes, a shift of 0.02 percentage points, or two one-hundredths of a percentage point.
Among the 36 statewide recounts since 2000, the average change in the winning margin, whether it grew or shrank, was 0.03 percentage points. The biggest shift was 0.11 percentage points in a relatively low turnout race for Vermont auditor in 2006. In that race, incumbent Republican Randy Brock led Democrat Thomas Salmon by 137 votes after the initial count. A recount flipped the race and Salmon won by 102 votes.
Recounts aren’t limited to general elections. They happen in primaries, too.
Earlier this year, the Washington state primary for commissioner of public lands went to a recount after the initial tally had Democrat Dave Upthegrove leading Republican Sue Kuehl Pederson by 51 votes, out of more than 1.9 million votes counted, as they vied for second place.
After the recount, Upthegrove’s lead shrank by just two votes. In Washington’s primary system, the top two candidates advance to the general election, regardless of their political party.
There are even more recounts in downballot races that are sometimes decided by a handful of votes. But even in these lower turnout elections, recounts rarely change the winners.
“Recounts are shifting a very small number of votes,” said Deb Otis, director of research and policy at FairVote. “We’re going to see recounts in 2024 that are not going to change the outcome.”

States have a wide variety of laws on when and how recounts are conducted. Many states have automatic recounts if the margin between the top two candidates is within a certain margin. The most common margin is 0.5 percentage points, but there is a lot of variation. Some states allow candidates to request recounts but require that they pay for them — unless the winner changes.

Alaska, Montana, South Dakota and Texas mandate recounts only if there is an exact tie, though candidates in those states can request a recount. South Carolina has automatic recounts if the margin between the top two candidates is 1% or less of the total votes cast in the race.
The AP may declare a winner in a race that is eligible for a recount if the AP determines the lead is too large for a recount or legal challenge to change the outcome.
In Washington’s public lands primary, which was ultimately decided by 49 votes, the AP waited until after the recount to declare the winner because the margin was so close. But in cases where the number of votes separating the top candidates is larger, for example in a statewide race where the candidates are separated by thousands or tens of thousands of votes, the AP may determine that it’s not possible for a recount to reverse the outcome.
Statewide recounts almost always change the results by a few votes.
Patrick said that’s usually because of human error -– either by an election worker or by voters. For example, paper ballots are often rejected because voters didn’t fill them out correctly, but they might later get added to the count after a review.
Paper ballots usually require voters to fill in little bubbles next to their chosen candidate, just like students taking standardized tests. Tabulation machines count the votes by looking for a mark on a very specific area of the ballot, Patrick said. If voters indicate their preference in some other way, like circling their chosen candidate, the machines won’t count the vote.
In some states, bipartisan panels review rejected ballots to see if they can determine the intent of the voter. Some states do these reviews whether there is a recount or not. Other states only do them if there is a recount. Still others never do these reviews and the ballots are simply rejected.
Patrick said she’s seen ballots marked many different ways that weren’t picked up by the tabulation machines, like voters using crayons or marking their choices with a highlighter.
In the Minnesota recount, a voter filed in the dot for Franken but also wrote “Lizard People” in the box for write-in votes. The ballot was rejected.
“Voters do a lot of very interesting things with their ballots,” Patrick said.

How voting before Election Day became so widespread and so political
WASHINGTON (AP) — Voters had plenty to argue about in the 1972 election, but they overwhelmingly agreed that when it came time to vote, they would do so in person on Election Day.
The act of voting was largely a communal experience that year, when roughly 95% of voters went to their local polling places and completed and submitted their ballots in person on a single day, according to a census survey at the time.
That number would fall gradually over the next 50 years as states provided Americans with more options on how and when to vote.
By 2022, only about half of the electorate voted at the polls on Election Day. The share of people voting before Election Day spiked to more than 70% in 2020, and votes cast by mail surpassed those cast on Election Day for the first time ever. That year, many states enacted emergency measures to temporarily expand vote-by-mail options to protect voters from the spread of COVID-19.
“We’ve been on an upward trend of early voting over time as more states have adopted early voting options and voters have embraced them,” said University of Florida political science professor Michael McDonald, who tracks voter turnout and early voting. “That’s resulted in a greater share of early votes being cast each election cycle.”
For most of that time, advance voting was a nonpartisan feature of elections, but a deep chasm formed between the parties on advance voting during and since the 2020 presidential election.
Voting before Election Day is much more common today than it was roughly 50 years ago. Yet it is highly politicized as voting in the 2024 presidential election is already underway.
What is advance voting?
Advance voting refers to the range of options that people have to vote before Election Day, whether by mail or in person at an election facility.
The term “early voting” can refer collectively to all voting that takes place before Election Day. Sometimes it refers explicitly to votes cast in person at local election offices or voting centers before Election Day.
To avoid confusion, The Associated Press generally uses terms like “advance voting” or “pre-Election Day voting” to refer to that broader category and “early in-person voting” for the narrower one. “Absentee voting” usually refers to ballots cast by mail.
What are the different types of advance voting?
Voting before Election Day includes both voting by mail and in-person voting conducted before Election Day.
Early in-person voting tends to mimic the experience of voting in person on Election Day, down to the type of voting equipment used and the locations serving as voting centers. The main difference is that the voting is conducted before Election Day. The length of early in-person voting periods varies by state.
Mail voting can be further divided into at least two smaller categories: “no-excuse absentee voting,” where any voter may request a mail ballot for any reason, and “excuse-required absentee voting,” where only voters with a valid excuse as to why they cannot vote in person on Election Day may vote by mail.
Requiring an excuse to vote absentee, such as travel or illness, used to be the norm in most states. Today, a shrinking handful of states still require voters to provide an authorized excuse.
A third category of mail voting is a hybrid of mail voting and early in-person voting: in-person absentee voting, where a voter submits (and sometimes fills out) a mail ballot in person at an elections office.
A small but growing number of states conduct their elections predominantly by mail. Those states, plus a few others and the District of Columbia, automatically send every registered voter a ballot.
When did advance voting begin?
Variations of absentee voting and voting over multiple days have been part of American elections since the nation’s founding. Today’s system of mail voting and early in-person voting took root more than a century ago. In 1921, Louisiana paved the way for a formalized early in-person voting system when its constitution specified that “the Legislature may provide a method by which absentee voting will be permitted other than by mail.”
Voting by mail is even older, but relatively few voters were allowed to take advantage of it as of 1972. Just two years later, Washington became the first state in the nation to allow any voter to request a mail ballot for any reason.
By 2005, more than half the states adopted no-excuse absentee voting. Today, only Alabama, Mississippi and New Hampshire provide neither early in-person voting nor no-excuse absentee voting.
Does one political party use advance voting more than the other?
Yes, but it wasn’t always that way.
Voting before Election Day steadily grew more popular in both Democratic and Republican-controlled states after 1972. Although there was a partisan split in some states that sometimes varied from election to election, polling from Gallup shows that nationwide there was little partisan divide on advance voting between 2004 and 2016. But the survey showed that voters’ plans to use early voting sharply diverged along party lines in the 2020 presidential election.
AP’s VoteCast survey of the 2020 electorate found a similar result, with additional details on how the choice of voting method divided the electorate. About two-thirds of the votes cast by mail in that election were for Democrat Joe Biden, compared with about one-third for Republican President Donald Trump. In contrast, Trump won about two-thirds of the in-person Election Day vote, compared with about one-third for Biden.
When it came to early in-person voting, there was a near-even split, with Trump having only the slightest advantage.
Biden overperformed among those casting votes before Election Day, especially among mail-in voters, even in many states that Trump won by a wide margin, VoteCast showed.
“This is just an across-the-board, national phenomenon,” McDonald said.
These patterns continued in the 2022 midterm elections, with Democrats accounting for the bulk of the mail vote, Republicans casting most of the Election Day vote and Republicans holding a small advantage in early in-person voting.
McDonald noted that party behavior on pre-Election Day voting was, if anything, the opposite before 2020.
“People who voted by mail tended to be more Republican than the people who voted in-person early,” he said, but those patterns “were suddenly turned upside down” during the pandemic.
What led to the partisan split in advance voting?
During the 2020 election, Trump repeatedly disparaged, politicized and undermined mail voting, going as far as to block funding to the U.S. Postal Service to thwart its ability to process mail ballots he claimed without evidence were susceptible to widespread tampering.
Trump’s messaging on mail balloting has been somewhat inconsistent. At times he has said “absentee voting” is “ good. ” But he also has claimed that mail voting is ripe for fraud, something not borne out by decades of mail voting conducted in every state. Trump himself has cast mail ballots on multiple occasions, including in the 2020 primaries.
Trump’s rhetoric seems to have taken a toll on Republican confidence in mail voting. An AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted in 2023 found that 58% of Republicans were not very or not at all confident that mail votes would be counted accurately, compared with 32% in 2018. Among Democrats, confidence in the counting of mail ballots increased, from 28% saying they were very or extremely confident in 2018 to 52% in 2023.
What will advance voting look like in 2024?
“We need to wait and see how 2024 plays out before we make definitive statements about what the early voting is telling us” about the election, McDonald said.
Absentee voting in some states began as early as mid-September, and more than half the states had begun some type of voting by Oct. 1.

Election officials are fighting a tsunami of voting conspiracy theories
ATLANTA (AP) — Voting machines reversing votes. More voters registered than people eligible. Large numbers of noncitizens voting.
With less than two weeks before Election Day, a resurgence in conspiracy theories and misinformation about voting is forcing state and local election officials to spend their time debunking rumors and explaining how elections are run at the same time they’re overseeing early voting and preparing for Nov. 5.
“Truth is boring, facts are boring, and outrage is really interesting,” says Utah’s Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, a Republican who oversees elections in her state. “It’s like playing whack-a-mole with truth. But what we try to do is just get as much information out there as possible.”
This year’s election is the first presidential contest since former President Donald Trump began spreading lies about widespread voter fraud costing him reelection in 2020. The false claims, which he continues to repeat, have undermined public confidence in elections and in the people who oversee them among a broad swath of Republican voters . Investigations have found no widespread fraud or manipulation of voting machines four years ago, and each of the battlegrounds states where Trump disputed his loss has affirmed Democrat J oe Biden’s win.
In the past week, U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene claimed a voting machine had changed a voter’s ballot in her Georgia district during early voting, and Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of the social media platform X, has promoted various conspiracy theories about voting machines and voter fraud both online and at a rally for Trump in Pennsylvania.
The floodgates are “very much” open, said David Becker, a former U.S. Justice Department lawyer who now leads the Center for Election Innovation and Research, a nonpartisan group that works with state and local election officials.
“This is making election officials’ lives much more difficult,” he said.
Eric Olsen, who oversees elections in Prince William County, Virginia, said combatting misinformation has become an important and challenging part of the job.
“It’s really difficult from our position, a lot of times, because social media feels like a giant wave coming at you and we’re in a little canoe with a paddle,” he said. “But we have to do that work.”
On the campaign trail, Trump has repeatedly attempted to sow doubt about the upcoming election – something he did ahead of his two previous bids for the White House. Even after he won in 2016, he claimed he had lost the popular vote because of a flood of illegal votes and he formed a presidential advisory commission to investigate. The commission disbanded without finding any widespread fraud.
This year, Trump claims that Democrats will cheat again and uses “Too Big to Rig” as a rallying cry to encourage his supporters to vote. Election experts see it as laying the groundwork to again challenge the election should he lose.
Spreading bogus accusations about elections has other consequences. It’s already led to a wave of harassment, threats and turnover of election workers as well as the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.
The conspiracy theories that have surfaced in recent weeks are not new. There have long been claims of “vote flipping,” with the most recent ones surfacing in Georgia and Tennessee.

County election officials issued a statement, noting the case involved one voter out of 6,000 ballots that had been cast since early voting began. The ballot was spoiled, and the voter cast a replacement that was counted. Officials said there was no problem with the voting machine.
Gabriel Sterling, chief operating officer for the Georgia secretary of state’s office, said every report they’ve seen so far of someone saying their printed ballot didn’t reflect their selections on the touchscreen voting machine has been a result of voter error.
“There is zero evidence of a machine flipping an individual’s vote,” he said. “Are there elderly people whose hands shake and they probably hit the wrong button slightly and they didn’t review their ballot properly before they printed it? That’s the main situation we have seen. There is literally zero -- and I’m saying this to certain congresspeople in this state -- zero evidence of machines flipping votes. That claim was a lie in 2020 and it’s a lie now.”
In Shelby County, Tennessee, county election officials said human error was to blame for reports of votes being changed. Voters had been using their fingers instead of a stylus to mark their selections on voting machines, officials said.
In Washington state, Republican Jerrod Sessler, who is running for the state’s 4th Congressional District seat, shared a video on social media this week that claimed to show how easily fraudulent ballots can be created. But the video did not make clear that voter information on each ballot is checked against the state’s voter list.
“A ballot returned using fake voter registration information would not be counted and is illegal in Washington state,” Charlie Boisner, a spokesperson for the Secretary of State’s Office, said in an email.
Musk recently invoked Dominion Voting Systems as part of his remarks at a rally in Pennsylvania, seeming to suggest its equipment was not trustworthy. Dominion has been at the center of conspiracy theories related to the 2020 election and settled its defamation lawsuit against Fox News last year for $787 million over false claims aired repeatedly on the network. The judge in the case said it was “CRYSTAL clear” that none of the allegations made by Trump allies on the network were true.
In a statement, Dominion said it was “closely monitoring claims around the Nov. 2024 election” and was “fully prepared to defend our company & our customers against lies and those who spread them.”
A request for comment from Musk was not immediately returned.
Musk, who has endorsed Trump, has repeatedly pushed misinformation about voter fraud to his 200 million followers on the X platform, where false information spreads largely unchecked.
He has often sparred online with Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson. Recently, the two tangled over Musk’s claim that there were more registered voters in Michigan, a presidential battleground state, than people eligible to vote. Benson said Musk was including in his count inactive voters who are scheduled for removal. A federal judge on Tuesday tossed out a lawsuit filed by the Republican National Committee claiming problems with the state’s voter list.
During an interview last month, Benson said she was disheartened to see someone in Musk’s position repeating false information.
“If he was sincerely committed, as he says he is, to ensuring people have access to information, then I would hope that he would amplify the truthful information -- the factual, accurate information -- about the security of our elections instead of just amplifying conspiracy theories and in a way that directs the ire of many of his followers onto us as individual election administrators,” Benson said. “It’s something that we didn’t have to deal with in 2020 that creates a new battlefront and challenge for us.”

About 475 damaged ballots retrieved from burned drop box in Washington state, auditor says
VANCOUVER, Wash. (AP) — About 475 damaged ballots were retrieved from a ballot box that was burned early Monday in southwest Washington, a county official said Tuesday.
Clark County Auditor Greg Kimsey said workers on Wednesday will begin searching through the damaged ballots for voter information in order to contact them about getting a new ballot. He said officials believe that although damaged, the workers will be able to pull voter information from the ballots.
The damaged ballots are separate from an unknown number that were destroyed, Kimsey said.
Incendiary devices damaged and destroyed hundreds of ballots at a drop box in Vancouver, Washington, and damaged three ballots at a box in Portland, Oregon, in what federal, state and local officials have decried as an attack on democracy before a heated Election Day.
Authorities have said that enough material from the incendiary devices was recovered to link the two fires on Monday, as well as an Oct. 8 incident, when an incendiary device was placed at a different ballot drop box in Vancouver. No ballots were damaged in that incident.
Surveillance images captured a Volvo pulling up to the drop box in Portland just before security personnel nearby discovered a fire inside the box, Portland Police Bureau spokesperson Mike Benner has said. The incendiary devices were attached to the outside of the boxes.
The FBI is among the agencies investigating. U.S. Attorney Tessa M. Gorman and Greg Austin, acting special agent in charge of the FBI Seattle field office, said in a joint statement Tuesday that they wanted to assure residents that they are working together to investigate the fires and will work to hold the person or people responsible “fully accountable.”
No arrests had been announced as of Tuesday evening.
The fire at the drop box in Portland was extinguished quickly thanks to a suppression system inside the box and a nearby security guard, police said.
Several hours later, another fire was discovered at a transit center drop box across the Columbia River in Vancouver. Vancouver is the biggest city in Washington’s 3rd Congressional District, the site of what is expected to be one of the closest U.S. House races in the country, between first-term Democratic Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez and Republican challenger Joe Kent.
The ballot box in Vancouver also had a fire suppression system inside, but that failed to prevent hundreds of ballots from burning, according to Kimsey. He has urged voters who dropped their ballots in the transit center box after 11 a.m. Saturday to contact his office for a replacement ballot.
The office is increasing how frequently it collects ballots and changing collection times to the evening, Kimsey said, to keep the ballot boxes from remaining full of ballots overnight when similar crimes are considered more likely to occur.
Officials in at least two other counties in Washington — including in King County, where Seattle is located, — announced Tuesday that ballot drop boxes will be checked more often up until Election Day.",2024-10-30

In their own words: What it’s like in a ‘chaos’ Congress and why these lawmakers keep coming back
WASHINGTON (AP) — Polarizing. Challenging. A lot of wasted time.
That’s how six lawmakers described what it is like being in the U.S. House — a particularly tumultuous period in American history that has brought governing to a standstill, placed their lives in danger and raised fundamental questions about what it means to be a representative in a divided democracy.
And yet, they keep at it, running for reelection.
The Associated Press sat down separately with lawmakers, three Republicans and three Democrats, to hear what it’s like on Capitol Hill and what they — and other Americans — can do to make it better. All hail from safe districts and are expected to easily win another term.
Here’s who they are, why they first ran for office and why they keep coming back.
Republicans
Dusty Johnson is the rare lawmaker whose sprawling district makes up an entire state, South Dakota. He ran for office in 2018 because he thought there were “too many jerks” in Congress and he would be better.
Nicole Malliotakis said that as the daughter of a Cuban mother and Greek father, her background made her born for politics. She ran in 2020 to provide a “counter view” as a Republican from New York City, representing Brooklyn and Staten Island.
Mark Amodei from northern Nevada, or “original Nevada,” as he calls it, has been in office since 2011. He said it’s his responsibility to do public service and give back to the state where his family has lived for generations.
Democrats
Chrissy Houlahan, an Air Force veteran, comes from the western Philadelphia region known as “the mushroom capital of the world.” The daughter of a Holocaust survivor and mother of a queer daughter, she decided to run for office in 2018 after seeing them in tears after Donald Trump’s 2016 election.
Veronica Escobar, from the border city of El Paso, Texas, ran for office to work for her community but also to tell the “El Paso story” and counter some of the “negative narratives” about immigrants. She won election in 2018.
Maxwell Frost, the youngest member of Congress, said his initial response to running for office was “Hell, no!” But he came to realize his work as the national organizer at March for Our Lives after the school shooting in Parkland, Florida, could carry over into Congress. He first won office in 2022.
So how’s it going?
“Chaos is honestly the word I would use to describe the totality of the Congress,” Frost said. “A lot of wasted time.”
“You have your ups and downs,” said Malliotakis.
Almost all of them have been in office during two presidential impeachments, two historic House speaker fights, the COVID closures and the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol.
“All of the things that you could not expect have happened have, have happened,” Houlahan said. This year in particular has been frustrating “and in some cases super demoralizing because, you know, you’re not here to not do things.”
Amodei said, “I think it’s an asset if you know how to play well with others. And if you don’t play well with others, then this is a nasty place to be.”
Escobar, who was among the lawmakers trapped in the House gallery on Jan. 6, 2021, said: “I will tell you, I love my job. I’m grateful for my job. It’s a tough job.”
What can Congress do differently?
“I struggle with that a lot,” said Houlahan.
Houlahan said the House’s 435 members operate like “independent contractors,” with small staffs and each office’s own personality. After a career in the military, as a small business entrepreneur and as a high school chemistry teacher, she said, “I’ve never seen anything like the organizational structure that is here.”
“Some of those offices, their mission is chaos, you know, and some of those offices, their mission is constructive,” Houlahan said.
Johnson said it’s the wrong question to be asking.
“It’s garbage in, garbage out,” he said.
“And if the people of America are going to continue to elect people who use fear and anger to motivate, we’re going to continue to find it more difficult than it should be to get things done in Congress,” he said.
Frost thinks unless there are institutional reforms — campaign finance changes and ending the Senate’s filibuster — “we’re going to be caught in this generational cycle of taking a few steps forward and a few steps backwards.”
Malliotakis expects it’s going to be this way for a while.
“The far right does its thing, the far left does its thing, and then everyone else in the middle really comes together to actually govern,” she said.
And what can Americans do to fix Congress?
“Congress is a reflection of what’s happening in America,” Escobar said.
“We have families that can no longer talk to one another about politics or about government,” she said. “We are drifting so far away from what is so good about our country and our communities, and Congress has a role in fixing that. ... But we in our country have to do more of that, as well.”
Malliotakis said it would help if Americans paid more attention to what their representatives were “actually doing when they’re in Washington.”
“So many people complain about issues and then they vote for the same members over and over,” she said.
Johnson suggests Americans list characteristics they would seek in a spouse, a boss, a pastor or child and use them when electing a representative.
“Congress can’t fix Congress,” he said. “The American people can fix Congress.”
Do you worry for your safety?
“We’ve all gotten death threats,” Malliotakis said. “Obviously, it is a polarizing time right now.”
Escobar said she has stopped holding large town hall gatherings over concerns of gun violence.
“I worry that any time I’m gathered with my constituents that one of my constituents could get hurt,” she said. “And I worry that my presence at a large gathering could put somebody else’s safety at risk.”
Houlahan said the risks of violence come with the job.
“This is a job where we are in danger,” she said. “It’s awful that we’re in that place, and we as leaders should be decrying that and not encouraging that.”
She said, “But it is absolutely my expectation that this is not a safe job.”
Frost said the threats he receives as a member of Congress are not new to him. “And I think it just shows, of course, the tone and this kind of violent culture that exists within American politics.”
What are the best parts of your job?
All said getting stuff done — even small wins. Especially the small wins, in fact, because that’s about all Congress can accomplish these days.
“There’s no other feeling like it,” said Frost.
He described standing at the White House for the launch of the first-ever Office of Gun Violence Prevention. And the “joy” he felt when receiving word that the administration would approve a second passport office in Florida, something constituents had been demanding since before he came to Congress.
Amodei mentioned work he’s done toward a monument for Vietnam War helicopter pilots at Arlington National Cemetery. “That’s neat.”
“The best days are days when you actually feel like you took a vote of consequence,” Johnson said, whether it’s certifying the results of the 2020 presidential election or “making sure that we don’t have any of these silly, stupid dumpster fires.”
“My role as a legislator is to find a solution,” Escobar said. “It may not be the perfect solution.... I have constituents who get mad at me for saying that, but progress is incremental.”
And the worst?
“I commute about 5,000 miles a week,” Amodei said.
But what’s “worse is when you feel like you’re here and your time is being taken for granted,” he said.
Why do you keep coming back?
“I keep coming back because it’s work that matters,” Johnson said.
“I do love what I do,” Malliotakis said, adding she wants to do “great work for our constituents.”
Houlahan said she envisions a future where Congress turns a corner.
“I stay because I’m hoping that we will find ourselves again,” she said. “And I hope that I can be part of it.”
Frost said, “If we step away from our civic power, our opposition is more than happy to step into it for us.”
“The way this institution works should reflect the wants and needs of the people. And so ... that’s why we’ve got to keep coming back.”
Does Congress matter?
“Anybody who would act like Congress doesn’t matter, I think, is naive to the point of being a bad citizen,” Johnson said. “The reality is that every single month, we cast votes that bend the trajectory of this country.”
Amodei said, “Well, fair question, but it’s like, well, do you think Social Security is important if you’re over 65? Do you think Medicare is important?... Do you think that our borders are important?”
He said he gets the “uber-cynics” who say, “You people are such dysfunctional jerks that we should just get rid of all of you. It’s like, okay, so tell me what your plan is.”
“Everything we do here in Washington, D.C., in Congress, impacts every single citizen in this great country,” Escobar said.

Courts could see a wave of election lawsuits, but experts say the bar to change the outcome is high
WASHINGTON (AP) — When the Supreme Court stepped into the 2000 presidential race, Republican George W. Bush and Democrat Al Gore were separated by a razor-thin margin. The court’s decision to halt the recount of votes in Florida effectively delivered the election to Bush and shaped the nation’s future.
The case is perhaps the most notable modern example of the judicial branch having a direct involvement after an election, but it’s not the only time judges have been drawn into postelection disputes.
America’s court system has no formal role in the election process, and judges generally try not to get involved because they don’t want to be seen as interfering or shaping a partisan outcome, said Paul Schiff Berman, a professor at George Washington University Law School.
But election disputes have increasingly landed in court since Bush v. Gore, Berman said.
This year could be especially contentious, coming after more than 60 unsuccessful lawsuits where then-President Donald Trump falsely claimed that he lost the 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden due to massive voter fraud. Dozens of lawsuits have been filed this year, mostly concerning relatively small matters.
“We have a long history in this country of a democratic process that operates in a nonpartisan manner with regard to vote counting that does not require constant court intervention, but that norm has been shattered in the same way that many of our democratic norms have been shattered since 2016,” Berman said.
Court cases could start election night over whether to keep polling places open if they experienced trouble affecting access during the day.
After the votes are all cast, lawsuits over the vote count could be next. That could involve claims about the counting of certain ballots, allegations against the election officials overseeing the count, disputes over the methodology or challenges to the certification of the vote totals in each state.
There could be lawsuits over recent updates to the Electoral Count Act, which governs the certification of the presidential contest. The revisions were passed by Congress in 2022 in response to Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 results by pressuring his vice president, Mike Pence, over congressional certification of the states’ electors.
How much a lawsuit might affect the outcome of an election depends on how many votes are in dispute and what kind of a solution a judge might order if a problem is found. In some cases, “It isn’t clear what the remedy would be if these suits were successful,” said Steven Schneebaum, an attorney and adjunct professor at Johns Hopkins University.
If the 2024 race is very close, court rulings could affect the outcome, especially in the swing states that will be key to the election. But for a lawsuit to affect the race, the election would have to be so close that the court would have to determine how people voted or one side would have to prove a major, fundamental problem with how it was run, said Rick Hasen, an elections expert and law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.
“The standard to overturn an election is extremely high, for good reason,” he said. “We want elections to be decided by voters, not courts.”

AP,FACT FOCUS: Inactive voters on Michigan's rolls are misrepresented in suggestions of fraud,"FACT FOCUS: Inactive voters on Michigan’s rolls are misrepresented in suggestions of fraud
Less than two weeks from Election Day, posts circulating on social media claim that Michigan has 500,000 more registered voters than it has people eligible to vote, a point used to suggest possible fraud in the system. But the claim misrepresents Michigan’s voter registration data, adding inactive voters to the total of those registered to make it appear there is an issue in the crucial swing state.
Here’s a closer look at the facts.
CLAIM: Michigan has 500,000 more registered voters than people eligible to vote, which creates the potential for widespread fraud.
THE FACTS: This is missing context. While the state does have more total voter registrations than eligible voters, that number includes voters who are inactive but cannot yet be removed from voter rolls under federal and state laws. The number of active voters is far less than those who are eligible to vote, and experts say there is no reason to believe that widespread fraud will result.
Still, numerous social media users have suggested these numbers are proof that Michigan is trying to cheat in the 2024 election. Among them is billionaire X owner Elon Musk, who has committed at least $70 million in support of former President Donald Trump.
“Jocelyn Michelle Benson, shame on you for blatantly lying to the public!” Musk wrote in an X post directed at Michigan’s secretary of state. “You only plan to remove ineligible voters AFTER this election. That necessarily means that there are far more people registered to vote than there eligible voters.”
The post had been liked and shared approximately 218,400 times as of Tuesday.
Benson responded on X, stating: “Let’s be clear: @elonmusk is spreading dangerous disinformation. Here are the facts: There aren’t more voters than citizens in Michigan. There are 7.2 million active registered voters and 7.9 citizens of voting age in our state. Musk is pushing a misleading number that includes 1.2 million inactive records slated for removal in accordance with the law.”
Musk did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.
There were approximately 7.9 million people of voting age in Michigan as of July 1, 2023. This figure is 500,000 fewer than the total registered voters — approximately 8.4 million. But that’s because the total registered voters include 1.2 million voters who are inactive. Those labeled inactive have not voted for six consecutive years or have not responded to a notice confirming their residency. Inactive voters are still eligible to vote.
Under state and federal law, voters are only removed from voter rolls after they have been sent a notice that their registration is subject to cancellation and two subsequent federal election cycles have passed without any response or voting activity. Voter registration cannot be canceled only because of a failure to vote.
This waiting period is why there are more total registered voters than eligible ones in the state.
More than 339,000 voter registrations are slated for cancellation in 2025 and more than 257,000 in 2027. As of March 2024, Michigan had canceled more than 800,000 voter registrations since 2019, including 273,609 for possible changes of residency, 532,513 for deaths and 16,716 at the request of the voter, according to its Department of State.
The Republican National Committee and two individual voters filed a federal lawsuit in March against Benson and Michigan Bureau of Elections Director Jonathan Brater for allegedly failing to “maintain clean and accurate voter registration records.” The suit was dismissed on Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Jane Beckering, who said the plaintiffs lacked legal standing and, regardless, did not state a plausible claim.

Michigan is hardly the only state with large numbers of inactive voters on its rolls. Every state — aside from the six which are exempt from the National Voter Registration Act — must send voters a cancellation notice and wait two federal election cycles before removing inactive voters.

The large numbers of inactive voters is a sign of robust list maintenance, according to David Becker, the founder and executive director of The Center for Election Innovation and Research, who served as a co-chair on Michigan’s Election Security Advisory Commission.
“You can only have a voter be inactive if you’re really engaged in list maintenance,” he said.
States use different methods to determine whether a voter may need to be listed as inactive. In Michigan, for instance, if a voter surrenders their Michigan driver’s license in another state, indicating that they’ve moved, the Michigan Department of State is notified. Election mail returned as undeliverable can also be a sign that a voter has a new residence or has died.
Election experts say it can be difficult for officials to keep track of voters who have moved out of state since there is no federal voter registration database. The Electronic Registration Information System, or ERIC, lets states share data that helps them keep accurate voter rolls and can identify potential illegal voting. But membership is voluntary — ERIC is currently made up of 24 states, including Michigan, and the District of Columbia.
It is unlikely that voters who are on voter rolls in more than one state will try to vote twice, experts say. Becker, who spearheaded ERIC’s development, said “double voting happens extremely rarely.” ERIC is among the safeguards that helps detect such fraud.
Christopher Thomas, who served as Michigan’s director of elections from 1981 to 2017, said that “most people would view voting twice as probably a pretty stiff felony” and therefore not worth the risk.
“Based on attempting to be a rational person and having been in the field for 50 years now and having never seen anybody prove any massive fraud in a presidential election in that time period, I think a rational person would conclude that it’s not going to be a present issue,” he said.

AP,House rejects temporary funding bill to avoid government shutdown,"House rejects temporary funding bill to avoid government shutdown
WASHINGTON (AP) — The House on Wednesday rejected Speaker Mike Johnson’s proposal that would have linked temporary funding for the federal government with a mandate that states require proof of citizenship when people register to vote.
Next steps on government funding are uncertain. Lawmakers are not close to completing work on the dozen annual appropriations bills that will fund federal agencies during the next fiscal year, so they’ll need to approve a stopgap measure to prevent a partial shutdown when that budget year begins Oct. 1.
The vote was 220-202, with 14 Republicans and all but three Democrats opposing the bill. Johnson, who said after the vote he was “disappointed,” will likely pursue a Plan B to avoid a partial shutdown, though he was not yet ready to share details.
“We’ll draw up another play and we’ll come up with a solution,” Johnson said. “I’m already talking to colleague about their many ideas. We have time to fix the situation and we’ll get right to it.”
Johnson had pulled the bill from consideration last week because it lacked the votes to pass. He worked through the weekend to win support from fellow Republicans but was unable to overcome objections about spending levels from some members, while others said they don’t favor any continuing resolutions, insisting that Congress return to passing the dozen annual appropriations bills on time and one at a time. Democrats overwhelmingly opposed the measure.
Requiring new voters to provide proof of citizenship has become a leading election-year priority for Republicans raising the specter of noncitizens voting in the U.S., even though it’s already illegal to do so and research has shown that such voting is rare.
Opponents say that such a requirement would disenfranchise millions of Americans who do not have a birth certificate or passport readily available when they get a chance to register at their school, church or other venues when voter registration drives occur.
But Johnson said it is a serious problem because even if a tiny percentage of noncitizens do vote, it could determine the outcome of an extremely close race. He noted that Republican Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks of Iowa won her seat back in 2020 by six votes.
“It’s very, very serious stuff and that’s why we’re going to do the right thing,” Johnson said before the vote. “We’re going to responsibly fund the government and we’re going to stop noncitizens voting in elections.”
Meanwhile, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump weighed in again just hours before the vote. seemingly encouraging House Republicans to let a partial government shutdown begin at the end of the month unless they get the proof of citizenship mandate, referred to in the House as the SAVE Act.
“If Republicans don’t get the SAVE Act, and every ounce of it, they should not agree to a Continuing Resolution in any way, shape, or form,” Trump said on the social media platform Truth Social.
House Democrats said the proof of citizenship mandate should not be part of a bill to keep the government funded and urged Johnson to work with them on a measure that can pass both chambers.
“This is not going to become law,” said Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif. “This is Republican theatrics that are meant to appease the most extreme members of their conference, to show them that they are working on something and that they’re continuing to support the former president of the United States in his bid to demonize immigrants.”
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has predicted Johnson’s effort was doomed to fail.
“The only thing that will accomplish is make clear that he’s running into a dead end,” Schumer said. “We must have a bipartisan plan instead.”
The legislation would fund agencies generally at current levels through March 28 while lawmakers work out their differences on a full-year spending agreement.
Democrats, and some Republicans, are pushing for a shorter extension. A temporary fix would allow the current Congress to hammer out a final bill after the election and get it to Democratic President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature.
But Johnson and some of the more conservative members of his conference are pushing for a six-month extension in the hopes Trump will win and give them more leverage when crafting the full-year bill.
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky declined to weigh in on how long to extend funding. He said Schumer and Johnson, ultimately, will have to work out a final agreement that can pass both chambers.
“The one thing you cannot have is a government shutdown. It would be politically beyond stupid for us to do that right before the election because certainly we would get the blame,” McConnell said.
Regardless of the vote outcome, Republican lawmakers sought to allay any concerns there would be a shutdown. Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., said if the bill failed, then another stopgap bill should be voted on that would allow lawmakers to come back to Washington after the election and finish the appropriations work.
“The bottom line is we’re not shutting the government down,” Lawler said.
But Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused Republicans of engaging in a “shutdown effort.”
“That’s not hyperbole,” Jeffries said. “It’s history. Because in the DNA of extreme MAGA Republicans has consistently been an effort to make extreme ransom demands of the American people, and if those extreme ransom demands are not met, shut down the government.”
The House approved a bill with the proof of citizenship mandate back in July. Some Republicans who view the issue as popular with their constituents have been pushing for another chance to show their support.
Rep. Robert Aderholt, R-Ala., noted that his state’s secretary of state announced last month that 3,251 people who had been previously issued noncitizen identification numbers will have their voter registration status made inactive and flagged for possible removal from the voter rolls. Voting rights groups have since filed a lawsuit saying the policy illegally targeted naturalized citizens for removal from voting rolls.
“These people should never have been allowed to register in the first place and this is exactly what the SAVE Act will prevent,” Aderholt said.",2024-09-18
AP,The first presidential election since the Jan. 6 attack will test new guardrails from Congress,"The first presidential election since the Jan. 6 attack will test new guardrails from Congress
WASHINGTON (AP) — This presidential election, the first since the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol, will be a stress test of the new systems and guardrails that Congress put in place to ensure America’s long tradition of the peaceful transfer of presidential power.
As Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris race toward the finish, pro-democracy advocates and elected officials are preparing for a volatile period in the aftermath of Election Day, as legal challenges are filed, bad actors spread misinformation and voters wait for Congress to affirm the results.
“One of the unusual characteristics of this election is that so much of the potential danger and so many of the attacks on the election system are focused on the post-election period,” said Wendy Weiser, vice president for democracy at the nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice.
After the Jan. 6 attack, Congress set out to shore up the process and prevent a repeat of that unprecedented period when Trump, joined by some GOP allies in Congress, refused to concede defeat to President Joe Biden. Trump spent months pushing dozens of failed legal cases before sending his supporters to the U.S. Capitol, where they disrupted the electoral count with a bloody riot. He faces a federal indictment for the scheme, which included slates of fake electors from states falsely claiming he won.
While the new Electoral Count Reform Act approved by Congress has clarified the post-election processes — to more speedily resolve legal challenges and reinforce that the vice president has no ability to change the election outcome on Jan. 6 — the new law is by no means ironclad.
Much depends on the people involved, from the presidential winners and losers to the elected leaders in Congress and the voters across America putting their trust in the democratic system that has stood for more than 200 years. Over the weekend, Trump said he and House Speaker Mike Johnson have a “little secret” for winning the election.
Voters are worried about post-election strife
A poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that American voters are approaching the election with deep unease about what could follow.
Dick Gephardt, the former House leader, now serves on the executive board of the nonpartisan Keep our Republic, which has been working to provide civic education about the process in the presidential battleground states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.
“We are concerned about one thing and one thing only: Can Americans still have valid trust in elections and can we have consistently a peaceful transfer of power in all offices, including the presidency?” Gephardt said in a briefing earlier this month.
“January 6th in 2021 was really a wake-up call, I think, for all of us,” he said.
It’s not just the onslaught of legal challenges that worries democracy groups, as dozens of cases already have been filed by both Republicans and Democrats even before Election Day. They say the sheer volume of cases has the potential to sow doubt in the election tally and give rise to disinformation, both domestic and foreign, as happened in 2020 when Trump’s legal team unfurled far-flung theories that proved to be wildly inaccurate.
As Trump runs to retake the White House, he is already setting the stage for challenges to the election he wants to be “too big to rig.” The Republican National Committee has made legal strategy a cornerstone of its Election Integrity program.

Trump is backed by Republicans on Capitol Hill, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has adopted similar language, saying he would accept the results only if the election is free and fair.

“We’re going to have the peaceful transition of power,” said Johnson, who led one of Trump’s 2020 legal challenges, on CBS. “I believe President Trump’s going to win, and this will be taken care of.”
One specific line of attack from House Republicans has been to suggest there will be illegal voting by noncitizens, even though it is a crime to do so, and state and federal reviews have found it to be extremelyrare. Johnson has pointed to past House races, including one in Iowa in 2020 that was won by six votes, to bolster his concerns.
Rep. Joseph Morelle of New York, the top Democrat on the Committee on House Administration, said Johnson is “saying the quiet part out loud,” signaling the way Republicans may challenge the outcome.
That “troubles me,” he said.
What comes between election and inauguration?
At the Brennan Center, they’ve conducted war-game-like scenarios for what could happen after the election, at a time when state election officials are facing a resurgence in conspiracy theories and misinformation about voting.
A series of deadlines between Election Day on Nov. 5 and Inauguration Day on Jan. 20 are built into the process, once routine steps that are now important milestones that can be met — or missed.
States are required to certify their electors by Dec. 11 in advance of a meeting of the Electoral College, which is set this year on Dec. 17.
The new Congress convenes Jan. 3 to elect a House speaker and swear in lawmakers. Then, on Jan. 6, Congress holds a joint session to accept the electoral count from the states — a typically ceremonial session presided over by the vice president.
To fortify the process in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack, the Electoral Count Reform Act instituted several changes intended to shore up the process and make sure the disputes are resolved by the time the Congress meets. Legal challenges to the results are to be more quickly resolved, under an expedited timeline for judicial review, all the way to the Supreme Court, if necessary. If a county refuses to certify its results, as some did during the 2022 midterm elections, the governor has more authority to certify the state’s tally.
On Jan. 6, the law now requires 20% of the House and Senate to challenge a state’s electors to force a vote on rejecting them, rather than a single member threshold from each chamber.
“You know people have a right, if they have a problem with the election, to go to court and be heard,” said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif. “The thing is, once that’s over, it’s over.”",2024-10-29
AP,Supreme Court rejects push to remove Robert F. Kennedy Jr. from ballot in two swing states,"Supreme Court rejects push to remove Robert F. Kennedy Jr. from ballot in two swing states
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected an emergency appeal to remove Robert F. Kennedy Jr. from the presidential ballot in two battleground states.
Kennedy wanted to get off the ballot in Wisconsin and Michigan after dropping his independent bid and endorsing Republican Donald Trump in the tight contest. He argued that keeping him on violated his First Amendment rights by wrongly implying he still wanted to be elected president.
Michigan and Wisconsin said removing his name now, with early voting underway days before the election, would be impossible. More than 1.5 million people in Michigan have already returned absentee ballots, and another 264,000 have voted early, state attorneys wrote in court documents. In Wisconsin, over 858,000 people have returned absentee ballots.
The justices did not detail their reason in an order rejecting the emergency appeal, as is typical. One justice, Neil Gorsuch, publicly dissented in the Michigan case.
The presence of independent and third-party candidates on the ballot in swing states could be a key factor in the close presidential race. The high court previously rejected Kennedy’s separate effort to stay on the ballot in New York, a state where his presence is unlikely to make a difference in the race between Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris.
Kennedy has been working to get off the ballot in the seven key swing states since endorsing Trump. Wisconsin and Michigan are the last two where his name is expected to appear.
In Michigan, he notched an appeals court win but courts ultimately found he couldn’t withdraw as the candidate of the Natural Law Party, which had wanted him to stay on.
In his dissent, Gorsuch pointed to lower court judges who wrote that the timing of Kennedy’s original request to be removed wasn’t so unreasonable that it should be denied.
In Wisconsin, courts rejected Kennedy’s argument that major parties unfairly get more time to switch nominees. Judges there found candidates who miss deadlines to change nomination papers must remain on the ballot unless they die, and a plan to cover Kennedy’s name with stickers was unworkable.",2024-10-29

Yankee Stadium fans ejected after one pries ball out of Mookie Betts’ glove at World Series
NEW YORK (AP) — Two fans at Yankee Stadium were ejected from Game 4 of the World Series after one pried a foul ball out of the glove of Los Angeles Dodgers right fielder Mookie Betts on Tuesday night.
Betts leaped at the wall in foul territory and initially caught Gleyber Torres’ pop up in the first inning, but a fan in the first row with a gray Yankees’ road jersey grabbed Betts’ glove with both hands and pulled the ball out. Another fan grabbed Betts’ non-glove hand.
Betts reacted angrily, and Torres was immediately called out on fan interference.
“When it comes to the person in play, it doesn’t matter,” Betts said. “We lost. It’s irrelevant. I’m fine. He’s fine. Everything’s cool. We lost the game and that’s what I’m kind of focused on. We got to turn the page and get ready for tomorrow.”
The Dodgers had a two-run lead at the time on Freddie Freeman’s two-run homer, but the Dodgers were unable to complete a sweep and took an 11-4 loss to the Yankees.
“I’ve never seen anything like it,” said Dodgers rookie pitcher Ben Casparius. “It’s pretty interesting. It was obviously very early in the game so I think it kind of set the tone.”
It was the second time Torres had an at-bat impacted by fan interference this World Series. With two outs in the ninth inning of Game 1 at Dodger Stadium, Torres hit a fly ball to left field, and a fan reached over and caught the ball. Torres was awarded a double.
Torres later hit a three-run homer to right field for New York’s final runs.

A rare comet brightens the night skies in October
NEW YORK (AP) — Prepare to spot a rare, bright comet.
The space rock is slinging toward Earth from the outer reaches of the solar system and will make its closest pass on Saturday. It should be visible through the end of October, clear skies permitting.
Comet Tsuchinshan-Atlas should be bright enough to see with the naked eye, but binoculars and telescopes will give a better view.
“It’ll be this fuzzy circle with a long tail stretching away from it,” said Sally Brummel, planetarium manager at the Bell Museum in Minnesota.
What is a comet?
Comets are frozen leftovers from the solar system’s formation billions of years ago. They heat up as they swing toward the sun, releasing their characteristic streaming tails.
In 2023, a green comet that last visited Earth 50,000 years ago zoomed by the planet again. Other notable flybys included Neowise in 2020, and Hale-Bopp and Hyakutake in the mid to late 1990s.
Where did comet Tsuchinshan-Atlas come from?
The comet, also designated C/2023 A3, was discovered last year and is named for the observatories in China and South Africa that spied it.
It came from what’s known as the Oort Cloud well beyond Pluto. After making its closest approach about 44 million miles (71 million kilometers) of Earth, it won’t return for another 80,000 years — assuming it survives the trip.
Several comets are discovered every year, but many burn up near the sun or linger too far away to be visible without special equipment, according to Larry Denneau, a lead researcher with the Atlas telescope that helped discover the comet.
How to view the comet
Those hoping to spot comet Tsuchinshan-Atlas should venture outside about an hour after sunset on a clear night and look to the west.
The comet should be visible from both the northern and southern hemispheres.

AP,"Trump will campaign in Wisconsin with Brett Favre, who's linked to a Mississippi welfare scandal","Trump will campaign in Wisconsin with Brett Favre, who’s linked to a Mississippi welfare scandal
Donald Trump and Kamala Harris will crisscross several swing states on Wednesday, passing each other in Wisconsin, where the former president is scheduled to appear in Green Bay with a onetime local icon, retired NFL quarterback Brett Favre.
A longtime supporter of Trump and other Republicans, Favre spent most of his career with the Green Bay Packers, winning the NFL’s Most Valuable Player award three times and a Super Bowl. But the Pro Football Hall of Famer has been in the news lately for a welfare scandal in his home state of Mississippi.
Favre, 55, is not facing any criminal charges, but he is among more than three dozen people or groups being sued as the state tries to recover misspent money. Favre has repaid just over $1 million he received in speaking fees funded by the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program. Mississippi Auditor Shad White, a Republican, has said Favre never showed up for the speaking engagements. White also said Favre still owes nearly $730,000 in interest.
Favre has posted and reposted social media messages supporting Trump and criticizing Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee.
“In all the elections I’ve seen over my lifetime, I’ve never seen one where there was so much hate,” Favre posted Monday on X. “It’s certainly sad to see.”
With six days until Election Day, Harris will travel from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to Wisconsin’s capital, Madison, and then back south to Raleigh, North Carolina. Trump will be moving in the opposite direction, heading to Green Bay after an event in Rocky Mount, North Carolina.
The focus on Wisconsin is no surprise. The Badger State is a perennial presidential battleground, often decided by only a few thousand votes. Trump won it in 2016 by 23,000 votes and lost it in 2020 to Democrat Joe Biden by 20,000 votes.
In relying on Favre, Trump is tapping into the state’s deep and loyal support for the Packers and the team’s onetime star quarterback. But Favre also comes with increased baggage after becoming enmeshed in Mississippi’s welfare spending scandal.
Mississippi has ranked among the poorest states for decades, but only a fraction of its federal welfare money has been going to families. Instead, the Mississippi Department of Human Services allowed well-connected people to waste tens of millions of welfare dollars from 2016 to 2019, according to White and state and federal prosecutors.
A nonprofit group called the Mississippi Community Education Center made two payments of welfare money to Favre Enterprises, the athlete’s business: $500,000 in December 2017 and $600,000 in June 2018. The TANF money was to go toward a volleyball arena at the University of Southern Mississippi. Favre agreed to lead fundraising efforts for the facility at his alma mater, where his daughter started playing on the volleyball team in 2017.
The Mississippi Community Education Center director, Nancy New, pleaded guilty in April 2022 to charges of misspending welfare money, as did her son Zachary New, who helped run the nonprofit. They await sentencing and have agreed to testify against others.
Favre appeared in September before a Republican-led congressional committee that was examining how states are falling short on using welfare to help families in need. U.S. House Republicans have said a Mississippi welfare misspending scandal involving Favre and others points to the need for “serious reform” in the TANF program.
Favre told the congressional committee that he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in January.

Villagers are wary of plans to dam a river to ensure Panama Canal’s water supply
EL JOBO, Panama (AP) — A long, wooden boat puttered down the Indio River’s chocolate waters carrying Ana María Antonio and a colleague from the Panama Canal Authority on a mission to hear directly from villagers who could be affected by plans to dam the river.
The canal forms the backbone of Panama’s economy, and the proposed dam would secure the water needed to ensure the canal’s uninterrupted operation at a time of increasingly erratic weather.
It also would flood villages, where about 2,000 people would need to be relocated and where there is opposition to the plan, and curb the flow of the river to other communities downstream.
Those living downstream know the mega-project will substantially alter the river, but they hope it will bring jobs, potable water, electricity and roads to their remote communities and not just leave them impoverished.
“We, as the Panama Canal, understand that many of these areas have been abandoned in terms of basic services,” Antonio said.
(AP Video/Matías Delacroix and Abraham Terán)
The canal
The Panama Canal was completed in 1914 and generates about a quarter of the government’s budget.
Last year, the canal authority reduced the number of ships that could cross daily by about 20% because rains hadn’t replenished the reservoirs used to operate the locks, which need about 50 million gallons of fresh water for each ship. It led to shipping delays, and in some cases companies looking for alternatives. By the time restrictions were lifted this month, demand had fallen.
To avoid a repeat due to drought exacerbated by climate change, the plan to dam the Indio River was revived.
It received a boost this summer with a ruling from Panama’s Supreme Court. For years, Panama has wanted to build another reservoir to supplement the main supply of water from Lake Gatun — a large manmade lake and part of the canal’s route — but a 2006 regulation prohibited the canal from expansion outside its traditional watershed. The Supreme Court’s decision allowed a re-interpretation of the boundaries.
The Indio runs roughly parallel to the canal, through the isthmus. The new reservoir on the Indio would sit southwest of Lake Gatun and supplement the water from there and what comes from the much smaller Alhajuela Lake to the east. The Indio reservoir would allow an estimated 12 to 13 additional canal crossings each day.
The reservoirs also provide water to the more than 2 million people — half the country’s population — living in the capital.
The river
Monkeys screeched in the thick jungle lining the Indio on an August morning. The boat weaved around submerged logs below concrete and rough timber houses high on the banks. Locals passed in other boats, the main means of transportation for the area.
At the town of El Jobo, Antonio and her colleague carefully climbed the muddy incline from the river to a room belonging to the local Catholic parish, decorated with flowers and bunches of green bananas.
Inside, residents from El Jobo and Guayabalito, two communities that won’t be flooded, took their seats. The canal authority has held dozens of such outreach meetings in the watershed.
The canal representatives hung posters with maps and photos showing the Indio’s watershed. They talked about the proposed project, the Supreme Court’s recent decision, a rough timeline.
Antonio said that canal officials are talking to affected residents to figure out their needs, especially if they are from the 37 tiny villages where residents would have to be relocated.
Canal authorities have said the Indio is not the only solution they’re considering, but just days earlier canal administrator Ricaurte Catín Vásquez said it would be the most efficient option, because it has been studied for at least 40 years.
That’s nearly as long as Jeronima Figueroa, 60, has lived along the Indio in El Jobo. Besides being the area’s critical transportation link, the Indio provides water for drinking, washing clothes and watering their crops, she said.
“That river is our highway and our everything,” she said.
The dam’s effect on the river’s flow was top of mind for the assembled residents, along with why the reservoir is needed, what would the water be used for, which communities would have to relocate, how property titles would be handled, would the construction pollute the river.
Puria Nuñez of El Jobo summed up the fears: “Our river isn’t going to be the same Indio River.”
Progress
Kenny Alexander Macero, a 21-year-old father who raises livestock in Guayabalito, said it was clear to him that the reservoir would make the canal a lot of money, but he wanted to see it spur real change for his family and others in the area.
“I’m not against the project, it’s going to generate a lot of work for people who need it, but you should be sincere in saying that ‘we’re going to bring projects to the communities that live in that area,’” he said. “We want highways. Don’t try to fool us.”
One complication was that while the canal authorities would be in charge of the reservoir project, the federal government would have to carry out the region’s major development projects. And the feds weren’t in the room.
The project is not a guarantee of other benefits. There are communities along Lake Gatun that don’t have potable water.
Gilberto Toro, a community development consultant not involved in the canal project, said that the canal administration is actually more trusted by people than Panama’s federal government, because it hasn’t been enmeshed in as many scandals.
“Everybody knows that the canal projects come with a seal of guarantee,” Toro said. “So a lot of people want to negotiate with the canal in some way because they know what they’re going to offer isn’t going to be trinkets.”
Figueroa expressed similar faith in the canal administrators, but said that residents would need to monitor them closely to avoid being overlooked. “We can’t keep living far behind like this,” she said. “We don’t have electricity, water, healthcare and education.”
Next steps
President José Raúl Mulino has said a decision about the Indio River project would come next year. The canal administration ultimately will decide, but the project would require coordination with the federal government. No public vote is necessary, but the canal administrator has said they are looking to arrive at a public consensus.
Opposition has emerged, not surprisingly, in communities that would be flooded.
Among those is Limon, where the canal representatives parked their car and boarded a boat to El Jobo. It’s where the reservoir’s dam would be constructed. The highway only arrived there two years ago and the community still has many needs.
Olegario Hernández has had a sign out in front of his home in Limon for the past year that says: “No to the reservoirs.”
The 86-year-old farmer was born there and raised his six children there. His children all left the area in search of opportunities, but Hernández wants to stay.
“We don’t need to leave,” Hernández said, but the canal administration “wants to kick us out.”",2024-10-23

Ranked choice voting could decide which party controls the US House. How does it work?
PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — An uncommon system of voting could be central to which party controls the U.S. House this fall — or even the presidency.
In Maine and Alaska, voters in competitive congressional districts will elect a winner using ranked choice voting.
Rather than cast a single vote for their preferred candidate, voters rank their choices in order of preference on the ballot. If a candidate is the first choice of more than 50% of voters in the first round of counting, that candidate is the winner.
But if no candidate surpasses 50%, the count continues in round two. The candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and voters who chose that candidate as their top pick have their votes redistributed to their next choice. This continues with the candidate with the fewest votes getting eliminated until someone emerges with a majority of votes.
Ranked choice voting has become more popular in recent years, particularly at the municipal level.
Voters in two dozen cities and counties — from New York and Minneapolis to Boulder, Colorado — used ranked choice voting in 2023, according to FairVote, a nonpartisan organization that advocates for the expansion of ranked choice voting. Seven other cities voted in favor of preserving, adopting or expanding ranked choice voting.
Proponents of ranked choice voting argue the system encourages candidates to build broader coalitions, eliminates the spoiler effect and discourages negative campaigning. Opponents say it’s confusing and can result in a candidate without the largest number of first-choice votes ultimately prevailing.
Because they take place over multiple rounds that are tabulated only once all first-choice votes are counted, elections in Alaska and Maine that advance to ranked choice are often resolved a week or more after Election Day.
Maine
Maine adopted ranked voting in elections in 2016 in a statewide referendum. It is used in all statewide primaries with more than two candidates. In general elections, it is used for federal offices including the presidency but not in state races, such as for governor or the Legislature, because it runs afoul of the Maine Constitution.
It quickly came into play — twice — in Maine’s 2nd Congressional District. Then-GOP Rep. Bruce Poliquin won the most first choice votes in 2018, but lost to Democratic Rep. Jared Golden when votes were reallocated after removing the third- and fourth-place finishers. The process repeated four years later when Golden beat Poliquin in a rematch.
A federal judge twice upheld the constitutionality of ranked voting in separate challenges by Poliquin in 2018 and a group of voters in 2020.
This year, only two candidates are explicitly on the ballot in the 2nd District — Golden and Republican Austin Theriault — but the race could nonetheless go to ranked choice voting because votes will be counted for a third candidate whose write-in candidacy has been recognized by the state.
If no first-round winner receives a majority of the vote on Election Day, then the ballots are shipped to the state capital, where the ballots are entered into a computer. The process takes about a week before the final tally is run and the winner declared.

Alaska
Alaskans approved the use of ranked choice voting in a 2020 statewide initiative. It is used in all general elections, including for the presidency, but not in state primaries. Alaska’s state primaries are open, so all candidates, regardless of party, run on the same ballot and the top four vote-getters advance to the general election.
Presidential primaries are different. Candidates can make the ballot by winning a recognized party’s primary or successfully petitioning the state Division of Elections. This year, there will be eight presidential tickets on the ballot in Alaska; voters can rank all of them if they choose.
The first use of ranked choice voting — and when it first came into play — was in a 2022 special election for the state’s at-large congressional district. Now-Rep. Mary Peltola, a Democrat, received the most votes in the first round of voting, while two Republican candidates finished second and third. She surpassed 50% of the vote when the third-place candidate was eliminated.
Peltola went on to win the regularly scheduled election, which also used ranked choice voting, later that year. She faces Republican Nick Begich, one of the two candidates she defeated in 2022, and two others in November.
Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski was reelected in 2022 in a race that went to ranked choice voting.
Alaska will vote next month on a ballot measure that would repeal the state’s new open primary and ranked choice general election system.
The presidency
The more candidates in a race, the more likely it is that candidates will split the vote and nobody will win a majority, advancing the election to ranked choice voting. The presidential ballots in Maine and Alaska will include more than just Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump, so it’s possible those states’ races could wind up going to ranked choice voting.
Maine is one of two states that gives an electoral vote to the winner of each congressional district along with two to the statewide winner, and ranked choice voting could go into effect if no presidential candidate receives a majority in one of the districts.
In 2020, before Alaska’s ranked choice voting was in place, Trump received about 53% of the state’s vote. Democrat Joe Biden won Maine with about 53% of the vote that year.

Church near Pennsylvania Capitol becomes peace hub hoping to protect democracy in divisive election
HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Grace United Methodist Church is located just steps from the Pennsylvania State Capitol. Between the two buildings, the church recently installed a pole. It reads: “May Peace Prevail on Earth.”
The timing and location of the “Peace Pole” were both intentional and symbolic.
It was done to commemorate the International Day of Peace last month. But also, “in recognition of the political climate that we’re in,” said the Rev. Anna Layman Knox, the church’s pastor.
From her office window, she has a view of the Capitol’s majestic dome inspired by Michelangelo’s design for St. Peter’s Basilica at the Vatican. But on the Capitol steps she has also witnessed rallies across the political spectrum, and she knows that the current heated election rhetoric could escalate into violence.
She hopes her church’s stand for peace will inspire others to do the same as the voting results come in.
During a recent Sunday service, Layman Knox asked congregants to pray for Kamala Harris and Donald Trump and to be mindful of their words. Wearing a stole in the rainbow colors of the LGBTQ+ flag, she said, “We pray for our nation in our division and our hope.”
Pennsylvania’s Capitol, in perhaps the most pivotal of swing states, could be a crucial venue if the upcoming election leads to worsening political divisions.
It’s where some of the first protests erupted in 2020 supporting Donald Trump’s lies of a stolen election. The string of demonstrations eventually exploded into the Jan. 6 insurrection, where Trump’s supporters stormed into the U.S. Capitol in a deadly riot.
In recent weeks, evangelical leader Sean Feucht, an outspoken Christian Nationalist, led a pro-Trump demonstration outside the landmark building in the capital city of Pennsylvania, saying “the enemy can’t have this state.”
At a nearby nondenominational church, billionaire Elon Musk backed Trump reiterating his false claims about election fraud.
Fear of violence recently prompted Layman Knox to join Choices and Voices for Peace, a coalition of faith leaders from across Pennsylvania who gathered at the state Capitol urging civility ahead of the election.
“Tensions have been rising, and all of our religious traditions preach peace and love,” said Rabbi Ariana Capptauber of Harrisburg’s Beth El Temple. “We know that that’s the highest value in our country — and our highest value.”
After their demonstration at the Capitol rotunda, the interfaith group — including rabbis, priests and imams — walked across to Grace Church to share a meal and plan how to peacefully fight against the looming threats.
“We’re protecting our communities,” said the Rev. Erin Jones, who works for a state advocacy arm of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, which organized the peace rally. It also led a petition asking Pennsylvanians to respect each other as they head to the polls.
“The choices we make there will be a statement about the way we want to live together here and now and the kind of tomorrow we want to leave for our children,” read the petition signed by more than 300 faith leaders.
Americans fear another round of violent protests
American voters are deeply concerned about the election and what could come next for the country, including the potential for political violence, according to a new poll.
The findings of the survey, conducted by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, show that about 4 in 10 registered voters say they are “extremely” or “very” concerned about violent attempts to overturn the results after the November election. A similar share is worried about legal efforts to do so. And about 1 in 3 voters say they are “extremely” or “very” concerned about attempts by local or state election officials to stop the results from being finalized.
“I fear that there will be violence, and I hope that there can be unity,” said Carly Wolf, 23, a Grace Church member and a college senior majoring in justice studies. She was outraged when she recently learned a group carrying swastika flags marched in front of her church on their way to the Pennsylvania Capitol.
“Regardless of the election results, the protests at the capitol need to be peaceful,” she said.
Although she prays that it won’t be necessary, she said she’d be ready to join counter peaceful protests to protect the Capitol and the Harrisburg community.
“I’d be willing to put myself on the line,” Wolf said. “We shouldn’t allow that kind of hate speech to happen. We’ve seen what happened on January 6, and it’s important to protect the sanctity of our capitol.”
Grace Church housed the state legislature after a devastating fire
Grace United Methodist Church is known as the church that saved Harrisburg from losing its status as the capital of Pennsylvania.
Since the early 19th century and throughout the Civil War, there were efforts to return the capital to Philadelphia. The pressure increased after a fire destroyed the Capitol building in 1897.
Since Harrisburg lacked a space large enough to accommodate the legislature, the church opened its doors to the Pennsylvania General Assembly. In just a few days, “all religious items and furnishings were removed,” the church says on its site, “and desks, chairs and spittoons were installed.”
Lawmakers worked from the church’s sanctuary and the Sunday school rooms for two years until the Capitol was rebuilt.
“There has been historically this profound connection between what it means to be a church and what it means to be an advocate and to be engaged politically in the community,” Layman Knox said.
Grace Church has taken that principle seriously, she said. “Being political isn’t about being partisan. It’s about providing for and living into the greater good for all.”
“Even now, it acts as a sacred space for people across denominations and interfaith gatherings to gather, to pray and to organize for advocacy efforts that happen up at the Capitol,” Layman Knox said.
After touring the Capitol building on a recent Sunday, Scott Bassett, a Pennsylvania-born retired teacher who lives in California, reflected on the work of faith leaders.
“I’m hopeful that they get along so much that they can pass on that message to all citizens here,” he said at the Capitol steps overlooking the soaring steeple of Grace and other churches that dot downtown Harrisburg.
“I can appreciate what they’re doing for this country and for the state of Pennsylvania.”

Harris urges voters to reject Trump’s efforts to sow division and fear
WASHINGTON (AP) — Kamala Harris stood before an overflowing crowd near the White House on Tuesday and promised Americans she would fight for them every day as she urged voters to reject Donald Trump’s efforts to sow division and fear, declaring, “It doesn’t have to be this way.”
One week out from Election Day, the vice president tried to drive home the contrast with Trump by delivering her closing argument from the same spot on the grassy Ellipse where the Republican former president had fomented the Capitol insurrection in 2021, pledging that she would work to improve people’s lives while arguing that her Republican opponent is only in it for himself.
“I’ll be honest with you: I’m not perfect,” she said. “I make mistakes. But here’s what I promise you: I will always listen to you, even if you don’t vote for me. I will always tell you the truth, even if it’s hard to hear. I will work every day to build consensus and reach compromise to get things done. And if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way.”
Harris began her capstone speech by reminding voters of Trump’s role in the chaos of Jan. 6, 2021, when he spewed falsehoods about the 2020 presidential election that inspired a crowd to march to the Capitol and try unsuccessfully to halt the certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s victory. She brought up his threats to use the military against his political rivals and his labeling of those who disagree with him as “the enemy from within.”
“Look, we know who Donald Trump is. He is the person who stood at this very spot nearly four years ago and sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol to overturn the will of the people in a free and fair election,” she said. Trump, she added, “has spent a decade trying to keep the American people divided and afraid of each other.”
“This is not a candidate for president who is thinking about how to make your life better,” she said, branding Trump a “petty tyrant” and “wannabe dictator.”
Harris continued: “But America, I am here tonight to say: That’s not who we are.” She added, “It doesn’t have to be this way.”
Harris sought to use her largest remaining stage before polls close to make a broader case for why voters should reject Trump and consider what she offers, while still introducing herself to voters clamoring for more information.
The White House gleaming behind her, Harris encouraged the crowd to visualize their divergent futures depending on who wins on Election Day.
“In less than 90 days, either Donald Trump or I will be in the Oval Office,” she said. “On Day One, if elected, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list. When elected, I will walk in with a to-do list.”
Harris went on to list key policy goals, including expanding Medicare coverage of home health care, boosting the supply of housing in the country and working to restore nationwide access to abortion.
Her speech drew a massive crowd to Washington, with supporters spilling out toward the Washington Monument on the National Mall. More critically, her campaign hopes the setting will help catch the attention of battleground state voters who remain on the fence about whom to vote for — or whether to vote at all.
Ahead of Harris’ remarks, her campaign showcased a line-up of ordinary Americans who spoke about their dream and priorities, rather than showcasing the star power that has been featured at some recent Harris events. They included Amanda Zurawski, a woman who nearly died from sepsis after being denied care under Texas’ strict abortion ban, Craig Sicknick, the brother of Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who died in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack, and a Pennsylvania husband and wife who previously vote for Trump but now back Harris.

“I think everybody understands what’s on the ballot,” she said as she waited in line to enter the event. “We’re either going to have an autocrat or freedom.”
Kathleen Nicholas, 36, a government relations worker in Washington, remembered Jan. 6 and loved the contrast of Tuesday’s crowd and atmosphere with that day. “I like she chose this place for her closing,” she said. “Having something that is a direct contrast to that day is what we needed.”
With time running out and the race tight, Harris and Trump have both sought big moments to try to shift momentum their way.
AP AUDIO: Harris reaches for a big moment in her closing argument for ‘turning the page’ on Trump
AP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports Kamala Harris will give her campaign’s closing argument tonight from the same spot where Donald Trump rallied supporters before the Capitol riot.
The address came days after Harris traveled to Texas, a reliably Republican state, to appear with megastar Beyoncé and emphasize the consequences for women after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. That, too, was a speech meant to register with voters far away in the battleground states.
The vice president’s latest address has been in the works for weeks. But aides hoped her message would land with more impact after Trump’s rally Sunday at Madison Square Garden in New York, where speakers hurled cruel and racist insults.
“Unlike Donald Trump, I don’t believe people who disagree with me are the enemy,” Harris said. “He wants to put them in jail. I’ll give them a seat at my table. And I pledge to be a president for all Americans. To always put country above party and above self.”
Also central to her message: positioning herself as a “new generation” of leader after Trump and even her current boss, President Joe Biden.
“It is time to stop pointing fingers and start locking arms,” she said. “It is time to turn the page on the drama and conflict, the fear and division. It is time for a new generation of leadership in America. And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States.”
She acknowledged that “many of you are still getting to know who I am” after her surprise elevation to the top of the Democratic ticket after Biden dropped out of the race in July, and used her remarks to try to answer voters’ curiosity.
“I recognize this has not been a typical campaign,” Harris said, adding that she is “not afraid of tough fights against bad actors and powerful interests.”
Ahead of Harris’ speech, Trump used remarks to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida on Tuesday morning to accuse Harris of closing with a message that doesn’t address everyday Americans’ day-to-day struggles and kitchen-table concerns.
He said Harris keeps “talking about Hitler, and Nazis, because her record’s horrible,” a reference to Harris amplifying the warnings from his former chief of staff that Trump spoke admiringly of the Nazi leader while in office.
Trump press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, “His closing argument to the American people is simple: Kamala broke it; he will fix it.”
Biden told reporters Tuesday that he would not attend Harris’ speech because the event is “for her,” but he sparked a firestorm ahead of Harris’ remarks. Reacting to a comic calling Puerto Rico garbage at a Trump rally last weekend, Biden said, “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.”
With Republicans amplifying his comments seemingly denigrating Trump supporters, Biden sought to clarify them in a post on X. “Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage — which is the only word I can think of to describe it. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation.”

A new push to wind down the Middle East wars faces familiar challenges
BEIRUT (AP) — The United States and other mediators are ramping up efforts to halt the wars in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip, circulating new proposals to wind down the regional conflict during the Biden administration’s final months.
Negotiations on both fronts have been stalled for months and none of the warring parties have shown any sign of backing down from their demands.
Senior White House officials Brett McGurk and Amos Hochstein will visit Israel on Thursday for talks on possible cease-fires in both Lebanon and Gaza, and the release of hostages held by Hamas, according to a U.S. official who was not authorized to comment publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.
A proposal to end the war between Israel and Hezbollah calls for a two-month cease-fire during which Israeli forces would withdraw from Lebanon, and Hezbollah would end its armed presence along the country’s southern border, two other officials familiar with the talks said.
But Israel is unlikely to trust U.N. peacekeepers and Lebanese troops to keep Hezbollah out of a reestablished buffer zone in Lebanon. It wants the freedom to strike the militants if needed. Lebanese officials want a complete withdrawal.
Separately, the U.S., Egypt and Qatar have proposed a four-week cease-fire in Gaza during which Hamas would release up to 10 hostages, according to an Egyptian official and a Western diplomat.
But Hamas still appears unwilling to release scores of hostages without securing a lasting cease-fire and a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, even after the killing of its top leader, Yahya Sinwar. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted on lasting Israeli control over parts of the territory.
In Lebanon, a push to revive the UN resolution that ended the last war
Neither Hezbollah nor Israel have publicly commented on the proposal to end their latest war, which started more than a year ago and dramatically intensified in mid-September.
During his visit to Beirut last week, Hochstein met with Lebanon’s Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri. They agreed on a roadmap on how to implement U.N. Security Council resolution 1701, which ended the 34-day Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006, according to a Lebanese official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the closed-door talks.
The resolution stipulates a cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah, withdrawal of Israeli forces from all Lebanese territory, and withdrawal of all armed forces except for U.N. peacekeepers and the Lebanese army from the area south of the Litani River, some 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of the border.
Two U.S. officials say there are competing proposals being discussed for a cease-fire in Lebanon, including one idea calling for an immediate truce followed by two months to fully implement the resolution.
The Lebanese official said that once a cease-fire is reached, a 60-day period will start in which the Lebanese army and the peacekeeping force known as UNIFIL would deploy in the border area as Israeli forces and Hezbollah fighters withdraw.
The Lebanese official said the roadmap includes increasing the number of U.N. peacekeepers from 10,000 to 15,000 and boosting the number of Lebanese troops south of the Litani from 4,000 to 15,000.
Resolution 1701 also called for “the disarmament of all armed groups in Lebanon,” including Hezbollah, but that is not part of the initial implementation phase under the current proposal.
Another official familiar with the talks said Israel has requested that any deal include measures to prevent Hezbollah from rearming and guarantees that Israel would be able to act in the buffer zone to combat threats from the militant group.
It is unclear if Lebanon would agree to a deal that allows Israel to continue military operations on Lebanese territory. Lebanese officials have insisted there should be no alteration to Resolution 1701, which stipulates a full Israeli withdrawal.
Hezbollah has said it will not halt its rocket fire on Israel unless there is a cease-fire in Gaza. It is not clear whether that stance has changed after the killing of Hezbollah’s longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and several other top commanders in Israeli airstrikes last month.
Mediators propose a limited cease-fire in Gaza
The U.S., Egypt and Qatar have proposed a four-week cease-fire in Gaza in which eight to 10 hostages would be released, according to a senior Egyptian official.
Under the plan, humanitarian aid to Gaza would be scaled up, but there would be no guarantees of future talks on a permanent cease-fire, the official said.
The U.S. official who confirmed McGurk and Hochstein’s travel said CIA Director Bill Burns was headed to Egypt on Thursday to discuss those efforts.
Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted around 250 in the Oct. 7 attack that triggered the war. Israel’s retaliatory offensive has killed over 43,000 Palestinians, according to local health authorities, who do not say how many were combatants but say more than half were women and children.
Around 100 hostages are still being held in Gaza, about a third of whom are believed to be dead.
The latest proposal is based on an initiative by Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi, who proposed a two-day cease-fire in exchange for the release of four hostages last week.
Netanyahu, who has always said he is open to temporary truces for the release of hostages, said in a statement that he had not received a formal proposal based on the Egyptian initiative but “would have accepted it immediately.”
Hamas has said it is open to discussing alternative proposals but has stood by its demands for a lasting cease-fire, an Israeli withdrawal and the release of Palestinian prisoners.
The Egyptian official said the mediators were not optimistic.
A Western diplomat in Cairo confirmed that their government had been briefed on the proposal, saying it was being pursued in parallel to the efforts for a cease-fire in Lebanon. Both officials in Egypt spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the talks.

Inside ‘the weave': How Donald Trump’s rhetoric has grown darker and windier
DULUTH, Ga. (AP) — No scene has dominated U.S. politics since 2015 quite like Donald Trump on stage, waxing on for an hour-plus in front of a chorus of red “Make America Great Again” hats.
The stream-of-consciousness routine, the interrupting one of his thoughts with the next, is not a polemic Cicero or Lincoln would recognize. The former president and Republican nominee calls his style of speech “the weave,” whipsawing from dystopian warnings to light-hearted storytelling to policy pronouncements.
“You make a speech, and my speeches last a long time because of the weave, you know, I mean, I weave stories into it,” Trump explained last week to popular podcaster Joe Rogan. “If you don’t — if you just read a teleprompter, nobody’s going to be very excited. You’ve got to weave it out. So you — but you always have to — as you say, you always have to get right back to work. Otherwise, it’s no good. But the weave is very, very important. Very few weavers around. But it’s a big strain on your — you know, it’s a big — it’s a lot of work. It’s a lot of work.”
Over the closing weeks of his third presidential campaign, Trump’s presentation has grown as disjointed as ever and notably darker. But the crowds keep coming, cheering his nationalistic populism, laughing at the insults and chanting along, fists raised, with his benedictory pledges to make America strong, proud, healthy, wealthy and, of course, great again.
Trump’s speeches, while never the same, all employ consistent devices and themes. He wields humor, braggadocio, anecdotes, grievances and grand promises. There are non sequiturs, fantastical falsehoods and withering attacks on opponents. He sprinkles in vulgarities and superlatives. There are even the occasional stints read from the teleprompters he mocks when any other politician uses them — and then claims that he doesn’t use teleprompters or doesn’t need them.
Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump’s Democratic opponent, encourages voters to see him in person, suggesting doing so only affirms that he is erratic and unfit for office. Other critics compare his extended showmanship to authoritarian leaders. Or they argue “the weave” is simply cover for the cognitive decline of a 78-year-old who would be the oldest newly sworn U.S. president in history.
Here is a study of “the weave,” deployed on one night last week in suburban Atlanta.
Epic entrance and just enough details — even lies — make the case
Perhaps the most important moment is Trump’s entrance. His walkout music, a device that evokes his brief turn as a professional wrestling promoter, is Lee Greenwood’s “God Bless The U.S.A.” The former president stands on stage, silent and serious, as the crowd sings along.
At a recent Turning Point USA rally in Duluth, Georgia, pyrotechnics and large video screens flanking him at center stage added to the effect, as his on-screen likeness towered over the crowd. Trump looked out over thousands of cellphones recording the spectacle.
With the last notes of Greenwood’s opening hymn, Trump immediately relaxed and praised his audience as “thousands of proud, hardworking Americans and patriots, which is what you are.”
Then, in a more formal tone he seemed to shift to the prompters: “I’d like to begin by asking a very simple question. Are you better off now than you were four years ago?”

It’s the famous question Republican Ronald Reagan used to defeat Democratic incumbent Jimmy Carter in 1980, and Trump uses it as a way to tie Harris to President Joe Biden. But as soon as the crowd in Duluth yelled “no,” Trump moved to sweeping promises, hyperbole and superlatives that doubled as indictments of Biden and Harris.

“I will end inflation. I will stop the invasion of criminals into our country,” he pledged, suggesting all migrants are criminals.
“We’re going to fix our nation fast,” he said. “America will be bigger, better, bolder, richer, safer and stronger than ever before. This election is a choice between whether we will have four more years of incompetence, failure and disaster, or whether we will begin the four greatest years in the history of our country.”
Biden and Harris aren’t just bad, in Trump’s language. He called them “the worst president” and “the worst vice president” ever. Harris, he warned, would “destroy your family’s finances forever.” He blames Harris alone for “an open border,” taking liberties with immigration and crime statistics and suggesting, falsely, that the vice president singlehandedly controls U.S. immigration policy.
He slipped in that Harris “got no votes” — a reference to her becoming the Democratic nominee after Biden dropped out following party primaries. “Therefore,” Trump insisted, “she is a threat to democracy” — a Trumpian staple projecting onto his opponents their most aggressive attacks against him.
By the time he was done in Duluth, he had lampooned Harris as a “low-IQ individual” and “not a smart person.”
Thousands laughed at each broadside.
Transitions and accuracy are never necessary
Trump does not speak in a linear pattern as he builds to a crescendo. From his first Harris takedowns, he moved to expressions of compassion for Hurricane Helene victims and then jarringly to one of his favorite subjects: his public standing.
“Our hearts are with you and we are praying for you — the polls, despite everything. The polls,” he said. “Do you see what’s happening here? Here, Alabama, Florida, South Carolina, Tennessee? And Georgia. The polls. The polls are through the roof.”
Minutes later, during an audible crowd lull, he dropped in his signature “MAGA” slogan to elicit cheers.
“What a nice crowd this is!” he answers with a chuckle. “What a nice crowd.”
He bounced back to the prompter for numbers framing inflation’s effects on U.S. households. He asked, “should I sue” CBS and “60 Minutes” for, in his words, manipulating Harris interview answers that were “from the loony bin.”
“It’s election interference and fraud,” he said, projecting charges that are part of felony criminal cases against him.
Trump mocked Harris for saying she will raise taxes, but misrepresented her proposals as applying universally. (She targets corporations and the wealthiest individual filers.) Trump’s 2017 tax cuts, meanwhile, were “the largest tax cuts in history,” he said. (A charitable interpretation, at best, that ignores inflation.)
Specifics, though, are not the bottom line
Timothy and Amanda Browning reached different conclusions about Trump’s style after driving from their Georgia mountain town of Lula to attend their first Trump rally.
“I liked it, because it shows how authentic he is,” said Timothy Browning. “There are lulls — but you’ve got to stick with him because there’s always a zinger coming.”
Amanda Browning laughed as she recalled leaning over to her husband to whisper that Trump “sure could use a speechwriter.”
Still, the co-owners of an event space and catering business in Lula reaffirmed their loyalties to the former president.
Timothy sported a T-shirt that had a sexist insult of Harris coined by some conservatives after Biden named her his running mate in 2020. Browning said, though, that he does not consider himself, Trump or the former president’s supporters angry.
Instead, the Brownings keyed on Trump’s first-term economy and his pledges for an encore term. Talking about their business, they recounted specific price increases they’ve seen since pandemic-era inflation. They were not interested in pandemic supply chain interruptions or Russia’s invasion of Ukraine roiling world oil markets. Trump, they said, presided over a better situation for them than Biden and, by extension, Harris.
Timothy Browning summed up his takeaway in Trumpian terms.
“I hear him,” Browning said, “putting America first.”",2024-10-30

Ballot drop box fires highlight concerns that election conspiracy theories are making them a target
ATLANTA (AP) — Two ballot drop boxes in the Pacific Northwest were damaged in a suspected arson attack just over a week before Election Day, destroying hundreds of ballots at one location in Vancouver, Washington.
At the other, in neighboring Portland, Oregon, it appears a fire suppression system worked to contain the blaze and limited the number of ballots damaged to three. Authorities are reviewing surveillance footage as they try to identify who is responsible.
Here’s what happened, how rules and security measures about drop boxes vary across the country, and how election conspiracy theories have undermined confidence in their use.
What do we know?
Police said incendiary devices started the fires in the drop boxes in Portland and Vancouver. Authorities said evidence showed the fires were connected and that they also are related to an Oct. 8 incident when an incendiary device was placed at a different drop box in Vancouver.
Multnomah County Elections Director Tim Scott said his office was planning to contact the three voters whose ballots were damaged in Portland to help them get replacements.
In Vancouver, hundreds of ballots were lost at a ballot box at the Fisher’s Landing Transit Center when the drop box’s fire suppression system did not work as intended. Clark County Auditor Greg Kimsey said the box was last emptied at 11 a.m. Saturday. Voters who dropped their ballots there afterward are being urged to contact the office to get a new one.
The office will be increasing how frequently it collects ballots and changing collection times to the evening to keep ballot boxes from remaining full overnight when vandalism is more likely to occur.
Kimsey described the suspected arson as “a direct attack on democracy.”
When and where can drop boxes be used?
Drop boxes have been used for years in states such as Colorado, Oregon, Utah and Washington, where ballots are mailed to all registered voters.
They grew in popularity in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, as election officials sought options for voters who wanted to avoid crowded polling places or were worried about mail delays.
In all, 27 states and the District of Columbia allow ballot drop boxes, according to data collected by the National Conference of State Legislatures. Six others don’t have a specific law but allow local communities to use them.
Placement can vary widely. In some communities, they’re located inside public buildings, available only during office hours. Elsewhere, they are outside and accessible at any hour, typically with video surveillance or someone watching.
Sporadic problems have occurred over the years.
In 2020, a few drop boxes were hit by vehicles, and one in Massachusetts was damaged by arson. In that case, most of the ballots were legible enough for voters to be identified and sent replacements. A drop box also was set on fire in Los Angeles County in 2020.
How should they be secured?
The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency advises state and local election officials to place drop boxes in convenient, high-traffic areas that are familiar to voters, such as libraries and community centers.
If drop boxes are not staffed, they should be secured and locked at all times, located in well-lit areas and monitored by video surveillance cameras, the guidance says. Many are bolted to the ground, surveilled with cameras or confined to public buildings during business hours, where they can be monitored.

How have conspiracy theories contributed to concerns around drop boxes?
Ballot drop boxes have been in the spotlight for the last four years, targeted by right-wing conspiracy theories that falsely claimed they were responsible for massive voter fraud in 2020.
A debunked film called “2,000 Mules” amplified the claims, exposing millions to a groundless theory that a ballot harvesting operation was depositing fraudulent ballots in drop boxes in the dark of night.
An Associated Press survey of state election officials across the U.S. found there were no widespread problems associated with drop boxes in 2020.
Paranoia about drop boxes continued into the 2022 midterms, when armed vigilantes began showing up to monitor them in Arizona and were restricted by a federal judge. This year, the conservative group True the Vote launched a website hosting citizen livestreams of drop boxes in various states.
In Montana, where an important U.S. Senate race is on the ballot, Republicans recently seized on an unsubstantiated ballot box tampering claim to raise money off doubts about the electoral process.
How have states responded since the 2020 election?
Republican lawmakers in several states sought to tighten rules around mail voting after the 2020 election, and much of their focus was on the use of ballot drop boxes.
Six states have since banned them: Arkansas, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina and South Dakota, according to research by the Voting Rights Lab, which advocates for expanded voting access.
Other states have restricted their use. This includes Ohio and Iowa, which now permits only one drop box per county, according to the Brennan Center for Justice.
In Georgia’s Fulton County, which includes Atlanta and has over 1 million residents, 10 ballot drop boxes are available for this year’s presidential election. That’s down from 38 four years ago under an emergency rule prompted by the pandemic. It’s the result of an election overhaul by Georgia Republicans in response to former President Donald Trump’s false claims of a stolen election.
Overall, 12 states prohibit drop boxes or do not list drop boxes as an approved method of returning a ballot, according to data collected by the National Conference of State Legislatures. Five other states do not have a state law and do not use drop boxes.
Drop boxes had been used for years in Wisconsin, one of this year’s presidential battlegrounds, but support for them has split along ideological lines since 2020. In Wausau, the conservative mayor carted away the city’s lone drop box, an action that’s under investigation by the state Department of Justice. The drop box has since been returned and is in use.

AP,"Israel debe llevar ayuda si prohíbe la agencia de la ONU vital para Gaza, dice la ONU","Israel debe llevar ayuda si prohíbe la agencia de la ONU vital para Gaza, dice la ONU
NACIONES UNIDAS (AP) — Naciones Unidas enfatizó el martes que si Israel implementa nuevas leyes que cortan lazos con la agencia de la ONU para los refugiados palestinos, el gobierno israelí tendrá que satisfacer las necesidades de la población según el derecho internacional.
El secretario general, António Guterres, dijo en una carta obtenida por The Associated Press que no hay otra alternativa a la agencia, conocida como UNRWA. Ha sido un salvavidas durante la guerra entre Israel y Hamás en Gaza, y la legislación israelí “tendrá consecuencias devastadoras para los refugiados palestinos” en Gaza, Cisjordania y Jerusalén Este, dijo.
Las agencias de la ONU para infancia, salud y migración también enfatizaron que UNRWA es la “columna vertebral” de las operaciones del organismo mundial en Gaza, donde la gente ha dependido de su ayuda alimentaria de emergencia y centros de salud durante la guerra de más de un año, que ha matado a decenas de miles y dejado gran parte del enclave en ruinas.
Las Naciones Unidas se sienten alentadas por las declaraciones de apoyo a UNRWA de todos los sectores y países, dijo el portavoz de la ONU, Stephane Dujarric, y “apreciaríamos mucho los esfuerzos de cualquier estado miembro para ayudarnos a superar este obstáculo”.
Israel ha alegado que algunos de los 13.000 empleados de UNRWA en Gaza participaron en los ataques del 7 de octubre de 2023 de Hamás que desencadenaron la guerra. También ha acusado a cientos de empleados de UNRWA de tener vínculos con milicias y dijo que ha encontrado activos militares de Hamás en o bajo las instalaciones de la agencia.
Las nuevas leyes de Israel
Dos leyes aprobadas el lunes podrían impedir que UNRWA continúe su trabajo. Incluso Estados Unidos, el aliado más cercano de Israel, se unió a muchos gobiernos y organizaciones humanitarias para oponerse a las medidas, que entrarán en vigor en tres meses.
Guterres envió la carta el martes al primer ministro israelí, Benjamin Netanyahu, para exponer sus preocupaciones.
Según el derecho humanitario internacional, Israel está obligado como potencia ocupante a asegurar que se cubran las necesidades de los palestinos, lo que incluye alimentación, atención médica y educación, dijo Guterres. Y si Israel no está en condiciones de satisfacer esas necesidades, tiene la obligación de permitir y facilitar las actividades de la ONU, y “UNRWA es el principal medio por el cual se suministra asistencia a los refugiados palestinos”, dijo.
Si las actividades de UNRWA se restringen o se detienen, el secretario general dijo que Israel tendría que llenar el vacío “para asegurar que se satisfagan las necesidades de la población”.
“De lo contrario, estaría violando el derecho internacional”, dijo Dujarric, el portavoz de la ONU.
El embajador de Israel ante la ONU, Danny Danon, respondió a la carta diciendo que “en lugar de condenar a UNRWA por hacer la vista gorda al terrorismo y en algunos casos participar en el terrorismo, la ONU en cambio condena a Israel”.
Afirmó en un comunicado que UNRWA no está interesada en proporcionar ayuda humanitaria a Gaza, calificándola de “nada más que un brazo de Hamas que opera bajo la apariencia de las Naciones Unidas”.
“Israel continuará facilitando la ayuda humanitaria en Gaza de acuerdo con el derecho internacional”, dijo Danon, “pero UNRWA ha fallado en su mandato y ya no es la agencia adecuada para este trabajo”.
Consternación de las agencias de la ONU
El portavoz de la Organización Mundial de la Salud, Tarik Jasarevic, dijo que los trabajadores de salud de UNRWA han proporcionado más de 6 millones de consultas médicas durante el último año. También ofrecieron vacunaciones, vigilancia de enfermedades y cribado para la malnutrición, y el trabajo de UNRWA “no podría ser igualado por ninguna agencia, incluida la OMS”, dijo.
Jeremy Laurence, portavoz de la oficina de derechos humanos de la ONU, dijo que “sin UNRWA, la entrega de alimentos, refugio, atención médica, educación, entre otras cosas, a la mayoría de la población de Gaza se detendría”.
UNRWA fue establecida por la Asamblea General de la ONU en 1949 para proporcionar alivio a los palestinos que huyeron o fueron expulsados de sus hogares antes y durante la guerra árabe-israelí de 1948 que siguió a la creación de Israel, así como a sus descendientes.
Israel enfrenta críticas
Coincidiendo con la aprobación de las leyes israelíes, Noruega anunció el martes que pedirá a la Asamblea General de 193 naciones que solicite un fallo del máximo tribunal de las Naciones Unidas sobre si Israel está obligado a facilitar la entrega de ayuda humanitaria a los palestinos por parte de organizaciones internacionales, incluida la ONU.
La Corte Internacional de Justicia condenó en julio el control de Israel sobre los territorios palestinos, declarando su ocupación ilegal. La opinión no vinculante instó a Israel a poner fin a su ocupación y detener inmediatamente la construcción de asentamientos.
El ministro de Relaciones Exteriores de Noruega, Espen Barth Eide, dijo a la AP que la política de Israel está haciendo cada vez más difícil para los palestinos acceder a asistencia vital. Dijo que Noruega argumentará que incluso si la ocupación de Israel es ilegal, tiene obligaciones, “y creemos que estas no se están cumpliendo”.
Guterres le dijo a Netanyahu que, aunque las leyes israelíes prohíben cualquier actividad de UNRWA “dentro del territorio soberano del Estado de Israel”, la ONU considera que Gaza, Cisjordania y Jerusalén Oriental forman parte del territorio palestino ocupado e Israel no tiene soberanía debido a su ocupación.
Mientras tanto, en la reunión periódica del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU sobre Oriente Medio, este mes abierta a todos los miembros de la ONU, los oradores apoyaron a UNRWA y prácticamente todos pidieron ceses al fuego inmediatos en Gaza y Líbano.
La embajadora de Estados Unidos, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, expresó su profunda preocupación por la legislación israelí, diciendo: “en este momento no hay alternativa a UNRWA cuando se trata de entregar alimentos y otra ayuda vital en Gaza”.
También instó a Guterres “a crear un mecanismo para revisar y abordar las acusaciones de que el personal de UNRWA tiene vínculos con Hamás y otros grupos terroristas”.
Dujarric, el portavoz de la ONU, dijo que su organismo de control interno está trabajando en eso. Señaló que se estaba analizando “con mucha seriedad” una carta del gobierno israelí de la semana pasada que planteaba cuestiones específicas no divulgadas.
El portavoz del Departamento de Estado de Estados Unidos, Matthew Miller, fue más allá y advirtió que la legislación israelí “representa riesgos para millones de palestinos que dependen de UNRWA para servicios esenciales”.
Miller reiteró que Estados Unidos se opone a la legislación y la discutirá con Israel en los próximos días. Señaló que su entrada en vigencia podría tener consecuencias bajo la ley y política estadounidense, en referencia a una carta que el secretario de estado, Antony Blinken, y el secretario de defensa, Lloyd Austin, enviaron a sus homólogos israelíes diciendo que la ayuda humanitaria debe aumentar o el país corre el riesgo de perder asistencia militar.

AP,"Elon Musk has often inflamed politically tense moments, raising worries for the US election","Elon Musk has often inflamed politically tense moments, raising worries for the US election
NEW YORK (AP) — Hours after an apparent attempt on Donald Trump’s life over the weekend, Elon Musk took to his social platform X to post a thinking emoji and a comment that “no one is even trying to assassinate” the Democratic president and vice president.
In the midst of anti-Muslim riots in the U.K. — which were ginned up by a false rumor — Musk declared that “civil war is inevitable” in the country.
And when an anonymous X user distorted data to claim a surge in sketchy voter registrations in three U.S. states, Musk amplified the false post and called it “extremely concerning.”
All three posts sparked quick backlash from public officials who called Musk’s words irresponsible and misleading. As his words amass millions of views and thousands of shares, they also illustrate the ability of one of the world’s most influential people to spread fear, hate and misinformation during fraught political moments around the world. That’s especially true because he owns the social platform that used to be Twitter, giving Musk the authority to shape how its content reaches users.
Musk’s inaccurate posts to his 200 million followers along with his site’s lack of guardrails are raising concerns about how he could manipulate public trust as Election Day in the U.S. draws nearer. He recently endorsed Trump’s presidential bid and has become more personally invested in politics — even agreeing to lead a government efficiency commission if Trump wins reelection.
Trump gave a shoutout to Musk during an event on X Monday evening, basking in the tech billionaire’s endorsement and referring to him as his “friend.” Musk did not reply to an emailed request for comment.
At the very least, experts and election officials worry that Musk could influence people to question the legitimacy of the vote. But they also are concerned his words could motivate threats and violence against election workers or candidates.
“X and Musk are raising the temperature of politics dangerously and irresponsibly at a critical moment,” said Heidi Beirich, co-founder of the Global Project Against Hate and Extremism. “It’s shameful.”
The 53-year-old billionaire who bought and transformed Twitter in 2022 has modeled his social media site as a marketplace of ideas where people can speak freely without censorship, a move that has been cheered by many conservatives. He often has touted X as a superior news source to the mainstream media, one where users can post without fear and discern the “truth.”
Yet the changes Musk has made to the company over two years also have allowed false information to spread largely unchecked.
He has dismantled the company’s Trust and Safety advisory group and stopped enforcing content moderation and hate speech rules that the site followed before his takeover. He has restored the accounts of conspiracy theorists, incentivized engagement on the platform with payouts and content partnerships, and instituted a Community Notes feature that at times results in misleading comments being placed on posts.
Baseless claims from both sides of the political spectrum rack up thousands of shares on Musk’s X. After a gunman shot Trump in the ear in an attempted assassination in Pennsylvania, far-left users shared false conspiracy theories that the former president had set it up. And after the debate between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, far-right users spread a bogus claim that Harris was wearing an earpiece.

Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, said Musk has degraded the site so that it’s just a shadow of what it was in 2020, when it was regarded as a fairly reliable clearinghouse for information.

“Twitter, or X, has a very different public reputation now. There’s a reason millions of people left the platform and advertisers left,” Hasen said. “He’s spreading terrible messages. ... The question is will the marketplace of ideas work well enough” that people will recognize those messages as untrustworthy, Hasen added.
Musk and many Republicans disagree with that sentiment. They say the site under its previous ownership unfairly censored accurate information about COVID-19’s origins and President Joe Biden’s son Hunter Biden when the facts were not immediately available.
Musk uses his platform to post about his companies Tesla and SpaceX, to share his personal views that more people need to be having children, and to make jokes in response to memes and other content that he finds entertaining. He also has increasingly used the site to amplify unfounded claims from politicians, including that Democrats are “importing” migrants into the country to vote and that Haitian migrants in Ohio are killing and eating pets.
Jocelyn Benson, Michigan’s Democratic secretary of state, said in an interview earlier this month that Musk’s election postings have created a “maelstrom of disinformation” that makes it harder for those who run elections to empower voters with the facts.
“I know the vast majority of election administrators just try to keep their heads down and do the work,” she said. “The challenge is, how do we get information about our work out to citizens, many of whom follow Musk or are members of X, or on the platform?”
Some election officials have tried engaging with Musk directly to educate him and his followers. In July, the Republican recorder responsible for elections in Maricopa County, Arizona, which includes Phoenix, invited Musk through an X post to an all-access tour of the county’s election facility.
Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon, a Democrat, organized a letter to Musk with four other secretaries of state this summer when Musk’s AI platform, Grok, was posting incorrect information about election rules. He said Musk deserved credit for belatedly correcting that misinformation.
Simon said that before Musk bought Twitter, the platform was helpful in correcting election misinformation and that he hopes Musk can do the same, whatever his personal beliefs.
“It’s one thing if you don’t like this election system or that election system in Minnesota,” Simon said, but factually false information about voting needs to be fixed.
Jen Easterly, director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, also commented last month on one of Musk’s posts to correct a misconception that most elections in the U.S. don’t use paper ballots. She wrote that during the last presidential election in 2020, “all States w/close presidential vote counts actually used paper records, allowing votes to be counted, recounted, & audited to ensure accuracy.”
The X owner has at times backtracked when he recognizes his posts were ill-advised. Earlier this month, he sparked outrage when one of his posts promoted an interview between the right-wing podcast host Tucker Carlson and a Holocaust revisionist. He then deleted it.
Musk also deleted Sunday’s post musing about how Biden and Harris had not been targeted by assassination attempts. White House spokesperson Andrew Bates nonetheless responded to call the post “irresponsible” and to say violence “should only be condemned, never encouraged or joked about.”
Siva Vaidhyanathan, a professor of media studies at the University of Virginia, said most celebrities are careful about their words, recognizing that not everyone will understand their jokes or respond in a measured way. Musk, he said, has never had that kind of filter.
Even so, Vaidhyanathan said Musk’s influence might be overblown when it comes to political misinformation. His platform has lost money and advertisers, and he’s only one of many figures who have long made false claims about elections.
“Musk is just one more voice in that cacophony,” he said.

In a first since 1938, Des Moines, Iowa, kids will trick-or-treat on Halloween
DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) — For the first time since 1938, children in Des Moines, Iowa, will go trick-or-treating on Halloween.
Going door-to-door for candy on All Hallows’ Eve has long been commonplace throughout the country. But not in Des Moines, where Iowa’s capital city took a different approach more than seven decades ago in hopes of tamping down on hooliganism.
Instead, Des Moines children don their costumes on Beggars’ Night, typically the day before Halloween. And besides screaming, “Trick-or-Treat,” children are expected to tell a joke before receiving a treat.
This year, Beggars’ Night was set for Wednesday, but because of expected heavy rain and thunderstorms, officials delayed trick-or-treating until Thursday, which to the rest of the country is the normal Halloween.
“To my knowledge, it has never been moved or canceled since it was established after Halloween in 1938,” Assistant City Manager Jen Schulte said. “However, the safety of our residents, families and children is always our top priority and led to the change in this year’s scheduled Beggars’ Night.”
The city began its unusual custom at the suggestion of a former city parks director as a way to reduce vandalism and promote more wholesome fun for kids. Initially, children were encouraged to sing a song, recite poetry and offer some other kind of entertainment, but over time a joke became the most common offering.
Beggar’s Night also has limited hours, typically running from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.
Many of Des Moines’ suburbs also adopted the Beggars’ Night tradition and chose to shift the celebration to Halloween this year.
“I didn’t realize we were that much of an anomaly because for us, this is normal,” said Debbie Westphal Swander, who owns a costume shop in West Des Moines. “We’re going to be in sync at least for this year with the way the event is celebrated everywhere else.
“The big picture for me is, it’s absolutely about the kids. That’s the most important thing.”",2024-10-29

Feeling stressed about the election? Here’s what some are doing and what they say you can do too
If the high stakes presidential election is causing troublesome thoughts, existential dread or rifts with loved ones, there’s no need to white knuckle through it.
Take a deep breath. Literally.
Meditation and mindfulness teacher Rosie Acosta says focusing on each inhale and exhale can help regain that grounding sense of control that may be drowned out by the spiraling uncertainty of election season. Experts like Acosta, who works in Southern California for Headspace, a mental health company and app, want those struggling to know there are ways to lighten election-induced stress and navigate related tensions.
“I can control how I’m breathing. … I can use my mindfulness practice and stay in the present moment, instead of worrying about what the outcome is going to be with an election,” said Acosta, who contributed the guided meditations “Surviving Dinner Table Debates” and “Compassion During Campaign Season” to Headspace’s “politics without panic” collection.
“You forget how much power we actually have over this tension and this anxiety.”
This year’s campaign has already witnessed unexpected twists and turns with President Joe Biden’s exit from the race and Vice President Kamala Harris’ quick ascendance among Democrats as well as assassination attempts targeting Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump.
And roughly 3 in 4 American adults believe the upcoming presidential election is vital to the future of U.S. democracy, although which candidate they think poses the greater threat depends on their political leanings, according to a survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
Mindfulness and setting boundaries
Acosta recalled how, back in 2016, political divisions seeped into a Christmas family gathering, turning an occasion for joy, connection and nostalgia into a “ground for verbal war.”
In navigating the aftermath, she said she learned to establish boundaries in the relationship with a relative and to focus on things that brought them together, rather than drew them apart. That could mean saying “‘We’re not talking about this right now; let’s talk about something else,’” disengaging from an unhelpful conversation, ignoring a sent political meme, she said, or bringing up a shared memory, instead of discussing the latest news.
“Mindfulness and meditation really help us reframe our relationships — our relationships in general, but, specifically, our relationship to our thoughts,” she said.
Headspace has also partnered with When We all Vote, a national nonpartisan voting initiative created by former first lady Michelle Obama, to provide eligible voters with some free resources to ease election-season anxiety. There’s a stress quiz to determine if you’re “the collected constituent,” “the overwhelmed optimist,” “the weary worrier,” or “the politically panicked.” The partnership also includes a voting registration portal.
“This is really intended to reach folks regardless of political affiliation or points of view,” said Headspace’s president, Christine Evans. “Regardless of who you are, you deserve mental health and support when you need it.”
Skills for disagreeing better
The Rev. Cynthia O’Brien often sees some people getting especially nervous around Thanksgiving.
“Thanksgiving is people you love, but you might not see all the time,” she said. “I hear people saying, ‘Oh, my relatives in Texas think I have gone off the deep end, that they won’t talk to me,’ or ‘my sister-in-law and I aren’t speaking’ and it’s simply the political polarization that has come between.”
One suggestion, she said, is not to have such conversations at the dinner table and opt instead for one-on-one chats.
O’Brien is no stranger to being in a room with people with different ideologies.
Based in Oregon, she’s the pastor of First Presbyterian Church of Woodburn and Aurora Presbyterian Church, with small congregations that include conservatives and progressives.
She’s also a national debate chair and a workshop moderator with Braver Angels, a nonprofit that does depolarization work. Workshops she moderates include ones teaching skills for disagreeing better.
“We’re not trying to smooth over differences. We’re teaching skills to bring out the differences in a responsible, loving, caring way,” she said.
Goals include having more understanding of the values and concerns of those who differ politically. Workshop participants are taught to listen carefully, acknowledge the other’s view before sharing their own, pivot to signal they’re about to share theirs and exchange perspectives such as by sharing a personal story behind their viewpoint or the source of information for their position.
They’re instructed to let go of the expectation of convincing others that they’re wrong.
“Our democracy requires us to talk through the disagreement and not just to shout at each other,” O’Brien said.
Normalizing the experience and practicing self-care
Dr. Petros Levounis, professor and chair of the Department of Psychiatry at Rutgers New Jersey Medical School, said “people who feel particularly anxious about the election should rest assured that they are not alone.”
He stressed the importance of taking care of one’s physical health, getting enough sleep, eating well and exercising regularly. While such practices may sound “a little banal,” he said, “they’re just so central to our well-being.”
Also, make time to relax and “perhaps having some breathing exercises, meditation, mindfulness; these are things that people have found quite helpful.”
Levounis cautioned against relying on alcohol to calm nerves, saying it “invariably increases anxiety in the long run and I’m not talking about months and years. ... A few hours after heavy consumption of alcohol, the anxiety increases.”
In the cases when anxiety becomes debilitating and is interfering with work or life at home, he recommends talking to a mental health professional or one’s primary care physician.
Taking action and being mindful of news intake, social media use
Some universities have also been providing their students with resources to manage election stress.
“We definitely have some students that really think a lot about politics and are aware of how that impacts them,” said Shauna Olson Hong, director of counseling services at California State University, East Bay. Those include some from LGBTQ+ communities or who are undocumented or have family members who are, she said.
The counseling center has been offering tips online. Those include limiting news intake, being especially careful about checking news immediately before sleep, vetting news sources to follow reputable ones and being mindful of social media use.
Other suggestions include seeking support and thinking about ways to be engaged and to affect positive change while maintaining balance.
“Just sitting around and worrying and feeling like I don’t have any control over what’s going to happen to me is a terrible place to sit and I think that really builds our anxiety,” said Hong. “So trying to take realistic action to speak out for what we believe in.”

In Pennsylvania, an influx of college graduates could push a key county toward Harris
BELLEFONTE, Pa. (AP) — It was love at first sight when Ellen Matis pulled up to this small Pennsylvania borough on a dreary winter day almost eight years ago. The road into town curved along the creek and then climbed uphill to a historic square where she chatted with regulars over beers at the local pub.
“This is where we need to live,” she decided. Matis’ sister-in-law, who grew up in the area, was shocked. She remembered Bellefonte as a sleepy place with vacant storefronts and a drug problem so notorious that people sometimes overdosed in front of the courthouse.
But Matis, 33, saw potential in the town’s quaint brick buildings and scenic foothold in the Allegheny Mountains just a short drive from Pennsylvania State University. She settled in, started a social media marketing company and had two daughters with her husband.
“People are excited for change and what the future holds,” Matis said.
Matis’ journey to Bellefonte is one small measure of a larger evolution that’s reshaping the politics of Centre County, which is home to about 160,000 people in the middle of Pennsylvania, and could tilt this year’s closely fought presidential election.
The area has long been divided between the liberal university town of State College, which anchors the region, and the conservative hamlets that surround it. But now the blue dot is expanding as college-educated people spread throughout Centre County, drawn by the lower cost of living, more relaxed lifestyle and economic development that has breathed new life into depleted blue-collar communities.
A college degree means more Democratic voters
Last year, 47.6% of county residents had a four-year college degree or more, up from 39.4% a decade ago. Because education levels tend to track partisan affiliation, Democrats have an increasing edge in a part of the state that has historically swung back and forth between the two parties. While in no way assured, the shift means Democratic nominee Kamala Harris could run up margins in small towns far from the big cities of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, which traditionally get far more attention from presidential campaigns.
Harris’ potential strength here reflects an ongoing tectonic realignment in American politics, with Republicans expanding their outreach to the working class and Democrats relying more on upwardly mobile, college-educated people.
In Centre County, that means Republican nominee Donald Trump remains appealing to voters who feel like their communities haven’t benefited from the area’s changes. But places like Bellefonte are trending blue, backing Joe Biden four years ago after supporting Trump four years before that, and voters with more optimistic views, like Matis, are lining up behind Harris.
“She makes you feel hopeful,” Matis said. “I want a clean slate.”
The changing demographics in Centre County have already had an impact on local politics. Although control of the board of commissioners used to switch every election, it’s been reliably Democratic for almost a decade.
The county’s leaders are also pursuing a new development plan that’s intended to diversify its economy beyond the university and attract even more people to the region.
“We have that solid rock in Penn State,” said Mark Higgins, chair of the county board of commissioners. “This is more than just Penn State now.”

Higgins said Centre County’s growth is partially fueled by “boomerangs,” meaning people who grew up in the area or went to school at Penn State and then move back to raise their family there.
“It’s Wobegon,” he said, “except it’s real.”
Much like other areas of the country, inflation and the rising cost of living have been challenges, but the impact is felt differently. People who are weary of expensive big cities are moving to State College, and people who can’t afford State College are moving to the surrounding area. It’s an economic chain reaction that means there are more liberal-minded people in more towns around the county.
People are ‘boomeranging’ back to Centre County
Derek and Lauren Ishler are the quintessential boomerang couple. They met while attending Penn State, and lived for several years in Alexandria, Virginia. But before having their two daughters, they relocated to State College to be close to their families.
“It’s grown but we still have that small-town feel,” Derek said. “We’re happy here.”
Derek, 42, does financial work for a logistics company and Lauren, 41, is an elementary school teacher. Both are voting for Harris.
“What world do I want my kids to grow up in?” he asked. “One is fear, fear, fear. The other is, ‘hey, let’s work together.’”
On a recent Friday night, they were in Bellefonte for an annual festival, where local vendors served gourmet food in a park under string lights while a band played nearby.
Stacy and Marc Counterman brought their five-month-old son in his stroller. They moved to town three years ago because Marc, 31, got a job as an academic adviser at Penn State.
They were so excited that they bought their house without seeing it in person, worried it would be snatched up before they arrived. Both of them are voting for Harris.
“She’s fighting for families,” said Stacy, 33, who works for an education nonprofit. “I’m hopeful she’ll fight for us.”
The ideological reshuffling is tied to State College, where the university is located. Some residents relocate there from what they call “Trump country” to be closer to the institution and its culture.
Alex Sterbenz, 31, came from Burnham, which is in the next county over.
“I figured it made sense to move here, instead of just coming up every weekend,” said Sterbenz, who works in a local music store and plays honkytonk songs on his 2021 Gretsch White Falcon. He tries not to talk politics with his friends and family back home.
But State College isn’t just attracting people; it’s also exerting a gravitational pull on surrounding towns.
Zeb Smoyer, 23, grew up in Bellefonte, where he joined the Boy Scouts and hunted whitetail deer. Like a lot of teenagers, he couldn’t wait to get out of town. But after he went to college elsewhere in Pennsylvania and spent some time traveling, he decided “Bellefonte is not a bad place.”
Now he lives there and works for an engineering company, which he helps comply with environmental regulations as it lays pipes for turning farmlands into housing developments. Smoyer hasn’t made up his mind about the election, but he previously voted for Biden.
The area is anchored by Penn State and its students
Ezra Nanes, the Democratic mayor of State College, said there’s been more overlap between his town and the surrounding area.
“You see an expansion of the university community and economy,” he said. “It touches all parts of the county.”
Nanes’ own journey to Centre County parallels the shifts in the region. A New York native, he was ready to make a change in his life and applied to Penn State’s MBA program. He moved to State College 14 years ago with his wife and baby daughter.
They fell in love with the community and the natural environment — “you can be in the mountains in 15 minutes,” he said — and never left. They now have two children. Nanes works at AccuWeather, a forecasting company, and his wife is a physical therapist who started her own business focused on women’s health.
Nanes was a delegate at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, and he hopes “we can help run up the score here.”
“There’s a lot of focus on the big cities,” he said. “But this is an important place if you want to win.”
One challenge is engaging Penn State’s expansive student population.
“We’re not exactly known for having a very deep political involvement, which is a shame,” said Baybars Charkas, president of the Penn State College Democrats. Charkas calls Penn State “probably the most powerful university in the United States at the current moment” given its size and location in a key battleground state. Roughly 48,000 students are enrolled at the school’s State College campus.
Graduate student Sydney Robinson started her own organization dedicated to supporting Harris. Members make friendship bracelets to promote their candidate and send text messages to rally potential voters.
Robinson, who is applying to law school, is hopeful about the future.
“We just have so many opportunities,” she said. “We’re at a crucial turning point in history, but it’s exciting.”
She’s earned the nickname “voter girl” because she tries to always carry registration forms; she gets three or four people to sign up each week.
The Harris campaign has four staff members in Centre County, including a dedicated campus organizer, and said they’ve knocked on more than 9,000 doors and made more than 80,000 phone calls. They’re also advertising on radio stations to catch voters while commuting in and out of State College.
Trump’s campaign did not provide figures on voter outreach. But Kush Desai, the Trump campaign’s Pennsylvania spokesman, said his team is attending college football tailgates and focusing on appealing to male voters to cut into Harris’ support within the educated electorate.
Some of the effort focuses on the economy, with the traditional question of, “Are you better off now than you were four years ago?” Desai also suggested that Democrats have shifted too far left on cultural issues.
“I think there’s just a natural backlash here,” he said, and men “are starting to chip away and come to our side instead.”
Ryan Klein, president of the Penn State College Republicans, said the campus leans left but conservatives aren’t as outnumbered as many think. He pointed to strong turnout at last month’s event with Trump supporter Charlie Kirk, who runs Turning Point, an organization focused on rallying young right-leaning voters.
On most days, “there aren’t a lot of people who want to go out of their way to proudly don the red hat,” Klein said, but hundreds wore “Make America Great Again” paraphernalia that day.
The county’s economic progress remains uneven
Republicans are much stronger in some of the rural areas surrounding State College that haven’t seen the same kind of development as Bellefonte.
One of those places is Philipsburg, with a postage-stamp-sized downtown where vacant storefronts remain common.
“It has potential,” said Brittney Tekely, 31. “It’s a cute little town. It just needs help.”
She saved up money to start her own barbershop there while working as a stylist during the day and in a Wal-Mart distribution warehouse at night. Tekely painted and decorated the place herself with model cars and other trinkets that she picked up at antique stores. She even went all the way to Niagara Falls to buy an old-fashioned cash register that dings loudly when opened. Her three dogs — Digger, Roxie and Mister Skunk — come to work with her and hang out in the back, where they bark when someone opens the front door.
But Tekely doesn’t see the same care being put into the rest of the town, saying, “There are buildings that no one is fixing up or tearing down.” She isn’t sure if she’ll vote this year, and many of her customers are vocal Republicans.
“They just go on and on and on,” Tekely said. “You’ve got to keep your two cents to yourself.”
Some of them, she said, “truly think if Trump becomes president again it will help the country and help prices.”
The town backed Trump over Biden four years ago, and there’s less of the optimism that characterizes Bellefonte’s renaissance.
Thomas Gette, 77, lives a few blocks from downtown with a Trump sign on the curb outside the front door. He’s retired after spending four decades as the manager of a local hardware store, and he just finished repainting his house.
Gette said voting for the Republican candidate is “a no-brainer,” especially with all the concerns about uncontrolled migration.
“Something has got to give,” he said, adding that if Trump doesn’t win, “I can’t imagine what it’s going to be like.”
In Gette’s mind, changes in the area have sapped the town of jobs and money.
“There were mines everywhere and the railroads were everywhere,” Gette said, and he’s worried that the transition away from fossil fuels is happening too fast.
And now, how would he describe Philipsburg?
“Pretty stagnant,” he said.",2024-10-23

When House members travel the globe on private dime, families often go too
They are the U.S. House’s frequent fliers — representatives who have traveled the country and the world on official business paid for by private interest groups. Over the past decade, they have accepted nearly $4.3 million for airfare, lodging, meals and other travel expenses.
Almost one-third of those payments — just over $1.4 million — covered the costs for a lawmaker’s relative to join the trip.
From European enclaves such as Rome, Geneva and Copenhagen to oceanfront golf resorts on both American coasts, to Asia and Africa, the trips allow members and their families to stay in world-class resorts, spend days soaking up the culture and score reservations at the hottest restaurants in town.
Critics maintain the trips — paid for by nearly 200 advocacy organizations, nonprofits, and liberal and conservative think tanks — are no more than “influence-peddling vacations.”
Since 2012, hundreds of House members, closely split along party lines, and their staff, have taken at least 17,000 privately funded trips, congressional records show.
But a five-month investigation by Boston University and the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the University of Maryland reveals how dozens of lawmakers legally turn the trips into free family adventures. The investigation examined 628 privately sponsored trips taken by lawmakers who topped the list of “frequent fliers” in the House in the past decade.
U.S. Rep. Barbara Lee, D-California, leads the list of frequent fliers with 45 trips since 2012. Lee has brought her grandson, spouse, sister, two daughters-in-law and two children on trips to Beijing, Berlin, two locales in Africa, as well as Istanbul, Israel and other destinations — with the family always flying business class and staying in five-star accommodations.
Lee declined interview requests. In an email, her spokesperson wrote, in part: “Congresswoman Lee has been in complete compliance with Ethics guidelines when traveling on privately funded official trips. As the Ranking Member of the House Appropriations subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations, these trips provide her an important opportunity to engage on foreign policy matters that inform her committee work and her work on behalf of her district and constituents.
“As one of the few Black lawmakers in these influential positions on foreign policy, she takes very seriously every opportunity she can to improve her understanding of global peace and security policy. Her legislative record speaks to that.”
The 24 House members who travel most frequently on the private sponsor dime took either their spouse, grandchild, sister, daughter-in-law or child with them on nearly 44% of their trips, congressional records show. House ethics rules permit funders to pay for one relative to join a trip.
“It seems like an egregious abuse,” said Beth A. Rosenson, a political science professor at the University of Florida and author of a 2009 congressional private travel study.
Allowing sponsors to pay for relatives to travel, Rosenson said, undercuts the sweeping 2007 House ethics reforms intended to distance lawmakers from special interest influence on trips, and insert more transparency into the process.
Some interest groups include lobbyists on their boards or accept money from foreign governments. When they pay the relatives’ trip costs, it heightens risks that lawmakers will feel indebted to those paying the big bills, Rosenson said.
“The member is not going to forget that the group paid for them and their spouse to go to Copenhagen, which I think is a huge problem,” Rosenson said. “It goes against the professed intent of the law, which is to reduce the influence that special interest groups have on members.”
The reforms, prompted by a 2006 scandal ensnaring public officials who took extravagant free trips from prominent Washington, D.C., lobbyist Jack Abramoff, resulted in stricter limits on lobbyists’ roles in private trips. For House leaders to approve trips, details on who pays, who goes, all expected costs and an hour-by-hour daily itinerary must be disclosed in advance. Members must participate in a full day of official programming per day on trips, and are generally expected to personally pay for recreational activities and entertainment not considered “official programming” under House travel rules.
House leaders have approved dozens of trip itineraries clearly listing recreational and entertainment activities. Trip disclosure records rarely indicate whether the sponsor or lawmaker pays for the leisure activities. The itineraries show that, in addition to the trip’s official purpose — such as a conference, policy summit or meeting with business or government leaders — opportunities for travelers include fishing, golfing, sightseeing, shopping, riverboat cruises, ceramic painting, museum and art gallery visits, hip-hop concerts, sunrise yoga and even an afternoon ballgame at Yankee Stadium.
Trip records also show the members’ relatives are rarely, if ever, part of official programs. That contrasts with federal executive branch spousal travel regulations, which require spouses to participate in formal events for funding to be approved.
House rules allow the travel, in part, so lawmakers can experience firsthand the challenges facing areas of the U.S. and the world, and enable Congress to better legislate, invest in, regulate and devise foreign policy for those regions.
Few of the 628 trips the frequent House travelers took were to impoverished regions or global trouble-spots, records show.
“These trips are not to problematic areas like Afghanistan or Iraq but usually to some sort of wonderful vacation spot like Paris or Brussels,” said congressional ethics expert Craig Holman of the nonprofit watchdog group Public Citizen. “It is little more than a vacation designed to endear the member of Congress to whoever is paying for the trip.”
Some of the House members traveling frequently take a relative on nearly every trip, even local ones to Virginia or Maryland, trip records show.
Sponsors spent nearly $100,000 for Washington Democrat Rick Larsen’s wife, Tiia Karlén, to accompany him on 19 of his 24 trips since 2012, including $12,607.76 for a 2022 excursion to Madrid, trip records show.
In an emailed statement, Larsen wrote, in part: “Private nonprofit groups regularly invite members on approved trips. I am no exception to those invites. If the work is relevant to my district, my committee, or an issue where I am developing an expertise and time permits, I consider going. Then, if, and only if, the House Ethics Committee approves the travel consistent with the House Rules, will I participate in the trip.”
U.S. Rep. Doug Lamborn, a Colorado Republican, took his wife Jeanne Lamborn on nearly every privately funded trip he took between 2012 and 2023. Sponsors ranging from The Heritage Foundation to The Aspen Institute to The German Marshall Fund of the United States underwrote almost $90,000 in costs for Jeanne Lamborn for 15 separate trips she took with her husband. The couple traveled the globe, staying in posh hotels and resorts in London, Vancouver, Jerusalem, Berlin, Prague, Nairobi, Buenos Aires and Reykjavik, as well as locales in the U.S., the records show.
A spokesperson for Lamborn did not respond to two emails and a call to his Washington office seeking comment.
In February 2020, a private car took Lee and her new husband, the Rev. Dr. Clyde Oden Jr., from the airport to luxe German resort Schloss Elmau, a historic icon nestled in the Bavarian Alps. With Lee attending a five-day forum on U.S.-German relations, Oden could enjoy the amenities of a hotel listed by Condé Nast as one of the best in the world. Oden’s trip tab: over $12,000, records show.
Illinois Democrat Jan Schakowsky brought her lobbyist husband, Robert Creamer, on 22 trips, staying in luxury hotels in London, Prague, Istanbul and São Paulo, among other destinations. Private sponsors, most frequently Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit The Aspen Institute, paid nearly $135,000 for Creamer’s travel since 2012, records show.
Schakowsky described the “educational” trips as “no walk in the park.”
”We are often working 12-hour days speaking at roundtable discussions, meeting with dignitaries and scholars and examining local policies,” she said in a statement.
An array of private organizations has underwritten nearly $136,000 for California Democrat Ami Bera to bring his wife to Copenhagen, Tokyo, Switzerland, Iceland and the opulent Cloister resort on private Sea Island, Georgia, among other places, trip records show.
Bera did not respond to multiple calls or emails to his office seeking comment.
Of the 21 privately funded trips former GOP Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan took over the past decade, he brought his wife Amey Upton on all but one. Upton retired from Congress in 2023. His most frequent sponsors were The Aspen Institute or The Ripon Society, the records show. Amey Upton’s travel cost private sponsors over $113,000. She and her husband stayed in world-class hotels and resorts in London, Paris, Copenhagen, Geneva, Rome and Istanbul, among other global cities. The sponsors also paid for the Uptons’ to travel numerous times to Sea Island, Georgia, where they stayed in the luxurious waterfront five-star resort, The Cloister, set on a private island, the records show.
Messages left on cellphones listed for the Uptons seeking comment were not returned.
In dozens of instances, the cost of one relative exceeds $10,000 or more per trip, funding that critics claim lawmakers should report as taxable income. House rules lack any guidance requiring the disclosure to the IRS of family travel costs as income, a glaring ethical omission, according to critics.
Congress updated the U.S. tax code in 1993, mandating money provided to an individual for a spouse or dependent travel costs on a business trip must be reported as income unless the relative is an employee or had a legitimate business reason to be on the trip. An IRS spokesperson did not respond to calls, emails or text messages requesting comment.
It’s not only House members who can bring family on trips. Their staff can as well.
Since 2012, some of the most frequent staff travelers on both sides of the aisle have taken their spouses on dozens of trips to resorts and spas, courtesy of private sponsors such as the Congressional Institute. According to travel disclosure forms filed by staff members, the nonprofit — which takes pride in its “premium level” programming, provides “valuable educational and organizational tools” for managing a congressional office. It also provides the spouses of these staffers the chance to stay at world-class resorts such as The Greenbrier in West Virginia. While congressional staffers are attending lectures, spouses can try their hand at falconry or yoga classes, enjoy spa treatments or play golf.
An analysis of dozens of staffers who traveled most frequently in the last decade shows private sponsors spent more than $12,000 so spouses could accompany staffers on these educational trips.
While staffers tend to keep their privately sponsored travel domestic, their bosses can be found traveling around the globe. The most frequent international destinations for House members and relatives are Israel, luxury resorts in Kenya and other regions of Africa, and Germany. U.S. popular travel spots include Virginia’s horse country, San Diego and Santa Monica, California, and annual jaunts hosted by the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation to historic Tunica, Mississippi, home to casinos, golf courses and rich Southern hospitality, records show.
Boston University and the Howard Center did not examine travel records for the much smaller Senate, which reported more than 2,600 trips during the same period. The Senate disclosure forms do not provide sponsors or destinations in a format that can be readily analyzed.
In addition to travel disclosures, nonprofit tax records and lobbying registrations, the examination by the Howard Center and Boston University also used data collected by OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan government watchdog organization, and by LegiStorm, a public affairs information platform.
In nearly 90 trips in which relatives traveled, legislators added extra days to their travel. While members are required under House rules to cover some of those costs personally, it is still a bargain for lawmakers, as private funders almost always cover round-trip airfare to the trips’ original destination for members and relatives, trip records show.
Colorado Democrat Diana DeGette leads frequent-flier House members in adding time to official trips, sometimes by up to five additional days. On seven of the trips, one family member joined her — either her husband, Lino S. Lipinsky de Orlov, a Colorado judge, or two different children, with stops in Belgium, Prague, Istanbul, Japan and a beachfront Ritz Carlton Hotel in Florida, trip records show.
Numerous travel invitations include a lawmaker’s spouse by name, another ethical red flag, critics said.
“Dear Diana: I would like to invite you and Lino to participate in a congressional conference on U.S. Russia Relations: Policy Challenges in a New Era,” reads one invitation to DeGette, from the nonprofit organization The Aspen Institute Inc. Congressional Program, a top funder of House trips since 2012. The Jan. 25, 2017, letter adds: “Expenses for you and Lino, including business class airfare” will be covered.
Such direct solicitations to members of Congress impart a basic “lack of ethical hygiene,” said Dylan Hedtler-Gaudette, senior government affairs manager for the Project on Government Oversight.
Degette did not respond to requests for comment.
In response to questions about whether it was appropriate to include a lawmaker’s spouse on a trip invitation, a spokesperson for The Aspen Institute said in an email: “Congressional Ethics rules are clear that members may be accompanied by a spouse. As the invitation in the document you attached indicates, we take compliance seriously and our programming is aligned with the spirit and the letter of those rules.
“For more than four decades, the Congressional Program has encouraged constructive interaction between members, and we have found that the presence of spouses certainly contributes to better relationships among them. Our programming is funded by foundations and 501c, free of special interests and lobbying. We’re proud of the role the Congressional Program has played in strengthening bipartisan cooperation and providing a space for members to delve into complex and pressing public policy issues.”
It is unclear if any House members report the family travel costs as income.
When asked about this and other travel guidelines for members and staffers, Tom Rust, the chief counsel and staff director for the House Ethics Committee, declined to comment.
The IRS ignored a 2006 complaint Holman filed requesting a probe into whether lawmakers broke federal law by failing to report relatives’ costs as income. He said it has never occurred.

International court prosecutor who charged Netanyahu faces sexual misconduct accusation
THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) — As the International Criminal Court’s top prosecutor sought war crimes charges this year against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu over actions in Gaza, he was engulfed in a very different personal crisis playing out behind the scenes.
Karim Khan faced accusations that he tried for more than a year to coerce a female aide into a sexual relationship and groped her against her will. He’s categorically denied the allegations, saying there was “no truth to suggestions of misconduct.” Court officials have said they may have been made as part of an Israeli intelligence smear campaign.
Two co-workers in whom the woman confided at the ICC’s headquarters at The Hague reported the alleged misconduct in early May to the court’s independent watchdog, which says it interviewed the woman and ended its inquiry after five days when she opted against filing a formal complaint. Khan himself was never questioned.
But the matter may not be over.
While the woman declined to comment to The Associated Press, people close to her say her initial reluctance was driven by distrust of the in-house watchdog and she has asked the body of member-states that oversees the ICC to launch an external probe. An ICC official with knowledge of the matter who spoke to AP on condition of anonymity confirmed that the request remains under consideration.
Those efforts were applauded by those close to the woman, who still works at the court.
“This wasn’t a one-time advance or an arm around the shoulder that could be subject to misinterpretation,” one of the people told AP, speaking on condition of anonymity to shield the woman’s identity. “It was a full-on, repeated pattern of conduct that was carried out over a long period of time.”
While the court’s watchdog could not determine wrongdoing, it nonetheless urged Khan in a memo to minimize contact with the woman to protect the rights of all involved and safeguard the court’s integrity.
Within days of the watchdog’s shelving of the case, the court’s work went on. Khan on May 20 sought arrest warrants against Netanyahu, his defense minister and three Hamas leaders on war crimes charges. A three-judge panel is now weighing that request.
U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration said it was blindsided by the move, with the president calling the prosecution “outrageous” for implying an equivalence between Israel and Hamas.
In announcing the charges, Khan hinted that outside forces were waging a campaign to derail his investigation.
“I insist that all attempts to impede, intimidate or improperly influence the officials of this court must cease immediately,” Khan said, adding he wouldn’t hesitate to use his authority to investigate anyone suspected of obstructing justice.
The allegations
AP pieced together details of the accusations through whistleblower documents shared with the court’s independent watchdog and interviews with eight ICC officials and individuals close to the woman. All spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the allegations or fear of retaliation.
Among the allegations told to AP is that Khan noticed the woman working at another department at ICC and moved her into his office, a transfer that included a pay bump. Their time together allegedly increased after a private dinner in London where Khan took the woman’s hand and complained about his marriage. She became a presence on official trips and meetings with dignitaries.
During one such trip, Khan allegedly asked the woman to rest with him on a hotel bed and then “sexually touched her,” according to the documents. Later, he came to her room at 3 a.m. and knocked on the door for 10 minutes.
Other allegedly nonconsensual behavior cited in the documents included locking the door of his office and sticking his hand in her pocket. He also allegedly asked her on several occasions to go on a vacation together.
Upon returning to ICC’s headquarters after one trip, she tearfully complained to two co-workers about Khan’s behavior and the anguish she felt for not standing up to a boss she once admired.
Those co-workers were shocked because Khan always seemed to show exemplary behavior around women and has been outspoken against gender-based crimes. They also weighed the accusations against the backdrop of well-publicized attempts by intelligence agents from Israel and elsewhere to penetrate the court, which created a work environment plagued by intrigue and mistrust.
But in the wake of the #MeToo movement, no powerful man is above scrutiny, and the co-workers complied with court workplace guidelines that encouraged the reporting of misconduct by senior officials.
After months of inaction and whispered rumors of a brewing scandal, an anonymous account on X called @ICC_Leaks last week began bringing some of the allegations to light.
Israel’s allies in the U.S. Congress have also seized on the would-be scandal. Sen. Lindsey Graham is seeking records about whether the misconduct accusations played any role in Khan’s decision in May to cancel an aide’s planned visit to Israel and move ahead with the war crimes charges.
“Another cloud — a moral one — hangs over prosecutor Khan’s abrupt decision to abandon engagement with Israel and seek arrest warrants,” the South Carolina Republican wrote in a letter to the court’s oversight authority.
Khan, who is 54 and married with two children, said in a statement there was “no truth” to the accusations, and that in 30 years of scandal-free investigative work he always has stood with victims of sexual harassment and abuse.
Khan added that he would be willing, if asked, to cooperate with any inquiry, saying it is essential that any accusations “are thoroughly listened to, examined and subjected to a proper process.”
Without naming any entity directly, he noted that both he and the court have been the target in recent months of “a wide range of attacks and threats,” some also aimed at his wife and family. Khan’s office declined to provide specifics because the incidents are under investigation.
A growing list of enemies
Under Khan, the ICC has become more assertive in combating crimes against humanity, war crimes and related atrocities. Along the way, it has added to a growing list of enemies.
Last September, following the opening of a probe into Russian atrocities in Ukraine, the court suffered a debilitating cyberattack that left staff unable to work for weeks. It also hired an intern who was later criminally charged in the U.S. with being a Russian spy.
Israel has also been waging its own influence campaign ever since the ICC recognized Palestine as a member and in 2015 opened a preliminary investigation into what the court referred to as “the situation in the State of Palestine.”
London’s The Guardian newspaper and several Israeli news outlets reported this summer that Israel’s intelligence agencies for the past decade have allegedly targeted senior ICC staff, including putting Khan’s predecessor under surveillance and showing up at her house with envelopes stuffed with cash to discredit her.
Netanyahu himself, in the days leading up to Khan’s announcement of war crimes charges, called on the world’s democracies “ to use all the means at their disposal ” to block the court from what he called an “outrage of historic proportions.”
The Israeli foreign ministry referred AP’s inquiries about the case to the Prime Minister’s office, which did not respond. The U.S. State Department declined to discuss the matter but said in a statement that it “takes any allegation of sexual harassment seriously, and we would expect the court to do the same.”
The Dutch foreign ministry and several lawmakers in the Netherlands have called for an investigation into whether the Israeli embassy has been conducting covert activities against the ICC.
Who is Khan?
Khan, a British international lawyer, had a long history defending some of the world’s most ruthless strongmen – including former Liberian President Charles Taylor and the son of the late Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi -- before being elected in 2021 in a secret ballot to become chief prosecutor.
The Rome Statute that established the court took effect in 2002, with a mandate to prosecute war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide — but only when domestic courts fail to initiate their own investigations. Neither the U.S., Israel nor Russia are among the 124 member nations recognizing the court’s authority, although their citizens can be charged with crimes committed in countries that are ICC members.
Still, Washington welcomed Khan’s election, especially after he moved to “deprioritize” an investigation opened by his predecessor into abuses by U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan.
Khan also broadened the court’s focus, bringing criminal charges for the first time against individuals outside Africa. He charged Russian President Vladimir Putin for kidnapping children in Ukraine and opened an investigation into Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro for his crackdown on protesters.
“He is by far the most professional jurist the court has had in its short history,” said Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch. “He’s articulate, sophisticated with the media and has extensive courtroom experience working with the highest standards of evidence.”
But Khan’s reputation with the U.S. came crashing down when he announced he was seeking the arrest of Netanyahu and Israel’s defense minister for war crimes including starvation of civilians.
To insulate himself from attacks that he held an anti-Israel bias, Khan, a practicing Muslim whose father migrated to the UK from Pakistan, shared the evidence with a panel of experts including British human rights lawyer Amal Clooney, wife of actor George Clooney.
‘Extreme fear’ to report misconduct
Although the 900-employee ICC has long had a “zero-tolerance” policy on sexual harassment, an outside review of the court’s inner-workings in 2020 found an unacceptable level of predatory behavior by male bosses, a lack of women in senior positions, and inadequate mechanisms for dealing with complaints and protecting whistleblowers.
“There is a general reluctance, if not extreme fear, among many staff to report any alleged act of misconduct or misbehavior” by a senior official, the review concluded. “The perception is that they are all immune.”
Although the ICC’s policies have been updated since the report, there’s no explicit ban on romantic relationships like there is in many American workplaces. And while elected officials such as Khan are expected to show “high moral character,” there’s no definition of “serious misconduct” that would warrant removal.
International organizations, like the ICC, are some of the last places where men in positions of power treat the organization like their “playgrounds,” said Sarah Martin, a gender equality expert who has consulted for several United Nations agencies.
“There are so many complaints that don’t even get investigated because there’s a perception that senior officials protect each other,” she said.
People close to Khan’s accuser say investigators from the court’s watchdog — known as the Independent Oversight Mechanism — showed up for an interview on a Sunday and asked for intimate details about her relationship with Khan as her child listened. Without any emotional support and wary of the process, she decided not to file a complaint at that moment.
In the weeks since, she’s decided to go up the chain of command, reaching out to the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute, which oversees the court and has the ultimate say about Khan’s future.
Paivi Kaukoranta, a Finnish diplomat currently serving as president of that body, did not comment specifically when asked if it had initiated a new investigation.
But in a statement she asked people to respect the integrity and confidentiality of the process, “including any further possible steps as necessary.”

Thousands of children adopted by Americans are without citizenship. Congress is unwilling to act
HENDERSON, Nev. (AP) — The 50-year-old newspaper was turning yellow and its edges fraying, so she had it laminated, not as a memento but as proof — America made a promise to her, and did not keep it.
She pointed to the picture in the corner of her as a little girl in the rural Midwest, hugging the family Yorkshire terrier, with dark pigtails and brown eyes so round people called her Buttons. Next to her sit smiling, proud parents — her father an Air Force veteran who had survived a German prison camp in World War II and found her in an orphanage in Iran. She was a skinny, sickly 2-year-old; he and his wife decided in 1972 to take her home and make her their American daughter.
They brought her to the United States on a tourist visa, which in the eyes of the government she soon overstayed as a toddler — and that is an offense that cannot be rectified. She is one of thousands of children adopted from abroad by American parents — many of them military service members — who were left without citizenship by loopholes in American law that Congress has been aware of for decades, yet remains unwilling to fix.
She is technically living here illegally, and eligible for deportation.
“My dad died thinking, ‘I raised my daughter. I did my part,’ but not knowing it put me on a path of instability and fear,” she said. The Associated Press is using only her childhood nickname, Buttons, because of her legal status. “Adoption tells you: You’re an American, this is your home. But the United States doesn’t see me as an American.”
Every time she turns on the news, she hears former President Donald Trump, in his bid for reelection, promising to round up immigrants living illegally in the U.S. Now she lays awake at night, wondering what it would be like to be sent back to Iran.
“What is a detention camp even like?” she wondered.
“We have a plan, we won’t let that happen,” her friend Joy Alessi, a Korean adoptee, assured her. They have lawyers, media statements prepared, phone numbers of sympathetic congressmembers.
But they slumped their shoulders — they know it could happen, because it already has.

Out of the shadows
These two women grew up in military families, and were taught to be grateful to the nation that celebrated saving them. Then one day, as adults, they walked into passport offices and learned the news that would unspool their lives.
Their adoption paperwork, signed by judges and stamped by governments, declared they enjoyed all the privileges of being daughters of American families. But that was untrue in one critical respect: Adoption for decades did not automatically make children citizens.
They both hid for years, thinking they were the only one who fell through the cracks. Then Trump stormed into politics in 2015 on a promise to rid America of undocumented immigrants. They weren’t citizens, so they couldn’t even vote to try to stop him. Each decided they had nothing left to lose, emerged and found each other.
A bureaucratic loophole left thousands of foreign adoptees without U.S. citizenship. Some adoptees live in hiding, fearing that tipping off the government could prompt their removal back to the country the U.S. claimed to have rescued them from. Some have already been deported.

Other adoptees found them, too, and told stories of indignities endured by those not fully American — they can’t get jobs or driver’s licenses or passports, every interaction with the government is terrifying, some panic when there’s a knock on the door.
No one knows how many of them there are — estimates range from 15,000 to 75,000. Many were adopted from South Korea, home to the world’s longest and largest adoption program, but they’d also been brought from Ethiopia, Romania, Belize, more than two dozen countries.
They started the Adoptee Rights Campaign, and were joined by an unexpected coalition, from the Southern Baptist Convention to liberal immigration advocates, all baffled that the government let this linger.
The Adoptee Rights Campaign has heard from people who’d been deported, some still living in hiding, others freshly discovering they’d never been made citizens. There is no government mechanism for alerting them. They find out by accident, when applying for passports or government benefits. One woman learned as a senior citizen, when she was denied the Social Security she’d paid into all her life.
Buttons calls herself the group’s “adoptee wrangler;” she was visiting Alessi in Nevada, sitting at her kitchen table, fielding inquiries and checking in on people.
She’s 54 and has never been in trouble; she has a corporate job in health care, owns her own home in California. She was raised a Christian, so fears that deportation to Iran would be “a death sentence.” Still legislators won’t help.
She had hope. She’s lost that now. For a decade, legislation has been introduced over and over, it dies, and nothing happens.
So she lugs around the laminated newspaper clipping, stacks of adoption files and court records as proof she’s supposed to be here.
“It’s hard to give hope,” she said, “when I don’t feel like I have any left.”
‘One piece of paper can ruin your life’
Alessi anointed her friend Buttons “an honorary Korean.”
This problem they have both endured was born there, in Alessi’s motherland, and to her it represents the most glaring example of the neglectful system that brought them here.
The international adoption industry grew out of the wreckage of the Korean War in the 1950s. Americans were desperate for babies — the domestic supply of adoptable children had plummeted — and South Korea wanted to rid itself of mouths to feed. Alessi was among this early wave of adoptees, taken from South Korea at 7 months old in 1967.
The system focused on shipping children abroad as quickly as possible. Korea’s government, eager to curry favor with the U.S., did everything it could to speed up the process, including relaxing the obligation of agencies to ensure citizenship for adoptees.
The adoption industry took the model created in South Korea into poor countries around the world, shipping babies in bulk to American families.
South Korea has struggled to track the citizenship of children placed in U.S. homes, and the status of more than 17,550 remains unconfirmed, according to government data AP obtained. The Adoptee Rights Campaign used Korean figures to estimate up to 75,000 adoptees from all over the world could lack citizenship. But groups like the National Council for Adoption put the number somewhere between 15,000 and 18,000.
The Korean adoption diaspora has been hit particularly hard — there are simply more of them. At least 11 adoptees have been deported to South Korea since 2002, where they don’t know the language or the culture. An adoptee named Phillip Clay, sent to the U.S. at 8 years old in 1983, was deported. He killed himself by jumping from an apartment building in Seoul in 2017 at 42 years old.
Adam Crapser, adopted at 3 years old in 1979, was also deported to South Korea. The married father of two says he was abused and abandoned by two different adoptive families who never filed his citizenship papers. He got into trouble with the law — once for breaking into his adoptive parents’ home to retrieve the Bible that came with him from the orphanage.
He sued his Korean adoption agency, Holt Children’s Services, and a court last year ordered the agency to pay him damages for failing to inform his adopters that they should take steps to secure his citizenship.
For some adoptees, their status is fixable through the arduous naturalization process — they have to join the line as though they’d just arrived. It takes years, thousands of dollars, wasted days, routine rejections from immigration offices on technicalities, the wrong form, an errant typo.
Alessi looked at a picture of herself standing in a high school gymnasium, finally being made an American citizen at 52. “We welcome you!” she remembers the announcer saying, and the crowd cheered. But her body looks stiff, her mouth pursed.
“You don’t welcome us,” she thought that day in 2019.
Her friend, the adoptee called Buttons, was at the ceremony crying, genuinely happy for her friend, but also devastated for herself. Alessi felt a sort of survivor’s guilt.
“You were sitting right there, and I felt so conflicted, so shameful,” Alessi told her.
Because for some adoptees, there is no clear solution. The difference between them is what visa their adoptive parents brought them in on, and many chose the fastest route — like a tourist or medical visa — not imagining complications down the road.
“One piece of paper,” Buttons said, “can ruin your life.”
‘A collective failure’
A quarter-century ago, the U.S. Congress recognized it had left adoptees in this legal limbo.
By 2000, nearly 20,000 children were coming to America each year. But the U.S. had wedged foreign adoptions into a system created for domestic ones. State courts give adopted children new birth certificates that list their adoptive parents’ names, purporting to give them all the privileges of biological children.
But state courts have no control over immigration. After the expensive, long process of adoption, parents were supposed to naturalize their adopted children, but some never did.
Those early decades of adoption were a “wild west,” said Greg Luce, a lawyer who has represented many non-citizen adoptees; there was no standardized procedure to help adoptive families.
“It’s a combination of adoption agencies that were neglectful, adoptive parents who should have known better, and the U.S. government that had lax oversight and a visa system that could allow this to happen,” Luce said. “It’s a collective failure on the part of everyone who was involved except the adoptee. They were a child, and they’re the ones left holding the bag.”
The U.S. is unique in this: No other nation that has taken in adopted children deprives them of citizenship.
In 2000, Congress acknowledged that injustice and passed the Child Citizenship Act, conferring automatic citizenship to adopted children. But it was designed to streamline the process for adoptive parents, not to help adoptees, and so applied only to those younger than 18 when it took effect. Everyone born before the arbitrary date of Feb. 27, 1983, was not included.
Hannah Daniel, director of public policy for the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, the lobbying arm of the Southern Baptist Convention, said lawmakers often find this situation hard to believe.
“I agree that it feels unbelievable,” she said. “It’s the most classic example of wanting to bang your head against the wall, because how in the world have we not fixed this?”
Adoption has been a rare issue championed by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, a way of saving children by making them American. Many churches preach intercountry adoption as a Biblical calling.
Daniel is part of a bipartisan coalition lobbying for a decade for a bill that extends citizenship to everyone legally adopted by American parents. The groups insist that families formed by adoption are due the same respect, the same rights, as biological ones, including equal treatment under the criminal justice system.
But that argument has been consumed by the country’s hyper-partisan frenzy over immigration. Any bills offering paths to citizenship have stalled out.
Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley, among those skeptical of the legislation, declined an interview. A spokesperson wrote in a statement that he is “a longtime adoption advocate” but “believes that any adult seeking U.S. citizenship should have their criminal records taken into consideration.”
That is a sentiment that advocates of the bill say undermines the very meaning of adoption. If a foreign adopted sibling and a biological sibling commit a crime together, the biological child would pay their debt to society and move on. The adopted child might face a second, severe punishment: getting sent back to where the U.S. professed to have rescued them from.
A bill is before Congress again now. But Daniel isn’t hopeful.
“In this day and age in Congress, if not doing anything is an option,” she said, “that is the bet I’m going to take.”
‘The American dream’
Laura Lynn Davis called her representatives, her senators. She’s written to celebrities and talk show hosts, thinking surely someone would help.
Mike Davis, her husband of 27 years, was adopted by a soldier, a Vietnam veteran stationed in Ethiopia, who met him there as a boy and brought him to the U.S.
He was deported to Ethiopia two decades ago, and now lives in a room with a mud floor and running water only once a month and even when the tap works, it isn’t safe to drink.
Davis, now 61, remembers his father telling him that everything would be OK because he was an American now. He pledged allegiance to the flag every morning and considered himself a happy military brat, moving around Army bases.
“I was living the American dream,” Davis said.
He worked at a pizza shop through high school and when he graduated, he opened his own.
In the 1990s, he was charged with possession of a firearm, marijuana and cocaine. He didn’t go to prison; he was sentenced to 120 days in a boot camp program. He found out he’d never been naturalized when he reported to his probation officer.
Nothing happened for years. He married Laura Lynn, they had children to raise, and he pushed it to the back of his mind.
Then one day in 2003, he closed his pizza shop and went to bed, someone banged on their door at 5 a.m.
“My kids were sleeping,” he said, “When they woke up, their dad was gone.”
He languished in a detention center for over a year, terrified, because he had the same perception of Ethiopia as many Americans: The State Department advises its citizens to not go there because of unpredictable violence, kidnappings, terrorism.
Then officers took him to the airport and put him on a plane, he said. One officer felt sorry for him and gave him $20; Davis promised to pay him back when he returned to the U.S.
He sold his wedding ring to pay rent, and that was the darkest moment. His adoptive father grew sicker, and Davis anguished over not being with him in the end.
His wife sold their house and moved their family to be with him. But life was hard in Ethiopia: There were people with M16s on the street, they couldn’t work or speak the language. Laura Lynn lost 30 pounds. She and their children went home to Georgia.
Mike was their breadwinner, and they struggled without him. They lived in cars and motels, but never blamed him.
Laura Lynn kept all his things neatly packed and awaiting his return: clothes, sports memorabilia, his favorite music — on cassette tapes, a reminder of how the world changed since he left. He gets sick a lot as he’s getting older, she said, and can’t access medications in Ethiopia.
He has five grandchildren he’s never met. His youngest son, Adam, 26 now, recently moved into his first apartment, and thought how nice it would be to have his father there to see it.
Laura Lynn has more hope than she has in a long time, she said, because a group she never expected came to their aid: Koreans. They’ve offered advocacy and legal help. He’s being represented by groups like Asian Americans Advancing Justice and Adoptees for Justice.
“I pray we can make them see that he didn’t ask to come here, he was adopted and brought here. He became a really good man,” she said. “He has a family who loves him and we’re ready for him to come back home to us.”
‘A spin of the roulette wheel’
Emily Howe, a lawyer in California, carries around a 5-inch binder, which she calls “the simplified version” of the labyrinthine set of laws that dictate which adoptees have been able to become citizens and which have not.
Howe was adopted from South Korea in 1984, barely young enough to be granted citizenship by the 2000 law. By a twist of luck and timing, this could have been her, she said. So she represents many adoptive families for free.
“It shouldn’t be a spin of the roulette wheel,” she said. She now asks every adoptee if they know their citizenship status. It gets complicated quickly; if they ask the government and find out they aren’t citizens, they tip off authorities to them living here illegally.
Her clients are panicking about what will happen if Trump wins reelection.
“I’m terrified,” a mother named Debbie cried in Howe’s San Diego office. “What if he gets back in? I’m hearing him talk about mass deportations.”
Debbie and her husband, Paul, adopted two special-needs children from a Romanian orphanage in the 1990s, and they’ve been trying to make them citizens almost ever since. The Associated Press is using only the first names of the parents because they fear endangering their adopted children.
The California couple watched a “20/20” television special about the plight of children there — they called them “unsalvageables,” they didn’t learn to read, there wasn’t enough food.
The couple was middle-class, with three biological children. But Debbie couldn’t sleep thinking about those kids, cold and hungry. So they refinanced their house to bring home two, a boy and a girl.
“We thought we had to get these children out of there. Then we’ll deal with what we need to deal with,” Debbie said.
The boy was 10, and so small, just 40 pounds, that the school allowed him in kindergarten. The girl was 14 and legally blind, with limited vision in just one eye. They both had physical and cognitive impairments; the doctors believed the boy suffered fetal alcohol poisoning.
The family was overwhelmed by their needs. Their new son was curious — in another life, he might have been an engineer, Debbie thinks. But in this one, they had to nail the front door shut because he’d wander out at night. He was fascinated by electricity, and couldn’t be left alone without fear he’d start a fire.
Howe assures them they did everything they could.
“We thought we did it the right way, we tried to, I hope we did,” Debbie said. “Maybe we were naive. Maybe there was something we missed.”
They consulted with dozens of lawyers, who all said it couldn’t be fixed — it was a convoluted calculation of the children’s ages, how their birth certificates were written, their visas. They can’t tally how many thousands of dollars they’ve spent.
“It’s dumb, it’s outrageously dumb, it should not be this monstrous task,” Howe said. “This could be fixed in a month if anyone had the political will to do it.”
Their son, 43, doesn’t understand the situation he’s in. But their daughter understands. She’s a Special Olympian, now 46, with a stack of gold medals. She can’t compete in international competitions because she can’t get a passport.
“I want to be a citizen really bad,” their daughter said. “I want to be here for a long, long time.”
They’ve called their legislators. Debbie wept again and again: “My adopted children deserve all the privileges of my birth children. They are no different in our eyes. Why are you looking at them differently?”
Everyone told them not to worry because they aren’t the type of people on immigration’s radar.
Then Trump’s administration terrified them. Debbie lay in bed, thinking her children couldn’t survive a detention camp. She imagined someone barging into their home and snatching them. It made her physically sick.
Debbie and Paul are in their late 60s, and feel an urgent need to fix this.
“The clock is ticking,” Debbie said. “I have zero regrets about adding these two to my family. But this country let them down, absolutely, without a doubt.”
‘It’s time for my country to fight for me’
For most of her life, Joy Alessi was a proud patriot, who got teary-eyed when Garth Brooks sang about America. But patriotism is confusing for her now — as it is for many of the adoptees who’ve found themselves in this predicament.
Alessi and Buttons hadn’t seen their friend and fellow adoptee, Leah Elmquist, since she became naturalized.
“Do you feel different? Do you feel like a citizen?” Alessi asked her, when they met for dinner at a Korean barbeque.
Elmquist had always considered herself “super-duper American.” She served in the Navy for 10 years; she was in a USAA commercial. That was all before she was actually made an American.
She told Alessi she doesn’t feel any differently now.
“I felt like a citizen for the decade I was in the Navy. And I wasn’t one,” she said.
Elmquist was adopted from South Korea as an infant in 1983, just six months too old to get citizenship by the 2000 legislation.
She grew up in a white family in a Nebraska town with two stop lights. She can cite what her adoption decree declared her parents had done: they “do hereby bestow upon said minor child equal rights, privileges and immunities with children born in lawful wedlock.”
That was not true, but she only learned that later.
“That’s why I joined the military. I felt so lucky to be an American, ironically. I wanted to thank this country for raising me,” she said. “I didn’t think about citizenship because I felt I was being more American than most Americans.”
She excelled in the military, but wasn’t eligible for certain security clearances. She’s wanted to serve as a linguist, but couldn’t. After leaving, she laid low, terrified of deportation. When Trump won election in 2016, she felt a fear more intense than the night before she deployed to Iraq.
Alessi pulled up a photo of Elmquist in 2019, standing behind a podium marked with the seal of the U.S. House of Representatives. Elmquist was wearing her military uniform, and Alessi recalled that the room went quiet, all you could hear was the “click click click” of cameras.
Elmquist remembered what she’d said: “I fought for my country, now it’s time for my country to fight for me.”
It didn’t.
That session, the bill didn’t pass.
Elmquist was rejected multiple times by immigration. Finally, she made it to an interview, and had to prove she could read and write English. Her interviewer was a veteran, like her, and said it seemed weird she was there. “Tell me about it,” she remembers responding.
She was naturalized in 2022, the day before her 40th birthday. She likes to look back at her picture on the front page of the local newspaper.
“I can see how happy I was,” she says. “I almost cried.”
“I can imagine,” Buttons responded.
She smiled, and wiped away a tear, imagining that one day maybe she’d feel that too.

AP,"Not everything will run perfectly on Election Day. Still, US elections are remarkably reliable","Not everything will run perfectly on Election Day. Still, US elections are remarkably reliable
Not everything will run perfectly on Election Day. Still, US elections are remarkably reliable
WASHINGTON (AP) — On Election Day, some voting lines will likely be long and some precincts may run out of ballots. An election office website could go down temporarily and ballot-counting machines will jam. Or people who help run elections might just act like the humans they are, forgetting their key to a local polling place so it has to open later than scheduled.
These kinds of glitches have occurred throughout the history of U.S. elections. Yet election workers across America have consistently pulled off presidential elections and accurately tallied the results — and there’s no reason to believe this year will be any different.
Elections are a foundation of democracy. They also are human exercises that, despite all the laws and rules governing how they should run, can sometimes appear to be messy. They’re conducted by election officials and volunteers in thousands of jurisdictions across the United States, from tiny townships to sprawling urban counties with more voters than some states have people.
It’s a uniquely American system that, despite its imperfections, reliably produces certified outcomes that stand up to scrutiny. That’s true even in an era of misinformation and hyperpartisanship.
“Things will go wrong,” said Jen Easterly, the director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.
None of these will mean the election is tainted or rigged or is being stolen. But Easterly said election offices need to be transparent about the hiccups so they can get ahead of misinformation and attempts to exploit routine problems as a way to undermine confidence in the election results.
“At the end of the day, we need to recognize things will go wrong. They always do,” Easterly said. “It will really come down to how state and local election officials communicate about those things going wrong.”
An election problem? It’s likely human error
It wasn’t that long ago when American voters accepted the results, even if their preferred presidential candidate lost.
Even in 2000, when 104 million votes came down to a 5-to-4 Supreme Court decision that effectively made Republican George W. Bush the president, his opponent, Democrat Al Gore, quickly conceded. The republic moved on peacefully.
Times have changed dramatically since then.
The internet, false claims and a voting public susceptible to conspiratorial theories about widespread voter fraud have changed that. Trust in the system is low, particularly among Republican voters whose perceptions have been shaped by a steady drumbeat of lies about the 2020 election by Donald Trump, the former president who is the Republican nominee on the Nov. 5 ballot.
At his campaign rallies, Trump continues to claim that the only way he can lose is if the other side rigs the election. In fact, it would be virtually impossible for anyone to rig a U.S. presidential race given the decentralized nature of the country’s elections, which are run by thousands of municipal or county voting jurisdictions.
What is more likely are simple mistakes and technical mishaps that occur during every election.
“When elections are very close and you have to look under the hood, sometimes you find some problems. Almost always those problems are the result of human error, incompetence — not malfeasance,” said Rick Hasen, an election law expert and professor at the University of California, Los Angeles.
“Both voter fraud and election administrator fraud is currently very rare in the United States. When it does happen, it’s not that hard to catch because of the safeguards in the system.”

Why do we need this discussion?
Distrust in elections is real and has serious consequences. Lies about the 2020 election being rigged were a catalyst for the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.
This has come despite Trump and his allies losing dozens of court cases aimed at reversing his loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Even a commission Trump created while president to investigate the 2016 election in hopes of identifying widespread voter fraud found none. Special police units established by a few Republican governors came up similarly empty-handed when they searched for widespread fraud during the 2022 midterm elections.
In addition to the court cases, Trump’s own attorney general and reviews, recounts and audits in the presidential battleground states found no evidence of widespread fraud and affirmed Biden’s victory.
That hasn’t mattered.
As late as 2023, a sizable portion of Republicans believed Biden was not the legitimately elected, and election conspiracy theories have taken root in Republican-leaning communities.
It would be incorrect to say there is never any fraud associated with elections. But in the 2020 election, an Associated Press investigation in the battleground states where Trump disputed his loss found an amount too small to alter the election. In most cases, it was individuals acting alone, not as part of a grand conspiracy to throw the election.
“The story of the last few decades is that voting systems in the United States are very secure,” said Robert Lieberman, a political science professor at Johns Hopkins University.
If not fraud, then what should we expect?
Basic mistakes, whether human or technical.
In Jackson, Mississippi, a ballot problem was blamed on inexperience and lack of training. In Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, inexperience was again the culprit when polling places ran out of ballots.
Sometimes the envelopes used to return the mailed ballots can create problems. The Pennsylvania Department of State recently announced on X that because of high humidity levels in much of the state, “some voters are finding that their mail-in ballots have the return envelope already sealed.” It advised voters to contact their local election office for next steps.
Paper was the culprit in a Maricopa County, Arizona, in 2022 when the ballot printers had problems and caused large backups in voter lines.
Potential problems on the horizon
One of the major concerns heading into the 2024 presidential election is the high turnover in election offices across the country, in particular in some of the presidential battlegrounds, said Edward B. Foley, a law professor who leads Ohio State University’s election law program.
Before the 2022 midterms, for example, 10 of Nevada’s 17 counties had turnover among their clerk or registration positions, which oversee voting.
Threats and harassment from those who believe election conspiracy theories have fueled the attrition. Despite all the training election workers receive, there’s no substitute for the experience of going through a major election cycle.
Many of those who have left had years and even decades of experience. In some cases, they have been replaced by people with little or no experience, and who at times have peddled conspiracy theories.
“If you’re looking for something to watch out for and be concerned about,” Foley said, “that is one place.”

Nebraska uses a unique method to find election workers: It drafts them
OMAHA, Neb. (AP) — Americans are encouraged to do their duty and vote on Election Day. But in Nebraska, some residents must go a step further: They are required to help run the elections.
Nebraska is the only state in the U.S. that employs compulsory election duty to recruit precinct poll workers, election office helpers and ballot deliverers, among other tasks, according to the National Conference of State Legislators. Anyone who ignores a summons could be charged with a criminal misdemeanor and fined up to $100.
Twenty years ago, Dawn O’Brien was busy teaching and shuttling kids to school and practice when she received a letter telling her she’d been selected for election duty. She had lived in Omaha for about 25 years by then and had never heard of mandatory election duty.
“I was surprised,” she recalled. “I do remember thinking, ‘Boy, how am I going to juggle this?’”
But like a lot of Nebraska residents drafted into the job, O’Brien ended up with a new appreciation for civic service. She now volunteers to work most elections.
“I just learned so much about what it takes to pull off free, fair elections,” she said. “It is a massive effort to do this and to do it right.”
So far, only Douglas and Sarpy counties — among the state’s most populous in the Omaha metro area — use the draft. That’s because with nearly 500,000 of the state’s 1.25 million registered voters in those two counties, they need thousands of workers to help at hundreds of polling places.
Finding all that help — especially at a time when election workers face threats and safety concerns — can be a challenge, Douglas County Election Commission Brian Kruse said. For the upcoming election, Douglas will employ about 3,000 election workers, 45% of whom are drafted.
While other states rely on election officials to recruit workers, with some turning to churches or community civic organizations to scrounge up volunteers, Nebraska’s system works much the same way as jury duty: Registered voters are selected at random to serve on Election Day. State law allows exemptions for anyone 70 or older, those with documented health issues or other reasons deemed acceptable. It also allows those with young children to defer service until the children are older.
The only other way to get out of election duty?
“You have to remove yourself from the voter registration rolls,” Kruse said. “Most people don’t want to go that route.”
Unlike jury duty, those selected for the Nebraska election draft aren’t just obligated to work the next election. They’re on the hook for four elections.
Along with those who volunteer, election draftees are paid a minimum wage of $12 an hour. State law requires draftees’ employers to allow paid time off to fulfill the duty, although employers may deduct the election work pay from the paid time off.
Power the Polls, a national initiative started in 2020 to recruit election workers, is keeping an eye on Nebraska’s approach, which has been in practice since at least the 1950s.
Marta Hanson, national program manager for Power the Polls, said a draft is an innovative way of ensuring diversity among poll workers and recruiting younger workers in an area dominated by those over 60.
“One of the biggest requests that we hear from election administrators across the country is for poll workers who have tech fluency, who are comfortable using an iPad or tablet as they upgrade election-related technology nationwide,” Hanson said.

Had she not been drafted, O’Brien said she likely never would have thought about volunteering.
“It wouldn’t even have occurred to me,” O’Brien said. “It does give me a sense of pride knowing that I’m helping to promote democracy. There’s a lot of people in other parts of the world that would probably be thrilled to have their right to vote.”",2024-10-29
AP,Latino evangelical voters torn between their faith and harsh rhetoric around immigration,"Latino evangelical voters torn between their faith and harsh rhetoric around immigration
Latino evangelical voters torn between their faith and harsh rhetoric around immigration
The Rev. Arturo Laguna leads a largely immigrant church of about 100 followers in Phoenix. His job as a pastor, he says, gets complicated come election season.
Laguna’s church, Casa de Adoracion, is in Arizona — one of seven closely-watched swing states that could possibly decide the next president. It is also a microcosm of the larger Latino evangelical Christian community in the U.S.
The soft-spoken Laguna says, for the members of his congregation, voting is “not an intellectual issue.”
“It’s a matter of faith and spirituality,” he said. “We’re in a complicated moment because, on the one hand, we are against abortion, and on the other, we are concerned about the sharp rhetoric around immigration and lack of reform. It’s a difficult choice.”
This is not a new dilemma for Latino evangelicals, who are growing in numbers even as mainline white Protestant denominations have steadily declined. Latino evangelicals are an influential voting bloc. Both parties have tried to appeal to them over the past two election cycles — neither with remarkable success — according to faith and community leaders.
A 2022 Pew Research Center survey showed 15% of Latinos in the U.S identify as evangelical Protestants. Among all American evangelicals, they are the fastest-growing group. About half of Latino evangelicals identified as Republicans or as independents who lean right, while 44% identified as Democrats or as independents leaning left.
While U.S. Latinos generally favor Democratic candidates, a majority of Latino evangelicals backed Donald Trump in 2020. According to AP Votecast, about six in 10 Latino evangelical voters supported Trump in 2020, while four in 10 supported Biden.
A Pew survey released last month showed that about two-thirds of Latino Protestants planned to back Trump this year, while about two-thirds of Hispanic Catholics and religiously unaffiliated Hispanics said they were supporting Vice President Kamala Harris.
Agustin Quiles, president and founder of Mission Talk, a Florida-based Latino Christian social justice organization, says conflicting priorities leave some Latino evangelicals feeling politically homeless. Some are torn between their conservative views on social issues such as abortion and their desire to see immigration and criminal justice reform, he said.
While many are offended by Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric, Quiles added, Democrats still haven’t figured out how to have conversations with the community about issues such as abortion.
“So there is a lot of silence among Latino evangelicals right now,” he said. “That does not mean they are not going to vote. There is just a lot of discontent.”
To understand Latino evangelicals, it is important to understand their origins, said Elizabeth Conde-Frazier, a scholar of the Association of Hispanic Theological Association. The word “evangelico” pertains to Protestants or those who are not Catholic, which includes a wide swath of churches, cultures and traditions, she said.
“When immigrants come here and have to reestablish themselves, the Protestant, Pentecostal and mainline churches become spaces where people create a new sense of community and family,” Conde-Frazier said. “People are trying to understand what life is supposed to be in this country.”
With white Protestantism in decline and different mainline denominations vying for the loyalty of these communities, second-generation Latino Christians became more a part of the dominant culture and often embraced the fervor of the white evangelical church, she said.

“Latino churches, in order to gain a sense of power and acceptance, began to align with (white conservative) evangelical churches in the U.S., moving away from their ‘evangelico’ roots,” Conde-Frazier said. Now, she added, some Latino evangelicals find themselves increasingly at odds with their white counterparts because they are pro-immigration.

Quiles says in white evangelical churches where Latinos, including undocumented immigrants, are growing in numbers, there is palpable dissonance between what is said in the pulpit and how those in the pews perceive it.
“Just because a pastor pushes anti-immigrant agenda, that does not mean members are receiving it,” he said. “They selectively take what they want from the teaching.”
The Rev. Juan Garcia, who leads a 100-strong Hispanic ministry at the First Baptist Church in Newport News, Virginia, said the word “evangelico” represents the Gospel to him. He says the “evangelical” label feels tainted because of its affiliation with one political party.
“Jesus is not Democrat or Republican,” he said. “Some see their Christian values being represented by the Republican party and others see some of their values represented by the Democrats. But neither party is Christian in essence.”
Garcia feels that sense of political homelessness, too.
“I have a candidate I may vote for, but no political party I’d like to belong to,” he said. “The most important value we as Christians must live by is love — love our neighbors, the poor, those fleeing persecution.”
Garcia said he has his “opinions and inclinations” but doesn’t view the candidate he favors as flawless. He warns his flock: “If one is the anti-Christ, the other is not Christ.”
The Rev. Jacqueline Tavarez, pastor of the Pentecostal Church of God in Raleigh, North Carolina, says her diverse congregation cares more about the values a political party represents rather than the face or the voice of the party.
“Our community doesn’t care about the politics,” she said. “They care about laws that affect our communities in terms of jobs, opportunities, education. And they view abortion and transgender laws as an attack on family values. When they see the ballot, they don’t see Trump or (Harris). They see what the party supports and how the community is going to fare under a candidate.”
The Rev. Lori Tapia, the Arizona-based national pastor and president of the Obra Hispana, Disciples of Christ, said politics is not typically integrated into the life of the Latino evangelical church. Unlike white evangelical congregations, political engagement happens more organically, she said.
“Here, the compassion piece is always stronger and there is a desire to see leaders who will prioritize compassionate politics,” Tapia said. “There is also frustration at how slow progress is on critical issues. Anyone can pitch a story or a political campaign. But where is it being manifested in the lives of people who are struggling?”
Bishop Angel Marcial, who leads the Church of God that oversees more than 15,000 churches, says some of the main issues for his congregants are healthcare education, public safety and housing.
“Voting gives you respect in this country and it brings opportunities for marginalized communities,” he said. “As pastors, we don’t tell people whom to vote for, but we do tell them about the platforms that best align with the values of the church and needs of our communities.”
John P. Tuman, professor of political science at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, observes that in Las Vegas, Latino evangelicals who join larger evangelical churches that have English and Spanish services tend to skew conservative. However, in communities that form their own congregations and conduct services in Spanish and Otomi, an Indigenous language in Mexico, are likely to have more diverse political views.
“They tend to be historically in favor of immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship, along with other elements of a social justice message that resonates more with Democratic candidates,” he said.
Nevada is also a key swing state.
Pastor Willie Pagan, who leads the 700-strong Iglesia de Dios in North Las Vegas that falls under the Church of God, said the economy is a top issue for his congregants.
“Yes, people are worried about immigration, but those who are here already, they want the economy to be stable,” he said. “They see homelessness and crime growing in Las Vegas. Our church was in a rough neighborhood that has gotten rougher recently.”
Pagan says some in his congregation believe they were better off financially and safer during the Trump administration, and wish to vote Republican to uphold their conservative religious values. But there are also those who fear they or their loved ones could get deported, he said.
“The struggle is real.”

At least 64 people die in devastating flash floods in eastern Spain, officials say
BARCELONA, Spain (AP) — At least 64 people have died in eastern Spain after flash floods swept away cars, turned village streets into rivers and disrupted rail lines and highways in the worst natural disaster to hit the European nation in recent memory.
Emergency services in the eastern region of Valencia confirmed a death toll of 62 people on Wednesday. Another two casualties were reported in the neighboring Castilla La Mancha region.
Rainstorms on Tuesday caused flooding in a wide swath of southern and eastern Spain, stretching from Malaga to Valencia. Mud-colored floods sent vehicles tumbling down streets at high speeds, while pieces of wood swirled in the water mixed with household items. Police and rescue services used helicopters to lift people from their homes and rubber boats to reach drivers trapped on the roofs of cars.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said dozens of towns had been flooded and warned that the danger is not over.
“For those who are looking for their loved ones, all of Spain feels your pain,” Sánchez said in a televised address. “Our priority is to help you. We are putting all the resources necessary so that we can recover from this tragedy.”
Authorities reported several missing people late Tuesday, but the following morning brought the shocking announcement of dozens found dead.
“Yesterday was the worst day of my life,” Ricardo Gabaldón, the mayor of Utiel, a town in Valencia, told national broadcaster RTVE. He said several people were still missing in his town.
“We were trapped like rats. Cars and trash containers were flowing down the streets. The water was rising to 3 meters (9.8 feet),” he said.
Over 1,000 soldiers from Spain’s emergency response units were deployed to the devastated areas. Rescue services were also rushing eastwards from other parts of Spain. Spain’s central government set up a crisis committee to help coordinate rescue efforts.
One elderly couple were rescued from the upper story of their house by a military unit using a bulldozer, with three soldiers accompanying them in the huge shovel.
Television reports showed videos shot by panicked residents documenting waters flooding the ground floors of apartment buildings, streams bursting their banks and bridges giving way.
Spain’s national weather service called the rainfall “extraordinary,” with 491 litres per square meter (108 gallons per 32.3 square feet) accumulated in eight hours in the Valencian locality of Chiva.
Spain has experienced similar autumn storms in recent years. Nothing, however, compared to the devastation over the last two days, which recalls floods in Germany and Belgium in 2021 in which 230 people were killed.
The death toll will likely rise with other regions yet to report victims and search efforts continuing in areas with difficult access.
In the village of Letur in the neighboring Castilla La Mancha region, Mayor Sergio Marín Sánchez said six people were missing.
Spain is still recovering from a severe drought and continues to register record high temperatures in recent years. Scientists say increased episodes of extreme weather are likely linked to climate change.
The prolonged drought has also made it more difficult for the land to absorb high volumes of water.
The storms unleashed a freak hailstorm which punched holes in car windows and greenhouses as well as a rarely seen tornado.
Transport was also impacted. A high-speed train with nearly 300 people on board derailed near Malaga, although rail authorities said no one was hurt. High-speed train service between Valencia city and Madrid was interrupted, as were commuter lines.
Valencian regional President Carlos Mazón urged people to stay at home, with travel by road already difficult due to fallen trees and wrecked vehicles. Rescue efforts were hampered, Mazón, said, by downed power lines that left areas without electricity, while phone lines were jammed with calls. He said that the regional emergency service had attended some 30,000 calls.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told reporters in Brussels that the EU will assist by using its Copernicus geo-monitoring satellite system “to help coordinate the rescue teams.”
The European Union leader said that the bloc stands ready to activate a civil protection mechanism offering the combined assistance of the other 26 member countries should Spain request assistance.
“Europe is ready to help,” Von der Leyen said.
As the waters fell, thick layers of mud mixed with refuse made streets unrecognizable.
“The neighborhood is destroyed, all the cars are on top of each other, it’s literally smashed up,” Christian Viena, a bar owner in the Valencian village of Barrio de la Torre, said by phone. “Everything is a total wreck, everything is ready to be thrown away. The mud is almost 30 centimeters (11 inches) deep.”
Outside Viena’s bar, people were venturing out to see what they could salvage. Cars were piled up and the streets were filled with clumps of water-logged branches.
Relatives of the missing filled social media and local television and radio outlets with appeals to find their loved ones.
Leonardo Enrique told RTVE that his family had been searching for hours for his son, Leonardo Enrique Rivera, 40, who was driving a delivery van when it began to rain. His son had sent a message saying his van was flooding and that he had been hit by another vehicle when he was near Ribarroja, an industrial town which is one of the worst affected, Enrique said.
Located south of Barcelona down the Mediterranean coast, Valencia is a tourist destination known for its beaches, citrus orchards, and as the home of Spain’s paella rice dish.
Like some other areas of Spain, Valencia has gorges and small riverbeds that spend much of the year completely dry but quickly fill with water when it rains. Many of them pass through populated areas.
The rain had subsided in Valencia by late Wednesday morning as the storm headed north, prompting authorities in the Barcelona region to issue weather alerts.

AP,What is the Electoral College and how does the US use it to elect presidents?,"What is the Electoral College and how does the US use it to elect presidents?
What is the Electoral College and how does the US use it to elect presidents?
WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016 because of the Electoral College. So did George W. Bush in 2000.
The Electoral College is the unique American system of electing presidents. It is different from the popular vote, and it has an outsize impact on how candidates run and win campaigns. Republicans Trump and Bush lost the popular vote during their presidential runs but won the Electoral College to claim the nation’s top office.
Some Democrats charge that the system favors Republicans and they would rather the United States elect presidents by a simple majority vote. But the country’s framers set up the system in the Constitution, and it would require a constitutional amendment to change.
A look at the Electoral College and how it works, as Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, compete for the White House on Election Day, Nov. 5:
What is the Electoral College?
The Electoral College is a 538-member body that elects a president. The framers of the Constitution set it up to give more power to the states and as a compromise to avoid having Congress decide the winner.
Each state’s electors vote for the candidate who won the popular vote in that state. The runner-up gets nothing — except in Nebraska and Maine where elector votes are awarded based on congressional district and statewide results.
To win the presidency, a candidate must secure 270 electoral votes — a majority of the 538 possible votes.
How is it different from the popular vote?
Under the Electoral College system, more weight is given to a single vote in a small state than to the vote of someone in a large state, leading to outcomes at times that have been at odds with the popular vote.
It also affects how candidates campaign. Because the outcome is almost certain in solidly Republican states and solidly Democratic states, candidates tend to focus most of their efforts on a handful of swing states that have split their votes in recent elections.
Who are the electors?
Electors are allocated based on how many representatives a state has in the House of Representatives, plus its two senators. The District of Columbia gets three, despite the fact that the home to Congress has no vote in Congress.
It varies by state, but often the electors are picked by state parties. Members of Congress cannot serve as electors.
How and when are the votes counted?
After state election officials certify their elections, electors meet in their individual states — never as one body — to certify the election. This year, that will happen on Dec. 17.
If the two candidates have a tied number of votes, the election is thrown to the House, where each state’s congressional delegation gets one vote. That has happened only twice, in 1801 and 1825.
Once a state’s electors have certified the vote, they send a certificate to Congress. Congress then formally counts and certifies the vote at a special session on Jan. 6. The vice president presides as the envelopes for each state are opened and verified.
Can lawmakers object?
Lawmakers can object to a state’s results during the congressional certification, as several Republicans did after the 2020 election. On Jan. 6, 2021, the House and Senate both voted to reject GOP objections to the Arizona and Pennsylvania results.
After Trump tried to overturn his defeat to Democrat Joe Biden and his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, Congress updated the 1800s-era Electoral Count Act to make it harder to object and to more clearly lay out the vice president’s ceremonial role, among other changes. Trump had pressured Vice President Mike Pence to try and object to the results — something the vice president has no legal standing to do.
Once Congress certifies the vote, the new or returning president will be inaugurated Jan. 20 on the steps of the Capitol.

Al menos 63 muertos en devastadoras inundaciones en España
BARCELONA, España (AP) — Al menos 63 personas murieron en el este de España tras inundaciones repentinas que arrastraron autos, convirtieron calles de pueblos en ríos y cortaron líneas ferroviarias y autopistas, en el peor desastre natural que ha golpeado a la nación europea en la memoria reciente.
Los servicios de emergencias en la región oriental de Comunidad Valenciana confirmaron una cifra de 62 muertos allí el miércoles. La oficina del gobierno central para la región de Castilla La Mancha agregó que una mujer de 88 años fue encontrada muerta en la ciudad de Cuenca.
Las tormentas del martes provocaron inundaciones en una amplia zona del sur y el este de España, desde Málaga hasta Valencia. Aguas de color lodo arrastraron vehículos calle abajo a velocidades peligrosas. Trozos de madera flotaban entre enseres domésticos. La policía y los rescatistas utilizaron helicópteros para evacuar a personas de sus casas y botes de goma para alcanzar a conductores atrapados en los techos de los autos.
El presidente del gobierno español, Pedro Sánchez, dijo que decenas de pueblos habían quedado inundados. “A quienes en esta hora siguen buscando a sus seres queridos, España entera llora con todos y con todas vosotros”, dijo Sánchez en un discurso televisado. “Nuestra prioridad absoluta es ayudaros. Vamos a poner todos los medios necesarios hoy y mañana y el tiempo que haga falta para que podamos recuperarnos de esta tragedia”.
Las autoridades reportaron varias personas desaparecidas la noche del martes, pero la mañana siguiente trajo el impactante anuncio de que se había encontrado muertas a decenas de víctimas.
“Ayer fue el peor día de mi vida”, dijo Ricardo Gabaldón, alcalde de Utiel, un pueblo en Valencia, a la televisora estatal RTVE. Varias personas aún estaban desaparecidas en su pueblo, añadió.
“Esto era una ratonera, iban coches y contenedores por las calles. El agua llegaba a tres metros”, explicó.
Se desplegaron más de 1.000 soldados de la Unidad Militar de Emergencias en las zonas devastadas. También se enviaron rescatistas desde otras partes de España. El gobierno central de España formó un comité de crisis para ayudar a coordinar las labores de rescate.
Una pareja de ancianos fue rescatada del piso superior de su casa por una unidad militar usando una excavadora, con tres soldados acompañándolos en la enorme pala.
Las televisoras emitieron videos grabados por residentes aterrados que documentaban cómo las aguas inundaron los pisos bajos de los apartamentos, arroyos desbordados y al menos un puente que se derrumbó.
España ha experimentado tormentas otoñales similares en los últimos años, pero nada comparado con la devastación de los últimos dos días, que recuerda a las inundaciones en Alemania y Bélgica en 2021 que dejaron 230 muertos.
La cifra de muertos podría aumentar fácilmente, ya que otras regiones aún no han reportado víctimas y los esfuerzos de búsqueda continúan en áreas de difícil acceso. Seis personas seguían desaparecidas en el pueblo de Letur, en la vecina región de Castilla La Mancha, según dijo el alcalde, Sergio Marín Sánchez.
España aún se está recuperando de una grave sequía y sigue registrando temperaturas récord en los últimos años. Los científicos dicen que los episodios de fenómenos meteorológicos extremos podrían estar relacionados con el cambio climático.
Las tormentas desataron una tormenta de granizo inusual que perforó ventanas de autos e invernaderos, así como un inusual tornado.
El transporte también se vio afectado. Un tren de alta velocidad con casi 300 personas a bordo descarriló cerca de Málaga, aunque las autoridades ferroviarias dijeron que nadie resultó herido. El servicio de tren de alta velocidad entre la ciudad de Valencia y Madrid quedó interrumpido, así como varias rutas de corta distancia.
El presidente regional valenciano, Carlos Mazón, instó a la gente a quedarse en casa para no complicar los esfuerzos de rescate, ya que el viaje por carretera ya era difícil debido a árboles caídos y vehículos destrozados. Las autoridades advirtieron que el peligro aún no había pasado con más lluvias por venir.
Las autoridades advirtieron que el peligro aún no había pasado con más lluvias por venir.
Gruesas capas de barro cubrían las calles mientras retrocedían las aguas.
“El barrio está destrozado, están todos los coches uno encima de otro, está reventado literalmente”, dijo por teléfono Christian Viena, dueño de un bar en el pueblo valenciano de Barrio de la Torre. “Está todo siniestro total, está todo para tirar. El barro llega casi a 30 centímetros”.
Fuera del bar de Viena, la gente salía para ver qué podían salvar. Los autos estaban apilados y las calles llenas de montones de ramas empapadas de agua.
Valencia, ubicada al sur de Barcelona a lo largo de la costa mediterránea, es un destino turístico conocido por sus playas, huertos de cítricos y como el hogar de la paella, un platillo típico con arroz.
Al igual que otras áreas de España, Valencia tiene gargantas y lechos de ríos pequeños que pasan la mayor parte del año completamente secos pero que se llenan rápidamente de agua cuando llueve. Muchos de esos torrentes atraviesan áreas pobladas.
Las lluvias habían disminuido en Valencia para el miércoles por la mañana. Sin embargo, se esperaba que las tormentas continúen hasta el jueves, según la Agencia Española de Meteorología.

AP,CNN bans conservative writer after 'beeper' comment to Muslim commentator,"CNN bans conservative writer after ‘beeper’ comment to Muslim commentator
NEW YORK (AP) — CNN has banned conservative writer Ryan Girdusky from the network following a contentious on-air exchange in which he told panelist Mehdi Hasan that “I hope your beeper doesn’t go off.”
“Did you just say I should die?” Hasan said.
He was responding to Girdusky’s apparent reference to September’s attacks where pagers and walkie-talkies used by hundreds of Hezbollah members in Lebanon and Syria exploded simultaneously, killing 39. The attack was widely believed to be carried out by Israel.
Hasan and Girdusky were on a panel on “News Night” Monday night, talking about Donald Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden, where speakers made a variety of racist comments and referred to Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage.” The panel discussion devolved into back-and-forth bickering after Girdusky said to Hasan, a commentator and founder of the media company Zeteo, that “you’ve been called an anti-Semite more than anyone else at this table.”
Host Abby Phillip said that Girdusky’s beeper comment was “completely out of pocket” and he apologized. But after a commercial break, he was gone.
Philip apologized to Hasan and to viewers. She said Girdusky, author of the book “They’re Not Listening: How the Elites Created the National Populist Revolution,” had crossed a line.
CNN was having a heated discussion about the Trump rally, where the racist and other demeaning language was a sign of how tensions are coming to a boil with only a week to go until a highly contested and contentious Election Day that reflects the nation’s political and cultural fissures.
Despite that fragmentation, Phillip said that “we can have conversations about what is happening in this country without resorting to the lowest ... kind of discourse.”
CNN, saying there is “zero room for racism or bigotry at CNN or on our air,” said that Girdusky would not be allowed back on the network.
Girdusky responded in a post on X: “You can stay on CNN if you falsely call every Republican a Nazi” but apparently can’t “if you make a joke. I’m glad America gets to see what CNN stands for.”

The ability to cast a ballot isn’t always guaranteed in Alaska’s far-flung Native villages
KAKTOVIK, Alaska (AP) — Early last summer, George Kaleak, a whaling captain in the tiny Alaska Native village of Kaktovik, on an island in the Arctic Ocean just off the state’s northern coast, pinned a flyer to the blue, ribbon-lined bulletin board in the community center.
“Attention residents,” it read. “In search of elections chairperson to conduct the August and November elections. … If interested please contact the State of Alaska Nome Elections.”
No one was interested, Kaleak said, and the state failed to provide an elections supervisor or poll workers.
When the primary arrived on Aug. 20, Kaktovik’s polling station didn’t open. There was nowhere for the village’s 189 registered voters to cast a ballot. Kaleak, who also is an adviser to the regional government, didn’t even try.
“I knew there was nobody to open it,” he said during an interview in Kaktovik earlier this month.
The development might have shocked voters or politicians elsewhere in the U.S., especially in swing states where any polling irregularities prompt scrutiny from party activists and news organizations, conspiracy theories spreading on social media and calls for investigations.
In Kaktovik, life went on. Some residents were frustrated, but they turned their attention to a more pressing matter: the start of whaling season.
Remote villages, few poll workers
The shuttered polling station represents just the latest example of persistent voting challenges in Alaska’s remote Native villages, a collection of more than 200 far-flung communities that dot the nation’s largest state. Many of the villages are far from the main road system, so isolated they are reachable only by small plane. Mail service can be halted for days at a time due to severe weather or worker illness.
Polling sites also did not open for the August primary in Wales, in far western Alaska along the Bering Strait. They opened late in several other villages. In Anaktuvuk Pass, the polling place didn’t open until about 30 minutes before closing time; just seven of 258 registered voters there cast ballots in person.
This year, with control of Congress on the line, the implications of any repeated problems during the November general election could be enormous. The state’s only representative in the House is Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola — the first Alaska Native to serve in Congress. She is popular among Alaska Native voters, won the recent endorsement of the Alaska Federation of Natives and is in a tight reelection fight against Republican Nick Begich.
“This congressional seat is going to be won by dozens of votes,” Peltola told a federation convention this month.
State, regional and local officials all say they are trying to ensure everyone can vote in the Nov. 5 election. In a written statement, Carol Beecher, director of the Alaska Division of Elections, called her agency “highly invested in ensuring that all precincts have workers and that sites open on time.” She acknowledged it can be difficult to find temporary workers to help run elections.
‘Out of sight and out of mind’
Like other Indigenous populations across the U.S., Alaska Native voters for years faced language barriers at the polls. In 2020, the state Division of Elections failed to send absentee ballots to the southwest Alaska village of Mertarvik in time for the primary election because its staff didn’t realize anyone was living there.
In June 2022, a special primary for the U.S. House was conducted primarily by mail after the sudden death of Republican U.S. Rep. Don Young. Some rural Alaska and lower-income urban districts had notably high rates of ballots disallowed — around 17% — due largely to missing witness signatures on envelopes or other mistakes the state provides no means of correcting.

Two months later, precinct locations in two southwest Alaska villages — Tununak and Atmautluak — did not open for the regular primary and special general election for the U.S. House, which were held on the same day. Ballots from several other villages arrived too late to be fully tabulated under the new ranked choice voting system the state uses for general elections.

“When these things happen in rural Alaska, when it’s out of sight and out of mind, it seems like the system just shrugs and writes it off as a character flaw for remote Alaskans,” said Michelle Sparck, with the nonprofit Get Out The Native Vote. “And we’re here saying this is unacceptable.”
Alaska allows absentee voting, but that can present its own challenges, given the sometimes questionable reliability of mail delivery in rural Alaska.
The Alaska Federation of Natives, the largest statewide Native organization in Alaska, passed a resolution last year raising concerns with mail service. It is surveying residents about their postal service, including how it affects their ability to vote or obtain medicine.
A land of caribou, whales and polar bears
Kaktovik is 670 miles (1,078 km) north of Anchorage, on Barter Island, between the Arctic Ocean and Alaska’s North Slope, an area of vast, treeless tundra nearly the size of Oregon. The temperature can dip to 20 below zero F (29 below C) during the perpetual darkness of winter. Air travel provides the only year-round access to Kaktovik, with ocean-going barges delivering goods in the warmer months.
It’s the only community in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, and whether the next presidential administration will support drilling for oil in the refuge — as many villagers hope — is a major topic of concern. The nearest settlement is Deadhorse, about 110 miles (177 kilometers) west, the oil company supply stop that marks the end of the gravel road featured in the reality TV show “Ice Road Truckers.”
Kaktovik’s roughly 270 residents, mostly Inupiat, live in single-story houses laid out in a grid of about 20 blocks. They subsist by hunting caribou and bowhead whales; village whalers landed three bowheads this year.
After butchering the whales on a nearby beach, the villagers pile the bones farther away, where polar bears feast on the scraps. That’s made Kaktovik a popular spot for polar bear tourism. The village also has a polar bear patrol, led by village mayor Nathan Gordon Jr., to run the animals out of town when they get too close.
During the August primary, some residents were away hunting or fishing. The mayor was on vacation with his family in Anchorage.
Plenty of obstacles to staffing polling sites
Madeline Gordon, a former election worker, had taken a new job at a village grocery store. Gordon, the mayor’s cousin, said she told the Nome office of the state elections division in early summer that she wouldn’t be able to run the primary election, but the state nevertheless mailed a box of ballots to her home.
She gave the box to a city clerk, Tiffani Kayotuk. A state official told Kayotuk to hang onto it until further notice, Kayotuk said. The box was still in her office when she went on maternity leave on the day of the primary.
It had been clear well before then that Kaktovik would need help running the primary.
Kaleak, a deputy adviser to the top official of the regional North Slope Borough — equivalent to a county government in other states — posted the flyer seeking help staffing the election on the community center bulletin board. It was still hanging there recently, near one for the volunteer fire department and another for the local fuel depot. He also posted notices on a community Facebook page.
But the position required travel to Utqiagvik, formerly known as Barrow, for training. And, Kaleak said, the pay — $20.50 an hour — wasn’t enough to be attractive in a village where gas is $7.50 a gallon and other goods, shipped long distance, are similarly pricey. Small pumpkins were going for $80 apiece this month.
Taylor Thompson, who heads the legal department for North Slope Borough, said a borough official had reached out to the state elections division before the August primary to find out if they anticipated problems, and offered to fly a borough staffer to the village if needed.
“The state just didn’t take us up on it,” Thompson said.
She said she “lost it” when she learned from a news article that Kaktovik’s precinct hadn’t opened. This time, the borough is sending a worker to Kaktovik to ensure the precinct opens for the general election.
“We’re going to make sure that someone is there, no matter what, if the state’s not going to fulfill their obligations,” Thompson said.
Determined to ensure voters won’t be disenfranchised again
The borough also was trying to coordinate with the state to ensure polls will be staffed in two other villages, Nuiqsut and Anaktuvuk Pass.
Beecher, the elections division director, said the state was notified late on the afternoon before the primary that Kaktovik didn’t have anyone to run the polls. The division immediately reached out to the village and the borough in hopes of finding someone, she said.
“Unfortunately, despite best efforts, sometimes the trained staff are no longer available, requiring the division to secure other workers and get them trained in a short timeframe,” Beecher said.
The mayor said he got an earful when he returned from vacation.
“I end up coming back and hearing about how the primary wasn’t opened and how people had to miss their first-ever election,” Gordon Jr. said.
Charles Lampe, the president of the Kaktovik Inupiat Corp. and a city council member, favors getting city officials trained to work elections. That way, he said, “nothing like this ever happens again.”
For Kaleak, the disenfranchisement of Alaska Native voters should raise as much outrage as the disenfranchisement of voters anywhere else in the country.
“Every person should be able to have a vote, and it should count, and it should be fair,” he said.

A Supreme Court reshaped by Trump has a low profile in this presidential campaign
WASHINGTON (AP) — Conservatives already have a supermajority on the Supreme Court as a result of Donald Trump’s presidency. If Trump wins a second term, the right side of the court could retain control for several more decades.
Justices Clarence Thomas, 76, and Samuel Alito, 74, are the two oldest members of the court. Either, or both, could consider stepping down knowing that Trump, a Republican, would nominate replacements who might be three decades younger.
“With President Trump and a Republican Senate, we could have a generation of conservative justices on the bench in the Supreme Court,” South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, recently wrote on X.
That’s exactly what worries Christina Harvey, executive director of the progressive group Stand Up America. “The real key here is Trump prevention. If Trump wins again, he could solidify right-wing control of the Supreme Court for decades,” Harvey said.
Yet the nation’s highest court has a lower profile than it did in the past two presidential campaigns. That’s despite an early summer ruling on presidential immunity that insured that Trump would not have to stand trial before the Nov. 5 election on charges of interference in the 2020 election and other consequential decisions on abortion, guns, affirmative action and the environment.
Both Trump and Democratic President Joe Biden used the prospect of Supreme Court nominations, which require Senate confirmation, to reassure key constituencies on their way to the White House.
In 2016, Trump put out lists of potential Supreme Court nominees that helped secure the enthusiastic backing of social conservatives. Four years later, Biden went to South Carolina, with its large share of Black Democratic primary voters, and pledged to name the first Black woman to the Supreme Court.
Biden followed through on his promise when he chose Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson in 2022.
Trump’s three nominees, Justices Amy Coney Barrett, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh, cemented the conservative majority that in 2022 overturned Roe v. Wade, among other major decisions.
That ruling, colloquially known as Dobbs, has led to abortion bans or severe restrictions in many Republican-led states. But it also has fueled voter anger that produced unexpected Democratic electoral success two years ago and put abortion access on the ballot in 10 states this year.
Vice President Kamala Harris, her party’s White House nominee, has made reproductive rights a central theme of her campaign.
The court? Less so.
While Harris also has embraced court changes put forward by Biden, including 18-year terms for justices instead of lifetime tenure and a binding ethics code, she doesn’t talk much about those proposals at her campaign events.
Delivering a message on abortion is simple and direct, said Alex Badas, a political science professor at the University of Houston who has studied the court and campaigns. “The court is kind of esoteric,” Badas said.
In addition, Badas said, “Trump has a conservative court. He doesn’t need to bolster that as an issue. And Harris doesn’t want to overcommit because once she becomes president, it’s very unlikely she’s going to be able to get the appointments needed to make the court a more moderate court, let alone a liberal court.”
The oldest liberal justice is Sonia Sotomayor, who turned 70 in June. Even if she were to retire, giving Harris a vacancy to fill, it would do nothing to alter the ideological balance.

The Supreme Court rarely takes center stage in presidential campaigns, which tend to focus on fundamental issues of war and peace, the economy and security.

But in 2016, the sudden death of Justice Antonin Scalia delivered a jolt to presidential politics, especially once the Republican-led Senate refused to consider President Barack Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland to the high court, which was otherwise split between four Democratic liberal appointees and four Republican conservatives. Garland is now Biden’s attorney general.
“2016 was exceptional because not only did you have a vacancy, but there was actually a vacancy that could crucially move the court in one direction or another,” said Christopher Schmidt, co-director at the Supreme Court institute at the Chicago-Kent College of Law.
The circumstances were somewhat similar to 1968, when Republican Richard Nixon’s “law-and-order” campaign targeted the liberal Warren Court and the nation knew the next president would appoint Earl Warren’s successor as chief justice, Schmidt said.
Biden’s pledge that led to Jackson taking her place on the court also had a historical analogue, Republican Ronald Reagan’s campaign promise to appoint the first woman. Eight months after Reagan took office, Sandra Day O’Connor took her judicial oath.",2024-10-23

North Carolina’s historically Black colleges are mobilizing for Nov. 5, tapping an activist history
GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) — Strewn across the coastal plains and backroads of North Carolina lie institutions that could be pivotal in the battleground state in Tuesday’s elections — 10 historically Black colleges and universities steeped in a history of activism.
Now, local student government associations and other organizations at these schools have mobilized in a full-on effort to galvanize a nearly 40,000-student voting bloc. They’re doing so as an HBCU graduate — Vice President Kamala Harris — is running for president.
In the leadup to Election Day on Tuesday, the North Carolina Black Alliance has been working with each HBCU, and one predominately Black institution in the state, to mobilize and transport students to the polls throughout the early voting season.
The Votecoming tour is a play on HBCU homecoming season, a sacred tradition at the schools. The hope is to inform students of who and what is on the ballot from top to bottom and get students to vote early so they can avoid any voter ID or registration problems, said Gabrielle Martin, the alliance’s campus coordinator.
The effort is non-partisan. But there’s no question that the presidential candidacy of Harris, an HBCU graduate herself (from Howard University) is driving excitement.
Having Harris at the Democrats’ helm puts positive attention on HBCUs and gives them a seat at the table, said Justin Nixon, a senior and student government president at Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte. “We’ve always said what we’re capable of, but now, especially, we can truly say that this is the clear representation what an HBCU can produce and has produced.”
Still, students say their effort is about civic engagement, not taking sides.
“It’s really crucial, especially during an election like this, for us students to actually be taking the reins on something so important,” said Kylie Rice, a senior and student government president at North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in Greensboro, the state’s largest HBCU.
“We stand on the shoulders of giants, and we realize the civic footprint that was left for us. Now, it’s up to us to actually fulfill and keep that same momentum going forward.”
North Carolina’s HBCU students have spearheaded civil rights movements for decades.
For example, students at Bennett College in Greensboro, one of two all-female HBCUs in the country, protested a local movie theater in the late 1930s because it would edit Black people out of films. In 1960, women from Bennett, known as Bennett Belles, were joined by North Carolina A&T students to protest at a local lunch counter.
“I feel like we’re making our past Belles, our big sisters, proud and happy because they were behind so many movements and now we’re here to make history ourselves,” said Lanell Jones-Huddleston, a junior at Bennett.
This spirit of activism hasn’t slowed.
In 2019, Black communities in North Carolina were gerrymandered, notably in Greensboro, Charlotte, and other cities, in a process that diluted their electoral power. North Carolina A&T students were impacted because the university was split in half and rallied against the maps in response.
North Carolina is also saddled with voter ID court battles and, now, Hurricane Helene destruction that residents worried could hamper voting.

“We want to hype up early voting so if there is a registration issue or an ID issue or a voting issue, period, the students will have time for recourse so that their vote can still count,” Martin said.

The tour kicked off Oct. 17, North Carolina’s first day of early voting, at Shaw University. It ends at Fayetteville University on Friday.
Local HBCUs have also hosted several other engagement events, including teacher-student voter information sessions at Bennett College, class wraps to explain the importance of voting at Elizabeth City State University, and various game nights with Black fraternities and sororities.
North Carolina is seemingly up for grabs since Republican Donald Trump ’s margin of victory here was just 74,481 votes in 2020, the tightest of any state he won over Democrat Joe Biden.
“That’s a razor-thin margin and North Carolina HBCUs alone are a significant voting bloc,” Nixon said. “So, we play a large role in shaping the dialogue around politics and around issues within the Black community.”
The Harris campaign is on an HBCU homecoming tour, which includes a stop at Shaw. The Trump campaign also plans to reach out to HBCU students directly, highlighting initiatives like the law he signed as president to establish permanent HBCU funding, said Janiyah Thomas, the Trump campaign’s Black media director.
The push to muster young voters makes North Carolina HBCU students a force in the campaign’s final days. “We’re Gen Z also and for us, it’s the first time we’ll have a say,” said Jazmin Rawls, 20, a Bennett sophomore who introduced Harris in Greensboro in September and will be voting for the first time.
Having a say in what may be the most consequential election to date prompted Shelby Fogan, a senior and student government president at Bennett, to change her voter registration from her home state in Ohio to North Carolina.
“I voted absentee in Ohio last year for local elections, but I had to ask myself for this election, where is my vote going to count the most?” Fogan said. “For me, it’s North Carolina. We really should consider where our votes will have the most impact.”
Students want to know which candidates locally and federally will fight best for HBCU funding. These schools historically struggle financially, despite recent influxes in money.
Bennett lost its accreditation in 2019 due to its financial standing. Without accreditation, colleges can’t participate in federal programs, like student aid. Bennett received its accreditation back in 2023.
HBCUs have lower tuition costs, giving Black students a greater opportunity to go to college, so the issue is important, said Aleah Crawford, a junior at Elizabeth City State University.
“Our funding is at stake,” Crawford said. If that’s lost, “people have to figure out how to pay out of pocket to go here and depending on your economic status, that basically chooses if you can go to college or not.”
Elizabeth City is in a rural area that can get overlooked by political candidates. With fewer than 2,200 students, the school is the only local four-year college and contributes heavily to its growth, but students don’t always feel considered, said Caszhmere Chaison, a junior and student government official at the university.
“We really have to focus in on us and our student body because we bring so much financial backing for this city,” Chaison said. “Not everybody looks at us as a part of the city. We have to make sure that we’re advocating for ourselves because if not us, then who?”
This sentiment ripples throughout the HBCU community nationwide.
What students have to do now is use their vote, said Bennett’s student government president, Suzanne Walsh.
“Our role,” Walsh said, “is to say, don’t overlook us.”

AP,Speaker Johnson lays out agenda for Republicans as they fight to hold House majority,"Speaker Johnson lays out agenda for Republicans as they fight to hold House majority
Speaker Johnson lays out agenda for Republicans as they fight to hold House majority
WASHINGTON (AP) — Speaker Mike Johnson laid out on Tuesday a policy agenda should Republicans take the majority next year that extends the tax cuts approved when Donald Trump was president, reduces the size of the federal workforce and gives parents more choice on where they can send their children to school.
Johnson emphasized five main policy points during a speech at the New York Stock Exchange. He talked of extending and building on the Trump tax cuts, confronting China, boosting oil and gas production, expanding school choice and cutting the size and scope of the federal government.
“The survival of the American dream depends upon our victory,” Johnson said.
The speaker and House Republicans are fighting this election season to hold their narrow House majority, with just a handful of seats to spare. Republicans are hopeful that a Trump victory over Vice President Kamala Harris in the election will help propel them to majorities in the House and Senate, which would give them unified control of Washington for the first time since 2018 and the ability to enact a sweeping legislative agenda.
Against the campaign backdrop, Johnson provided a bleak view of the economy under President Joe Biden, though the economy continues to grow at a solid pace, inflation is on the decline and the unemployment rate is still low by historical standards. He spoke to an audience of Wall Street investors, traders and others who have witnessed stock markets reach record highs in recent days.
But Johnson said that as he has traveled the country, he’s meeting business owners on the verge of collapse because of high inflation, high taxes and over-regulation. And he said he’s met moms and dads who have resorted to donating plasma and setting up crowdfunding pages so that they didn’t lose their homes.
“Our incredible people are hanging on right now in spite of so many unprecedented challenges, but many can’t afford to do it much longer,” Johnson said.
The first policy priority he outlined was enhanced tax breaks, citing specifically immediate expensing for research and development costs. He also cited the need for a “strong” child tax credit, though he did not provide specific numbers. He said the Republican tax policies would “respect the dignity of work, and it doesn’t pay people more for staying out of the workforce.”
Trump has laid out a series of tax cuts on the campaign trail, such as extending the expiring provisions of his 2017 overhaul, and not taxing tips and Social Security. Outside experts say the tax cuts proposed by Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris would cause the debt to rise even faster the pace under current law.
Doing more to confront China and rolling back environmental regulations are a common denominator for Republicans that Johnson embraced in his speech. On education, he said millions of Americans have the opportunity to send their children to a school that best fits their need, and “Republicans want to expand that choice so that every American has that opportunity.”
Johnson also emphasized cutting the debt by cutting the size of the federal government, saying “we’re going to reduce the size of the federal workforce and root out a long list of non-essential jobs through the federal bureaucracy.”
“It’s hard to roll back the entrenched bureaucracy and face the system that has produced the decline. It’s a difficult task, but it’s a task that can be achieved,” Johnson said.",2024-10-01

Luxury SUV test: Edmunds compares the Lincoln Nautilus and Mercedes-Benz GLC
While Lincoln’s full-size Navigator is great for big families and towing, the recently redesigned Lincoln Nautilus should have broader appeal for SUV shoppers. It’s a midsize SUV that seats five and boasts distinctive styling, lots of premium features, and an eye-catching curved display that spans the width of the dashboard. So how does this Lincoln measure up to the competition? To find out, the car experts at Edmunds compared it to the Mercedes-Benz GLC, a benchmark for luxury SUV excellence.
Power and fuel economy
The Nautilus offers two engines, a turbocharged four-cylinder that produces 250 horsepower and a hybrid version of the same engine that bumps output to 310 horsepower. The non-hybrid engine delivers an EPA-estimated 24 mpg in combined city/highway driving. Opting for the hybrid gets you 30 mpg combined. Those are decent figures for a luxury SUV. Edmunds has found the Nautilus’ acceleration is underwhelming, however. At the Edmunds test track, the hybrid Nautilus accelerated from zero to 60 mph in 7.2 seconds.
The GLC 300, which is the base version, is also powered by a turbocharged four-cylinder engine. It produces 255 horsepower and gets an estimated 26 mpg combined. It’s also quicker than the Nautilus; it hit 60 mph in a respectable 6.1 seconds. The GLC 350e, which is new for 2025, is a 313-horsepower plug-in hybrid model. The EPA has yet to release its fuel economy estimates as of this writing, but Mercedes says it provides a lengthy 54 miles of all-electric driving before it switches over to operating like a regular hybrid when the battery runs low. Mercedes also offers a high-performance version, the 416-horsepower AMG GLC 43.
We like that Lincoln offers an available hybrid, but the GLC’s superior acceleration and fuel efficiency help it win this category.
Winner: GLC
Interior and tech features
An expansive dashboard-spanning screen dominates the Nautilus’ interior. It displays the instrument panel and other information like navigation directions and music. It also has a full Google integration that lets you use helpful features like the voice-based Google Assistant while driving. But all this impressive tech is let down by functionality. The center console button layout is confusing, and the lower touchscreen controls almost everything including the air vents. The unlabeled steering wheel controls are also difficult to use.
The GLC offers a more elegant and luxurious interior thanks to a wide selection of leather upholstery and wood trim. Its display screens are smaller, but the interface they display is much easier to use. The same goes for the GLC’s button layout and navigation and voice assistant systems.
As for comfort, both luxury SUVs boast very quiet interiors. The GLC provides a smoother ride that absorbs bumps better. Edmunds has found that the Nautilus rides a bit too firmly over rough surfaces.
Winner: GLC
Utility
The Nautilus is the better pick if you have a lot of stuff to haul. Its cargo area offers 36.4 cubic feet of space behind its rear seats. That’s considerably more than the GLC can fit. In addition, the rear seats fold completely flat for more room. Storage for your small personal items is also impressive thanks to a generous storage area under the center console that’s large enough for a purse or bag and sizable door pockets.
The GLC’s 21.9 cubic feet of cargo space is less than what the Nautilus can hold, though its rear seats also fold nearly flat. Wide door pockets and a decent-sized glove box provide adequate small item storage but it still isn’t as much as what you can fit in the Nautilus.
Winner: Nautilus
Pricing and value
The Nautilus’ base Premiere trim starts at $53,485 (including destination), and the hybrid engine adds $2,000. The Reserve trim adds nearly $10,000, and the top Black Label model balloons to $76,645. If you stick to the Premiere trim, the Nautilus offers plenty of value because it comes loaded with a lengthy list of features including lots of advanced driver aids and BlueCruise, a hands-free highway driving system. But higher trims are pricey, offering less value.
The GLC 300 starts at $50,400 and the GLC 350e plug-in hybrid model has a starting price of $61,050. The GLC doesn’t come standard with as many features, but if you add most of the optional packages and features to a GLC 300, it will set you back about $65,000, which is about the same price as the midlevel Nautilus Reserve.
Winner: tie
Edmunds says
Lincoln has come out with one of its more compelling SUVs to date with the new Nautilus. It’s worth considering if you want a roomy SUV that’s also stylish. Otherwise, Edmunds thinks the GLC’s superior fuel efficiency, acceleration and ease of use make it the winner of this comparison.

Native voters could swing US elections, but they’re asking politicians: What have you done for us?
DILKON, Ariz. (AP) — Felix Ashley’s red Toyota sends a plume of dust billowing along the sloping hills and boulders he traverses hours every week to pump water – the same roadway voters walk miles every four years to cast their ballots in presidential elections.
Here on this forgotten swath of the Navajo Nation, the largest Native American reservation in the United States, hardship is embedded into day-to-day life.
Nearly a third of homes like Ashley’s still don’t have running water. Soaring unemployment and poverty has pushed young Navajos, including most of Ashley’s children, to leave their sacred lands in search of jobs. Logistical and legal obstacles have long stood in the way of Arizona’s 420,000 Native citizens casting their vote.
“People lose trust in the government and they don’t – you don’t – care to vote anymore. People don’t get what they were promised,” said 70-year-old Ashley, whose family offers rides to hitchhikers to polls on Election Day.
Yet it is Native voters like him who could be key to winning Arizona and some of the most contested swing states in November. In 2020, Arizona voted for a Democratic president for the first time in decades, with President Joe Biden winning the race by around 10,500 votes.
Native Americans – who make up 5.2% of Arizona– saw a surge in turnout, voting in large numbers for the Democratic Party, according to a data analysis by the Associated Press.
The victory turned the heads of politicians from both parties, who now flock to some of the most remote swaths of Arizona as they try to close razor thin margins. Democrats are hoping to repeat the feat, while Republicans see an opportunity to use Native voters’ frustration with the economy as a chance to sweep up new votes.
“The Native vote has power, because they’re able to decide the next presidential election. Everybody knows that it’s going to come down to 15,000 or so votes in Arizona,” said Jacqueline De León, a voting rights attorney with the Native American Rights Fund and member of the Isleta Pueblo.
One Senate candidate hiked down the wall of the northern Havasu Canyon to a tribe accessible only by helicopter, mule or hours-long treks to win over votes. Another, tailed by floats in a local parade in Tuba City, roared “This is all in your hands. … Let’s show the rest of this state, the rest of this country that the Navajo vote is strong!”
Local fairs and flea markets are painted with blue and red campaign signs reading “Trump low prices” and others written in Native slang “Stoodis Harris” or “Let’s do this Harris.” Radio ads for both presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris ring out on the radio every 30 minutes in homes far from the reach of cellphone signals.
But Native voters in Arizona have a simple question for candidates: What have you ever done for us?

A long history of obstacles
The feeling of being forgotten is one that has long simmered among the 22 federally recognized tribes across Arizona, from rock homes pressed on the edge of high plateaus of the Hopi reservation, to the barren plains where Ashley pumps water to his family.
Dozens of people who spoke to the AP in the final weeks before the election expressed frustration with Democratic-leaning tribal governments, as bureaucracy and corruption scandals tie up the most basic development efforts, and politicians in Washington, who they say rarely use their seat at the table to push for them.

That was the feeling for Ashley, a Democrat, as he pumped water into a tank in the back of his truck. The Vietnam Marine veteran struggles to get care for post-traumatic stress disorder due to long distances he has to travel to a veteran’s hospital. With high inflation, the family must scrape together money for the most basic things like gas to go visit a dying family member.
“You are always promised jobs, you’re promised running water,” he said. “But there is nothing out here.”
At the same time, some voters face almost insurmountable obstacles to voting.
Some tribes have to travel up to 285 miles to cast their ballots, according to the Native American Rights Fund. Homes on many reservations don’t have addresses needed to register to vote, so members of grassroots organizations walk door-to-door, helping people to register by tracking their geolocation and pinpointing it on a map. Some older Navajos don’t speak much English, and organizers provide them detailed information in their native tongue.
“We go the extra mile. This is out in the middle of nowhere almost, and this is where people are not being reached,” said 45-year-old Navajo Lacosta Johnson, a volunteer at the non-partisan group Arizona Native Vote, who drove hours one Saturday night to the outskirts of the reservation to mobilize voters.
Compounding logistical hurdles is historic voter suppression and abuses of Native communities. Native people were first recognized as U.S. citizens 100 years ago, but Arizona prevented them from voting until 1948, arguing they were “incompetent.” Many states used English literacy tests to further block voters from casting ballots until the 1970s.
Since then, legal experts say a mix of voter dilution tactics and burdensome election laws have blocked the Native vote, as recently as 2022. That’s when the Republican-controlled Arizona Legislature and then-GOP governor passed a law requiring voters to provide proof of residency and an address for presidential voting.
The U.S. Supreme Court later struck down the measure, but Native communities have seen thousands of ballots thrown out in past elections due to similar statutes. Native voters have their ballots rejected at higher rates than other demographics in the state, according to Arizona State University’s Indian Legal Clinic.
The result: People are highly skeptical of promises made year after year but never fulfilled.
“These incredibly slim margins mean that cutting off a community of a thousand voters has a huge substantive impact,” said De León, the attorney. “Right now, many Native Americans don’t have their full rights of citizenship because it’s just too hard to vote.”
Both parties campaign on Native lands
Democrats have long claimed an advantage in number of votes on reservations like the Navajo Nation. They’ve boasted a heavy presence on Native lands. In the final weeks of the election, Harris met with Native American youth in Arizona, telling them in a campaign video, “your voice is your vote, and your vote is your power.” President Joe Biden and vice presidential hopeful Tim Walz also paid visits last week to reservations in Arizona.
“Time and time again, Donald Trump had to do what was right for Indian Country and he chose the opposite,” Walz said, promising to work for Native voters.
But they now face a strong campaign push by Republicans among Native voters in an attempt to peel off votes.
The Republican Party has opened its first campaign headquarters on the Navajo Nation, said Halee Dobbins, Arizona communications director of the Republican National Committee, and started to set up in local fairs long frequented by Democratic organizers.
“In 2020, we lost the election by 10,000 votes and we’ve seen that there is such a stronghold of the Native American vote by Democrats for decades, essentially,” Dobbins said. “We’re seeing a huge shift towards the Republican party given the issues that are top of mind for Native American voters – the economy, inflation, cost of living.”
Dozens of Native voters from across the state who spoke to the AP echoed Dobbins in ranking inflation and the economy as their top priorities, though most leaned Democratic or asked why they would bother to vote.
In mid-October, Trump’s campaign invited a group of Navajo supporters like 61-year-old Francine Bradley-Arthur to sit behind him during a rally, where Trump gave a shout out to a conservative tribal leader.
Bradley-Arthur, a former Democrat, said she began to campaign for Trump, in part, because she felt Native communities often didn’t feel the payoff of longtime support for Democrats. It’s a sentiment shared by Latino, Black and other minority voters across the U.S., causing a moment of reckoning for the party.
“We got up at 5 o’clock this morning to drive down here. We want to show that Native Americans support him,” she said, among roaring crowds of Trump supporters.
Meanwhile, Democratic Senate candidate Ruben Gallego went as far as to trek hours down a canyon to meet with one of the most remote tribes in North America in the weeks before the election, where he’s locked in a tight race against Republican Kari Lake, who has promoted false claims that Trump won the 2020 election in Arizona.
He hoped to connect with voters in the Havasupai reservation, which has only 156 registered voters, to fulfill a campaign pledge to visit all the Native American tribes in Arizona. The tribe is so rural that election authorities helicopter ballots and election supplies in and out of the canyon.
Gallego said he’s heard criticism that politicians only visit bigger and more accessible tribes, and that few in Washington know how to work with tribes to provide aid. Lake, his competitor, has also made campaign appearances on the Navajo Nation.
“They do feel like they’re left behind. And a lot of it is because there’s been negligence by both parties,” Gallego told The Associated Press. “We just can’t take advantage of the vote. We assume that, you know, the same amount of people will come out every year. And that’s not actually the case.”
Speaking with Democratic-leaning Havasupai voters about their fight against a uranium mine they warn could poison their waters, Gallego was met with skepticism from some like Dinolene Caska, a tribal leader.
“For me, it’s whoever is going to support Indigenous issues. It’s not just Republicans or Democrats,” Caska said. This year she planned to vote for Democrats because Democratic lawmakers have backed the tribe in the fight.
Who will fight for Native rights?
Many other Navajo voters will also stick with the Democrats this year. Ashley, the Marine still plans to vote for Harris, just as he voted for Biden four years ago.
For Ashley, the deciding factor for this election was the fight for water rights, long championed by Democratic members of Congress, and social spending he hoped would trickle down to them. He and his family have wrinkled their noses at racist comments made by Trump during the campaign, seeing it as a sign that Republicans don’t have minority interests at heart.
But for other Navajo, this is the year they are willing to try something new.
Just down the road from Ashley, 68-year-old goat herder Richard Begay awakes at 6 a.m. sharp, flips on conservative radio and sips coffee out of a mug reading “TRUMP. Best President Ever” as the sun rises over his small wooden home.
Begay’s fierce loyalty to the Republican Party rests largely in the economy.
He blames Biden for inflation disproportionately affecting Native Americans because of the scarcity of jobs in their communities, which forced him and other family members to leave the reservation for many years. The prices of gas and food for his animals have squeezed his pocketbook.
“I remember gas was $1.60 here and when Biden came and went up over $3,” he said. “We don’t have the money to buy gas at outrageous prices. We pay more for less.”
He hopes Trump’s push for deregulation could usher in new economic opportunities on his reservation, citing the contentious construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline along tribal lands as a key example. Maybe then, young people would see more of a future in Dilkon. He believes under a Trump presidency, development would increase, which would bring some optimism.
But for now, he guides his goats along the rugged mountains, little changed over the course of generations his family has dwelled there.
Even with his hope for change, he voiced a sentiment that unites both Republican and Democratic-leaning voters on reservations across the state.

American despair: In Arizona, high home prices and limited prospects shape voters’ presidential pick
MESA, Ariz. (AP) — Karl Peterson has been living the cruel inverse of the American dream. His rent keeps getting higher, but his apartments keep getting smaller.
Peterson left the Midwest nine years ago for the epicenter of an economic boom, only to gradually learn that endless sunshine and desert views are increasingly among the few bargains left in Arizona. Peterson married his wife, Tani, and they struggled to save for a home, moving through four apartments as their rent nearly tripled from $625 to $1,800 a month.
He does not believe that either presidential nominee, Democrat Kamala Harris or Republican Donald Trump, is addressing the paradox of a country that has never been this wealthy even as so many people see themselves left behind. His trust in government is running low. The negatives of inflation and national division are easier to glimpse than are signs of hope.
Voters like Peterson are at the fulcrum of the electorate in Arizona and the handful of other key states that will decide which candidate wins the White House and which party controls Congress.
“I don’t think they’re addressing what’s really going on with me, with my family,” said Peterson, who figures he will need to leave Mesa, east of Phoenix and the state’s third-largest city, for Indiana or Wisconsin if he ever hopes to attain the middle-class promise of owning his own home.
Promises by both parties to “help the middle class” ring hollow to many voters who have heard those commitments before, only to see the pressures on housing, education, career, parenthood and the tending of their own aging parents mount.
Harris has pledged $25,000 for first-time homebuyers and tax breaks for new parents. The Trump campaign says mass deportations of migrants living in the U.S. without permanent legal permission will free up housing and that higher tariffs will create job opportunities. Voters are focused on the inflation of the past three years, but Federal Reserve data reveal a deeper gap in which the United States has so much wealth that it can be easy for anyone to feel worse off than their neighbors.
Being — and staying — middle class in a nation of millionaires
Fed data released late last year point toward this complicated reality.
In 2022, when many voters felt inflation was strangling the economy, for the first time the average U.S. household was worth more than $1 million. Yet there is a difference between meeting that average and being the typical household, despite gains since 2019. The median household had a net worth of just $192,900. That’s the level at which half are above and half are below.
Plenty of Americans can look at their personal finances and see reasons for comfort, even if they mostly register despair when asked about the health of the country as a whole. Nearly 6 in 10 described their own economic situation as good, even as 7 in 10 said the nation was on the wrong track, according to a September poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs.
John Akers, 34, is one who feels lucky with how the economy has treated him, but worries too many of his family and friends are being left behind.
He and his wife have seen their fortunes improve over the past several years as their high-end audio-visual business has thrived, and the fixer-upper they bought in 2015 in Phoenix has proved to be a wise investment.

At the same time, some of their aging relatives have struggled with rising costs, and a few close friends are thinking about ditching Arizona to find cheaper housing. It’s left him wondering if Washington is too focused on hot-button cultural issues.

“No matter what, we’re going to have polarization at the end of this election,” said Akers, who plans to vote for Trump. “The political conversation is too often pitting the middle class against each other, and there’s been too little focus on the issues that matter, like inflation and housing costs.”
Arizona’s economic gains make it a swing state
In some ways, Arizona’s Maricopa County is proof of America’s vitality and ability to generate wealth out of seemingly nothing but grit, hard work and applied intelligence.
The state’s 11 electoral votes could make the difference in who wins the presidency, yet the area’s success is overshadowed by fierce political hostilities and a sense that in a warming, costlier world, things are bound to get harder.
The county was once nothing but desert, so vast and with so few people before World War II. But the land was cheap and once water and air conditioning arrived, the cities of Phoenix, Scottsdale, Chandler, Glendale, Tempe and Mesa spread across the once dry sandstone.
Tech companies like Intel, TSMC, Google and others arrived, as developers said the time it took to get approval for a new housing development in the county increased. Out of the biggest counties nationwide, Maricopa posted the largest percentage job gains so far this year, according to the Labor Department. Home prices have nearly doubled since 2016, according to Zillow.
The population surge — Phoenix is now the fifth largest U.S. city — also has fostered competing political beliefs in which the one source of unity is a mutual frustration with government leadership.
A little more than half of Arizona voters said the government should do more to solve people’s problems, according to AP VoteCast, a sweeping survey of the electorate, while less than half said the government was already doing too much. That year, about one-third of the state’s voters identified as “moderates” — a group whose votes could be critical to the outcome of the Nov. 5 election.
Voters see reasons to doubt both candidates’ commitment to help
Abel Ramirez, 32, is an assistant pastor at the Baptist church where Karl Peterson worships. Ramirez voted for Trump in 2020, firmly opposes abortion, questions the credibility of the 2020 election that Democrat Joe Biden won, and believes Biden’s administration is too supportive of LGBTQ+ rights.
His family lives in a manufactured home in a mobile home park and he figures that once all his kids are in school, his wife can work full time and he can take on a second job so they can buy a house. But he’s dismayed by a politics geared toward hurting rivals instead of helping voters.
“When it comes to helping the citizen, helping a guy that’s got to go to work every day to provide for their family, I’m not hearing too much about it,” Ramirez said. He is considering not voting in this election.
Samantha Lopez, who voted for Biden in 2020, believes the federal government needs to spend more on education, secure abortion rights and do more to expand Americans’ access to health care.
A student at Arizona State University, Lopez recently moved back to her parents’ home about 15 miles from campus after it became clear to her that it would be too difficult to keep up with rent and groceries while paying for school.
“The future feels really unpredictable right now,” said Lopez, who is uncertain how she will vote, between serving customers earlier this year at her part-time job at a downtown Phoenix doughnut shop.
It’s all about the housing market
Maricopa County is a microcosm of the boom that has driven American prosperity over the past two presidencies, powering through the Great Recession’s housing bust and pandemic era shutdowns. But that boom also destabilized people’s confidence in the real estate market that helped drive the growth
More people moved into the area than its cities and neighborhoods could absorb, pushing prices up in ways that made mortgage rates of 6%-plus troubling. Homeowners felt they could not afford to sell and buy a new property. Renters felt that the promise of middle-class stability was increasingly out of reach.
“Many voters see home prices and 30-year mortgage rates and compare that to the experience of their parents and grandparents and say ‘I’m never going to own a home,’” said Glenn Farley, director of policy and research at the nonprofit Common Sense Institute Arizona. “Until those things are brought back under control, voters are going to continue to be sour.”
Other worries also overshadow progress. The country is more educated and more diverse, yet there are persistent worries about mass shootings, crime, personal liberties, illegal immigration, climate change and the capacity of the government to fix any of it.
Why do so many Americans feel bad about the economy? Blame our politics
Americans are finding firsthand that prosperity is not the same as opportunity.
The University of Michigan’s consumer sentiment index, a well-regarded barometer of confidence in the economy, is lower now than during the height of the 2020 pandemic. The index, with Biden in power, shows that people also think about the economy based on their political identity. with Democrats comparatively optimistic and Republicans decidedly bleak.
When Republican John Giles was elected mayor of Mesa in 2014, his goal was to have a place where his children and grandchildren could live.
It’s easy to overlook the city in the shadow of Phoenix, but Mesa’s population of 511,648 makes it larger than Atlanta, Miami or Minneapolis. The closing of Williams Air Force Base three decades ago led Mesa to recruit leading companies and Giles treats his state of the city addresses like a CEO at a tech rollout, recreating scenes from the time-travel movie “Back to the Future” and hanging out with shock rocker Alice Cooper.
But Giles made headlines by endorsing Harris and speaking at the Democratic National Convention in August, saying that her policies would be more helpful for his city than would Trump’s. Giles sees the negativity swirling around the population as a byproduct of the politics in which ideologically driven media elevates conspiracy theories and consistently seeks to perpetuate division instead of rewarding problem-solving.
“I always used to think the political spectrum was a pendulum,” he said. “There were these forces that would bring us back to seeing the flaws of extremism. But now there’s a lot of people making a lot of money promoting extreme political thought. To be successful at that, you have to fan people’s fears and tell them that they’re unhappy.”
He looks at the economic data — 4.1% unemployment, new computer chips plants opening in Arizona, record levels of factory construction spending, a higher stock market and inflation easing — and confesses that he’s never been one who could overlook the facts and toe the Republican Party line.
“President Biden should be hoisted on our shoulders and walked to the top of the mountain,” he said.
Plenty of new wealth, but a great sense of uncertainty
As economist Farley, who once worked for former Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, sees it, Arizona packed in generations of wealth creation in less than a decade. Its chief virtue was always its proximity to California and ability to capture both people and employers who found that state’s taxes and cost of living to be too high.
Farley said Arizona had a reliable climate and affordable electricity costs, adding 20,000 businesses in under eight years as posh steak houses opened in Paradise Valley, the small Phoenix suburb that is the state’s richest city, and Waymo had driverless Jaguar sedans ferrying people through Scottsdale. But that growth also came with the need for a larger services sector with more people working for lower wages and inequality became clearer.
“We’re not the growth state anymore, but we’re not the mature state,” he said.
The pandemic also changed Arizona’s economy.
After the Great Recession, it was adding roughly 40,000 people a year on average from other states. But when the pandemic hit, the prospect of bigger homes brought in roughly 100,000 people in 2020, more than what the housing market could absorb. Median home prices in Maricopa County jumped to a peak of $500,767 in July 2022, leaving many renters unable to buy a home.
Trevor Cowling, the assistant pastor at the Baptist church in Mesa, bought his 1,500 square foot home in 2020 for $225,000 with a 3.1% mortgage rate. Mortgage rates more than doubled, until easing recently, as have the prices in his neighborhood.
“The Lord has taken care of us,” said Cowling, who said he could not afford his home at current mortgage rates.
But housing is just one problem.
People in the middle class also feel they’re no longer able to afford schooling or groceries as before.
Juvi Arvizu, 31, with a 5-year-old son in Phoenix, said shopping that used to cost her about $120 a week now often costs $200. After her divorce and with crime rising after pandemic, she moved to a smaller home in a safer neighborhood and decided to enroll her son in a public kindergarten, after having him in a private preschool.
Arvizu voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton for president in 2016. Frustrated by the tenor of the 2020 race, Arvizu she skipped voting. She said she plans on voting in November, but is uncertain for whom.
Regardless who wins, she is skeptical that Washington will be delivering relief to working people like her anytime soon.
“It feels like things are only going to get a lot harder,” Arvizu said.

AP Decision Notes: What to expect in Wisconsin on Election Day
WASHINGTON (AP) — Wisconsin is no stranger to close presidential elections. The margin of victory was less than a percentage point in the state’s 2020, 2016, 2004 and 2000 elections. So it might be again this Election Day.
Both Republican former President Donald Trump and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris are competing hard for the 10 electoral votes at stake in Wisconsin, making frequent stops in the Badger State — including several in the vote-rich Milwaukee, Madison and Green Bay areas.
Wisconsin was one of three “blue wall” states (Michigan and Pennsylvania are the others) that went narrowly for Trump in 2016 after almost 30 years of voting for Democratic presidential candidates. Four years later, Democrat Joe Biden won all three states back for Democrats with a margin in Wisconsin of about 20,000 votes out of nearly 3.3 million votes cast.
In the state’s U.S. Senate race, Democratic incumbent Tammy Baldwin seeks a third term against Republican Eric Hovde. Baldwin is one of five vulnerable Senate Democrats defending a seat against a well-funded, Trump-backed challenger in a campaign cycle when a defeat for even one would likely cost the party control of the chamber. Both the Baldwin and Hovde campaigns and their allies have blanketed the state with more than $160 million in advertising, according to data from the campaign ad tracking firm AdImpact.
In the state Legislature, Democrats hope that new district maps will help them chip away at the lopsided majorities Republicans have enjoyed in both chambers for more than a decade. Almost half of Wisconsin’s 33 state Senate seats and all 99 state Assembly seats are up for election this year. In the state Assembly, Democrats have their most competitive campaign cycle in years, thanks in large part to the newly redrawn districts and the retirements they helped bring about.
Wisconsin voters will also consider a statewide ballot measure that would amend the state constitution to specifically ban noncitizens from voting in state elections. Noncitizens are already barred from participating in federal elections nationwide, and no state permits them to vote in state elections. However, some municipalities in a handful of states allow noncitizens to vote in local elections. The issue has prompted efforts by Republicans in Congress and several states to ban the practice entirely.
Here’s a look at what to expect in the 2024 election in Wisconsin:

Poll closing time
9 p.m. ET.

Decision Notes
In Wisconsin, the first vote results reported on election night tend to be a mix of ballots cast on Election Day and in advance. In the April presidential primaries, more than a third of counties reported most or all of their vote results in their first vote report of the night — including in-person Election Day votes as well as mail-in and early votes.
But larger counties, including the Democratic strongholds of Milwaukee and Dane, took much longer. Their first vote update of the night included only a small share of the total votes cast. In a close race, that likely means waiting for final results in both places to know who has won the state.
In 2016, Democrat Hillary Clinton lost to Trump despite winning Milwaukee County with 66% of the vote; Dane County, the home of Madison, with 70%; and LaCrosse County with 51%. Four years later, Biden won Milwaukee with 69% of the vote, Dane with 76% and LaCrosse with 56%, eking out a narrow statewide victory.

Trump carried Brown County, the home of Green Bay, in 2016 and 2020 with about 52% of the vote, but Biden improved upon Clinton’s showing there by about 4 percentage points on his way to a win.
Along with support in the more rural parts of the state, Trump will likely need to post big numbers in the “WOW” counties of Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington in suburban Milwaukee to counter the heavy Democratic support Harris will likely claim in Milwaukee and Dane.
The Associated Press doesn’t make projections and will declare a winner only when it has determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race hasn’t been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, like candidate concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make clear it hasn’t declared a winner and explain why.
Recounts are not automatic in Wisconsin, but candidates may request and pay for one if the vote margin is less than a percentage point. The AP may declare a winner in a race that is eligible for a recount if it can determine the lead is too large for a recount or legal challenge to change the outcome.
Past presidential results
2020: Biden (D) 50%, Trump (R) 49%, AP race call: Wednesday, Nov. 4, 2020, 2:16 p.m. ET.

Will the polls be right in 2024? What polling on the presidential race can and can’t tell you
WASHINGTON (AP) — The presidential race is competitive.
That’s about as much as the national polls can tell us right now, even if it looks like Democrat Kamala Harris is down in one poll or Republican Donald Trump is up in another.
And that’s just fine.
Even though polls are sometimes treated as projections, they aren’t designed to tell you who is likely to win.
Polls are better for some things than others. Tracking shifts in voter intention is hard to do with a survey, particularly when the number of truly persuadable voters is relatively small. Voters’ opinions can change before Election Day and they often do. Horse race polls can only capture people’s viewpoints during a single moment in time. Even then, a margin that looks like one that could decide an election — say, one candidate has 48% support and the other has 45% support — might not be a real difference at all.
When reporters at The Associated Press are covering the election, horse race polling numbers don’t take center stage. The reason for this is that the AP believes that focusing on preelection polling can overstate the significance or reliability of those numbers.
Election-year polls are still useful, particularly when they’re trying to assess how the public is feeling about the candidates or the state of the country. They told us quite clearly, for instance, that many Americans wanted Democratic President Joe Biden to drop out of the 2024 race. But they’re not the same thing as an election result, and even a poll conducted just before Election Day still reflects opinion before all ballots have been cast.
Even in high-quality polls, each finding is just an estimate
Polls are useful tools, but it’s important not to overstate their accuracy. After all, a polling organization can’t talk to every single person in the country. They instead rely on a sample to produce a statistically valid estimate of the views of all adults. Even though polls can give a reasonable approximation of the views of the larger group, the question is how much each finding could vary.
The margin of error, which all high-quality pollsters will share along with their results, helps capture some of that uncertainty. It means that in a poll with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, a finding that 47% of voters say they’ll support a particular candidate actually means that there’s a very good chance that anywhere between 50% and 44% of voters are supporting that candidate. If the other candidate has 45% support, which could really be anywhere from 42% to 48%, the 2 percentage point difference isn’t statistically meaningful.
That’s why the AP will only say a candidate is leading if that candidate is ahead by more than twice the margin of error.
When you’re looking at a subgroup, rather than a national sample, the potential error is even larger. The fewer people interviewed, the larger the margin of error. This means that state-level polls or polls that measure the views of a subgroup such as women, men, Hispanic Americans or Black Americans are subject to even more error than a national finding.
The margin of sampling error is not the only source of survey error. It is simply the only one that can be quantified using established statistical methods. But there are other factors, too. The wording and order of questions can affect how people answer. An interviewer’s skill can have an effect. Even in high-quality polls, some respondents may be less likely to answer, which means their views can be underrepresented.

Don’t forget about the Electoral College
National polls measure how voters all over the country are thinking about the election. But that’s not how we elect presidents.
The Electoral College system means that presidential elections are functionally decided by a small number of states. So in some ways, looking at polls of those states is a better way to assess the state of the race.
But state-level polls introduce their own challenges. They’re not conducted as frequently as national polls and some states get polled more often than others. Also, the number of people surveyed for state polls is often smaller than for national polls, which means the margin of error is broader.
What about polling averages?
Some media outlets or organizations publish polling averages or aggregates that combine the results of multiple polls into a single estimate. There are some organizations that create polling averages or models during elections that attempt to determine which candidate is leading in overall polls.
But averaging poll results does not eliminate polling error and it can introduce additional problems. Polling averages contain their own methodological decisions, such as which polls are included or receive greater weight. Some of them also include other factors such as the state of the economy to turn those estimates into forecasts.
In election polling, survey averages can provide a general sense of the state of a race. But it’s also important to not overstate the accuracy of an average or expect it to be a crystal ball into the election outcome. Sometimes the individual results of multiple different polls can provide a better sense of the potential array of outcomes than an average boiled down to a single number.

US House clears a largely bipartisan package of bills to counter China
WASHINGTON (AP) — The U.S. House this week approved a sweeping package of bills to counter China’s influence, shoring up a largely bipartisan push to ensure America comes out ahead in the competition between the world’s superpowers.
The efforts would ban Chinese-made drones, limit China-linked biotech companies from access to the U.S. market, strengthen sanctions and deepen ties with Asian countries. The campaign to target Beijing this week shows how curbing China’s power has emerged as a rare issue of political consensus.
But some measures did pass along party lines, with Republicans arguing the need to protect national security when it comes to everything from education to farmland, and Democrats raising concerns about discrimination. The advocacy group Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote also warned about “overly broad anti-China rhetoric.”
One contentious measure seeks to revive a Trump-era program to root out Beijing’s spying in American universities and institutes. The bills all still need Senate approval.
“The House sent a powerful, bipartisan message to the Chinese Communist Party: the United States will not sit idly by,” said Republican Rep. John Moolenaar, chair of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party.
The Chinese Embassy in Washington has said the measures would damage bilateral relations and U.S. interests. “China deplores and firmly opposes this and has lodged serious representations to the U.S. side,” spokesman Liu Pengyu said.
Here’s a look at key topics that the legislation focused on this week:
Technology
Tech dominated the measures, reflecting a “laser-focused” approach to limit the spread of Chinese technology in the U.S. and prevent Beijing from accessing American innovations, said Craig Singleton, senior China fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies think tank.
The House backed a bill to prevent federal money from flowing to five biotech companies with Chinese ties, described as necessary to protect Americans’ health data and reduce reliance on China for U.S. medical supplies.
Another bill that cleared the House would outlaw, on national security grounds, devices from Chinese drone maker DJI, a dominant player in the global market.
“Allowing artificially cheap DJI drones to monopolize our sky has decimated American drone manufacturing and given our greatest strategic adversary eyes in our sky,” said Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y.
To patch a loophole in export controls, the House backed an amendment that supporters say would cut off remote Chinese access — such as through cloud computing services — to advanced U.S. technology to develop artificial intelligence and modernize its military.
Spying at schools
A bill passed along party lines would direct the Justice Department to curb spying by Beijing on U.S. intellectual property and academic institutions and go after people engaged in theft of trade secrets, hacking and economic espionage.
It’s House Republicans’ attempt to revive the China Initiative, a Trump-era program meant to curb China’s spying in U.S. universities and research institutes. It ended in 2022 after multiple unsuccessful prosecutions of researchers and concerns that it had prompted racial and ethnic profiling.
The measure “brings back the shameful China Initiative, which is the new McCarthyism,” said Rep. Judy Chu, D-Calif. She criticized the program for assuming that “researchers and scholars in America should be investigated if they had a nexus with China, such as being born there or having relatives from there.”
Rep. Lance Gooden, a Texas Republican and bill sponsor, called racism claims baseless.
Another controversial bill would restrict federal funding to universities with cultural institutes funded by the Chinese government or programs linked to certain Chinese schools.
Rep. Michael Guest, R-Miss., called Beijing’s influence inside American schools “one of our nation’s most glaring vulnerabilities.” Fellow Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Democrat, argued the measure could shut down legitimate academic programs, such as exchange students, study-abroad opportunities, guest lectures and sports events.
Farmland and electric cars
Several Democratic lawmakers also raised bias concerns about a measure that flags as “reportable” land sales involving citizens from China, North Korea, Russia and Iran.
The bill also would add the agriculture secretary to the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment, which reviews the national security implications of foreign transactions.
China “has been quietly purchasing American agricultural land at an alarming rate, and this bill is a crucial step towards reversing that trend,” said Rep. Dan Newhouse, a Republican from Washington state.
The National Agricultural Law Center estimates 24 states ban or limit foreigners without residency and foreign businesses or governments from owning private farmland. The interest emerged after a Chinese billionaire bought more than 130,000 acres near a U.S. Air Force base in Texas and another Chinese company sought to build a corn plant near an Air Force base in North Dakota.
The House also narrowly approved an effort to exclude Chinese electric cars from receiving clean-vehicle tax credits. “America’s working families should not be forced to subsidize a nation whose decades of unfair trade practices and government subsidies have led to lost jobs, shuttered factories and hollowed out communities right here at home,” said Rep. Jason Smith, a Missouri Republican.
Rep. Dan Kildee, a Michigan Democrat, said the bill’s “unclear restrictions” would make it unworkable and “leave the auto industry and batter manufacturers to pull back their U.S. investments.”
Diplomacy
The House backed several measures to boost sanctions on China and deepen ties with Asia-Pacific countries to counter China’s influence.
One could lead Hong Kong’s representative offices in the U.S. to close by stripping them of diplomatic privileges if the territory is deemed to have lost autonomy from mainland China.
To deter Chinese aggression toward the self-governed island of Taiwan, a bill goes after the financial assets of Chinese officials and their immediate families.
Addressing concerns over Beijing’s rising military influence, a resolution cleared the House to recognize the importance of cooperation with South Korea and Japan.",2024-09-12
AP,"La economía de EEUU creció a un sólido ritmo del 2,8% el último trimestre impulsada por el consumo","La economía de EEUU creció a un sólido ritmo del 2,8% el último trimestre impulsada por el consumo
WASHINGTON (AP) — La economía de Estados Unidos creció a una tasa anual saludable del 2,8% de julio a septiembre, con los consumidores impulsando el crecimiento a pesar del peso de las tasas de interés aún altas.
El informe del miércoles del Departamento de Comercio indicó que el producto interno bruto —el total de bienes y servicios de la economía— se desaceleró ligeramente desde su tasa de crecimiento del 3% en el trimestre de abril a junio. Sin embargo, las cifras reflejan una sorprendente durabilidad justo cuando los estadounidenses evalúan el estado de la economía en la recta final de la carrera presidencial.
Este informe es el primero de tres estimaciones que el gobierno hará del crecimiento del PIB para el tercer trimestre del año. La economía de Estados Unidos ha continuado expandiéndose a pesar de las tasas de préstamo mucho más altas que la Reserva Federal impuso en 2022 y 2023 en su esfuerzo por controlar la inflación. A pesar de las amplias predicciones de que la economía sucumbiría a una recesión, ha seguido creciendo, con empleadores aún contratando y consumidores aún gastando.
En señal de que los hogares de la nación, cuyas compras impulsan la mayor parte de la economía, continuarán gastando, el Conference Board dijo el martes que su índice de confianza del consumidor registró su mayor ganancia mensual desde marzo de 2021. La proporción de consumidores que esperan una recesión en los próximos 12 meses cayó a su punto más bajo desde que la junta planteó esa pregunta por primera vez en julio de 2022.
Al mismo tiempo, el otrora candente mercado laboral de la nación ha perdido algo de impulso. El martes, el gobierno informó que el número de ofertas de empleo en Estados Unidos cayó en septiembre a su nivel más bajo desde enero de 2021. Y los empleadores han añadido un promedio de 200.000 empleos al mes hasta ahora este año —una cifra saludable pero inferior al récord de 604.000 en 2021 cuando la economía se recuperaba de la recesión pandémica, 377.000 en 2022 y 251.000 en 2023.
El viernes, se espera que el Departamento de Trabajo informe que la economía añadió 120.000 empleos en octubre. Sin embargo, ese aumento probablemente haya sido limitado por los efectos de los huracanes Helene y Milton y por una huelga en Boeing, el gigante de la aviación, todos los cuales dejaron temporalmente a miles de personas fuera de las nóminas.
En su reunión más reciente el mes pasado, la Fed estaba lo suficientemente satisfecha con su progreso contra la inflación —y lo suficientemente preocupada por la desaceleración del mercado laboral— para reducir su tasa de referencia en un robusto medio punto porcentual, su primer y mayor recorte de tasas en más de cuatro años. Cuando se reúna la próxima semana, se espera que la Fed anuncie otro recorte de tasas, esta vez de un cuarto de punto.
Los responsables de la política monetaria del banco central también han señalado que esperan reducir su tasa clave nuevamente en sus dos últimas reuniones de este año, en noviembre y diciembre. Y prevén cuatro recortes de tasas más en 2025 y dos en 2026. El resultado acumulativo de los recortes de tasas de la Fed, con el tiempo, probablemente será tasas de préstamo más bajas para consumidores y empresas.
La inflación, que alcanzó un máximo de cuatro décadas del 9,1% en junio de 2022, ha caído al 2,4%, apenas por encima del objetivo del 2% de la Fed. Pero los precios promedio aún superan con creces sus niveles previos a la pandemia, lo que ha exasperado a muchos estadounidenses y planteado un desafío a las perspectivas presidenciales de la vicepresidenta Kamala Harris en su carrera contra el expresidente Donald Trump. Sin embargo, la mayoría de los economistas convencionales han sugerido que las propuestas de política de Trump, a diferencia de las de Harris, empeorarían la inflación.

How elections forecasters became political ‘prophets’
WASHINGTON (AP) — Before there was a FiveThirtyEight model, or a New York Times election night needle, or 13 keys revealing “how presidential elections really work,” there was an economist named Louis Bean.
Bean achieved a sort of political fame for a book he wrote in 1948 that suggested, contrary to conventional wisdom, that Democratic President Harry Truman was favored to win the election, not Republican Thomas Dewey, the governor of New York.
“It is here, presumably, where the experts fall out, that the tea leaves and intuition enter in,” said a Times review of Bean’s book, “How to Predict Elections.” “The intuitive school has already counted Governor Dewey in by a landslide.”
Truman won.
When Bean predicted that Sen. Robert A. Taft, R-Ohio, would lose reelection in 1950, The Washington Post printed the headline: “Political Prophet Sees Taft Defeat.”
Today, there are more of these “prophets” than ever.
It may be no surprise that people seek certainty before elections happen, given what they see as the stakes: One recent Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found that about 7 in 10 Americans believe that the future of democracy is at stake in this year’s presidential election, and another found that about 6 in 10 Americans described themselves as being “fearful” about the possibility of Democrat Kamala Harris winning, Republican Donald Trump winning, or both.
Yet often the forecasters themselves are the first to push back on the characterization that they can tell you what’s going to happen.
“People I think are looking for oracles, right?” said Nate Silver, the founder of FiveThirtyEight and author of the Silver Bulletin, a new site analyzing elections. “They’re looking for people that seem to have some magic formula or have some almost quasi-mystical understanding of elections and trends.”
Charlie Cook, founder of the Cook Political Report, said he flinches “at the term ‘prediction’ because it suggests saying, ‘I think Smith will win.’” But, Cook said, ”In close races, how can someone say that without knowing precisely what will happen between now and the last vote is cast?”
Most people, Cook said, “don’t really understand probabilities, they want it to be definitive, either Smith or Jones, no hedging, no qualifying, no conditions, don’t give me nuance” and “they want us to say something that is unknowable.”
In a recent column, the Cook Report’s publisher and editor, Amy Walter, issued a “plea” to stop “attaching your hopes, dreams, and fears to one poll or a poll model on any given day.”
“Just take a breath and accept the fact that this election will be won on the margins,” Walter said in an interview.
Even Bean, whose election predictions made headlines for decades, cautioned against reading his analysis as gospel. A year before the 1968 election, he predicted, with a caveat, that Democratic President Lyndon Johnson would defeat Republican Richard Nixon: “If the Republicans win, you ought to forget it and say it was a good, tentative early analysis.”
Johnson ended up dropping out and his vice president, Humbert Humphrey, was the party’s nominee. Nixon won.

Nuanced analysis versus snappy headlines
Before the 2022 midterms, a Q-and-A with David Wasserman appeared in New York Magazine with the headline “‘A Category 2 or 3 Hurricane Headed Democrats’ Way.’” The quote wasn’t wrong. It just wasn’t complete.
“Today, we’re somewhere between an asterisk year, where there’s a minimal wave, and a classic midterm election, where Republicans do quite well,” Wasserman said at the time. “I think this is probably a Category 2 or 3 hurricane headed Democrats’ way, just not a Category 4 or 5.”
Wasserman, senior editor and elections analyst at the Cook Report, said he was trying to convey that, despite the conventional wisdom, a massive Republican wave wasn’t imminent at all. But that’s not how many readers interpreted the headline. Republicans ended up making only modest gains.
“I have to be very careful on how I communicate our elections analysis because it’s so prone to misinterpretation,” Wasserman said.
Before the internet took off, analysts such as Cook and Stu Rothenberg offered their analysis in newsletters. Part of that included putting individual races in categories, on a scale from “safe” to “toss-up.” Those designations come from a combination of access to polling data, reporting in battleground states, in-person assessments of candidates and other factors that have made Cook and Rothenberg some of the foremost elections experts.
The ratings, however, are only a small part of the analysis these outlets provide.
Rothenberg, the founder of the Rothenberg Political Report, approached his newsletter as a venue to tell subscribers what he had observed and analyzed in the world of elections, communicating directly with the readers who knew and trusted him.
Sometimes news outlets would mark his ratings as news events, rather than as expert analysis.
“It was like I was coming down from Mount Sinai with the truth,” Rothenberg reflected.
The current surge of elections predictions is centered around models that use a combination of factors — polling, demographics, historical results, to name a few — to put a number on the probability that a race will turn out one way or the other. That can make it seem like forecasts are objective measurements, when in fact they rely on many subjective decisions, said Natalie Jackson, a longtime pollster who is now vice president at Democratic polling firm GQR.
“They’re treated as a lot more concrete than they should be,” Jackson said.
Nathan Gonzales, who runs Inside Elections, calls the process of placing races in a category to denote competitiveness “a combination of art and science.”
Accepting the uncertain
Paradoxically, even though the most reputable analysts urge caution, it’s those who present their predictions most confidently who tend to receive the most attention.
The digital era has made people even more uncomfortable with uncertainty.
“There’s information, and a lot of it, and there’s an industry constantly creating more information, and that makes us think we should have everything at our fingertips, including future election results,” Jackson said.
“Everyone is jockeying for attention, and there are some perverse incentives as well,” Wasserman said. “If your model shows a strong probability for one side, that’ll get the most ‘likes’ and ‘retweets’ on that side. A lot of the most nuanced and thoughtful approaches get drowned out.”
That need for certainty may also be one reason for a field of elections forecasters that is dominated by men, despite the large number of women who work in polling and political journalism.
There’s not a single reason that fully explains the gender disparity, though Silver believes that “men are given license to be more aggressive” and that sexism likely plays a role in who gets taken seriously.
Studies also suggest women are more cautious in professional settings, Jackson noted. It’s a quality that can be critical for conveying uncertainty of elections predictions but doesn’t necessarily get rewarded on social media or in headlines.
“People don’t like uncertainty,” Jackson said. “They like the person who tells them what’s happening.”
That human tendency is especially problematic in the elections forecasting business. Silver actually describes his forecasts as “models of uncertainty.”
“A definitive prediction,” Silver said, “is usually a sign that someone’s a charlatan.”

AP,Ministro talibán: mujeres afganas no pueden rezar en voz alta ni recitar frente a otras mujeres,"Ministro talibán: mujeres afganas no pueden rezar en voz alta ni recitar frente a otras mujeres
ISLAMABAD (AP) — Las mujeres afganas tienen prohibido rezar en voz alta o recitar el Corán frente a otras mujeres, según un ministro del gobierno talibán.
Es la última restricción para las mujeres tras las leyes de moralidad que les prohíben elevar la voz y mostrar sus rostros fuera del hogar. Ya están excluidas de la educación después del sexto grado, de muchos espacios públicos y de la mayoría de los empleos.
Nadie del Ministerio de Virtud y Vicio estuvo disponible de inmediato el miércoles para aclarar los comentarios del funcionario o confirmar si la prohibición también se convertiría en parte de las leyes de moralidad.
Durante un evento en la provincia oriental de Logar el domingo, el ministro de Virtud y Vicio, Khalid Hanafi, dijo: “Está prohibido que una mujer adulta recite versos coránicos o realice recitaciones frente a otra mujer adulta. Incluso los cánticos de takbir (Alá Akbar) no están permitidos”.
Afirmó que pronunciar expresiones similares como “subhanalá”, otra palabra central en la fe islámica, también estaba prohibido. No se permitía a una mujer realizar el llamado a la oración, dijo a los presentes.
“Así que, ciertamente no hay permiso para cantar”, dijo.
El audio de las declaraciones de Hanafi se compartió en las plataformas de redes sociales del ministerio, pero luego fue eliminado.
El ministerio dijo el martes que se está llevando a cabo un programa de concienciación nacional sobre las leyes que involucra a funcionarios del ministerio a nivel provincial y distrital.
“Organizar tales programas contribuirá a formar la percepción pública y aumentar la conciencia sobre los dictámenes divinos”, añadió el ministerio.
Las provincias afganas ya están prohibiendo a los medios mostrar imágenes de seres vivos, otra característica controvertida y ampliamente criticada de las leyes de moralidad.
Los talibanes establecieron el ministerio para la “propagación de la virtud y la prevención del vicio” después de tomar el poder en 2021. Desde entonces, el ministerio ha hecho cumplir decretos emitidos por la dirección talibán que tienen un impacto desproporcionado en mujeres y niñas, como códigos de vestimenta, educación segregada y empleo, y tener un guardián masculino cuando viajan.

WASHINGTON (AP) —
Maricopa County, Arizona, has become the nation’s ultimate swing county — a place that could determine whether Democrat Kamala Harris or Republican Donald Trump will be the next president and which party controls the U.S. Senate.
The county is so closely divided politically that it can take more than a week to learn who won it. This year, election officials warn it could be as long as 13 days to tabulate all of the ballots in Maricopa.
The drawn-out count has made Maricopa County — home to Phoenix and dozens of other communities — a center of election conspiracy theories.
But the reason it takes so long is simple. Here are some things to know about this consequential battleground:
It is a sprawling, fast-growing county
Maricopa County stretches across more than 9,000 square miles, more than four U.S. states. With its 4.5 million residents, the county is home to 60% of Arizona’s voters. It has more residents than nearly half of the states in the country.
It wasn’t always that way. In 1969, the county was still home to fewer than 1 million people. It became a magnet for conservatives like John Kavanagh, a retired New York Port Authority Police officer who in 1993 relocated with his family to Maricopa County.
Kavanagh was like a lot of other people who moved to Arizona in the 1990s — middle-class folks fleeing colder places and what they saw as economic and political dysfunction around them — for a sunny, affordable, and what they perceived as a cleaner city.
In 1993, the county’s population was 2.3 million, and Republicans dominated the state legislature and Maricopa County politics.
Today, the county is nearly double that size, and its politics have changed. Arizona now has a Democratic governor, elected in 2022. Both its U.S. senators were elected as Democrats.
How Maricopa went from GOP stronghold to swing county
Among the reasons Maricopa County’s political leaning shifted was increased migration to Arizona from Mexico.
In the 1990s, President Bill Clinton’s administration strengthened California’s border, pushing illegal migration to Arizona, which already had a robust Hispanic population. Immigration quickly became a political flashpoint, leading many in the state’s already-large Latino population to feel that Republicans were demonizing them.
The biggest shift came in 2010, when Arizona’s Republican-controlled legislature passed a law, SB1070, that allowed local police to stop people they suspected of being in the country illegally. The law, which opponents dubbed “Show Me Your Papers,” was the harshest anti-immigrant law in the nation, and it energized the state’s Latinos to organize against Republicans.
It “galvanized the Latino community like nothing ever had ever done before,” said Joe Garcia, a leader of the Latino activist group Chicanos Por La Causa.
Still, the first rumblings that Maricopa County could swing against the long-dominant Republican Party didn’t come until 2016.
Republican voters like Gordon Keig were growing increasingly uneasy with some GOP positions.
Keig couldn’t bring himself to vote for Trump or his 2016 rival, Hillary Clinton. And once Trump came into office and began what Keig saw as his erratic, feud-driven approach to governing — including fighting with Arizona’s popular senior Republican Sen. John McCain, whose grandchildren Keig’s own daughters knew — Keig couldn’t take it anymore. He switched his registration to the Democratic Party, saying he felt like Republican values “weren’t there for me anymore.”
In 2020, Keig voted for Democrat Joe Biden. The change by voters like him is visible by comparing Maricopa’s votes in the 2012 presidential election with 2020. A crescent of more affluent neighborhoods ringing central Phoenix from the north to the southeastern edge, where a new Intel chip plant has attracted high-tech workers, switched from Republican to Democratic. Local operatives dubbed the area “the flip zone.”

The flip zone largely tracks where Maricopa’s more educated residents have clustered. Once less educated than the national average, the county now boasts a slightly higher share of adults with four-year-college degrees than the national average — a key indicator of voting Democratic in the age of Trump.

The county became a hotbed for Trump’s election lies and conspiracies
Trump falsely claimed he won Arizona after his 2020 loss to Biden, and he and his allies attacked anyone who argued otherwise.
Supporters turned up outside the county elections office, some armed and many waving Trump and American flags, for a “Stop the Steal” rally. Trump’s then-attorney, Rudy Giuliani, held hearings at a Phoenix hotel.
The Republican-controlled state Senate launched an error-riddled review of Maricopa’s handling of the 2020 election. The county became something of a tourist attraction for election deniers who came from other states to watch the show.
County Recorder Stephen Richer, a Republican who defended the accuracy of the county’s election results, was singled out for criticism by Trump himself, and Richer and his family faced threats.
Richer says the reason some Republicans remain skeptical of the way elections work in the county isn’t because there’s anything especially complicated or unusual in how it counts votes. It’s because Maricopa — where Biden defeated Trump by a margin of about 11,000 votes — may be the best place to undermine confidence in national elections.
Maricopa is a swing county in a swing state, he noted.
“So if you wanted to really fix your attention on a place that would yield dividends for your theories, then Maricopa County would be the place,” Richer said.
Why a complete count takes time
The conspiracists have seized on how Maricopa reports its ballot counts in one large burst after Election Day and then in dribs and drabs for more than another week, when it finally becomes clear who won. There are three main reasons for this — Maricopa’s size, the closeness of races in the county and Arizona’s voting laws, which were written and approved by Republicans.
Maricopa is the second-largest election jurisdiction in the nation. Only reliably Democratic Los Angeles County is larger.
Maricopa reports its results far faster than Los Angeles, but it takes longer to find out who won because the county — and Arizona overall — is so evenly divided. That creates a false impression of disorder in the vote count.
Arizona’s mail voting law also drags out the count. It allows voters to return mail ballots by the close of polls on Election Day. In 2022, 293,000 voters — one-fifth the total vote in Maricopa — dropped off their mail ballots on Election Day.
Mail ballots take longer to count because, before they can be tallied, the envelopes must be scanned, the ballots sorted and the voters’ signatures inspected to ensure they’re legitimate. Some states like Florida require all mail ballots to be in before Election Day so this process is over when the polls close. Because of Arizona law, when Maricopa’s polls close it’s just beginning.
Extending the count even longer is a provision in Arizona law that allows voters to “cure” their ballots up to five days after Election Day. That means if the election office thinks the signature on the ballot or some other technical detail is wrong, the voter has five more days to come in and fix it so the ballot counts.",2024-10-30
AP,US backs 2 permanent seats for African nations on the UN Security Council,"US backs 2 permanent seats for African nations on the UN Security Council
UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United States announced Thursday that it will support the addition of two new permanent seats for African countries on the powerful U.N. Security Council — and a first-ever non-permanent seat for a small island developing nation.
U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Linda Thomas-Greenfield made the announcement in a speech to the Council on Foreign Relations, calling it a follow-up to U.S. President Joe Biden’s announcement two years ago that the U.S. supports expanding the 15-member body.
While Africa has three non-permanent seats on the Security Council, that doesn’t allow African countries “to deliver the full benefit of their knowledge and voices,” she said.
“That is why, in addition to non-permanent membership for African countries, the United States supports creating two permanent seats for Africa on the council,” Thomas-Greenfield said. “It’s what our African partners seek, and it’s what we believe is just.”
However, Thomas-Greenfield later said Washington opposes giving veto power to the African countries that would hold the two permanent seats because the veto makes the Security Council’s work “dysfunctional.”
That view shows the limits in the amount of power that Washington wants to give to any other country. While Security Council resolutions are legally binding, they are often ignored by targeted countries.
Virtually all countries agree that nearly eight decades after the United Nations was established in the wake of World War II, the Security Council should be expanded to reflect the world in the 21st century and include more voices. But the central question — and the biggest disagreement — remains how to do it.
The Security Council, which is charged with maintaining international peace and security, has not changed from its 1945 configuration: 10 non-permanent members from all regions of the world elected for two-year terms without veto power and five countries that were dominant powers at the end of World War II are permanent members with veto power: the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France.
Russia’s veto power, for instance, has stymied any council action on the war in Ukraine and U.S. support for its ally Israel has limited the council’s response to the war in Gaza.
Attempts to reform the council to reflect the changing world began in 1979.
In 2005, world leaders called for the council to be “more broadly representative, efficient and transparent.” That year, the General Assembly, which must approve any council reforms, shelved three rival resolutions to expand its membership, a reflection of deep divisions that have continued until today.
In September 2022, Biden called for increasing the number of both permanent and non-permanent members, including “permanent seats for those nations we’ve long supported, and permanent seats for countries in Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean.” The United States has long supported permanent seats for Germany, Japan and India.
Thomas-Greenfield made no mention of Biden’s other pledge about permanent seats for countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. But a senior U.S. administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to brief reporters ahead of the announcement, said the U.S. still supports permanent seats for Latin America and the Caribbean, plus Africa.
Responding to countries arguing that it’s time for the U.N. to look beyond just regional representation, the U.S. ambassador also announced that the United States is supporting the creation of an additional rotating seat for small island developing countries.
“These 39 states are not a monolith. They are home to 65 million people, across over 1,000 islands,” she said. “But each has critical insights on a range of international peace and security issues including, notably, the impact of climate change.”
Thomas-Greenfield said the United States plans “to actually put our principles on paper” and draft a resolution to reform the council.
Some countries argue that before negotiating a resolution, “all 193 member states need to be in agreement about what a reformed council should look like,” she said.
“I’m an optimist. But I’m also a realist. And the reality is this: no amount of conversation will ever get us to a place of total consensus on this issue,” Thomas-Greenfield said.

AP,Hundreds of Pennsylvania voters are challenged based on postal service's change-of-address database,"Hundreds of Pennsylvania voters are challenged based on postal service’s change-of-address database
HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Counties in Philadelphia’s suburbs are being asked to throw out the mail-in ballot applications of hundreds of voters in what the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania said are mass-produced and illegal challenges.
The challenges question the voter’s residence based on a supposed match with a U.S. Postal Service change-of-address database.
Diane Houser, a supporter of former President Donald Trump who filed over 200 of the challenges in Chester County, said the challenges are nonpartisan and from a grassroots network targeting the ballot applications of people who moved out of state.
However, the ACLU said the challenges are illegal because voters can only be challenged on their qualifications to register to vote. Friday is the deadline for such challenges, which the ACLU said must be based on specific evidence that a certain would-be voter is not eligible to vote.
The challenges are based on a faulty premise that someone is moving out-of-state permanently because the change-of-address forms are also designed to help someone get their mail forwarded, the ACLU said.
Someone in the database may be temporarily relocating for school, military service or other purposes, as opposed to permanently changing their residence, the ACLU wrote in a letter to counties.
“There are lots of reasons you could be on that list and still be eligible and registered to vote in Pennsylvania,” Witold Walczak, legal director of the ACLU of Pennsylvania, said in an interview.
The challenges are just one front in various legal disputes over which mail-in ballots can be counted in a state that is expected to be critical in deciding the winner of the presidential election.
The counties thus far receiving the challenges are in Philadelphia’s heavily populated and left-leaning suburbs where voters in 2020’s presidential election heavily supported Democratic President Joe Biden over Trump.
The counties receiving them — Bucks and Chester counties — expect their three-member elections boards to consider the challenges at a public meeting.
Bucks County reported receiving 191 complaints from a person it declined to identify, while Houser said complaints will be filed in Montgomery and Delaware counties. Those counties did not report receiving complaints as of Tuesday.
Still, deeming any of those voters ineligible or rejecting their ballot based on the challenge alone would violate federal and state law, the ACLU said.
People also are receiving associated letters from “a friend in Pennsylvania” advising them to cancel their voter registration if they have moved out of state, Walczak said.
Walczak said voters of various party registrations had been challenged, but it skewed heavily to Democrats because Democrats vote more heavily by mail than Republicans.

US lawmakers’ concerns about mail ballots are fueled by other issues with mail service
Lawmakers said during a contentious congressional hearing Thursday they are uneasy about the U.S. Postal Service’s readiness for a crush of mail ballots for the November election because some of them feel burned by other Postal Service actions.
Postmaster General Louis DeJoy sought to reassure a House Appropriations subcommittee that the Postal Service is well-positioned for an extraordinary effort to deliver mail ballots to election officials on time to be counted and that close to 100% will make it promptly. In recent weeks, DeJoy has pushed back on suggestions from state and local election officials that the Postal Service has not addressed problems that led to mail ballots arriving too late or without postmarks, disenfranchising those voters.
But as subcommittee members asked DeJoy about how the Postal Service has addressed election officials’ concerns, they criticized a larger, 10-year plan to make the mail delivery system more efficient and less costly by consolidating mail processing centers, suggesting it could slow mail delivery, particularly in rural areas. DeJoy disputed that.
DeJoy has said repeatedly that the Postal Service’s larger plans won’t affect the handling of potentially tens of millions of mail ballots for the Nov. 5 election because the plan is on hold for October and the first half of November. But subcommittee Chair David Joyce, an Ohio Republican, told him in opening the hearing that broader problems with mail delivery are on constituents’ minds as the presidential election approaches.
“Many of our constituents have expressed concerns about the Postal Service’s ability to deliver election ballots securely and on time,” Joyce said. ”It is imperative that the Postal Service get this right.”
DeJoy told the lawmakers that the Postal Service’s 650,000 employees will be sifting through 300 million pieces of mail to capture stray ballots and ensure they arrive on time. DeJoy said the Postal Service has improved its training and touted a year-round task force he created to deal with mail ballot issues.
“We do everything we possibly can in an imperfect system that expects the perfect, and we’re a good target for a lot of blame,” DeJoy said.
DeJoy said that nearly 99.9% of the mail ballots from the 2020 election were delivered within seven days, the “recommended commonsense time frame.” Asked whether people can trust mail ballots, DeJoy said, “Absolutely, absolutely.”
Scrutiny of the Postal Service intensified earlier this month when the National Association of Secretaries of State and National Association of State Election Directors sent DeJoy a letter saying that their concerns weren’t being adequately addressed, releasing it to news organizations. DeJoy said he’s had a good working relationship with them.
“A phone call would have helped instead of a letter to the press,” he said.
But Joyce said that in Ohio’s Nov. 7, 2023, election, when voters approved an amendment to the state constitution protecting abortion rights, some ballots mailed by voters on Oct. 24 did not arrive until Nov. 21 — 10 days too late to be counted. DeJoy said he would need to learn the specifics.
Democratic Rep. Matt Cartwright of Pennsylvania, a key swing state in the presidential election, pointed to an end-of-July report from the Postal Service’s inspector general saying that in some places, Postal Service workers weren’t following its procedures for handling mail ballots.

He said the inspector general’s office “has a couple hundred people” to investigate potential problems and “interrogate our people.”
“They find some things wrong — they’re perfect at that,” he said.
Though the subcommittee said it was examining issues about mail ballots, several members used the hearing to air other issues that trouble them, particularly the larger plan to reorganize the mail delivery system.
DeJoy said the Postal Service has embarked on long-overdue investments in “ratty” facilities and making other changes to create “a Postal Service for the future” and deliver mail faster. But lawmakers in several states have argued that mail delivery slowed after regional hubs were consolidated.
Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan, of Wisconsin, suggested that a pilot program consolidating some mail processing in Green Bay, Wisconsin, had failed and said the larger reorganization should remain on hold “forever.”
DeJoy said a pilot program allowed a test of potential changes and problems are being addressed after telling Pocan, “You know, the first rockets that went to the moon blew up.”
Pocan shot back: “Thanks for blowing up Wisconsin.”
Cartwright expressed concern about a potential slowdown of rural mail delivery. DeJoy suggested the Postal Service was a financial and operational mess when he became postmaster general in 2020 and badly needed fixing, but Cartwright said, “You really think that rural Americans should have to pay the price?”
DeJoy responded: “I disagree with the premise, and I think it’s an unfair accusation, considering the condition that the Postal Service has been allowed to get to.”

AP,"How Putin views the choice between Harris and Trump, and what the election means for Russia","How Putin views the choice between Harris and Trump, and what the election means for Russia
How Putin views the choice between Harris and Trump, and what the election means for Russia
The question posed to Vladimir Putin in September about the U.S. election drew a wry smile and an arched eyebrow from the Russian president.
Asked whether he preferred Donald Trump or Kamala Harris, Putin caught listeners up short with his teasing reply that also included a gentle jab at President Joe Biden.
“Our ‘favorite,’ if you can call it that, was the current president, Mr. Biden,” he told the audience at an economic forum in the Far East port of Vladivostok.
“But he was removed from the race, and he recommended all his supporters to support Ms. Harris. Well, we will do so — we will support her,” he said sardonically, citing her “expressive and infectious laugh” that shows “she’s doing well.”
The election Tuesday carries significant stakes for the Kremlin, and despite Putin’s noncommittal and somewhat teasing answer, it appeared to encapsulate Russia’s view as a choice between two unappealing possibilities.
Analysts say neither offers much promise of improving relations that have hit their lowest point since the Cold War.
Harris, the current vice president, has taken a hard line against Russia, while Trump, the former president, is known for his admiration of Putin. Still, at the September gathering, Putin complained that when Trump was in office, there were “so many restrictions and sanctions against Russia like no other president has ever introduced before him.”
Timothy Colton of the Harvard Academy for International and Area Studies said that the Kremlin leadership is “by and large convinced nothing good is going to come in the election from Russia’s point of view.”
But he added that on the whole, Trump “is probably their preference; he’s more of a known quantity.”
Key issues for Russia as the U.S. election looms:
What will happen to aid for Ukraine?
Harris is seen as likely to continue the Biden administration’s massive military and economic support for Ukraine as Russia’s invasion stretches toward a third year.
Trump has bragged that his rapport with Putin and respect from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy are so strong that he could negotiate an end to the war “in 24 hours.” He declines to detail his strategy, but recent remarks criticizing sanctions in general suggest he could lift those against Russia as an inducement to help settle the conflict.
During their debate, Trump twice refused to directly answer whether he wanted Ukraine to win the war, while Harris praised Western support for Kyiv and urged it to continue.
“Otherwise, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe. Starting with Poland,” she said.
Trump’s running-mate Sen. JD Vance has mentioned proposals that could suggest Trump’s thinking: having Ukraine demilitarize territory occupied by Russia and agree to permanent neutrality. Those terms would be anathema to Kyiv, but Trump has shown little sympathy for Ukraine, saying Zelenskyy “should never have let that war start.”
Harris has not specified how her position would differ from Biden’s. The U.S. has provided Ukraine more than $59.5 billion in weapons and assistance since Russia invaded in 2022. She has said previously it would be foolish to risk global alliances the U.S. has established and decried Putin’s “brutality.”
A Harris win “likely promises continued U.S. support as long at the administration can maintain congressional backing,” the International Crisis Group said in a commentary, though it said she could seek an end to the fighting more actively than Biden did. Growing congressional animosity to vast outlays of aid for Ukraine could hobble or reshape her strategy.

How will the U.S. approach Russia on human rights?
Harris has confronted Russia directly on such matters, particularly in the case of the death in prison of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. She was among the first foreign leaders to comment on his death, calling it “a further sign of Putin’s brutality.”
Trump put off comment for days, then did not connect Putin to the matter. He likened Navalny’s punishment to his own fraud prosecution, calling his case “a form of Navalny.”
Trump has called for a bill declaring there to be only two genders and pledged to keep transgender women out of women’s sports — positions that parallel how Russia under Putin has rolled back LGBTQ+ rights and lauded “traditional values.”
His characterization of Democrats and his rivals as “the enemy within” is little different in spirit than Russia’s accelerating suppression of opposition.
How will NATO be affected?
Trump has wrestled with other members of the NATO alliance, demanding that they meet the agreed spending levels for their militaries in their national budgets. He said that as president, he warned leaders that he would not only refuse to defend nations that don’t meet those targets, but that Russia could “do whatever the hell they want” to such countries.
Trump also has questioned the NATO charter’s mutual-defense clause, asking in an interview why the United States should be obliged to defend the “very aggressive people” of NATO member Montenegro.
Harris says the United States’ commitment to NATO is “ironclad.” She has not weighed in on whether she supports Ukraine becoming an alliance member.
What about arms control deals with Russia?
Putin has repeatedly brandished the nuclear sword as he seeks to deter the West from supporting Ukraine.
The last remaining nuclear arms control treaty between Moscow and Washington, New START, is to expire in 2026. a year after the new administration takes office, and its prospects are troubled.
Biden renewed the treaty quickly upon taking office, and Harris could be expected to follow that support for the pact that limits the number of intercontinental nuclear missile launchers.
Russia suspended participation in 2023 — although it did not withdraw — and the U.S. retaliated with measures including halting the sharing of information on missiles’ location and status.
Trump, although he has warned of the threat of “nuclear warming,” took steps while in office to dismantle the arms control regime, including pulling out of the INF Treaty on intermediate-range nuclear weapons — which banned ground-based nuclear and conventional missiles with a range of 500-5,500 kilometers (310-3,410 miles),
While in office, Trump called for a new nuclear pact that would include both Russia and China.",2024-10-30

Voters drowning in ads from ‘obscene’ amounts of cash flooding Montana U.S. Senate race
BOZEMAN, Mont. (AP) — After 18 years working to topple Montana Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Tester, Republicans in Big Sky Country see potential victory and control of the Senate majority within their grasp in an increasingly acrimonious contest that’s shattering campaign spending records.
Montana voters, meanwhile, are getting worn out — deluged by negative ads on their TVs, radios, phones and in their mailboxes.
Tester won by a narrow, 3,500-vote margin in 2006 and has held on for three terms despite a dramatic political re-alignment across the U.S. Northern Plains. He’s confronting what analysts say is his most serious challenge yet in Republican Tim Sheehy, a former U.S. Navy SEAL and wealthy aerospace executive aligned with former President Donald Trump.
The two sides have dueling ad campaigns with similar goals: Tear down the opponent.
A Sheehy ad talks about rampant corruption in Washington and calls Tester “one of the worst offenders.” A Tester ad labels Sheehy a “fake cowboy” and attacks him for lying about a bullet wound in his arm.
At a weekend Tester rally in Bozeman, Montana — where Sheehy in August held an event with Trump that drew thousands of people — the crowd for the incumbent lawmaker numbered in the dozens.
Josh Olsen, an outdoor guide and Tester voter, worried that as Montana’s population expands, its electorate is becoming too partisan to back the grain farmer from the tiny town of Big Sandy who is counting on his cross-party appeal to give him another term.
“A hundred percent I’m worried about it,” said Olsen. “There’s more partisan people coming here...If they’re coming here and they’re Republicans, they’re voting for Sheehy.”
Tester, 68, entered office as one of a half dozen Democratic senators in a five-state region stretching from Nebraska to Canada. He’s the last one still in office, and Republicans have spent years trying to chip away at his support, particularly in rural areas.
Montana is one of the least-densely populated states in the U.S., and only about a quarter of its residents live in cities of 50,000 or more.
“Outside the cities of Montana, Republicans have made gains in most of the towns and rural counties,” said political analyst Jeremy Johnson at Carroll College. “That’s a challenge for Democrats.”
‘Obscene’ amounts of money
Republicans have a two-seat deficit in the Senate.
Democrats, desperate to retain their majority, are on track to outspend Republicans by almost $50 million in the Montana race, according to Federal Election Commission filings and data from the media tracking firm AdImpact. Total spending is expected to exceed $315 million, or about $487 for each of the state’s 648,000 active registered voters — a record for a congressional race on a per-voter basis, according to party officials.
Former Montana Gov. Marc Racicot called the flood of money into the sparsely populated state “absolutely obscene.” It comes more than a decade after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down political spending restrictions on corporations and unions.
“You can’t stand to even turn on TV,” Racicot said in an interview. “You’re just confronted constantly with this anger, grievance, sloganeering — everything that goes on in these campaigns — because there’s so much money involved. It’s an abomination.”
If Sheehy wins, a Republican-majority Senate can hamstring Democrats’ agenda should Vice President Kamala Harris win the White House. Similarly, a Tester victory could help Democrats counter a Trump administration’s actions.

The non-partisan Campaign Legal Center has sued over alleged financial transparency violations by a pro-Tester group, Last Best Place PAC, that has amplified some of the most incendiary claims against Sheehy. Another complaint from the advocacy group charges that a straw donor was used to conceal more than $2.5 million in contributions to political committees, including one supporting Sheehy.
The allegations are unlikely to be resolved before the election.
Trump on the ballot
Trump won Montana overwhelmingly in 2016 and 2020. The 2024 election is the first where both Tester and Trump are on the ballot.
Sheehy’s campaign themes largely mirror those of Trump and the national party. He rails against immigration, inflation and social issues such as transgender children in sports.
Democrats hitched Tester’s campaign to abortion and women’s health care, hoping the backlash that surfaced even in Republican-leaning states after the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade will continue.
Tester has distanced himself from Harris and other Democratic leaders. That political isolation reflects the GOP’s gains over the past two decades with rural voters who once backed Democrats.
Tester’s campaign has outraised Sheehy’s by more than three-to-one, propelled by a massive influx of small out-of-state donations after Democrats raised alarms over the race.
“Jon Tester has more money but dollars don’t vote,” Sheehy’s campaign said in a statement. “Montanans just want common sense: a secure border, safe streets, cheap gas, cops are good and criminals are bad, boys are boys and girls are girls.”
Lies and lobbyists
Sheehy, who arrived in Montana a decade ago and compares himself to early European settlers, has sought to turn Tester’s Senate tenure into a liability.
Republicans allege a pattern of campaign donations flowing to the Democrat from industries that needed his vote. Tester previously faced scrutiny over donations from bank executives affected by a 2018 regulatory roll back and Lockheed Martin employees who benefited from a 2021 defense bill. There’s no indication of wrongdoing or that the contributions swayed Tester.
He ranks as the number one recipient of lobbyist cash among members of Congress, with $500,000 in donations this election cycle, and has raised $88 million overall.
Tester said in an interview following the Bozeman rally that he doesn’t know who donates to him or if any lobbyists were there that night.
“I’ve got policies to write, people to get on board,” he said. “If it makes sense for Montana, I’ll support it.”
Sheehy has money pouring in from national groups, too. He’s received $109,000 from lobbyists and previously lobbied government officials himself, seeking business for the aerial firefighting company he founded with his brother.
Sheehy has no prior political experience and has avoided in-depth interviews. He’s faced blowback over derogatory remarks he made to supporters about Native Americans and questions about the bullet wound in his arm, which he has said came from a firefight in Afghanistan.
Sheehy told a Glacier National Park ranger in 2015 that the wound was self-inflicted. Park Ranger Kim Peach, now retired, earlier this month publicly accused Sheehy of lying when he says it was from combat.
Peach repeated the accusation in a subsequent advertisement from a pro-Tester PAC and acknowledged the ad was recorded before he went public, despite initially telling The Associated Press that he was unconnected to Democratic groups.
Republicans said Peach wasn’t credible.
“He’s shifting his story left and right because he is a liar and a Democrat partisan,” said Mike Berg with the National Republican Senatorial Committee.
Tester said Sheehy should release his medical records to clear up the dispute, adding: “Stolen valor is a huge problem.”",2024-10-29

Speaker Johnson sets House vote on government funding bill after a one-week postponement
WASHINGTON (AP) — House Speaker Mike Johnson will move ahead with a temporary spending bill that would prevent a partial government shutdown when the new budget year begins on Oct. 1, despite the headwinds that prompted him to pull the bill from consideration last week.
The bill includes a requirement that people registering to vote must provide proof of citizenship, which has become a leading election-year priority for Republicans raising the specter of noncitizens voting in the U.S., even though it’s already illegal to do so and research has shown that such voting is rare.
“I urge all of my colleagues to do what the overwhelming majority of the people of this country rightfully demand and deserve — prevent non-American citizens from voting in American elections,” Johnson said Tuesday.
Johnson told reporters he was not ready to discuss an alternative plan to keep the government funded other than what will come before the House on Wednesday.
“I’m not having any alternative conversations. That’s the play. It’s an important one. And I’m going to work around the clock to try and get it done,” Johnson said.
The legislation faces an uphill climb in the House and has no chance in the Senate. The vast majority of Democrats oppose it, and some Republicans do, too, but for different reasons.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the only way to prevent a government shutdown was for both sides to work together on an agreement. He said the House vote announced by Johnson was doomed to fail.
“The only thing that will accomplish is make clear that he’s running into a dead end,” Schumer said. “We must have a bipartisan plan instead.”
The legislation would fund agencies at current levels while lawmakers work out their differences on a full-year spending agreement.
Democrats, and some Republicans, are pushing for a short extension. A temporary fix would allow the current Congress to hammer out a final bill after the election and get it to President Joe Biden’s desk for his signature.
But Johnson and some of the more conservative members of his conference are pushing for a six-month extension in the hopes that Republican nominee Donald Trump will win the election and give them more leverage when crafting the full-year bill.
Schumer said a six-month measure would shortchange the Pentagon and other government agencies that need more certainty about funding levels.
“You simply cannot run the military with six-month stopgaps,” Schumer said.
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell declined to weigh in on how long to extend funding. He said Schumer and Johnson, ultimately, will have to work out a final agreement that can pass both chambers.
“The one thing you cannot have is a government shutdown. It would be politically beyond stupid for us to do that right before the election because certainly we would get the blame,” McConnell said.
Johnson said last week that he was not giving up on his proposal just yet and would be working through the weekend to build support. He said ensuring that only U.S. citizens vote in federal elections is “the most pressing issue right now and we’re going to get this job done.”
On Sunday, he traveled to Florida to meet with Trump, who had earlier seemingly encouraged a government shutdown if Republicans “don’t get assurances on Election Security.” Trump said on the social media platform Truth Social that they should not go forward with a stopgap bill without such assurances.
The House approved a bill with the proof of citizenship mandate back in July. Some Republicans who view the issue as popular with their constituents have been pushing for another chance to show their support for the measure. Still, other Republicans are expected to vote no because they view the spending in the bill as excessive.",2024-09-17

Biden looks to maintain relevance in political conversation in final sprint to Election Day
NEW CASTLE, Del. (AP) — As President Joe Biden ’s 50 years in elected office near an end, he doesn’t appear content to quietly exit the political stage.
With a week to go before Election Day, Biden is intent on promoting his administration’s record and making the case for Americans to support Vice President Kamala Harris and other Democrats on the ballot — whether they want him or not.
He’s determined to keep up a busy schedule during the final sprint to Nov. 5 even as many in his party appear to be keeping their distance from him.
Biden, in an exchange with reporters Monday, played down the fact that he hasn’t campaigned side-by-side with Harris since their joint Labor Day campaign appearance in Pittsburgh and that he’s held few public campaign appearances with Democrats in competitive races.
“I’ve done a lot of surrogate stuff, and the fact of the matter is that I’ve also had to continue to be president at the same time,” Biden told reporters after casting his early vote on Monday in his home state of Delaware.
Biden said that he and Harris still “talk all the time.” He added that he has also made several visits to battleground states in his official capacity in recent months, and he plans to do more campaigning in the days ahead in Pennsylvania, including his childhood hometown of Scranton.
Officials say Biden also plans to attend a campaign-related event in Maryland on Tuesday with U.S. Senate candidate Angela Alsobrooks, conduct a series of campaign calls on Thursday, and return to battleground Pennsylvania on Friday to spotlight Democratic support for unions.
Biden said the Harris campaign is asking him to go “where they think I should be to help them the most.”
He had pledged to campaign hard for Democrats after dropping out. Yet few Democrats have invited him to campaign by their side since he ended his reelection bid.
The dynamic has meant the outgoing president has had to pick his spots carefully as he tries to remain a relevant voice in a chaotic political season.
Trump on Monday took to his social media platform to mock Harris and Democrats for keeping Biden at arm’s length.
“The Democrats have not only greatly demeaned and embarrassed Crooked Joe Biden, but now they’re demanding that he be nowhere near Lyin’ Kamala’s Campaign,” Trump said on Truth Social. “It’s not good enough that they took the Presidency away from him, just like you take candy away from a baby, but now they have to further embarrass him by telling him to, “GET LOST.”
To be certain, not all Democrats are avoiding Biden.
Two Democratic Senate candidates, Pennsylvania incumbent Sen. Bob Casey and Delaware Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester, campaigned with Biden this month. Both have deep ties to the president.
Biden on Monday stopped at a breakfast spot near his home outside Wilmington with Rochester, a longtime ally who is vying to become the first Black woman to represent Delaware in the U.S. Senate.
The night before their breakfast, he formally endorsed Blunt Rochester in a short video that her campaign released on social media. Biden, in his endorsement, praised Blunt Rochester for being “Delaware through and through.”
The four-term House lawmaker has known Biden for about 30 years and is heavily favored to win the seat in the Democratic-dominated Delaware.

At a Pittsburgh union hall on Saturday, Biden wound through a mostly standard campaign speech before veering into a sharp attack on Trump backer Elon Musk. He accused the billionaire tech mogul of working illegally when he first came to the United States to attend college.
The “wealthiest man in the world is now his ally, right?” Biden said, referring to a recent Washington Post report questioning Musk’s status when he was a student at Stanford University. “Well, that wealthiest man in the world turned out to be illegal worker here when he was here” as a student.
Musk, who was born in South Africa, denies the allegation.
Last week, during a stop at a New Hampshire campaign office to meet Democratic volunteers, Biden borrowed some of Trump’s sharp rhetoric.
“We’ve got to lock him up,” Biden told the volunteers, before quickly amending his comments to note he meant that Democrats need to “politically lock him up.”
Blunt Rochester joined Biden on Monday as he waited in line for about 40 minutes at a busy early voting location not far from his home.
Biden thought he had one more election in him before deciding to end his campaign in July because of Democrats’ growing worries about his chances of defeating Trump.
He chatted with voters as he waited in line to cast his ballot, and helped push an older woman in a wheelchair who was ahead of him. He handed his identification to a election worker, who had him sign a form and announced: “Joseph Biden now voting.”
Outside the polling place, Biden told reporters that the moment was more “sweet” than bitter. He expressed confidence when asked if he thought Democrats — including Harris -- would win.
“I think we will,” he said.

AP,The Associated Press' role in calling races and polling voters,"The Associated Press’ role in calling races and polling voters
WASHINGTON (AP) — Hundreds of news organizations, readers, listeners and viewers will look to the The Associated Press Decision Desk on Nov. 5 to learn dozens of election results. Some have already been looking to the AP to learn where voters stand on certain issues and candidates.
The AP has been calling elections since the 1800s. The work begins well before election night, with months of work leading up to the first Tuesday in November.
On this episode of The Story Behind the AP Story, a recurring audio production that features extended interviews with AP journalists, vice president of news operations David Scott walks listeners through what a typical election day looks like for the Decision Desk, and how the AP calls races. Emily Swanson, director of public opinion research, will explain how AP conducts its polling to understand voter sentiments.
AP AUDIO: The Associated Press’ role in calling races and polling voters
AP correspondent Haya Panjwani reports on how The Associated Press approaches calling races and polling.
—-
HAYA PANJWANI, HOST: The Decision Desk at The Associated Press has been calling races since 1848. David Scott, vice president and head of news strategy and operations at the AP, leads the team that does that in 2024.
SCOTT: Voters are voting. They’re out there. They’re casting their ballots, and the last ones to do so. So many Americans vote in advance these days. You get to sort of the late afternoon and, you know, the pizza’s coming at 5 or 6 o’clock before first polls close. But you’re doing your final prep work, you’re doing your final analysis. You’re going through your checklist to make sure that you’ve got all the information that you need.
And then around 6:30, 6 o’clock, votes start coming in. And then it just goes — it just goes — and there’s 5,000 races to call — contested races to call. And polls will keep closing up until 1 a.m. on the East Coast. Then, election night is not over. The vote count continues till 3 or 4 in the morning on the East Coast. And then we get up the next day and our team keeps counting the vote and we keep declaring it.
PANJWANI: I’m Haya Panjwani. In this episode of The Story Behind The AP story, we’ll be learning about how the AP calls races and how our polling team AP VoteCast operates.
SCOTT: So literally, at the dawn of the cooperative, two years after the Associated Press was founded, we decided as a membership cooperative that we weren’t going to wait any more for the time it would take for the mechanism of government to sort of collect all the votes and say who won.
On election night, we are still out there calling counties, putting reporters in county election offices, scraping websites, taking in data feeds from multiple sources. We are getting the vote, the results of the election, and we combine all those results together into one source, one feed, one graphic, one story, so that on election night or in the days thereafter, Americans can know and the world can know who Americans have picked to be their new leader.
This fall, in this year’s general election, we’ll tabulate results in 7,000 races total, including more than 5,000 contested races. For every race that we count the vote in, where we report results, we also declare a winner.
SWANSON: A lot of people think of the importance of polling around elections as being something that tells us who’s going to win.

SWANSON: I tend to think that that is an overrated reason to think that polling is important. In part because polling by its very nature is an imprecise science and can’t necessarily tell us who is going to win, especially in a close election. But also because there’s so much more that polling has to offer. It can tell us what people find most important, what they think about those issues that they’re finding most important. And it can also tell us a lot about what people are experiencing.
PANJWANI: Since the 1960s, news organizations like the AP have used exit polls to survey voters and analyze election results. While this method has been effective, it has become harder in recent years as voting methods have evolved.
SWANSON: So many people now, instead of going to the polls, they vote by mail, they vote early in person. And it just became more and more difficult for us to reach the true universe of voters by talking to them in person at polling stations.
PANJWANI: So to address these challenges, AP VoteCast was created to accurately reflect the electorate regardless of how individuals cast their ballots.
SWANSON: One of my jobs, one of the Decision Desk’s jobs, is to reduce the number of unknowns. And to the extent that we can’t do that, reduce the number of unknown unknowns — make sure that the things we don’t know are things that we know we don’t know, and (that we) are able to factor the fact that we don’t know them into our decision making.
But the reality is that there can be new curveballs, new changes in the way that somebody counts their votes that could come at us. That’s always something that’s a little bit scary, and always something that we need to make sure that we have on the back of our minds when we’re doing important work that we really need to make sure that we get right.
SCOTT: Our standard for declaring winners in elections is 100%. If we don’t get every single one right, we consider that – now, I wouldn’t say a failure, but it’s an opportunity for improvement. We want to be right all the time. It’s really important to us that when we are declaring a winner, we are confident that there’s no chance the trailing candidate can catch up. And so our standard is 100%.
SWANSON: One thing that we’ve really had to pay more and more attention to on the Decision Desk is how different vote types impact how votes are counted. At least as much as if not more than geography does.
In a traditional election, 20 years ago, or even 10 years ago, the primary thing that we were looking at on Decision Desks was how specific counties are coming in and how that compares to past elections – and that’s pretty basic. But ultimately, that’s sort of like the core of what you’re doing when looking at an election. It’s what has already come in? What do we know about it and what do we know about the counties that are still out?
The major thing that has changed over the last 10 years or so and is only getting to be more of an issue is that now people are to a large extent voting by mail. They’re voting before Election Day. And it’s not just that more people are doing it, but that they’re different from the people who are voting on Election Day. It adds an additional dimension to what we need to pay attention to.
SCOTT: For years, we had all of these internal conversations in the newsroom about the status of the vote count or when it was the right time to call a winner, what we were looking for, what piece of information was missing that wasn’t allowing us to make a call. Then when we got it, OK, now’s the moment we can declare somebody the winner.
What we found is that, in this moment, those internal conversations needed to be journalism. We needed to be showing our work. Just like you’re back in high school and math class, you need to show your work. You need to show your proof of why this call was the right call to make at this time.
The audience for journalism in our country just expects more. Trust but verify, as President Reagan would say. They have an expectation that in order to trust, they want to see what’s gone into our reporting.
And, you know, think about it like a story, right? Like you don’t send out a headline. There’s the headline, but then there’s the story that has all the information, the background and the interviews and the context that explains what goes into that headline. And that’s the same sort of approach now we’re just taking with race calls.
There’s certainly been a rise of misinformation and disinformation, particularly on social media, places where those headlines in isolation can be challenged. And the best way to fight that, we think, is by showing our work, showing what’s taking place behind the scenes so that it’s not even really behind the scenes anymore. It’s just part of the journalism that goes into election night.

Hearing on Trump assassination attempts says Pennsylvania failure was by Secret Service
WASHINGTON (AP) — Members of a bipartisan House task force investigating the Trump assassination attempts emphasized during their first hearing Thursday that the Secret Service, not local authorities, was responsible for the failures in planning and communications that led to a gunman being able to open fire on former President Donald Trump in Pennsylvania.
Lawmakers repeatedly questioned why the agency tasked with protecting the country’s top leaders didn’t do a better job communicating with local authorities during the July 13 rally, particularly when it came to securing the building that was widely agreed to be a security threat but that ultimately was left so unprotected that gunman Thomas Michael Crooks was able to climb up and open fire on Trump.
“In the days leading up to the rally, it was not a single mistake that allowed Crooks to outmaneuver one of our country’s most elite group of security professionals. There were security failures on multiple fronts,” said the Republican co-chair of the committee, Rep. Mike Kelly from Pennsylvania.
“The communication between the Secret Service and local and state partners was disjointed and unclear,” said Rep. Jason Crow, the ranking Democrat on the panel, who also praised the local law enforcement.
Trump was wounded and a man attending the rally with his family was killed.
The panel — comprised of seven Republicans and six Democrats — has spent the last two months analyzing the security failures at the rally, conducting nearly two dozen interviews with law enforcement and receiving more than 2,800 pages of documents from the Secret Service.
The lawmakers are also investigating a second assassination attempt on Trump that happened earlier this month where a man with a rifle sought to assassinate the GOP presidential nominee while he was golfing at one of his courses in southern Florida.
But the hearing Thursday focused on the rally shooting with testimony from Pennsylvania and Butler County police officials.
The Secret Service often relies on local authorities to secure bigger events where protectees like Trump appear around the country. But after the Butler rally, the agency was heavily criticized for failing to clearly communicate what it needed from those local agencies that day.
One key question has been why there were no law enforcement personnel on top of the AGR building where Crooks eventually climbed up and took his shots, considering that it was so close to the rally stage and afforded a clear line of sight to Trump.
“A 10-year old looking at that satellite image could have seen that the greatest threat posed to the president that day” was the building near the stage, said Rep. Pat Fallon, R-Texas.
Edward Lenz, commander for the Butler County Emergency Services Unit who was in charge of the local tactical units operating at the Butler rally, said his agency was never asked to put a sniper team on top of the roof and never said that they would. Lenz said the Secret Service knew their shooters were inside the AGR Building — a position designed to allow them to look for threats inside the rally crowd as opposed to threats to the president from outside — and there was no “feedback or guidance” from the Secret Service that they wanted the team anywhere else.
“They knew where we would be,” Lenz said. “They knew what our plan was.”
Lenz also testified that Secret Service officials did not check with him or his team to make sure they were in place before Trump went on stage and that the emergency communication for July 13 had not been worked out in advance.
Drew Blasko, an assistant team leader of the sniper unit within the Butler Township Emergency Services Unit, testified that he shared his concerns about the building with the Secret Service ahead of the rally and said his team didn’t have the manpower to post anyone there. He said he asked the Secret Service that additional people be posted there and was told “that they would take care of it.”
Some of the witnesses also said that there had been discussions ahead of time about using opaque screens or large farm equipment to block the line of sight to the stage, but it’s not clear what happened to those suggestions.
Another issue that lawmakers emphasized was the difficulty of the various agencies to talk to each other on radios or cellphones. And they questioned why there were two command posts as opposed to one unified post where the Secret Service could have directly communicated with all the state and local authorities.
Patrick Sullivan, a retired Secret Service agent who was not involved in the Butler rally but attended the hearing as an expert on the agency’s practices and procedures, said it was not a typical setup. “There should be just one overall command post,” he said.
Lawmakers struggled in their questioning Thursday to get witnesses to zero in on a single individual or moment that led to the assassination attempt. Local police officials and a retired Secret Service agent also testifying instead pointed to a series of incidents and mistakes that ultimately allowed Crooks to remain undeterred for a prolonged period of time and eventually take his shot at the former president.
“Communication was totally lacking here,” said Rep. Correa, a Democrat from California. “What went wrong? Who’s in charge?”
Thursday’s session was the fourth congressional hearing about the Butler shooting since July. Secret Service Director Kimberly Cheatle resigned one day after she appeared before a congressional hearing where she was berated for hours by both Democrats and Republicans for the agency’s security failures.
Cheatle called the Pennsylvania attempt on Trump’s life the Secret Service’s “most significant operational failure” in decades, but she angered lawmakers by failing to answer specific questions about the investigation.
An interim report Wednesday from the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which is also conducting an investigation, said the Secret Service failed to give clear instructions on how state and local officials should cover the building where the gunman eventually took up position. The report also said the agency didn’t make sure it could share information with local partners in real-time.
The Secret Service has also released a five-page document summarizing the key conclusions of a yet-to-be-finalized agency report on what went wrong in Butler. Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe has said that the agency is ultimately responsible for what happened. He’s cited complacency by the agency’s staff and said they needed to do a better job communicating with local and state officials.
The House panel is expected to propose a series of legislative reforms and issue a final report before Dec. 13.
While the oversight investigations have been bipartisan, Democrats and Republicans have disagreed on whether to give the Secret Service more money in the wake of its failures. A government funding bill that passed Wednesday includes an additional $231 million for the agency, even though many Republicans were skeptical and said an internal overhaul of the Secret Service is needed.",2024-09-26
AP,Tech firms remove social media accounts of a Russian drone factory after an AP investigation,"Tech firms remove social media accounts of a Russian drone factory after an AP investigation
Google, Meta and TikTok have removed social media accounts belonging to an industrial plant in Russia’s Tatarstan region aimed at recruiting young foreign women to make drones for Moscow’s war in Ukraine.
Posts on YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok were taken down following an investigation by The Associated Press published Oct. 10 that detailed working conditions in the drone factory in the Alabuga Special Economic Zone, which is under U.S. and British sanctions.
Videos and other posts on the social media platforms promised the young women, who are largely from Africa, a free plane ticket to Russia and a salary of more than $500 a month following their recruitment via the program called “Alabuga Start.”
But instead of a work-study program in areas like hospitality and catering, some of them said they learned only arriving in the Tatarstan region that they would be toiling in a factory to make weapons of war, assembling thousands of Iranian-designed attack drones to be launched into Ukraine.
In interviews with AP, some of the women who worked in the complex complained of long hours under constant surveillance, of broken promises about wages and areas of study, and of working with caustic chemicals that left their skin pockmarked and itching. AP did not identify them by name or nationality out of concern for their safety.
The tech companies also removed accounts for Alabuga Polytechnic, a vocational boarding school for Russians aged 16-18 and Central Asians aged 18-22 that bills its graduates as experts in drone production.
The accounts collectively had at least 158,344 followers while one page on TikTok had more than a million likes.
In a statement, YouTube said its parent company Google is committed to sanctions and trade compliance and “after review and consistent with our policies, we terminated channels associated with Alabuga Special Economic Zone.”
Meta said it removed accounts on Facebook and Instagram that “violate our policies.” The company said it was committed to complying with sanctions laws and said it recognized that human exploitation is a serious problem which required a multifaceted approach, including at Meta.
It said it had teams dedicated to anti-trafficking efforts and aimed to remove those seeking to abuse its platforms.
TikTok said it removed videos and accounts which violated its community guidelines, which state it does not allow content that is used for the recruitment of victims, coordination of their transport, and their exploitation using force, fraud, coercion, or deception.
The women aged 18-22 were recruited to fill an urgent labor shortage in wartime Russia. They are from places like Uganda, Rwanda, Kenya, South Sudan, Sierra Leone and Nigeria, as well as the South Asian country of Sri Lanka. The drive also is expanding to elsewhere in Asia as well as Latin America.
Accounts affiliated to Alabuga with tens of thousands of followers are still accessible on Telegram, which did not reply to a request for comment. The plant’s management also did not respond to AP.
The Alabuga Start recruiting drive used a robust social media campaign of slickly edited videos with upbeat music that show African women smiling while cleaning floors, wearing hard hats while directing cranes, and donning protective equipment to apply paint or chemicals.
Videos also showed them enjoying Tatarstan’s cultural sites or playing sports. None of the videos made it clear the women would be working in a drone manufacturing complex.
Online, Alabuga promoted visits to the industrial area by foreign dignitaries, including some from Brazil, Sri Lanka and Burkina Faso.
In a since-deleted Instagram post, a Turkish diplomat who visited the plant had compared Alabuga Polytechnic to colleges in Turkey and pronounced it “much more developed and high-tech.”
According to Russian investigative outlets Protokol and Razvorot, some pupils at Alabuga Polytechnic are as young as 15 and have complained of poor working conditions.
Videos previously on the platforms showed the vocational school students in team-building exercises such as “military-patriotic” paintball matches and recreating historic Soviet battles while wearing camouflage.
Last month, Alabuga Start said on Telegram its “audience has grown significantly!”
That could be due to its hiring of influencers, who promoted the site on TikTok and Instagram as an easy way for young women to make money after leaving school.
TikTok removed two videos promoting Alabuga after publication of the AP investigation.
Experts told AP that about 90% of the women recruited via the Alabuga Start program work in drone manufacturing.

AP Decision Notes: What to expect in North Carolina on Election Day
WASHINGTON (AP) — North Carolina voters will cast ballots for president and governor in the Nov. 5 general election while many in the state are still dealing with the aftermath and massive destruction caused by Hurricane Helene.
The Tarheel State is one of a handful of competitive presidential battlegrounds that will likely determine the race for the White House. Polls there have tightened considerably since President Joe Biden dropped out of the race in July, making the state a popular destination for both campaigns. Since the storm, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican former President Donald Trump and their running mates have all visited North Carolina.
Since 1968, Democratic presidential candidates have carried North Carolina only twice: in 1976 and 2008. Nonetheless, the state has been competitive in recent years. Trump carried North Carolina twice but with less than 50% of the vote each time. He edged Biden in 2020 by about one percentage point, his smallest winning margin in any state.
In the race for governor, Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson and Democratic state Attorney General Josh Stein are the nominees to replace Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper, who is term-limited. Robinson has denied a CNN report that he posted explicit messages on a pornography web site more than a decade ago. Since the allegations surfaced, many of his campaign staff members have resigned and he was excluded from a Trump campaign event in Wilmington.
Also on the ballot is a competitive race in the 1st Congressional District in northeastern North Carolina. Democratic U.S. Rep. Don Davis is seeking a second term against Republican Laurie Buckhout.
In the state Legislature, Republicans overwhelmingly outnumber Democrats in both chambers, but a net loss of a single seat in the Senate or the House could cost the GOP its supermajority, and its ability to override the governor’s veto along with it. All 50 state Senate and 120 state House seats are up for election.
Voters will also consider a proposed amendment to the state constitution that would specify that only U.S. citizens can vote in the state.
Here’s a look at what to expect in the 2024 election in North Carolina:
Election Day
Nov. 5.
Poll closing time
7:30 p.m. ET.
Presidential electoral votes
16 awarded to statewide winner.
Key races and candidates
President: Harris (D) v. Trump (R) v. Chase Oliver (Libertarian) v. Jill Stein (Green) v. Randall Terry (Constitution) v. Cornel West (Justice For All).
Governor: Robinson (R) v. Stein (D) and three others.
1st Congressional District: Davis (D) vs. Buckhout (R) and one other.
Ballot measure: N.C. 1 (Citizenship Requirement to Vote General).
Other races of interest
U.S. House, Agriculture Commissioner, Attorney General, Auditor, Court of Appeals, Insurance Commissioner, Labor Commissioner, Lieutenant Governor, Secretary of State, Supreme Court, Superintendent of Public Instruction, Treasurer, state Senate, state House.
Decision Notes
North Carolina has a track record of counting votes relatively quickly, leaving only about 1% of the vote uncounted after election night. This year, the count could be slowed in some areas due to the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. State elections officials approved emergency measures in nearly 30 western counties and tribal areas giving voters additional options for turning in their absentee ballots.
State law allows county elections officials to begin tabulating mail ballots before the polls have closed on Election Day. As a result, the first votes reported on election night will include many of these mail ballots. Overall, these ballots have tended to favor Democrats, ever since the issue of early and mail voting became highly politicized during the 2020 election. This means that the Democratic candidate in a competitive contest could take an early lead in the vote count in the initial vote reports after polls close, even though the race may tighten considerably as more votes are tabulated.

In the 2022 U.S. Senate race, for example, Democrat Cheri Beasley took a 20 point lead over Ted Budd when the first batches of votes were released after polls closed. That lead disappeared after about 90 minutes, when Budd overtook Beasley in the vote count and went on to win the seat. Mail and early in-person votes accounted for about 59% of all ballots in that election.

In statewide elections, the Democratic strongholds are in the Raleigh, Charlotte, Greensboro and Fayetteville areas, while Republicans tend to perform best in the western, eastern and southeastern areas of the state. When Barack Obama carried North Carolina in 2008, he won beyond the safe Democratic areas and picked up an additional 11 counties in what were moderate Republican areas. More than half of those counties may have moved out of reach for Democrats today, as Trump outperformed Biden by double-digit margins in 2020. But that same year, Democratic Gov. Cooper picked up Granville, Pasquotank and Scotland counties in his successful reelection bid and reduced the margin in others.
Other counties to watch include Nash, northeast of Raleigh, and New Hanover on the Atlantic Coast. They are two of only 10 counties across the seven presidential battlegrounds that flipped from Trump to Biden. Nash is expected to complete its vote count by around 10 p.m. ET, followed by New Hanover about half an hour later.
The Associated Press doesn’t make projections and will declare a winner only when it has determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race hasn’t been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, like candidate concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make clear it hasn’t declared a winner and explain why.
There are no automatic recounts in North Carolina, but candidates may request and pay for one if the margin is less than 0.5% of the total votes or 10,000 votes for statewide races or 1% for non-statewide races. The AP may declare a winner in a race that is eligible for a recount if it can determine the lead is too large for a recount or legal challenge to change the outcome.
Past presidential results
2020: Trump (R) 50%, Biden (D) 49%, AP race call: Fri. Nov. 13, 2020, 3:49 p.m. ET.
Voter registration and turnout
Registered voters: 7,666,436 (as of Sept. 1, 2024). 31% Democrats, 30% Republicans.
Voter turnout in 2020 presidential election: 75% of registered voters.
Pre-Election Day voting
Votes cast before Election Day 2020: about 84% of the total vote.
Votes cast before Election Day 2022: about 58% of the total vote.
Votes cast before Election Day 2024: See AP Advance Vote tracker.
How long does vote-counting take?
First votes reported, Nov. 3, 2020: 7:42 p.m. ET.
By midnight ET: about 99% of total votes cast were reported.

NEW YORK (AP) — Actor Timothée Chalamet made a surprise appearance at his own look-alike contest in Lower Manhattan on Sunday, an event that drew hundreds of onlookers, a dispersal order from police and at least one arrest.
Flanked by bodyguards, Chalamet briefly posed for photos with his high-cheeked, curly haired doppelgängers, some of whom had dressed as the actor’s characters in “Wonka” and the “Dune” movies.
But just as the wannabe-Chalamets began strutting along a red carpet in Washington Square Park, police ordered the large group to disperse, slapping organizers with a $500 fine for an “unpermitted costume contest.”
At least one contestant was taken away in handcuffs, though police did not immediately say why. A spokesperson for the NYPD said charges were pending.
“It started off as a silly joke and now it’s turned pandemonium,” said Paige Nguyen, a producer for the YouTube personality Anthony Po, who staged the event.
The organizers had posted flyers for the contest — which promised a $50 prize to the winner — around New York in recent days, spurring social media speculation and thousands of RSVPs to an online invite.
After leaving the park, the group soon found a backup location in a nearby playground, where more than a dozen contestants competed for audience approval from a makeshift stage.
What makes a good Chalamet?
“It’s all in the nose,” said Lauren Klas, a 27-year-old graphic designer who clung to a fence post to get a better view of the stage. “All of his bone structure, really.”
After winnowing down the group down to four, the remaining contestants were asked about their French proficiency, their plans to make the world a better place and their romantic intentions with Kylie Jenner. Chalamet and Jenner are said to be a couple.
Eventually, a winner was chosen: Miles Mitchell, a 21-year-old Staten Island resident, who dressed in a purple Willy Wonka outfit and tossed candy to the crowd from a brief case.
As he stood next to a novelty-size check written out to “Best Tim,” a group of admirers lined up for the chance to take a photo — or exchange social media profiles — with the winner.
“I’m excited and I’m also overwhelmed,” Mitchell said. “There were so many good look-alikes. It was really a toss-up.”",2024-10-27

AP Decision Notes: What to expect in New York on Election Day
WASHINGTON (AP) — New York is a Democratic-leaning state, but it is still a major priority for Republicans on Election Day.
Half a dozen U.S. House races in New York have become highly competitive, making it a key state in the race to control the chamber.
Democrats are hoping to flip two Long Island districts: the 1st District in Suffolk County and the 4th District in Nassau County. In the 1st District, Republican Rep. Nick LaLota faces a challenge from Democrat John Avlon. In the 4th District, Republican Anthony D’Esposito faces a rematch against 2022 Democratic nominee Laura Gillen.
Another three Republican freshmen are facing competitive races further north: Reps. Mike Lawler, Marc Molinaro, and Brandon Williams. The three congressmen and D’Esposito represent districts that President Joe Biden carried in the 2020 election, making them top priorities for Democrats. Across the aisle, Democratic Rep. Pat Ryan is also running in a competitive race.
Republican former President Donald Trump and Democrat Vice President Kamala Harris are competing for New York’s 28 electoral votes. The state hasn’t voted for a Republican presidential nominee since Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand is also on the ballot seeking a third full term.
In the state Legislature, Democrats have a lopsided advantage but a net loss of a few seats in either chamber could cost them their supermajority. All state Senate and Assembly seats are up for election in November.
Voters will also decide a ballot measure called the “ Equal Rights Amendment,” which is largely backed by Democrats and supporters of abortion rights. While the proposal doesn’t specifically mention abortion, it would bar discrimination based on “pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy.” New York is one of 10 states where voters will decide abortion-related ballot questions on Nov. 5.
Here’s a look at what to expect in the 2024 election in New York:

AP,Trump's social media company is now worth more than Musk's X after recent surge in stock price,"Trump’s social media company is now worth more than Musk’s X after recent surge in stock price
NEW YORK (AP) — Donald Trump’s Truth Social is now worth more than Elon Musk’s X, thanks to a recent run-up in the shares of the parent company of the former president’s social media platform.
Trump Media & Technology Group is now valued at over $10 billion after its shares more than quadrupled since late September. Meanwhile, X Holdings is valued at around $9.4 billion, based on the most recent value the investment group Fidelity assigned to its stake in the company formerly known as Twitter.
The stock of Trump Media, or TMTG, tends to move more with Trump’s re-election odds than on its own profit prospects and investors have seen his chances of retaking the presidency improving of late. On Tuesday, the stock rose almost 9% to close at $51.51, on top of a 21.6% gain Monday. The stock was moving so sharply that trading was briefly halted several times during the morning. The stock had dropped to roughly $12 late last month.
Trump created TMTG after he was banned from Twitter and Facebook following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. He owns about 57% of the company but has no role in running it.
Based in Sarasota, Florida, TMTG has been losing money and struggling to raise revenue. It lost more than $16 million in the quarter ending in June while generating only $837,000 in revenue, according to regulatory filings.
When Musk took over Twitter in October of 2022, the company was valued at around $44 billion. At that time, Fidelity Investments valued its stake at $19.7 million. In a recent regulatory filing, Fidelity’s Blue Chip Growth fund said its stake in X Holdings was worth about $4.2 million.
Other companies TMTG is now bigger than include: Caesars Entertainment, Match Group, Walgreens Boots Alliance and Hasbro, the maker of the Monopoly game.
Musk has become one of Trump’s most prominent supporters in his bid to get re-elected. The world’s richest man, Musk has committed more than $70 million to boost Trump and has recently held a number of town halls in support of the former president.",2024-10-29
AP,"Virginia asks US Supreme Court to reinstate removals of 1,600 voter registrations","Virginia asks US Supreme Court to reinstate removals of 1,600 voter registrations
WASHINGTON (AP) — Virginia on Monday asked the U.S. Supreme Court to intervene to allow the state to remove roughly 1,600 voters from its rolls that it believes are noncitizens.
The request comes after a federal appeals court on Sunday unanimously upheld a federal judge’s order restoring the registrations of those 1,600 voters, whom the judge said were illegally purged under an executive order by the state’s Republican governor.
Gov. Glenn Youngkin says he ordered the daily removals in an effort to keep noncitizens from voting. But U.S. District Judge Patricia Giles ruled late last week that Youngkin’s program was illegal under federal law because it systematically purged voters during a 90-day “quiet period” ahead of the November election.
The Justice Department and a coalition of private groups sued to block Youngkin’s removal program earlier this month. They argued that the quiet period is in place to ensure that legitimate voters aren’t removed from the rolls by bureaucratic errors or last-minute mistakes that can’t be rectified in a timely manner.
Youngkin said he was simply upholding a state law that requires Virginia to cancel noncitizens’ registration.
The ruling Sunday from the three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, sided with the judge who ordered the restoration of voters’ registrations.
The appeals court said Virginia is wrong to assert that it is being forced to restore 1,600 noncitizens to the voter rolls. The judges found that Virginia’s process for removing voters established no proof that those purged were actually noncitizens.
Youngkin’s executive order, issued in August, required daily checks of data from the Department of Motor Vehicles against voter rolls to identify noncitizens.
State officials said any voter identified as a noncitizen was notified and given two weeks to dispute their disqualification before being removed. If they returned a form attesting to their citizenship, their registration would not be canceled.
The plaintiffs said that, as a result of the program, a legitimate voter and citizen could have his or her registration canceled simply by checking the wrong box on a DMV form. The plaintiffs presented evidence showing that at least some of those removed were in fact citizens.
A similar lawsuit was filed in Alabama, and a federal judge there last week ordered the state to restore eligibility for more than 3,200 voters who had been deemed ineligible noncitizens. Testimony from state officials in that case showed that roughly 2,000 of the 3,251 voters who were made inactive were actually legally registered citizens.
The appeal filed to the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday by Virginia’s Republican attorney general, Jason Miyares, asks the high court to intervene by Tuesday. Without any intervention, the injunction issued last week by Giles requires Virginia to notify affect voters and local registrars by Wednesday of the restorations she ordered.
Miyares’ filing argues that requiring Virginia to restore the voter registrations of those who have been identified as noncitizens is a “violation of Virginia law and common sense.”
Virginia also argues that requiring these changes less than a week before the presidential election is bound to create confusion, “creating a massive influx of work for its registrars in the critical week before the election, and likely confusing noncitizens into believing that they are eligible to vote.”
The 4th Circuit opinion was written by Toby Heytens, a Biden appointee, and joined by Chief Judge Albert Diaz and Judge Stephanie Thacker, both Obama appointees.
The panel emphasized, as Giles did in her initial ruling, that the state is within its rights to remove noncitizens from the voter rolls, even during the 90-day quiet period, but must do so in an individualized process rather than the systematic process relying on data transfers from the DMV.
Nearly 6 million Virginians are registered to vote.

AP,Investigation finds Rhode Island governor played a role in awarding contract,"Investigation finds Rhode Island governor played a role in awarding contract
PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — A long-running investigation found Tuesday that the Rhode Island governor “personally and directly intervened” in the awarding of a multimillion-dollar state contract but that his actions were not criminal.
The findings of the investigation from the Office of the Attorney General and the Rhode Island State Police focused on the awarding of a consulting contract worth more than $5 million to the ILO Group.
The allegation was that Democratic Gov. Dan McKee steered the federally funded state contract to the company in exchange for a politically connected firm, Chiefs of Change, paying a political affairs firm to provide services to the governor. The report concluded that both allegations were true based on the evidence and “cannot be seriously disputed.”
But the investigation concluded McKee’s actions did not violate the state’s bribery and campaign finance laws.
“Failure to abide by state procurement regulations is not in and of itself a criminal offense,” the report continued. “Likewise, that an official action may have been influenced or informed by personal relationships does not violate state criminal law. At the end of the day, to bring a criminal bribery case this Office needs clear evidence, beyond inferences and suppositions.”
McKee, who refused to be interviewed as part of the investigation, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.
John Marion, the executive director of Common Cause Rhode Island, said his group took issue with the idea that McKee could not be prosecuted under the state’s Code of Ethics.
“No Rhode Islander should feel good about what they read in this report,” Marion said in a statement. “The Governor and every elected official are stewards of the taxpayer’s resources. That is why state contracts should be awarded to vendors who provide the best service to the people of the state, not to the politically connected.”",2024-10-29
AP,Here's what to watch in the final full week of the presidential campaign,"Here’s what to watch in the final full week of the presidential campaign
Here’s what to watch in the final full week of the presidential campaign
NEW YORK (AP) — Uncertainty reigns entering the final full week of the 2024 campaign with Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump locked in a fiercely competitive presidential contest. What happens in the coming days will be pivotal in deciding the winner.
Here’s what we’re watching this week:
Can Trump stay on message (relatively speaking)?
Even before the week began, Trump’s campaign risked being knocked off course by controversy. A rally at New York City’s Madison Square Garden late Sunday that was meant to serve as a closing message was instead overshadowed by racist insults, including a comedian who called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage.”
And with eight days to go until Election Day, history suggests Trump is virtually guaranteed to say or do something else controversial in the final stretch. The only question is whether it will break through.
If there’s one thing we know, it’s that Trump cannot help himself. He’s been using authoritarian-style rhetoric in recent days to suggest that his Democratic opponents, whom he calls “ the enemy within,” are more dangerous to the nation than the threat posed by Russia and China.
Democrats will be combing through every Trump interview and public appearance for something similar to exploit. There are also multiple ongoing criminal investigations into Trump, who has already been convicted of 34 felony charges, that could reveal new information.
Yet Democrats are the first to admit that voter opinions of Trump is so hardened that it would take something truly stunning to change the course of the election.
There is precedent for a final-week stunner, however. Remember, it was Oct. 28, 2016, when former FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to Congress indicating that federal investigators learned of new emails pertinent to the investigation into Hillary Clinton’s use of a private email server.
Will Harris’ closing message harness Democrats’ anxiety?
It would be an understatement to describe Democrats as anxious as Election Day looms. But there was a deliberate effort by Harris’ senior team over the weekend to project optimism to help temper the fear.
Harris senior adviser Jen O’Malley Dillon predicted victory on MSNBC on Sunday: “We are confident we’re going to win this thing,” she said. “We’re seeing extraordinary enthusiasm. This is going to be a close race, and our campaign is exactly where we want to be.”
Harris will try to alleviate Democratic anxiety further on Tuesday when she delivers her “closing argument” at the Ellipse, the same spot near the White House where Trump spoke on Jan. 6, 2021 shortly before his supporters attacked the Capitol.
Harris is expected to focus her remarks on the danger Trump poses to U.S. democracy. She has called her Republican rival “a fascist” in recent days. And she’s been joined by an unlikely ally, Trump’s former chief of staff John Kelly, who has also described Trump as a fascist recently.
But she’s expected to hit broader themes as well, encouraging voters to look behind her at the White House and imagine who will be sitting at the Resolute Desk at a moment of great consequence. She’s aiming to drive home the stakes of the Nov. 5 election for undecided voters — especially moderate Republicans who may be uncomfortable with Trump’s divisive leadership and extreme rhetoric. And while Harris’ team is betting that there is a significant number of moderates who can still be persuaded, progressive Democrats are worried she’s not focused enough on economic issues in the campaign’s closing days.
Democratic anxiety, we have learned, may be a fact of life.

Where will they go?
The candidates’ evolving travel schedules will tell us much about the battlegrounds that will matter most on Election Day.
Here’s what we know for sure: Harris and Trump are aggressively competing in just seven swing states that will ultimately decide the election. They are the three so-called “Blue Wall” states — Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — in addition to Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and North Carolina.
For a political perspective, however, not every one of the seven is created equal.
Harris spent Sunday in Pennsylvania, which may be the election’s biggest prize. Harris is next scheduled to go to Michigan. And after Tuesday’s closing argument in Washington, she plans to visit North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin on Wednesday alone. She heads to Nevada and Arizona on Thursday.
What do we know about Trump’s schedule? He’s booked to host at least one rally every day next week: Monday in Georgia, Tuesday in Pennsylvania, Wednesday in Wisconsin, Thursday in Nevada, Friday in Wisconsin again and Saturday in Virginia.
But as a reminder, these schedules are likely to change based on the campaigns’ intelligence on the ground.
Will the early voting surge continue?
More than 41 million votes have already been cast in the election nationwide. Democrats generally have an advantage in early voting, but so far, at least, Republicans are participating at a much higher rate than they have in the past.
The question: Will it last?
Trump, of course, has for years encouraged his supporters to cast only in-person ballots on Election Day. The practice put the GOP at a significant disadvantage. He largely reversed course in recent months as he and his party acknowledged the obvious benefit of being able to bank their votes as early as possible.
Because of the Republican participation, the early turnout was breaking records last week in swing states such as Georgia and North Carolina.
But with the GOP more focused on “election integrity” rather than a traditional get-out-the-vote operation, it’s unclear whether the uptick in Republican early voting will continue. Democrats hope it won’t.
How hard will Trump work to undermine election results?
History may one day decide that the most significant thing Trump said in the closing days of the 2024 election is the thing that many voters barely notice anymore: his persistent warnings that this election is rigged against him.
Indeed, as Election Day approaches, Trump is increasingly warning his supporters that he will lose on Nov. 5 only if his political opponents cheat. Such statements have no basis in fact. There was no evidence of significant voter fraud in the 2020 election, which Trump lost, and there is no evidence that Trump’s adversaries can or will rig this election against him either.
Still, Trump’s unfounded warnings make an already tense and violent election season even more fraught. And there are real threats that foreign adversaries — especially Russia, China and Iran — will meddle in the election.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee has invested tens of millions of dollars into an operation to mobilize thousands of polling place monitors, poll workers and attorneys to serve as “election integrity” watchdogs. Democrats are worried that the effort could lead to harassment of election workers and undermine trust in the vote.
Both parties are aggressively preparing for long legal battles no matter who wins.
Will wars in the Middle East shift the focus?
U.S. presidential elections are rarely shaped by foreign affairs, but the wars in the Middle East have been escalating at the very moment that millions of voters are preparing to cast ballots.
It’s still unclear how Iran will respond to Israel’s unusually public airstrikes across Iran on Friday but Israel did not target oil or nuclear sites, a sign that a much more serious escalation may have been avoided. In another indication that this conflict may not spiral out of control, the Islamic Republic insisted the strikes caused only “limited damage” and the messaging from Iranian state-run media downplayed the attacks.
If the region spirals further toward all-out regional war or holds steady at an already devastating and destabilizing level of violence could also determine the extent to which the Middle East conflict shapes the U.S. election.
The issue has been especially difficult for Harris to navigate as she simultaneously vows to support Israel and offers empathy for those tens of thousands of Palestinians killed by Israel’s response to Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023 attacks. The Democratic vice president continues to face intense pressure from her party’s progressive base, which has been extremely critical of Israel.",2024-10-28
AP,Liberty University sued by former IT staffer fired after disclosing she's a transgender woman,"Liberty University sued by former IT staffer fired after disclosing she’s a transgender woman
Liberty University sued by former IT staffer fired after disclosing she’s a transgender woman
The bitter nationwide debate over transgender rights is playing out on a very personal level in a federal court lawsuit filed in Virginia by a former Liberty University employee. She was fired by the evangelical Christian school after disclosing her identity as a transgender woman.
The lawsuit on behalf of Ellenor Zinski was filed in July by the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia and the Richmond law firm of Butler Curwood. It alleges that she was fired last year from her job on Liberty’s Information Technology help desk solely because of her gender identify, in violation of the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Earlier this month, the conservative legal organization Liberty Counsel filed a brief on behalf of the university asking the federal district court to dismiss the lawsuit. The brief contends that the Civil Rights Act explicitly permits religious educational institutions to make employment decisions consistent with their religious doctrine — in this case a doctrinal statement asserting that “denial of birth sex by self-identification with a different gender” is sinful.
Liberty University, based in Lynchburg, Virginia, has evolved over its five-decade history into one of the largest Christian universities in the world, with more than 100,000 students enrolled in its residential and online programs. One of its co-founders was the late Jerry Falwell Sr., the prominent televangelist and conservative activist; his son, Jerry Falwell Jr., served as president for 13 years before resigning in 2020 amid a series of personal scandals.
The brief filed by Liberty Counsel alleges that Zinski attempted to “set up” the university, applying for the IT job four months after beginning to take female hormones yet agreeing — when offered the job in February 2023 — to adhere to the school’s statement rejecting transgender transition.
Only after a 90-day probation ended did Zinski notify the university of the gender transition process and then request that the school “depart from its doctrine and mission,” Liberty Counsel said in an effort to get the lawsuit dismissed.
“All of this was done to set Liberty up and attempt to make an example out of the university for standing its ground,” contended Mat Staver, Liberty Counsel’s founder and chairman.
Wyatt Rolla, the ACLU of Virginia’s senior transgender rights attorney, rejected the claim of a set-up.
“It’s strange to disparage Ellenor over what turned out to be real concern with employment discrimination,” they said. “Her intention was to be a highly successful employee for Liberty who continued to meet all of her obligations.”
The trans woman suing Liberty had grown up admiring the university
Zinski, 30, says she was raised as a conservative Christian, attended a Christian high school, and took the job at Liberty hoping the university — which she had admired — would accept her even after learning of her transition. She had received a positive performance review after completing her probation.
“I was really hoping they would work with me ... that I could be myself,” she told The Associated Press. “I was hoping I could advocate for queer people. We need Jesus just as much as anyone else does.”
In her July 2023 letter to the university disclosing her transition, Zinski stressed that her Christian faith “has been a guiding force throughout this process.”
“The public discourse surrounding the transgender community has imbued my journey with a certain degree of trepidation,” she wrote. “However, I am hopeful that with your support and understanding, we can navigate this process with sensitivity and respect for all parties involved.”
Zinski received no immediate response to her letter, leading to what she described as intense anxiety.
After four weeks, she inquired about the status of her case and was promptly summoned to a meeting with Liberty human resources officials to be informed she was being fired. A lengthy email explaining the rational for the firing was read aloud to her at the meeting.
“Active and unrepentant patterns of sin, including sinful behaviors regarding sexual expression and/or gender expression, would be incompatible with our Christian workplace,” the email said.
What lies ahead for Ellenor Zinski — and her lawsuit?
Within a few months of her firing, Zinski was able to obtain a similar IT help-desk job at the University of Lynchburg, a small, private university. It is affiliated with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), a mainline Protestant denomination, and describes spiritual life on campus as “inclusive and open.”
“A lot of people at work have my back,” Zinski said.
She has also found support as an active member of Lynchburg’s Trinity Episcopal Church. It was at Trinity, she says, that she was first assured that “God made me this way.”
The next formal step in the case will be the filing of a brief by the ACLU of Virginia opposing Liberty Counsel’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit.
Daniel Schmid, a Liberty Counsel lawyer working on this case, said there would likely be a hearing — and perhaps a decision — on the motion to dismiss before the end of this year. Yet the case could linger far beyond that, he said, if there are appeals eventually leading to the U.S. Supreme Court.
In a phone interview with the AP, Schmid alluded to the so-called “ministerial exception” — which gives religious institutions protection against anti-discrimination lawsuits related to jobs with ministerial functions.
Even with IT staff and janitors, Schmid said, “Liberty considers them to be ministers of the Gospel. The First Amendment protects their right to make that call.”
The lawsuit seeks compensatory and punitive damages of $300,000 on behalf of Zinski, as well as a declaration that the university’s handling of the case violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.
Zinski told the AP she has no desire to return to work at Liberty, at least under its current leadership.
“My biggest fear if I ever went back is knowing there are people who do not want me there at all,” she said. “I would not feel comfortable enough to work there.”

How will abortion laws motivate women in North Carolina to vote in this election?
WASHINGTON (AP) — The latest in an Associated Press series examining what’s motivating voters in battleground states looks at how state abortion bans that have transpired since 2022 will influence the way women vote in North Carolina.
Two years after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, tensions over abortion have only intensified, setting the presidential election up as a referendum on fundamental rights for tens of millions of women.
Flanked by southern states where abortion is nearly outlawed, North Carolina has a more moderate 12-week ban in place after the Supreme Court overturned nationwide abortion rights. The state has also dealt with a deluge of women who are seeking abortions that they cannot get in states like Florida, Georgia and South Carolina.
Still, Democrats are betting that abortion will be the winning issue that motivates white women voters to cast a ballot for Vice President Kamala Harris, bucking the years of support that former President Donald Trump enjoyed from those voters. If Harris has any chance of winning the state’s 16 electoral votes, she’ll need to draw from the 60% of white women voters who backed Trump in the 2020 election, according to AP VoteCast data.
Here are highlights from AP’s report:
Young women are most motivated to vote over abortion
Young women, like 26-year-old Christy Kishbaugh, are seeing horror stories on social media of women who’ve been turned away from emergency rooms after trying to get care for miscarriages or failing pregnancies. But state abortion bans prevented doctors from helping them.
That sticks with Kishbaugh, a married suburbanite, as she thinks about voting in this election. She’ll cast a ballot for Harris, in part because she’s worried about how she and others would be treated if they ever experience a pregnancy emergency.
“Thinking ahead, if anything were to go wrong,” Kishbaugh nearly whispered, iced coffee in hand. “The idea that myself, my friends, people close to me, that they could potentially die or never have kids or lose a child because they’re not getting access to the health care they need, that really dwells with me.”
The Supreme Court’s ruling that left the states to decide abortion rights has far from settled the issue, with legislatures passing a range of restrictions that face ongoing legal changes. And it has pushed a new crop of North Carolina voters — 10% of them in 2022 — to name abortion as their highest priority, according to AP VoteCast data. In 2020, only 3% of the state’s voters named it a top issue, and most of them backed Trump.
Jenny Gonzalez is one of those voters. The 21-year-old is already signed up to vote in her first election and it was abortion that motivated her.
“It should be access to all women, no matter the situation, because everyone goes through different things and you don’t know why they decide to get the abortion,” Gonzalez, a college student who is studying pharmacy technology, said.
But now, Democrats say, the tide has turned. In this election, they are targeting young women under the age of 35 in particular on the issue, said Morgan Jackson, an adviser for Democratic candidate Josh Stein’s campaign. And they’re running stark ads, warning that women could lose access if they vote for Republicans, including candidate for governor Mark Robinson, who has promised to outlaw “abortion in North Carolina for any reason.”
“Republicans have set off their hand grenade in their own hands,” Jackson said. “They thought you were with them all the way. It’s way more complicated than that.”

Not so fast, Republicans say
The issue isn’t as pressing for voters in North Carolina, which does not have the draconian bans that some other southern states have implemented, said Republican state senator Vickie Sawyer.
Sawyer considers what she hears from her own young adult daughters. Abortion comes up, she said, but not as much as worries about the cost of housing or everyday items.
“It’s right in the wheelhouse of something that could affect them,” Sawyer said. But she said “they know their rights are protected” because the state’s 12-week abortion ban allows for some exceptions in the second trimester.
Instead, Republicans think the inflated prices of everyday goods, housing and gas is a more pressing issue in the minds of voters.
Leyla Herrera, a 20-year-old Wake Forest University student, agrees. She’s considering a vote for Trump in her first presidential election. The biology student, who doesn’t ascribe to a party, says inflated prices have been tough on her middle class family, based in a Charlotte suburb.
“Donald Trump, when he was in office, there was better prices, especially for gas. Food is a really big thing, all of that has really gone up,” she said.
Older women care about the abortion issue less
Older women — even Democrats — see abortion as more of a peripheral issue compared to younger women.
To Donna Klein, an 80-year-old retiree, women’s rights are “important,” but the environment is her top concern, a worry only punctuated by the hurricane destruction.
“It’s very important we try to figure out what’s going on, what we can do it about it,” Klein said. “As an older person, as I think about my grandkids. What kind of earth are they going to inherit?”
Abortion may resonate deepest with younger women, but they’re also a historically unreliable voting bloc, said Linda L. Petrou, a longtime Forsyth County Republican and district chair.
“There might be more women — younger women — coming out and voting for Harris because of that,” Petrou acknowledged. But, she added, “the percentage of young people vote is relatively small.”
Nationally, 4 in 10 women under 30 years old say abortion is their top issue, according to a poll released this month by KFF, a health policy research organization.
Laura Browne, a 45-year-old retired Air Force staff sergeant and mother of two daughters, believes Democrats are using stories about denied medical care to scare young women. Browne works for an anti-abortion center that counsels pregnant women. Some days, she stands outside of a Planned Parenthood clinic, hoping to talk women out of having an abortion.
“I believe they’re being told there’s only one option, and that they’re too young to have children,” said Browne, who lives in Fayetteville, North Carolina. “And I would say that that is wrong.”

Scientists recreate the head of this ancient 9-foot-long bug
WASHINGTON (AP) — As if the largest bug to ever live – a monster nearly 9 feet long with several dozen legs – wasn’t terrifying enough, scientists could only just imagine what the extinct beast’s head looked like.
That’s because many of the fossils of these creatures are headless shells that were left behind when they molted, squirming out of their exoskeletons through the head opening as they grew ever bigger — up to 8 to 9 feet (2.6 meters) and more than 100 pounds (50 kilograms).
Now, scientists have produced a mug shot after studying fossils of juveniles that were complete and very well preserved, if not quite cute.
The giant bug’s topper was a round bulb with two short bell-shaped antennae, two protruding eyes like a crab, and a rather small mouth adapted for grinding leaves and bark, according to new research published Wednesday in Science Advances.
Called Arthropleura, these were arthropods -- the group that includes crabs, spiders and insects – with features of modern-day centipedes and millipedes. But some of them were much, much bigger, and this one was a surprising mix.
“We discovered that it had the body of a millipede, but head of a centipede,” said study co-author and paleobiologist Mickael Lheritier at the University Claude Bernard Lyon in Villeurbanne, France.
The largest Arthropleura may have been the biggest bugs to ever live, although there is still a debate. They may be a close second to an extinct giant sea scorpion.
This story is featured in our One Notable Number series, which spotlights the key numbers leading our coverage.

Researchers in Europe and North America have been collecting fragments and footprints of the huge bugs since the late 1800s.
“We have been wanting to see what the head of this animal looked like for a really long time,” said James Lamsdell, a paleobiologist at West Virginia University, who was not involved in the study.
To produce a model of the head, researchers first used CT scans to study fossil specimens of fully intact juveniles embedded in rocks found in a French coal field in the 1980s.
This technique allowed the researchers to scrutinize “hidden details like bits of the head that are still embedded in the rock” without marring the fossil, Lamsdell said.
“When you chip away at rock, you don’t know what part of a delicate fossil may have been lost or damaged,” he said.
The juvenile fossil specimens only measured about 2 inches (6 centimeters) and it’s possible they were a type of Arthropleura that didn’t grow to enormous sizes. But even if so, the researchers said they are close enough kin to provide a glimpse of what adults looked like – whether giant or of a less nightmarish size -- when they were alive 300 million years ago.

AP,"As New York's Democratic mayor deflects questions about Trump, some see act of self-preservation","As New York’s Democratic mayor deflects questions about Trump, some see act of self-preservation
NEW YORK (AP) — With days to go until the presidential election, the top Democratic official in one of the most liberal cities in America might be expected to spend his time heaping criticism on the Republican candidate, Donald Trump.
But that’s not the approach being taken by New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who is facing a federal corruption indictment. At a news conference Tuesday, Adams deflected more than a dozen questions about Trump and his policies.
He declined to say whether he would oppose Trump’s plan to launch the largest mass deportation operation in American history, dismissing the removal plan as “hypothetical.”
AP AUDIO: As New York’s Democratic mayor deflects questions about Trump, some see act of self-preservation
AP correspondent Julie Walker reports New York City’s Mayor, under federal indictment, avoids criticizing Donald Trump following his Madison Square Garden rally.
He also passed up an opportunity to criticize Trump over recent false statements the Republican had made about a group of wrongfully convicted New Yorkers known as the Central Park Five, deferring questions to their lawyers. And he declined to say when he had last spoken to Trump.
Instead, Adams directed ire toward his own party, arguing that it was insulting to ask whether Trump was a fascist and urging leaders to “turn down the rhetoric” ahead of the election.
“With all that’s going on to everyday New Yorkers, we’re asking questions, ‘Is someone a fascist?’ or ‘Is someone a Hitler?’” Adams said. “That’s insulting to me.”
The comments marked the latest defenses of Trump by Adams, a centrist Democrat whose longstanding grievances with his own party have ramped up since he was indicted last month on federal corruption charges. He has since suggested, without providing evidence, that he was targeted by U.S. prosecutors over his criticism of President Joe Biden’s immigration policies.
If he were to win the White House, Trump could potentially halt the corruption case against Adams or grant the mayor a pardon.
At Tuesday’s press briefing, Adams would not comment on whether he was angling for a possible pardon in the event of a conviction.
Asked who he planned to vote for in the presidential election, Adams referred obliquely to a past endorsement and said he hadn’t changed his mind. But he never said Kamala Harris’s name.
“I’m not going to do an annual endorsement refresher,” Adams said.
But it was his refusal to denounce Trump’s deportation plans that stirred the most anger on Tuesday. Asked directly if he would support or oppose the plan — which Trump has said will be a “bloody story” — Adams said he would not be “entertaining any hypotheticals.”
Some of Adams’ likely opponents in June’s Democratic mayoral primary quickly seized on the comments as proof of an alliance with the Trump administration.
“It’s now clear the mayor believes his political future is tied to the former president’s and he is willing to betray the fundamental values of our city to cozy up to a fascist,” said Zohran Mamdani, a Queens assembly member who is running against Adams in next year’s mayoral primary. “It’s reckless, unacceptable, and wrong.”
Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, who would become mayor if Adams were to resign or be removed, called the comments “disgraceful,” adding that Adams “believes in what Trump is saying to the point that he can’t denounce anything the man has said.”
Trump, meanwhile, has praised Adams, thanking him at his rally at Madison Square Garden on Sunday. “Mayor Adams has been treated very badly,” Trump said, adding, “I have to tell you he’s been really great.”

On Tuesday, Adams said that some of the speakers at the rally had made “inappropriate” comments, but added: “You can’t demonize an entire population based on the actions of those who attend.”
Asked whether he disagreed with any of Trump’s statements, Adams responded tersely: “Next question.”",2024-10-29
AP,On a screen near you: Officials are livestreaming the election process for more transparency,"On a screen near you: Officials are livestreaming the election process for more transparency
Rows of folding tables and empty chairs appear on Ballot Processing View 2. Over on Tabulation View 2, a man in a black T-shirt and shorts is seen shuffling papers near a waist-high machine.
The livestream scenes from Maricopa County, Arizona, of the 2024 election process may not be the most riveting video. But the feeds, already online, and other live videos like it streaming from election sites across the country have a serious aim. They are an effort by election officials to demystify voting and provide greater transparency to a process that in recent years has been subject to intense scrutiny, misinformation and false claims of widespread fraud.
The increase in livestreaming the election process, an operation conducted by local governments nationwide, reflects a broader rise in video streams online, according to Wendy Underhill, election and redistricting director at the National Conference of State Legislatures.
There is a concern, however, among officials that people unfamiliar with what’s happening in a livestream could misunderstand what they’re watching and reach misleading conclusions.
Here is a closer look at who is streaming elections and what you might see if you tune in.
Which states livestream elections?
National elections are run at the local level. There’s not a uniform standard or rule requiring live video feeds, but several jurisdictions, including large ones and those in battleground states, run livestreams. Among them are Philadelphia, Los Angeles County and Washington’s King County.
Arizona is an outlier because it has a state law requiring its counties to livestream the elections process, Underhill said.
If you want to understand more about whether your local government is providing a livestream, get involved by contacting them, said Tammy Patrick, chief program officer for the National Association of Elections Officials and a former Maricopa County elections official.
What can I expect if I watch?
That will vary by location. For example, Arizona offers various views of different parts of the process, from ballot drop boxes to tabulation rooms.
Other places, like Philadelphia, haven’t begun streaming yet. The city is set to begin streaming on Election Day, Nov. 5., at 7 a.m. EST.
One thing the streams will likely have in common is that the election processes they show can be slow-moving — the kind of methodical material that few would consider must-see TV.
People should be patient as officials deal with an array of circumstances, including having to drive ballots from polling places to processing centers, said Jennifer Morrell, CEO and co-founder of The Elections Group. It’s made up of former state and local election officials who offer training and other support to officials across the country.
In part because of technology, people are used to many things happening almost automatically, she said, but there are just the “logistical realities” that could make the process take longer. She warned against viewers making assumptions based on something they see on a livestream or a single moment in the vote-counting process, noting that leads can shift and a candidate who may be winning at one point in the count could be losing hours later.
That isn’t an indication of fraud. “I would just really emphasize that people have to be patient,” she said.

How do I know what I’m seeing?
That’s perhaps the biggest question and a potential hurdle to transparency, Patrick said.
Officials have learned since 2020, when livestreaming grew in popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic, that voters might not know or understand what they’re watching on a screen, she said.
“The more transparent we can be, the better off it is,” Patrick said. “When you are transparent, it does not mean that individuals will necessarily know what they’re seeing or understand what they’re seeing.”
It could provide fodder for someone to take something out of context. In part to address that, some places have begun adding signs to explain what elections workers are doing, so viewers have a better idea of what’s happening on screen, Patrick said.
A solution, Patrick suggested, is to get involved: Contact local and state officials, sign up for tours, ask to be a poll worker.
“There are plenty of roles where you can educate yourself on all the safeguards that are in place to protect the system, to make sure that it’s eligible voters that are participating,” she said. “And that’s, quite frankly, I think the best way to get involved. But you have to be willing to accept the facts and the truth.”

AP,"Florida has nearly all ballots counted on Election Day, while California can take weeks. This is why","Florida has nearly all ballots counted on Election Day, while California can take weeks. This is why
Florida has nearly all ballots counted on Election Day, while California can take weeks. This is why
WASHINGTON (AP) — In the 2020 presidential election, Florida reported the results within a few hours of poll close of more than 99% of ballots cast.
In California, almost one-third of ballots were uncounted after election night. The state was making almost daily updates to its count through Dec. 3, a full month after Election Day.
This wasn’t unusual or unexpected.
California, the nation’s most populous state, is consistently among the slowest to report all its election results. Florida, the third-most populous state, is generally among the first to finish.
The Constitution sets out broad principles for electing a national government and leaves the details to the states. The choices made by state lawmakers and election officials as they sort out those details affect everything from how voters cast a ballot, how quickly the tabulation and release of results takes place, how elections are kept secure and how officials maintain voters’ confidence in the process.
The gap between when California and Florida are able to finalize their count is the natural result of election officials in the two states choosing to emphasize different concerns and set different priorities.
How California counts
Lawmakers in California designed their elections to improve accessibility and increase turnout. Whether it’s automatically receiving a ballot at home, having up until Election Day to turn it in or having several days to address any problems that may arise with their ballot, Californians have a lot of time and opportunity to vote. It comes at the expense of knowing the final vote counts soon after polls close.
“Our priority is trying to maximize participation of actively registered voters,” said Democratic Assemblymember Marc Berman, who authored the 2021 bill that permanently switched the state to all-mail elections. “What that means is things are a little slower. But in a society that wants immediate gratification, I think our democracy is worth taking a little time to get it right and to create a system where everyone can participate.”
California, which has long had a culture of voting absentee, started moving toward all-mail elections last decade. All-mail systems will almost always prolong the count. Mail ballots require additional verification steps — each must be opened individually, validated and processed — so they can take longer to tabulate than ballots cast in person that are then fed into a scanner at a neighborhood polling place.
In 2016, California passed a bill allowing counties to opt in to all-mail elections before instituting it statewide on a temporary basis in 2020 and enshrining it in law in time for the 2022 elections.
Studies found that the earliest states to institute all-mail elections – Oregon and Washington – saw higher turnout. Mail ballots also increase the likelihood of a voter casting a complete ballot, according to Melissa Michelson, a political scientist and dean at California’s Menlo College who has written on voter mobilization.
In recent years, the thousands of California voters who drop off their mail ballots on Election Day created a bottleneck on election night. In the past five general elections, California has tabulated an average of 38% of its vote after Election Day. Two years ago, in the 2022 midterm elections, half the state’s votes were counted after Election Day.
Slower counts have come alongside later mail ballot deadlines. In 2015, California implemented its first postmark deadline, meaning that the state can count mail ballots that arrive after Election Day as long as the Postal Service receives the ballot by Election Day. Berman said the postmark deadline allows the state to treat the mailbox as a drop box in order to avoid punishing voters who cast their ballots properly but are affected by postal delays.

Initially, the law said ballots that arrived within three days of the election would be considered cast in time. This year, ballots may arrive up to a week after Election Day, so California won’t know how many ballots have been cast until Nov. 12. This deadline means that California will be counting ballots at least through that week because ballots arriving up to that point might still be valid and be added to the count.
How Florida counts
Florida’s election system is geared toward quick and efficient tabulation. Coming out of its disastrous 2000 presidential election, when the U.S. Supreme Court settled a recount dispute and George W. Bush was declared the winner in the state over Al Gore, the state moved to standardize its election systems and clean up its canvass, or the process of confirming votes cast and counted.
Republican Rep. Bill Posey, who as state senator was the sponsor of the Florida Election Reform Act of 2001, said the two goals of the law — to count all legal votes and to ensure voters are confident their votes are counted — were accomplished by mandating optical ballot scanners in every precinct. That “most significant” change means no more “hanging chads” in Florida. The scanners read and aggregate results from paper ballots, immediately spitting back any that contain mistakes.
Florida’s deadlines are set to avoid having ballots arrive any later than when officials press “go” on the tabulator machines. The state has a receipt deadline for its absentee ballots, which means ballots that do not arrive by 7 p.m. local time on Election Day are not counted, regardless of when they were mailed.
Michael T. Morley, a professor of election law at Florida State University College of Law, pointed out that Florida election officials may begin processing ballots, but not actually count them, before polls close. That helps speed up the process, especially compared with states that don’t allow officials to process mail ballots before Election Day.
“They can determine the validity of ballots, confirm they should be counted and run them through machines,” Morley said. “They just can’t press the tally button.”
Florida takes steps to avoid a protracted back-and-forth on potentially problematic ballots. At the precinct, optical scanners catch some problems, such as a voter selecting too many candidates, that can be fixed on-site. Also, any voter who’s returned a mail ballot with a mismatched or missing signature has until 5 p.m. two days after the election to submit an affidavit fixing it. California gives voters up to four weeks after the election to address such inconsistencies.

Newspaper non-endorsements at Washington Post, LA Times fit a trend, but their readers aren’t happy
The number of newspapers endorsing a candidate for president has dwindled with the industry’s financial troubles the past two decades, in part because owners reason that it makes no sense to alienate some subscribers by taking a clear stand in a politically polarizing time.
Yet in the past week, The Washington Post and Los Angeles Times have angered readers for precisely the opposite reason: by choosing not to select a favored candidate.
The fallout from both decisions continued Monday, with Post owner Jeff Bezos taking the unusual step of publicly defending the move in the columns of his own paper. Three members of the Post’s editorial board resigned their positions and some journalists pleaded with readers to not express their disapproval by canceling subscriptions. Many thousands have already done so.
Bezos, in a note to readers, said it was a principled stand to ditch endorsements. People essentially don’t care and see it as a sign of bias, he said. His comments appeared hours after NPR reported that more than 200,000 people had canceled their Washington Post subscriptions.
If NPR’s report is true, that would be a startling blow to an outlet that lost money and shed staff despite having more than 2.5 million subscribers last year. A Post spokeswoman would not comment on the report.
Subscribers are falling away in recent days
The Times has acknowledged losing thousands of subscribers due to its own decision.
Both newspapers had reportedly prepared editorials supporting Democrat Kamala Harris. Instead, at the behest of Bezos and Patrick Soon-Shiong at the Times, they decided not to endorse. Post publisher Will Lewis called it “a statement in support of our readers’ ability to make up their own minds.”
By announcing their decisions within two weeks of Election Day, however, the newspapers left themselves vulnerable to criticism that their publishers were trying not to anger Republican Donald Trump if voters returned him to power. “It looked like they were not making a principled decision,” said John Woolley, co-director of the American Presidency Project at the University of California-Santa Barbara.
Retired Post editor Martin Baron, on social media, said the decision showed “disturbing spinelessness at an institution famed for courage” and that Trump would see it as a further invitation to intimidate Bezos.
Endorsements have a long history
Back in the 1800s, newspapers were sharply partisan in both their news pages and editorials. Even when a trend toward unbiased news reports took hold in the 1900s, editorial pages remained opinionated and the two functions were kept separate.
As recently as 2008, 92 of the nation’s 100 largest newspapers endorsed either Democrat Barack Obama or Republican John McCain for president. But by 2020, only 54 made a choice between Trump and Joe Biden, according to the presidency project. Figuring there were even fewer this year, Woolley said they aren’t even planning to count.
The Tampa Bay Times told its readers this week that it was concentrating its editorial endorsements on local races where it can be more helpful. “We cannot think of a single reader who has told the editorial board over the past election cycle that they needed our help deciding on how to vote for president. Not one,” the paper wrote in an unsigned story.
Studies found readers paid endorsements little heed and, in a digital world, many didn’t understand the distinction between straight news stories and advocacy-driven editorials. In many cases, chain ownership took the decision out of the hands of local editors. At a time the news business is struggling, they didn’t want to give any readers an excuse to leave.

“They really don’t want to rattle or piss off the people who are not going to like their endorsement,” said Rick Edmonds, media business analyst at the Poynter Institute, a journalism think tank. “The solution is just not to do them.”
That hasn’t seemed to fly at newspapers in two large metropolitan areas with liberal populations. The Post, under Baron’s leadership during the Trump administration, saw its circulation spike with aggressive political coverage that frequently angered the former president.
The Post’s decision drew ire from many quarters
Besides Baron, the decision was denounced by Watergate era reporting legends Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein. Columnists Robert Kagan and Michele Norris said they were quitting the newspaper in protest. Three of the nine members of the Post’s editorial board said they were leaving that role.
Out West, a Los Angeles Times editorial writer, Karin Klein, wrote in the Hollywood Reporter that she was quitting the newspaper. Klein said that while Soon-Shiong had the right to impose his will on editorial policy, by making the non-endorsement so late in the campaign he was effectively expressing the opposite of the neutrality he claimed to seek.
Indeed, timing was the one regret Bezos expressed. “I wish we had made the change earlier than we did, in a moment further from the election and the emotions around it,” he wrote. “That was inadequate planning, and not some intentional strategy.”
In an article about the continuing fallout on the Post’s website Monday, more than 2,000 people left comments, many of them saying they were leaving. Even former GOP congresswoman Liz Cheney said she was canceling.
“From what I’ve seen in recent days, the paper is hearing its subscribers very clearly,” Post media critic Erik Wemple said during an online chat Monday.
There are worries that journalists will be the ones hurt
The protests have left some journalists alarmed, worried that they and their colleagues would only be hurt in the end. The union representing Los Angeles Times workers issued a statement last week that “before you hit that ‘cancel’ button,” recognize that subscriptions help underwrite the salaries of hundreds of journalists.
“The more cancellations there are, the more jobs will be lost, and the less good journalism there will be,” Post columnist Dana Milbank wrote.
It would be better, one commenter on the newspaper’s website said on Monday, to boycott Amazon — founded by Bezos — than the Washington Post.
Milbank said he was angered by the decision, too. He helped organize a protest letter that some of the paper’s columnists signed. But he noted that, except for the endorsement decision, he’s seen no evidence of Bezos interfering in the Post’s editorial operations.
“For the past nine years, I’ve been labeling Trump a racist and a fascist, adding more evidence each week — and not once have I been stifled,” he wrote. “I’ve never even met nor spoke to Bezos.”
The owner said as much in his column. “I challenge you to find one instance in those 11 years where I have prevailed upon anyone at the Post in favor of my own interests,” he wrote. “It hasn’t happened.”
Some newspapers are bucking the trend of non-endorsements. The Oregonian, for example, reversed its decision not to endorse after staying neutral in 2012 and 2016. “We heard the community’s disappointment over our non-endorsements loud and clear,” editor Therese Bottomly wrote in response to a question by Poynter’s Edmonds.
In Cleveland, Plain Dealer Editor Chris Quinn polled his editorial board about whether to make a presidential endorsement. “We don’t delude ourselves about our presidential endorsement impacting voters,” Quinn wrote. “If we are not going to impact voters, why publish something that will anger half our audience?”
He cast the deciding vote. The Plain Dealer endorsed Harris. Quinn had raised the question via text to some of his readers. They felt a non-endorsement would be a betrayal, he wrote — an act of cowardice.
“That was enough for me,” Quinn wrote. “Our duty is to the readers.”

Colorado congressional candidates in up-for-grabs district walk the line on border security
DENVER (AP) — The stage at a recent rally for presidential candidate Donald Trump in Colorado was designed with a pointed message in mind: poster-sized mugshots of Hispanic men in prison-orange loomed from the stage as speaker after speaker preceding Trump stoked fear over violent crimes they associated with illegal immigration.
“These illegal aliens, they do deserve one thing,” shouted Colorado Rep. Lauren Boebert to raucous applause. “They deserve a one-way ticket home!”
A glaring exception in the lineup was Gabe Evans, a Republican running in Colorado’s 8th Congressional District. Evans said Democrats “opened our borders” but left any direct mention of immigration at that, bypassing the easy applause lines.
As Evans tries to win a district that’s nearly 40% Latino and could be pivotal in determining which party controls Congress, he’s balancing the need to sound tough on immigration without tipping into menacing language.
Evans’ rhetorical tiptoeing — which took place before a rally at Madison Square Garden on Sunday that was laced with racist rhetoric from multiple speakers supporting Trump — has been matched with similar caution by Rep. Yadira Caraveo, the incumbent Democrat defending the seat. The 43-year-old pediatrician has taken a stronger stance on border security at a time when views on immigration are increasingly nuanced, including among Latinos.
The caution from the two candidates, both Hispanic, makes the 8th District something of a testing ground for efforts by both sides to appeal to Latino voters. In places like this, the candidates walk a line between the pitfalls of overheated rhetoric and the perils of seeming lax on border security.
“In an electorate that by many other measures is very polarized — people have chosen their corners and it’s all a game of inches,” said Carlos Odio, co-founder of the Latino-focused polling group, Equis. “There is just a big portion of the Latino electorate that remains swingy. The risk would be not competing for it.”
A nuanced appeal
At the center of both candidates’ outreach is a recognition that Latino voters aren’t a monolith and can’t be waved away as invariably blue votes. While polling has shown them to be more supportive of Democrats overall, Trump made gains among Hispanic voters, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of surveys of validated voters conducted in 2016 and 2020.
The “why” of all that has induced fervent debates among pundits and strategists, especially given the sometimes demeaning rhetoric used by Trump and some Republicans. If those arguments are ever settled, it won’t be by Nov. 5.
What has crystallized this year is an urgency among Democrats to retain voters who’ve long helped deliver them victories, and a sense among Republicans that there could be a real opportunity here.
The delicate drama played out vividly at a recent 8th District debate when moderator Kyle Clark asked Evans, an Army veteran and former police officer, what he thinks when “Trump says that immigrants are poisoning the blood of our country.”
“I’ve always condemned any sort of racist statements,” said Evans, who was endorsed by Trump.

“I’ve always condemned racist statements,” Evans repeated.
Asked whether he supported Trump’s mass deportation proposal for all immigrants in the U.S. illegally, including using the National Guard to do so, Evans sidestepped again.
He gave more direct answers in an interview, rejecting the use of the National Guard to round up immigrants.
“I was in the National Guard,” he said. “No. There’s so many different issues associated with doing that.”
The debate moderator turned to Caraveo, citing her previous call to divest from border enforcement agencies and asking if she would still vote to do so.
“My constituents do not believe that, and so I would vote against that,” said Caraveo.
“Is it still your position?” asked Clark.
“My job is to represent the 8th Congressional District,” Caraveo said with a sidestep of her own.
In an interview, Caraveo gave another reason for her middle-ground approach: “People are upset that they’ve been here for 30 or 40 years and they haven’t had the ability to legalize their status. And they think, you know, they see it as people jumping ahead of them in line.”
A new approach
Caraveo and Evans are clear-eyed that some Latino voters still need convincing.
“I think that this has been a very good and very important wake-up call to say, ‘You can’t just talk to us about immigration,’” said Caraveo, who narrowly defeated Republican Barbara Kirkmeyer in 2022. “‘You can’t just take us for granted as being a blue vote for you. You have to include us in all of the decision-making processes.’”
When Evans showed up to a Hispanic forum in Denver recently, someone told him he was the first Republican who’d ever attended. “And I said, ‘That’s a crying shame,’ because that’s the work that we need to be doing.”
Evans says Latino voters were sold false hope.
“It’s that level of disconnect from the Democrat Party that’s starting to drive this shift in the Hispanic community,” he said. “They’re not able to get the American prosperity. They’re not able to get generational wealth. They’re not able to pass on a better quality of life to their kids.”
Voters are listening
Caraveo’s balancing act plays well with Tanya Trujillo-Martinez, 47, a Democrat who says representing the district’s voters is “truly what her job is, it’s not to go with her party.”
“For so long we’ve heard the rhetoric and ‘We want to hear your voice, bring your voice to the table,’” said Trujillo-Martinez, who attended a Latino forum in Greeley recently. “But as soon as we got to the table, the amplifier was shut off.”
Trump, she said, went wrong in “not engaging Latinos with respect, but engaging them as a tool.” She took note, for example, when he recently referred to popular male Latin singer Nicky Jam as “she.”
Evans’ rhetoric has landed with some Latino voters, too.
Desiree Serna, 33, a Latina whose family has been in the U.S. for many generations, said at a voter registration picnic that she cast a ballot for Trump in 2016 and 2020, and will likely support him again in 2024 after years of mostly backing Democrats.
“It almost, like, it feels like a betrayal, but at the same time (Trump) knows what he wants and how he wants to do it,” said Serna.
And yet there’s ambivalence there. She described Trump’s allegations, offered without evidence, that Haitian immigrants in Ohio were eating pets as “very ignorant,” and doesn’t support his proposal to oust everyone in the U.S. illegally — though she would like to see much stricter border security.
Serna was sitting with her husband, Juan Hernandez, who remains undecided in the presidential race. He asked Evans about rising homelessness.
Evans linked the issue to drug use, which he connected to Democratic policies that he said hamstrung Colorado police officers. “I couldn’t call immigration customs and say, ‘Come get your drug dealer.’”
“What if that person was white?” asked Hernandez, a 32-year-old construction worker.
Evans pivoted slightly, saying that Democratic policies impede law enforcement’s ability to stop crime regardless of immigration status..
Hernandez nodded. Evans, he said, would get his vote.

AP,"Yes, voter fraud happens. But it's rare and election offices have safeguards to catch it","Yes, voter fraud happens. But it’s rare and election offices have safeguards to catch it
Yes, voter fraud happens. But it’s rare and election offices have safeguards to catch it
NEW YORK (AP) — You’ve heard the horror stories: Someone casting multiple ballots, people voting in the name of dead relatives, mail-in ballots being intercepted.
Voter fraud does happen occasionally. When it does, we tend to hear a lot about it. It also gets caught and prosecuted.
The nation’s multilayered election processes provide many safeguards that keep voter fraud generally detectable and rare, according to current and former election administrators of both parties.
America’s elections are decentralized, with thousands of independent voting jurisdictions. That makes it virtually impossible to pull off a large-scale vote-rigging operation that could tip a presidential race — or most any other race.
“You’re probably not going to have a perfect election system,” said Republican Trey Grayson, a former Kentucky secretary of state and the advisory board chair of the Secure Elections Project. “But if you’re looking for one that you should have confidence in, you should feel good about that here in America.”
What’s stopping people from committing voter fraud?
Voting more than once, tampering with ballots, lying about your residence to vote somewhere else or casting someone else’s ballot are crimes that can be punished with hefty fines and prison time. Non-U.S. citizens who break election laws can be deported.
For anyone still motivated to cheat, election systems in the United States are designed with multiple layers of protection and transparency intended to stand in the way.
For in-person voting, most states either require or request voters provide some sort of ID at the polls. Others require voters to verify who they are in another way, such as stating their name and address, signing a poll book or signing an affidavit.
People who try to vote in the name of a recently deceased friend or family member can be caught when election officials update voter lists with death records and obituaries, said Gail Pellerin, a Democratic in the California Assembly who ran elections in Santa Cruz County for more than 27 years.
Those who try to impersonate someone else run the risk that someone at the polls knows that person or that the person will later try to cast their own ballot, she said.
What protections exist for absentee voting?
For absentee voting, different states have different ballot verification protocols. All states require a voter’s signature. Many states have further precautions, such as having bipartisan teams compare the signature with other signatures on file, requiring the signature to be notarized or requiring a witness to sign.
That means even if a ballot is erroneously sent to someone’s past address and the current resident mails it in, there are checks to alert election workers to the foul play.
A growing number of states offer online or text-based ballot tracking tools as an extra layer of protection, allowing voters to see when their ballot has been sent out, returned and counted.
Federal law requires voter list maintenance, and election officials do that through a variety of methods, from checking state and federal databases to collaborating with other states to track voters who have moved.
Ballot drop boxes have security protocols, too, said Tammy Patrick, chief executive officer for programs at the National Association of Election Officials.
She explained the boxes are often designed to stop hands from stealing ballots and are surveilled by camera, bolted to the ground and constructed with fire-retardant chambers, so if someone threw in a lit match, it wouldn’t destroy the ballots inside.

Sometimes, alleged voter fraud isn’t what it seems
After the 2020 election, social media surged with claims of dead people casting ballots, double voting or destroyed piles of ballots on the side of the road.
Former President Donald Trump promoted and has continued to amplify these claims. But the vast majority of them were found to be untrue.
An Associated Press investigation that explored every potential case of voter fraud in the six battleground states disputed by Trump found there were fewer than 475 out of millions of votes cast. That was not nearly enough to tip the outcome. Democrat Joe Biden won the six states by a combined 311,257 votes.
The review also showed no collusion intended to rig the voting. Virtually every case was based on an individual acting alone to cast additional ballots. In one case, a man mistakenly thought he could vote while on parole. In another, a woman was suspected of sending in a ballot for her dead mother.
Former election officials say that even more often, allegations of voter fraud turn out to result from a clerical error or a misunderstanding.
Pellerin said she remembered when a political candidate in her county raised suspicion about many people being registered to vote at the same address. It turned out the voters were nuns who all lived in the same home.
Patrick said that when she worked in elections in Maricopa County, Arizona, mismatched signatures were sometimes explained by a broken arm or a recent stroke. In other cases, an elderly person tried to vote twice because they forgot they had already submitted a mail ballot.
“You really have to think about the intent of the voter,” Patrick said. “It isn’t always intuitive.”
Why voter fraud is unlikely to affect the presidential race
It would be wrong to suggest that voter fraud never happens.
With millions of votes cast in an election year, it’s almost guaranteed there will be a few cases of someone trying to game the system. There also have been more insidious efforts, such as a vote-buying scheme in 2006 in Kentucky.
In that case, Grayson said, voters complained and an investigation ensued. Then participants admitted what they had done.
He said the example shows how important it is for election officials to stay vigilant and constantly improve security in order to help voters feel confident.
But, he said, it would be hard to make any such scheme work on a larger scale. Fraudsters would have to navigate onerous nuances in each county’s election system. They also would have to keep a large number of people quiet about a crime that could be caught at any moment by officials or observers.
“This decentralized nature of the elections is itself a deterrent,” Grayson said.

In Nevada, immigration is a nuanced issue. But the politics of it is painted in black and white
BAKER, Nev. (AP) — Few things say America like Janille and Tom Baker’s ranch, with its grazing cattle, scrub brush-dotted desert and snow-capped mountains.
If only they could get American citizens to work on it.
The ranch in remote eastern Nevada produces around 10,000 tons of hay annually, and combines cowboy culture with a dash of Manifest Destiny. Rabbits, gophers and the occasional badger always outnumber humans and the nighttime sky is dark enough to count the stars.
But the Bakers’ business couldn’t survive without an agricultural guest worker program that brings in Mexican immigrants for about nine months a year to help harvest crops in fields where temperatures frequently exceed 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 Celsius).
“When people complain that foreign workers are taking their jobs, I roll my eyes,” said Janille Baker, who manages the ranch’s accounting. “In any industry, everybody’s trying to find help. So this anti-immigration stance doesn’t really make sense to me. If everyone needs workers, how are you planning to fill those jobs?” The ranch follows federal rules that require advertising available positions and making them available first to U.S. citizens. But in the last six years, only two Americans called to inquire about jobs. A third trekked out in person, but left after seeing what the work entailed.
Immigration has become a source of fright and frustration for voters in this presidential election — with possible outcomes that could take the United States down two dramatically different paths. Nowhere are the stakes higher than in Nevada, where 19% of residents are foreign-born and around 9% of the total workforce doesn’t have U.S. legal status.
The influx of illegal border crossings has strained city and state resources across the nation, even in Democratic strongholds. And yet immigration has fueled job growth in ways that strengthen the economy and improve the federal government’s fiscal health.
So black and white in the candidates’ rhetoric, immigration is actually incredibly complex in reality — a fact that reveals itself every day in Nevada.
Voters say it is among their most important issues in November. How they come down on immigration, choosing former President Donald Trump ’s hard-line proposals for mass deportations or Vice President Kamala Harris ' calls for a path to citizenship for millions of people in the country illegally who have been here for years, will go a long way toward determining the outcome.
Nearly 300 miles or 480 kilometers south of Baker Ranch, neon-saturated Las Vegas had almost 41 million tourists visit last year, and is seeing the issue of immigration play out differently, but with distinct parallels.
“There’s a lot of fear,” said Nancy Valenzuela, a 48-year-old maid who works at the Strat casino. “There are people who don’t have papers. They’re like, ‘They want to throw us all out.’”
Valenzuela plans to vote for Harris. But others can only watch and hope their way of life isn’t turned upside down. “We’re here, propping up the country so the economy doesn’t crash,” said Haydee Zetino, who scrubs lavish hotel suites at Harrah’s Casino on the famed Las Vegas strip. She is an immigrant from El Salvador with only temporary protected U.S. status and can’t vote.

If Trump deported all 11 million immigrants without legal status in the U.S., as he has suggested, the collateral risk could extend to the entire economy. Nevada’s job losses alone might nearly equal what it suffered during the 2008 financial crisis. More than 10% of Nevada’s population lives in homes with at least one immigrant in the country illegally, according to estimates from the advocacy group Fwd.us.
“In our wonderful, 24-hour economy, we know that these hotels and casinos could not, should not, would not be able to open every day without immigrants,” said Peter Guzman, president and CEO of the Latin Chamber of Commerce in Nevada.
Trump could also revive pushes he made during his first term to cancel programs that have extended temporary legal status to Zetino and hundreds of thousands of others.
Harris has called for humane treatment at the border, particularly for children and families, and for letting longtime immigrants get citizenship. But she’s also promised to revive a bipartisan package that Trump forced congressional Republicans to squash, which sought to provide $20 billion for immigration enforcement and tightened rules for immigrants seeking U.S. asylum.
Recent Biden administration orders have imposed asylum restrictions when the border is overwhelmed. The vice president recently walked the border with Mexico in Douglas, Arizona, and called for getting tougher than Biden has — despite his administration having seen arrests for illegal border crossings fall sharply in recent months, even approaching levels recorded during Trump’s final year in the White House.
Polling released last month by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research showed Trump has an advantage over the vice president on who voters trust to better handle immigration 44% vs. 37% — a gap Harris’ campaign has sought to narrow by moving harder to the middle on the issue.
Immigrants say a bipartisan push toward getting tougher at the border has clouded the larger issue in ways often too complicated to break down easily along ideological lines.
“I think that our focus is completely directed into the border and not toward the people who are already here and have been here for many, many years,” said Erika Marquez, immigrant justice organizer for the advocacy group Make the Road Nevada, and a recipient of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, an Obama-area effort giving limited protections to immigrants brought to the U.S. as children.
The Pew Research Center estimates that 11 million people in the country illegally live in the U.S. Big states like California, Texas and Florida have larger numbers who potentially could have even more influence on workforces and communities. But all of those states are all solidly red or blue in presidential races — and aren’t likely to sway the election as toss-up Nevada might.
Clark County, encompassing Las Vegas, is about 75% of the state’s population and includes a sizeable number of hospitality industry workers represented by Nevada’s powerful Culinary Union, which has endorsed Harris.
But Trump is hoping to turn out infrequent voters there, and do very well in much of the rest of the state, which tends to be rural and conservative. Washoe County, home to Reno, is a perennial toss-up, though. And voters can also choose “None” of the presidential candidates, adding to the Nevada electorate’s famously fickle nature.
Maria Nieto, president of the Young Democrats of Nevada, also got Obama-era protections for immigrants who arrived as children. She said she was always taught while growing up never to talk about her legal status. Now, however, Nieto, is making a point of using her story to motivate people to exercise voting rights she doesn’t have.
“At times, I think that people don’t realize how personal this is,” she said.
The post-Election Day economic consequences might be even more dire.
A group of researchers led by Warwick J. McKibbin, an economics professor at the Australian National University, found that removing workers in the U.S. illegally would sharply reduce labor supply in the mining, agriculture, services, and manufacturing sectors. Deporting even 7.5 million workers might slash Real Gross Domestic Product by 12%.
If Nevada lost all of its workers in the country illegally, Labor Department figures suggest the direct job losses would be roughly as large as those from the 2008 financial crisis, which stalled tourism, triggered a wave of housing market foreclosures and cost the state about 9.3% of its jobs during the subsequent Great Recession.
And rounding up people in the country illegally may not even count people like Zetino, Marquez, and Nieto, nor the guest workers at Baker Ranch, all of whom are authorized to be in the U.S.
Zetino, 62, gained temporary protected status since arriving after a major 2001 earthquake in El Salvador, but saw Trump try to remove it during his term.
“These people don’t have any conscience,” she said of mass deportation supporters. “They believe they can lift up the country, move the economy forward, but they don’t think of those at the bottom.”
‘No issue with people who want to come here legally’
Trump has made border security an unofficial anthem of his campaign, constantly decrying an “ invasion ” of people flooding into the country illegally. At the same time, he’s endorsed more temporary visas for qualified foreigners, saying at a recent town hall with Spanish-language Univision, “We want workers, and we want them to come in, but they have to come in legally, and they have to love our country.”
But the former president also has lately stepped up his attacks on people with temporary protected status, including spreading falsehoods about Haitians legally living in Ohio abducting and eating pets, and threatening to deport them should he win in November. Trump has further stoked tensions by suggesting that immigrants coming into the U.S. illegally are doing so to expressly take jobs from Black and Hispanic Americans.
Still, some of Trump’s top supporters in Nevada are more careful to make distinctions between immigrants here legally and not. That includes former North Las Vegas Mayor John Lee, who has been endorsed by Trump as he runs for Congress and acknowledged of his state: “We are running out of labor force right now.”
“We have no issue with people who want to come here legally,” Lee said. “We’ll train them and they’ll work, and we see all the joys of America that way.” But he said people in the country illegally, by contrast, have contributed to higher crime rates, including construction sites being burglarized.
Other conservatives are more explicit about the economic damage tougher immigration policies might do, though.
Guzman, of the Latin chamber, has organized forums examining how construction in Las Vegas has been slowed by not being able to find enough workers. He’s pushed for expanding guest worker programs, noting on a call with an advocacy group, “I’m a registered Republican, and we are not all the same on this issue.”
Florisela López Rivera has seen that nuance firsthand and worries about politics overwhelming decency.
A dishwasher at Wynn Casino in Las Vegas, López Rivera is originally from El Salvador and got temporary protected status after Hurricane Mitch’s devastation in 1998. She recently gained permanent U.S. residency after her wife became a citizen, which means she’s unlikely to face deportation under any circumstances.
López Rivera is a member of the Culinary Workers Union, which represents 60,000, majority-Hispanic workers in Las Vegas and Reno. A Harris supporter, López Rivera canvasses for her union to advocate for the vice president, stressing Harris being the daughter of immigrants.
She speaks Spanish while knocking on doors and says that she encounters some people who tell her, “I love Trump.” Even then, she tries to engage them rather than simply turning away.
“When we focus on the negative, we lose the human side of things,” López Rivera said.
Bipartisan support for stricter border security
Harris’ calls for tightening asylum rules and stepping up enforcement at the border underscore just how much voters backing both parties want a strong hand there.
“Everybody I know, Republican or Democrat, believes border security is important,” said Edgar Flores, a Democratic Nevada state senator and immigration attorney. “We have real problems with drugs, with gangs, with violence.”
But move even partially toward mass deportations, Flores said, and “you’re going to disturb the most essential industries in Nevada, and that’s going to be replicated around the country.”
Marquez, of Make the Road Nevada, said her organization accepts that there need to be stiffer controls at the border, but added, “I think a lot of people — and Trump himself — have this irrational idea that we are here and we are not good people.”
“We are all working class,” said Marquez, who was born in Leon, Mexico, and immigrated at age 3, when her grandmother paid smugglers to take her and her then-pregnant mother into the United States. “All we want is being able to supply food, shelter and a good education for our children and just to be able to grow as a community.”
A recent Scripps News/Ipsos survey found that 86% of Republicans “strongly” or “somewhat support” mass deportations, but so do 25% of Democrats. Overall, 54% of voters support removing potentially millions of people from the country, topping the 42% who oppose it, while a third of Americans see securing the U.S.-Mexico border as the country’s top immigration priority, the survey found.
‘You can’t get anyone to come do the work’
Back on Baker Ranch, the H-2A visa program brings immigrant workers to the fields. They harvest hay, control weeds and irrigate with wheel lines moved by hand, or fully hand irrigate, building small dams using tarps they drag to different areas so that crops can be better submerged in water.
During Trump’s first term, the H-2A program’s participation rose, but he also proposed a rule just before the end of his term that would have frozen farmworkers’ salaries for two years, loosened requirements for worker housing and restricted the transportation costs they could be reimbursed for. The Biden administration wiped those out, but imposed new rules it says can better protect workers and has seen participation climb even higher.
Tom Baker co-owns the ranch with his brothers, and it began operating in 1954, nearly two decades before the area was electrified. He calls it “hard, hot work” that’s “kind of miserable.”
“These kinds of farms, without immigrants, would become infeasible because you can’t get anyone to come do the work,” said Baker, 54. “The wage isn’t the issue. It’s whether people will come do the job.”
The soil — enriched by hot days and nights that turn cooler because of higher elevations — can make for superior hay, some of which goes to race and polo horse centers like West Palm Beach, Florida, home to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago club.
The ranch has 26 employees, including five current H-2A immigrant workers. Many of the oldest ranch hands arrived long enough ago to get U.S. legal status through 1980s programs. Some have children who were born in the U.S. and are citizens, even if one or both of their parents are not.
The guest workers declined to comment, not wanting to attract undue attention. Still, three generations of immigrant workers at the ranch largely hail from the towns of Apozol and Juchipila in north-central Mexico.
The original arrivals now have grown children. Some of them work at the ranch and have had their own children who are now in high school and work there themselves during the summers. One former employee’s wife had her baby in a ranch vehicle on the way to the hospital, about 80 miles away.
Janille Baker, 51, is no fan of Trump, but also has at times become exasperated with Biden administration regulations. Those include small things like immigrant living quarters being required to have screen doors, despite being air conditioned and already equipped with screens on the windows.
“It is a hot potato and each side’s lobbing one at the other. And, in all honesty, both are to blame,” she said of immigration. “There is going to come a point where it has to get taken care of. You can’t just keep using fearmongering and scaring people, and then being critical of the people who do or don’t want to do whatever jobs.”
