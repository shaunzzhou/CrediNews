Guardian,Two women removed from BA flight ‘after altercation over Maga cap’,"Two women were removed from a British Airways flight at Heathrow after an altercation reportedly provoked by a Make America Great Again (Maga) cap.
The incident occurred on Saturday as the women, aged 40 and 60, were preparing to board a flight bound for Austin, Texas.
Witnesses said that one woman took offence at her fellow passenger’s red Maga hat, worn by supporters of the former US president Donald Trump, and asked that it be removed, the Sun reported.
Flight BA191 had been due to depart the airport at 12.10pm and eventually took off at 2.11pm without the two women onboard.
Punches were allegedly exchanged between the two women, both booked to fly in premium economy, before they ended up squaring up to one another in the cabin. When the captain called for assistance, police arrived at the scene to escort the passengers from the aircraft.
Arrests were not made but both women made claims of affray against the other.
Police are continuing to investigate the incident. A spokesperson said: “Shortly after 12.45pm on Monday, 28 October, police at Heathrow were made aware of an incident involving two women waiting to board a plane in Terminal 5.
“A woman in her 40s and a woman in her 60s made counter allegations of affray. Enquiries are ongoing.”
British Airways said in a statement: “We apologised to our customers for the delay and got them on the way as quickly as possible.”
A Heathrow source told the Sun: “With the US presidential election so close, tensions are sky high. Airline crew could not run the risk of a full scale punch-up at 30,000ft.
“BA officials cannot recall a flight being delayed before due to a passenger’s baseball cap. It was extraordinary.”",2024-10-30
Guardian,"Yes, I think Democrats are complicit in genocide. But Trump would be far worse | Wajahat Ali","If you’re undecided about your vote, a reliable rule of thumb is to always side against the candidate who is a convicted criminal, admires “good things” done by Adolf Hitler, and is labeled a “fascist” by four-star generals who worked in their administration.
However, just days before the chaotic 2024 US election, many American voters are still loath to vote for Kamala Harris due to the Biden administration’s complicity in Israel’s ongoing genocide in Gaza. It’s hard to blame them. “How can we vote for genocidaires?” ask many Democratic voters radicalized and infuriated by Israel’s daily war crimes. Meanwhile, Benjamin Netanyahu’s fanatical government, populated by a rogue galley of Jewish supremacists, openly declared their desire to ethnically cleanse Palestinians and illegally occupy more land. Their desire for ultra-violence and carnage does not spare journalists, UN workers, doctors or even US citizens. More than 42,000 Palestinians, mostly civilians, have been killed.
And yet Democrats couldn’t be bothered to even invite one Palestinian as a speaker at the Democratic national convention. Instead, they were replaced by hollow talking points about the need for a ceasefire, return of hostages, and Palestinian self-determination even as the Israeli prime minister’s policies make such goals an impossibility. However, Netanyahu’s humiliation and repudiation of the US, Israel’s greatest ally, is still rewarded with billions of aid and unconditional support.
Despite these tragic, deflating, and heartbreaking circumstances, progressive voters must still support the vice-president in the 2024 election. The reality is that only one of two candidates will be the next president and the most powerful person on Earth. It will be either Donald Trump, a twice-impeached vulgarian who incited a violent insurrection, or Harris. Whenever I say this to undecided friends, they accuse me of supporting genocide or believe “both sides” are the same evil.
I respectfully disagree.
Donald Trump will be genocidal and a fascist. On Gaza, Trump promised he would let Israel “finish the job”. That means fulfilling his mega-donor Miriam Adelson’s wish of annexing the West Bank and standing pat as Israel moves to occupy northern Gaza on the graveyard of Palestinians. There’s a reason why Israel’s extremist national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, wants Trump to win and says he will be better for Israel. Trump might be better for Israel, but he won’t be better for Jewish people, whom he said he would blame if he loses the 2024 election. This is an addition to his promotion of antisemitic “dual loyalty” tropes and support of the antisemitic “great replacement theory”.
Trump loathes Palestinians even more. He said the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, who is Jewish, has “become like a Palestinian” and “a proud member of Hamas” for criticizing Israel’s war in Gaza. Trump has also promised to bar Palestinian refugees and implement an “ideological test” for Muslim immigrants if re-elected. At Trump’s Nazi cosplay rally at Madison Square Garden, Rudy Giuliani said Palestinians “are taught to kill us at two years old” and added: “They may have good people, I’m sorry, [but] I don’t take a risk with people that are taught to kill Americans at two.” Afterward, Trump appeared on stage and declared the GOP was “the party of inclusion”. Unless you’re Palestinian, an undocumented person, Haitian, Puerto Rican, a woman or a Jewish liberal.
Still, some jaded American voters don’t believe anything will be different when it comes to US policy in Gaza. I don’t blame them. But, if you remain unmoved on that issue, then I’d kindly ask you to turn to the domestic front where in the final month of his campaign Trump has promised to unleash the military and national guard on US citizens and invoke the Alien Sedition Act against migrants. This is the same man who said he’d be a “dictator for a day” and whose Project 2025 is like a helpful Bond villain blueprint that explicitly details the authoritarian ambitions for a white Christian nationalist utopia. The agenda includes replacing public servants with Maga brownshirts, weaponizing the justice department against his numerous enemies – which include Liz Cheney, for whom he wants televised public military tribunals – and eliminating the Department of Education.
“Well, we already survived the first Trump administration. The system will hold. This is just scare-mongering,” I am told in response. This statement is rooted in privilege and amnesia. I’d recommend people who believe this fiction to talk to the family members of nearly half a million Americans who died during the pandemic, a disaster made infinitely worse due to Trump’s incompetence and lies to the US public. I want people to talk to low-income and middle-class families who rely on Obamacare for survival, which Trump and the GOP have promised to eliminate and replace with a “concept of a plan”. I’d like people to read the story of Amber Nicole Thurman, a young Black woman who died in Georgia because she was denied access to a legal abortion thanks to Trump and his extremist, rightwing supreme court majority that overturned Roe v Wade.
There’s too much at stake and far too many communities, both in the United States and abroad, that will suffer if Trump is re-elected. The desire to “punish” Joe Biden and Harris for Gaza and vote instead for Trump or a third party, which just helps Trump in swing states, is like punching ourselves in the face. The entire country will end up with a bloody nose as Trump becomes a dictator and unleashes his Maga brownshirts.
With Harris and Democrats, there is an opening for Americans to organize, push, and pressure her administration to halt Israel’s genocide and pursue progressive healthcare and economic policies. Democratic allies include Bernie Sanders, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, labor organizations and communities of color who remain committed to social justice, equity and peace. With the Republicans and Trump, no such allies exist. There’s simply a fascist and a white Christian nationalist regime in waiting.
There’s no both sides. Please vote accordingly.

Guardian,Trump claims ‘nobody loves Puerto Rican community more than I do’ at Pennsylvania rally,"Donald Trump praised Puerto Ricans on Tuesday during a Pennsylvania rally, days after a comedian made a racist joke and referred to Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage” at one of his rallies.
“Nobody loves our Latino community and our Puerto Rican community more than I do,” the former president said a little over an hour into a rally in Allentown, in the Lehigh Valley, which has a sizable Latino population.
More than 68,000 people – over half of the total population – in Allentown are Hispanic or Latino, according to US census data. A few blocks from the rally, a home had a Puerto Rican flag posted on the door.
He also claimed that he had done a lot for Puerto Rico as president. Trump drew ridicule for tossing paper towels into a crowd on the island after it was ravaged by a hurricane; blocked hurricane aid; and mused about selling the island.
He also again praised the rally at Madison Square Garden, saying “the love was unbelievable” and told a rambling story about watching a SpaceX rocket that lasted longer than his discussion of Puerto Ricans.
Many of the speakers on Tuesday, including the Puerto Rican official Zoraida Buxó, emphasized their Puerto Rican heritage, signaling the campaign’s effort to win Puerto Rican voters in Pennsylvania, the key battleground state in this election, where polls show a tight race.
“We won’t get rattled, we won’t yield to ignorance, foolishness, or irrational thoughtlessness,” she said.
Senator Marco Rubio, another speaker at the rally, also joined Trump onstage during the former president’s remarks to share with the crowd comments from Joe Biden on Tuesday in which the president condemned the remarks about Puerto Ricans and said: “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters – his – his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American”, according to a White House transcript. After Republicans circulated a clip of the statement, calling it an attack on Trump supporters, Biden put out a statement saying he meant to refer to the comedian who made the joke.
A small protest arrived outside the arena just before the rally began on Tuesday. Some of the protesters were carrying signs that said Latinos for Harris-Walz, while others wore the Puerto Rican flag.

One of the people marching was Luis Gonzalez, a retired 65-year-old truck driver from Allentown. He wore a sweater with the Puerto Rican flag stitched on it.
“The guy has no idea what he’s talking about,” he said. “I was born in Puerto Rico. That island as well as all the other islands around it are beautiful.
“For anybody to say that it’s a garbage island – they’ve never been to the Caribbean.”
But inside the rally, few people thought the fallout from the comment would have much effect on Trump. Some had not heard it.
“It was made in poor taste, I have to admit. But Donald Trump is Donald Trump, ” said Mark Melendez, 55, who is Puerto Rican and traveled to the rally from New Jersey. “I don’t think it will affect him; it might.”
At least one audience member was holding a sign that said “Boricuas for Trump”, using a term that describes people of Puerto Rican descent.
Jackie Beller, 60, who lives near Allentown, thought the joke was funny.
“If you take a comedian out of context and you look at it as a serious thing, yes, you would be offended,” Beller said.
“It’s all a joke – I’ve spoken to some Puerto Rican people and they weren’t offended, so I don’t know,” said Mary Mendez, 65, a retired paramedic from New York.
Trump’s speech kicking off the final week of the presidential race mixed personal attacks, grievance, anti-immigrant rhetoric and a smattering of policies. He accused Democrats of having already cheated, misrepresenting an ongoing investigation in Lancaster county in an example of how he is priming his supporters to challenge the election results if he loses.
His remarks were less an appeal to undecided voters than a full-throated appeal to his base, pledging that he would be able to fix all of the US’s ills.
“This is gonna be a very special time. It’s going to be America’s new golden age. Every problem facing us can be solved,” he said.
As Kamala Harris made her closing argument in Washington and called Trump “unstable” and “obsessed with revenge”, Trump called Harris a “low-IQ individual” and mused about getting retribution against Michelle Obama for criticizing him on the campaign trial.
“Michelle Obama was very nasty,” he said. “I’ve gone out of my way to be nice to Michelle. Haven’t said a damn thing about her. She hit me.”",2024-10-30
Guardian,Steve Bannon released from prison a week before US election,"Steve Bannon, the longtime Donald Trump acolyte, was released from prison on Tuesday, following a four-month sentence for defying a congressional subpoena in an investigation of the 6 January 2021 US Capitol attack.
The far-right firebrand’s release from federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut, comes just one week before election day. Bannon, 70, surrendered to prison on 1 July after the US supreme court rebuffed his effort to postpone this sentence pending appeal.
“I’m not broken, I’m empowered,” Bannon said upon leaving the lockup at about 3.15am local time, according to the New York Times. Bannon wasted little time in resuming his position as a pro-Trump demagogue, implying that political unrest would unfold after the election.
“If people think American politics has been divisive before, you haven’t seen anything,” Bannon said, according to reports.
He also insisted that serving time behind bars was “1,000%” worth the price of refusing congressional testimony. “If you’re not prepared to go to prison to fight for your country,” Bannon said, “you’re not prepared to fight for your country.”
Bannon was convicted on two counts of contempt of Congress in July 2022. Federal prosecutors argued that Bannon thought himself “above the law” in refusing to sit before the January 6 House select committee and rejecting demands for documents in his work to subvert 2020’s election results – which saw Joe Biden besting Trump.
The prosecution said that Bannon “chose to show his contempt for Congress’s authority and its processes” in flouting these subpoenas. Bannon has insisted that the convictions against him were politically motivated, similar to Trump’s unsubstantiated claims that law enforcement actions against him stemmed from a nefarious Democratic conspiracy.
David Schoen, Bannon’s lawyer, claimed that this case prompted “serious constitutional issues” that needed to be examined by the supreme court.
“Quite frankly, Mr Bannon should make no apology. No American should make any apology for the manner in which Mr Bannon proceeded in this case,” Schoen said.
Bannon’s legal team has also argued that there was a “strong public interest” in permitting him to remain out on bail in advance of the 2024 US presidential elections.
Hours after his release, Bannon returned to his political proselytizing, with a live War Room podcast where he peddled election conspiracy theories.
At a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, about 12 hours after his release from prison, Bannon railed against Nancy Pelosi, the US attorney general, Merrick Garland, and Harris, again claiming that he was a “political prisoner”.
“The system is broken,” Bannon said, claiming the justice department was “weaponized” to punish Trump’s backers and gut his popular podcast.
Bannon also insisted that he met a lot of “working-class minorities” behind bars, saying he listened to, and learned from, them. They disliked Harris, Bannon said, calling the former prosecutor as the “queen of mass incarcerations”.
Doubling down on his War Room claims on Tuesday morning, in which Bannon insisted that prison had empowered him, he also quipped: “Nancy Pelosi, suck on that.”
Bannon also thanked the prison for providing an opportunity for him to teach civics to about 100 students, pointing out that he had Puerto Rican and Dominican pupils. Bannon discussed his work with persons of color at several points, in a seeming effort to downplay attention on anti-Latino commentary from Trump supporters.
He also toyed with the idea that Democrats would try to steal the election from Trump; Biden won the 2020 election and there is no credible evidence of misconduct that undermines the legitimacy of his win.
“We’re going to have a reprise of 2020 where they’re going to do everything humanly possible to nullify” Trump’s victory and “delegitimize his second term”, Bannon claimed.
“The working-class people in this country that support Donald John Trump are not going to let that happen.
“The 2020 election was stolen,” Bannon also said later.
During a question-and-answer session with Bannon, an apparent interloper – it appears that he is a comedian – asked “when’s the next insurrection, and can we storm the Burger King after this?” This person seemed to have been escorted out of the press conference.
Bannon still faces state-level charges in New York over his alleged tricking of donors who contributed to building a US-Mexico border wall. Bannon maintains his innocence; trial in this case is scheduled for December.

Guardian,Trump wants you to believe that the US economy is doing terribly. It’s untrue | Steven Greenhouse,"If Donald Trump wins next week’s election, it would be the first time in US history that a candidate wins based on such a huge lie – his falsehood that we have “the worst economy ever”. The former president’s big lie has distorted the views of millions of Americans, wrongly convincing many that the US economy is in bad shape.
There’s no denying that many Americans are struggling economically and that inflation was painfully high back in 2022, but inflation is far lower now, and most economists agree that our economy is strong. The unemployment rate is low, inflation is way down, economic growth is solid, and job growth has been remarkably strong. Indeed, the country has added nearly 18m jobs – a record – under the Biden-Harris administration. Not only that, median household income has climbed to $80,610, higher than it was in Trump’s last year in office.
“In the 35 years I’ve been an economist, I’ve rarely seen an economy performing as well as it is,” Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, said recently. “I’d give it an A+.” But the US public, still upset about the surge in inflation several years ago, sees things very differently: 62% say the economy is in bad shape, while just 38% say it’s in good shape, according to an October AP-NORC poll.
The public holds this negative view even though there’s been very good news for blue-collar workers: the US has added more than 700,000 factory jobs under the Biden-Harris administration, far more than during Trump’s presidency, indeed more than under any president since the 1970s. There’s also been good news for small businesses – a record 19m new business applications have been filed under Biden. There’s also good news for the wealthy – the stock market has climbed to record levels, which is Wall Street’s way of saying the economy is in excellent shape. Let’s not forget that Trump warned that if Biden was elected president, the stock market would crash. Wrong again, Donald. Under Biden, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 36% higher than when Trump left office, and the S&P 500 is 53% higher.
Trump’s repeated claim that today’s economy is the worst ever shows either an appalling ignorance of history or an appalling contempt for the truth. The truth is that the economy was in far worse shape during Trump’s last year in office, when the unemployment rate soared to 14.8% during the pandemic, compared with 4.1% now. Moreover, there were many other times when the economy was in worse shape – it was worse during the 2008 recession under George W Bush, far worse during the 1980-81 and 1974-75 recessions, and catastrophically worse during the Great Depression of the 1930s. When Trump tells his Maga crowds that today’s economy is the worst ever, he’s taking everyone for an idiot.
The US economy has grown the fastest among major industrial nations since the pandemic began. Our economy has grown twice as fast as Canada’s, three times as fast as France’s and Japan’s, and four times as fast as Britain’s. Under Biden, the average unemployment rate has been lower than under any president since Lyndon Johnson.
If Harris loses to Trump, historians and economists will long debate why she lost while Ronald Reagan was re-elected in a landslide in 1984 even though unemployment was far higher back then (7.2% versus 4.1% today), inflation was higher (4% versus 2.4% today), and the Federal Reserve’s interest rates were far higher (10% versus 5% today). One thing working for Reagan was that GDP growth was strong in 1984.
Don’t get me wrong, today’s economy has serious problems. Millions of Americans are struggling, but it’s wrong to blame Biden and Harris for that. I’ve been writing about America’s workers and economy for more than 40 years – from Reagan to Clinton to Trump to Biden – and under every president, millions of American have struggled economically. Trump makes believe that far more Americans are struggling now than ever before, but that’s just not true. Take this important statistic: 11.1% of Americans currently fall below the poverty line. That’s essentially the same percentage as under Trump and is only slightly above its lowest point in half a century.
Many Americans say the economy is in poor shape mainly because of their lingering dismay about the high inflation from mid-2021 to mid-2023. But they may not know that wages have risen faster than inflation over the past two years and that real wages are higher than before the pandemic. Trump blames Biden and Harris for causing inflation, but they weren’t the cause. The two main causes were the pandemic’s closing factories and disrupting supply chains worldwide and Russia’s war against Ukraine, which increased energy and food prices. Americans complain that gas prices are higher, but that’s Vladimir Putin’s and Opec’s fault, not Biden’s or Harris’s. US oil production has hit record levels.
Housing affordability remains a big problem. Not only have housing prices soared, but high interest rates – which are finally coming down – have made it far too difficult for many Americans to buy a house. Again, the housing squeeze is not Biden’s or Harris’s fault; it was caused by a huge slowdown in housing production that began during the 2008 recession.
It’s unfortunate that Trump’s dishonesty and deceit too often make us focus on his lies rather on something far more important: the future, and what a second Trump term would mean for the country. Many economists warn of disaster if Trump wins. They warn that his plan to impose tariffs or taxes on all imported goods will send inflation soaring and ignite a dangerous trade war that could cause a recession and throw millions out of work. Economists also warn that Trump’s plans, including his plan to slash taxes on the wealthy and corporations, not only will increase the federal debt by a colossal $7.8tn, but could bankrupt the social security system and lead to a 33% across-the-board cut in social security benefits.
No wonder 23 Nobel Prize-winning economists signed a recent letter calling Trump’s economic agenda “counterproductive” and warning that it “will lead to higher prices, larger deficits, and greater inequality”.
In contrast to Trump, Kamala Harris has specific plans to improve the economy and help Americans cope with high prices. She has pledged to build 3m new housing units to help bring down housing prices. She also plans to give $25,000 in down payment assistance to first-time homebuyers. To help with the high cost of raising a family, she has called for creating a $3,600 tax credit per child and $6,000 for newborns. Recognizing how expensive caregiving needs can be, she wants to create a trailblazing Medicare at Home program to help pay for care for ageing parents.
Nobel-winning economists said Harris’s economic agenda is “vastly superior” to Trump’s and “will improve our nation’s” employment opportunities, health, investment and fairness.
American voters have a clear choice. They can choose Harris’s agenda, which promises a stronger, fairer economy, or Trump’s agenda, which will bring a worse, less stable economy with higher prices and less fairness.
Unlike Trump, I’ll be honest and won’t claim that his economic agenda will bring the worst economy ever, even though his agenda looks plenty dangerous.

Guardian,Autumn budget live: Rachel Reeves says budget will raise taxes by £40bn,"The news that the UK’s fiscal rules will now target Public Sector Net Financial Liabilities, PSNFL, (known as “persnuffle” in economic circles), confirms the Guardian’s report from last week.
It means the UK will now account financial assets, including student loans and company shares, alongside government debts.
Here’s BenZaranko of the IFS:
It should free up potentially £50bn of extra borrowing within the fiscal rules, as this chart shows:
Reeves says she will be left with £15.7bn of headroom at the end of the OBR’s forecast period, under PSNFL.
That’s “much lower than expected”, reports PaulJohnson of the InstituteforFiscalStudies.
Reeves confirms debt definition is changing, but says four 'guardrails' will ensure extra borrowing is responsible
Reeves says, under the Tories, public investment was set to fall from 2.5% of GDP to 1.7% of GDP.
She says her new debt rule – called the investment rule, because the definition of debt is changing to allow more investment – will address this.
She confirms that the government will move to public sector net financial liabilities (PSNFL) as the debt measure. This is a metric that has been measured since 2016, she says.
She says four “guardrails” will be in place.
First, our portfolio of new financial investments will be delivered by expert bodies like the National Wealth Fund, which must, by default, earn a rate of return at least as large as that on gilts.
Second, we will strengthen the role of institutions to improve infrastructure delivery.
Third, we will improve certainty setting capital budgets for five years and extending them at every spending review every two years.
Finally, we will ensure that there is greater transparency for capital spending with robust annual reporting of financial investments based on accounts audited by the National Audit Office and made available to the office for Budget Responsibility at every forecast.
Taken together with our stability rule, these fiscal rules will ensure that our public finances are on a firm footing, while enabling us to invest prudently.
Reeves says, in line with the Barnett formula, there will be an extra £3.4bn for the Scottish government, an extra £1.7bn for the Welsh government and an extra £1.5bn for Northern Ireland.
And the Welsh government is getting £25m to help fund the maintenance of coal tips, she says.
Reeves says freeze in income tax and national insurance thresholds will not be extended, contrary to some pre-budget reports
There was speculation that Reeves would extend the freeze on income tax and national insurance thresholds put in place by the last government. But Reeves has decided not to, she says.
The previous government froze income tax and National Insurance thresholds in 2021 and then they did so again, after the mini budget, extending their threshold freeze for a further two years …
Having considered this issue closely, I have come to the conclusion that extending the threshold freeze would hurt working people would take more money out of their pay slips. I am keeping every single promise on tax that I made in our manifesto. There will be no extension of the freeze in income tax and national insurance thresholds beyond the decisions by the previous government.
From 2028-29, personal tax thresholds will be uprated in line with inflation once again.
Blick Rothenberg, the audit, tax and business advisory firm, point out that Rachel Reeves has announced the largest tax-raising budget in decades.
Simon Gleeson, a partner at Blick Rothenberg, says:
“£40bn in tax raises is the largest any chancellor has made since Norman Lamont in 1993, at £38.5bn (Conservatives), and Dennis Healy at £31.4bn in 1975 (Labour).”
To help high streets, Reeves says there will be 40% relief on business rates for the retail, hospitality and leisure industry in 2025-26, up to a cap of £110,000 per business.
The small business tax multiplier will be frozen next year. And permanently lower tax rates will be introduced for retail, hospitality & leisure properties from 2026-27.

Guardian,Man upset by Chinese spy balloon found guilty of threatening Kevin McCarthy,"A Montana man was convicted on Wednesday of threatening to assault the former House speaker Kevin McCarthy after becoming upset that the government had not shot down a Chinese spy balloon that floated over his home city.
Richard Rogers, 45, of Billings, delivered the threat to a McCarthy staffer during a series of more than 100 calls to the Republican speaker’s office in just 75 minutes on 3 February 2023, prosecutors said. That was one day after the Pentagon acknowledged it was tracking the spy balloon, which was later shot down off the Atlantic coast.
The 12-person federal jury also found Rogers guilty on two counts of making harassing telephone calls: the ones to McCarthy’s office plus 150 calls he made to an FBI tip line in 2021 and 2022.
Rogers routinely made vulgar and obscene comments in those calls.
Sentencing was set for 31 January. He faces up to six years in prison and a $250,000 fine for threatening to harm a member of Congress, and a maximum penalty of two years and a $250,000 fine on the harassment counts.
The US district judge Susan Watters allowed Rogers to remain free of custody pending sentencing.
Threats against public officials in the US have risen sharply in recent years, including against members of Congress and their spouses, election workers and local elected officials. Rogers’ case was among more than 8,000 threats to lawmakers investigated by the US Capitol police in 2023, and officials expect another surge with the 2024 election.
During a three-day trial, Rogers testified that his outraged calls to the FBI and McCarthy’s office were a form of “civil disobedience”.
He and his attorneys argued that using obscenities with FBI operators and congressional staff was protected as free speech under the first amendment, which establishes the right “to petition the government for a redress of grievances”.
But prosecutors said Rogers crossed the line with a threat on McCarthy’s life and by hurling abusive and sexual verbal tirades against the lawmaker’s staffers and FBI operators.
In the dozens of calls that were played for jurors, Rogers was heard asking for investigations of various alleged conspiracies involving the FBI and the administration of Joe Biden. He was polite at times, but would quickly become angry and shout obscenities until the calls were disconnected.
“You can’t talk to people that way. It’s common sense,” the assistant US attorney Thomas Godfrey said. “He’s calling not out of political protest; he’s calling because he gets enjoyment out of it.”
The prosecutor told the jury there was no exception in federal law that says government employees can be subjected to harassment.
“‘Petitioning the government’ – baloney,” Godfrey said. “Kevin McCarthy was the speaker of the House. It’s not his job to shoot down spy balloons.”
Rogers, a former telephone customer service representative, testified that he took care to “edit” his comments on the phone to avoid any threats because he did not want to go to prison.
He added that he never tried hide his actions and frequently offered his name and phone number when calling the FBI.
“They were disrespectful to me, so I was disrespectful to them,” Rogers said.
The defense attorney Ed Werner said Rogers “just wanted to be heard”.
Following the guilty verdict, Rogers repeated his contention that he never threatened anyone. He also said he was dissatisfied with his defense attorneys for not adequately presenting his case.
Rogers wore shirts depicting Captain America and other superheroes throughout the trial, including one on Wednesday with the letters “Maga” on the front, a reference to Donald Trump’s “Make America Great Again” slogan. A supporter of the former president, he said he was in Washington DC during the 6 January 2021 attack on the Capitol.
Godfrey said the case was not about politics but rather illegal harassment.
Earlier this year, a 30-year-old Billings man was sentenced to two and a half years in federal prison after leaving voicemail messages threatening to kill the Montana Democratic senator Jon Tester and his family. Another Montana man, from Kalispell, was sentenced to two and a half years in prison last year, also for making threats against Tester.",2024-10-03
Guardian,Hulk Hogan once endorsed Barack Obama. How did he become a big Maga mascot? | Arwa Mahdawi,"It was less WWE, more WTF. On Sunday night, Terry Gene Bollea, better known as Hulk Hogan, strutted on stage at Madison Square Garden to speak at a Donald Trump rally. Wearing tiny yellow sunglasses that looked as if they’d been nicked off a toddler, Hogan attempted to rip his shirt off. It took a bit of struggling, but eventually the 71-year-old wrestling legend managed it.
The high jinks continued: Hogan treated the crowd to a dance. Notably, Hogan’s dance moves are just like the ones Trump has shown off at numerous rallies. A lot of arm-pumping; kinda looks like they’re milking a cow. (That said, my own dancing looks like a penguin being caught in an earthquake, so I’m not judging.)
“You know something, Trumpmaniacs?” Hogan said, after his jig was up. “I don’t see no stinking Nazis in here.” The wrestler was referencing the fact that the Trump event had drawn numerous comparisons, including from Tim Walz, to a Nazi rally held in 1939 at an earlier iteration of Madison Square Garden. Not an outrageous comparison, considering the 2024 rally was full of racism and nativist language, with former Trump aide Stephen Miller saying things such as: “America is for Americans and Americans only.” As for Hogan, while World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) once fired him for using the N-word, his rally speech wasn’t overtly racist. However, he did appear to make a disgusting oral sex joke about Kamala Harris.
Hogan’s campy costumes and corny catchphrases may make him seem a bit of a joke, but he’s had a serious impact on the political landscape in recent years. Hogan may not have been able to see any “stinking Nazis” in Madison Square Garden, but powerful men with darkly authoritarian views sure seem to see a useful ally in him.
Hogan was certainly instrumental in helping billionaire Peter Thiel kill the media organisation Gawker – a long and sordid saga that started in 2006, when Hogan had sex with the wife of his friend, a radio personality called Bubba the Love Sponge. Bubba filmed the encounter and, in 2012, the tapes got leaked (possibly by a rival DJ) to Gawker. They published the video with the headline: “Even for a minute, watching Hulk Hogan have sex in a canopy bed is not safe for work but watch it anyway”.
Watching closely was Thiel, who had held a grudge against Gawker ever since it published a post with the headline: “Peter Thiel is totally gay, people” in 2007. A book about the lawsuit by Ryan Holiday claims that an acquaintance of Thiel, aware of this grudge, gave him the idea to take Gawker down in 2011. When the Hogan tape came out, Thiel had the perfect opportunity to exact revenge: he secretly bankrolled the wrestler’s lawsuit against the company. Because Thiel has unlimited funds, the lawsuit was dragged out to ensure Gawker hemorrhaged money. Which wasn’t necessarily great for Hogan, who had to make his private affairs very public. Things were even worse for Gawker, though, which was driven to bankruptcy.
Gawker was a brilliant site, but it also did a bunch of indefensible things, outing someone and publishing a sex tape without their consent being prime examples. Nevertheless, an aggrieved billionaire suing a publication into oblivion set a chilling precedent. It ushered in a United States where, as Tom Scocca, a former Gawker writer, put it, “a billionaire can put a publication out of business”.
Hogan, who once endorsed Barack Obama for president, clearly got a taste for hanging around vengeful billionaires after the lawsuit. He’s been a prominent fixture in the Trump campaign for the past few months and had a primetime speaking slot at the Republican national convention in July. Like every aggrieved rich guy in America, Hogan has also flirted with the idea of a political career: if Trump wins, there is a non-zero chance he might get some sort of official position.
But while it may be notable that Hogan has got more Trumpy over the years, perhaps what’s most glaring here is how much Trump’s GOP has become like the WWE. It’s shed any pretence of respectability, morphing into a violent theatre of the absurd, full of caricatures and cheap gimmicks. Unlike wrestling however, the only people really getting hurt are the public.",2024-10-29
Guardian,"Biden says ‘garbage’ remark was aimed at comedian, not Trump supporters","Joe Biden put out a statement that he had “meant to say” earlier on Tuesday that a pro-Trump comedian’s “hateful rhetoric” about Puerto Rico was “garbage”. But in an edited video clip already widely circulating on social media Tuesday evening, a phrase that came out of Biden’s mouth was “the only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters”.
Republican politicians and rightwing media outlets quickly picked up the clip to argue that Biden had called Trump’s supporters garbage, comparing his remarks to Hillary Clinton’s labeling of half of Trump supporters as belonging in “a basket of deplorables” in 2016, a comment that is widely seen as undermining her campaign.
Biden’s full comments on Tuesday are somewhat garbled, and some journalists transcribing the remarks argued that Biden really did seem to be trying to refer to comedian Tony Hinchcliffe’s remarks, not all of Trump’s supporters, while others reported that the president had indeed suggested that Trump supporters themselves were garbage.
Biden’s comment came during a Zoom call with Voto Latino, in which Biden referred to Hinchcliffe’s comments and said the Puerto Ricans he knows are “good, decent, honorable, people. The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter’s – his – his demonization of things is unconscionable, and it’s un-American, and it’s totally contrary to everything we’ve done.” But it wasn’t entirely clear whether he had said the singular “supporter’s” or the plural “supporters”, describing Trump’s base more broadly.
In the official transcript of Biden’s remarks released on Tuesday night by the White House press office, the comment has an apostrophe: “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter’s – his – his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American.”
Speaking at a campaign event with Trump, Senator Marco Rubio picked up the remark as “breaking news” and told Trump supporters that Biden had dismissed a huge number of everyday Americans as “garbage”, while conservative outlets amplified the remark. Biden quickly tweeted that he had “meant to say” that the comedian’s remarks were “garbage”.
The furore over Biden’s “garbage” remarks comes on what was supposed to be a big night for Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, as she attempted to make her closing argument of the campaign, urging the country to “turn the page” on Trump. Harris spoke in front of tens of thousands of supporters in Washington DC. She made her case in the location where Trump addressed his supporters on January 6, before many of them went on to storm to US Capitol in an attempt to halt the certification of Biden’s 2020 election victory.
Biden’s slightly garbled original comments mark another gaffe for a gaffe-prone politician on the eve of a very tight election.
Polling averages show that Harris and Trump remain locked in what the Guardian’s poll tracker calls a nail-bitingly close presidential race.
On Tuesday evening, the polling expert Nate Silver tweeted that, if Harris loses, “you’re going to get a hot take … from me about Joe Biden”.
Hinchcliffe, the host of a podcast called Kill Tony, was the first speaker at a rally for Trump at Madison Square Garden on Sunday night. His racist comments have sparked broad condemnation, including from Republicans, and were even disavowed by the Trump campaign.
“There’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. Yeah. I think it’s called Puerto Rico,” Hinchcliffe said. He also said that Latinos “love making babies … There’s no pulling out. They don’t do that. They come inside, just like they did to our country.”
NBC reported that Hinchcliffe had tested the same joke about Puerto Rico, and that the joke had bombed, at a comedy set in New York the night before the Trump rally.",2024-10-30
Guardian,Californians want controls on AI. Why did Gavin Newsom veto an AI safety bill? | Garrison Lovely,"Governor Gavin Newsom of California recently killed SB1047, a first-of-its-kind artificial intelligence safety bill, arguing that its focus on only the largest AI models leaves out smaller ones that can also be risky. Instead, he says, we should pass comprehensive regulations on the technology.
If this doesn’t sound quite right to you, you’re not alone.
Despite claims by prominent opponents of the bill that “literally no one wants this”, SB1047 was popular – really popular. It passed the California legislature with an average of two-thirds of each chamber voting in favor. Six statewide polls that presented pro and con arguments for the bill show strong majorities in support, which rose over time. A September national poll found 80% of Americans thought Newsom should sign the bill. It was also endorsed by the two most-cited AI researchers alive, along with more than 110 current and former staff of the top-five AI companies.
The core of SB1047 would have established liability for creators of AI models in the event they cause a catastrophe and the developer didn’t take appropriate safety measures.
These provisions received support from at least 80% of California voters in an August poll.
So how do we make sense of this divide?
The aforementioned surveys were all commissioned or conducted by SB1047-sympathetic groups, prompting opponents to dismiss them as biased.
But even when a bill-sympathetic polling shop collaborated with an opponent to test “con” arguments in September, 62% of Californians were in favor.
Moreover, these results don’t surprise me at all. I’m writing a book on the economics and politics of AI and have analyzed years of nationwide polling on the topic. The findings are pretty consistent: people worry about risks from AI, favor regulations, and don’t trust companies to police themselves. Incredibly, these findings tend to hold true for both Republicans and Democrats.
So why would Newsom buck the popular bill?
Well, the bill was fiercely resisted by most of the AI industry, including Google, Meta and OpenAI. The US has let the industry self-regulate, and these companies desperately don’t want that to change – whatever sounds their leaders make to the contrary.
AI investors such as the venture fund Andreessen Horowitz, also known as a16z, mounted a smear campaign against the bill, saying anything they thought would kill the bill and hiring lobbyists with close ties to Newsom.
AI “godmother” and Stanford professor Fei-Fei Li parroted Andreessen Horowitz’s misleading talking points about the bill in the pages of Fortune – never disclosing that she runs a billion-dollar AI startup backed by the firm.
Then, eight congressional Democrats from California asked Newsom for a veto in an open letter, which was first published by an Andreessen Horowitz partner.
The top three names on the congressional letter – Zoe Lofgren, Anna Eshoo, and Ro Khanna – have collectively taken more than $4m in political contributions from the industry, accounting for nearly half of their lifetime top-20 contributors. Google was their biggest donor by far, with nearly $1m in total.
The death knell probably came from the former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, who published her own statement against the bill, citing the congressional letter and Li’s Fortune op-ed.
In 2021, reporters discovered that Lofgren’s daughter is a lawyer for Google, which prompted a watchdog to ask Pelosi to negotiate her recusal from antitrust oversight roles.
Who came to Lofgren’s defense? Eshoo and Khanna.
Three years later, Lofgren remains in these roles, which have helped her block efforts to rein in big tech – against the will of even her Silicon Valley constituents.
Pelosi’s 2023 financial disclosure shows that her husband owned between $16m and $80m in stocks and options in Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Nvidia.
When I asked if these investments pose a conflict of interest, Pelosi’s spokesperson replied: “Speaker Pelosi does not own any stocks, and she has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions.”
SB1047’s primary author, California state senator Scott Wiener, is widely expected to run for Pelosi’s congressional seat upon her retirement. His likely opponent? Christine Pelosi, the former speaker’s daughter, fueling speculation that Pelosi may be trying to clear the field.
In Silicon Valley, AI is the hot thing and a perceived ticket to fortune and power. In Congress, AI is something to regulate … later, so as to not upset one of the wealthiest industries in the country.
But the reality on the ground is that AI is more a source of fear and resentment. California’s state legislators, who are more down-to-earth than high-flying national Democrats, appear to be genuinely reflecting – or even moderating – the will of their constituents.
Sunny Gandhi of the youth tech advocacy group Encode Justice, which co-sponsored the bill, told me: “When you tell the average person that tech giants are creating the most powerful tools in human history but resist simple measures to prevent catastrophic harm, their reaction isn’t just disbelief – it’s outrage. This isn’t just a policy disagreement; it’s a moral chasm between Silicon Valley and Main Street.”
Newsom just told us which of these he values more.

Guardian,Five ways a Trump presidency would be disastrous for the climate,"1. A dangerous and uncertain futureAmid the frenetic bombast of politics, it is easy to overlook the long legacies of electoral decisions. Action or inaction on the climate crisis in the span of just the next few years will help decide the tolerability of the climate for generations not yet born.
“We have now brought the planet into climatic conditions never witnessed by us or our prehistoric relatives,” as a recent paper authored by more than a dozen scientists warned. “We are on the brink of an irreversible climate disaster. This is a global emergency beyond any doubt.”
Wind turbines operate at a wind farm near solar panels in California on 6 March 2024. Photograph: Mario Tama/Getty ImagesThere is enough momentum behind the record growth of clean energy that it won’t be utterly derailed by a Trump presidency. But a Trump White House would still have a tangible impact, adding, by some estimates, several billion tonnes of heat-trapping gases that wouldn’t otherwise be in the atmosphere, gumming up the international response, subjecting more people to flood or fire or toxic air. It would help prod societies ever closer to the brink of an unlivable climate.
Kamala Harris has declined to lay out much of a vision on how she would tackle the climate crisis, and barely even mentions it on the campaign trail, but to some experts the stakes are compellingly clear. “With Kamala Harris, there’s a good chance we can avert truly catastrophic global climate impacts,” said Mann. “With Trump there is not. It’s night and day.”
2. Climate denialism would return to the Oval OfficeA new Trump administration would bring a jarring rhetorical shift. Unlike almost every other world leader – such as Joe Biden , who has called the climate crisis an “existential threat” – Trump dismisses and even mocks the threat of global heating.
In recent weeks, the former president has said that climate change is “one of the great scams of all time, people aren’t buying it any more” and has falsely claimed the planet “has actually got a bit cooler recently”, that rising sea levels will create “more oceanfront property”, that wind energy is “bullshit, it’s horrible” and even that cows and windows will be banned by Democrats if he loses.
Trump has coupled this with demands for unfettered oil and gas production in all corners of the US and has actively courted industry executives for donations. “He wholeheartedly believes we should produce our own energy sources here in the US, there’s no grey area there,” said Thomas Pyle, president of American Energy Alliance, a free market group.

He is instinctively in the right place on these issues – he wants to see more energy production across the board and less government intervention in the cars we drive and the stoves we have.”
Others see signs a second Trump presidency will be even more extreme on climate than the first iteration. “The style, the indifference to empirical evidence and the bold sweeping gestures are familiar,” said Barry Rabe, an energy policy expert at the University of Michigan. “But this sequel will be an aggressive, revenge-based repudiation of anyone who has challenged him in the past.”
3. Clean energy policies unpickedA primary target for a new Trump administration would be the landmark climate bill signed by Biden that is pushing hundreds of billions of dollars to renewable energy deployment, electric car production and battery manufacturing.
Trump has promised to “terminate Kamala Harris’s green new scam and rescind all of the unspent funds”. In its place, oil and gas production, already at all-time highs , will be boosted by opening up Alaska’s Arctic to drilling and ending a pause on liquified natural gas exports to “cut the cost of energy in half within the first 12 months of taking office”.
Achieving a full repeal of the climate bill, named the Inflation Reduction Act, will hinge upon the composition of Congress. Even if Republicans won both the House of Representatives and the US Senate, as well as the White House, there would still be some pushback from conservative members who have seen a disproportionate torrent of clean energy investment and jobs flow to their districts.
Joe Biden signs the Inflation Reduction Act at the White House on 16 August 2022. Photograph: Drew Angerer/Getty Images“I don’t think we will see the Inflation Reduction Act fully overturned, it will be more surgical than that,” said Kelly Sims Gallagher, an environmental policy expert at Tufts University. “The US is already a top oil and gas producer but what would likely change is the companion investment in low-carbon energy. That seems less likely under a Trump administration.”
Without Congress, Trump will still be able to slow the rollout of spending and demolish regulatory actions taken under Biden, such as rules cutting pollution from coal-fired power plants, cars and trucks and efforts to shield disadvantaged communities from pollution. Penalties for leaking methane, a potent greenhouse gas that is rising at a galloping pace , will also be targeted following complaints from some of Trump’s top oil industry donors.
In his first term, Trump squashed more than 100 environmental rules but the courts halted much of his agenda. This time, a more ruthlessly efficient and prepared operation is expected , backed by a conservative-aligned judicial system, including the supreme court itself. “He will work quickly, I think, to dismantle the Biden approach,” said Pyle.
4. A purge of scienceA far more ideological slant on science and expertise is likely to emerge should Trump win office, with Project 2025 , the conservative manifesto authored by many former Trump officials, calling for civil servants to be replaced by loyal political operatives.
Mentions of the climate crisis were sidelined or erased during Trump’s last term and a repeat is widely expected. Climate considerations for new government projects will likely be ditched, states will get less help to prepare for and recover from disasters and public weather forecasts will be privatized, Project 2025 has suggested.
Scientists, who remember research being buried and Trump publicly changing an official hurricane forecast map with a Sharpie pen during his first term, fear a reprise. “The United States will become an unsafe place for scientists, intellectuals and anyone who doesn’t fit” with the Republican agenda, Mann said.
Donald Trump holds up a hurricane forecast map that he marked up at the White House on 4 September 2019. Photograph: Michael Reynolds/EPATrump has said that “nuclear warming”, which seems to be a reference to nuclear war, is a greater threat than global warming and that while he likes the idea of clean water and air “at the same time you can’t give up your country, you can’t say you can’t have jobs any more”.
When disasters, driven by a warming world, do hit the US, Trump has signaled he will withhold federal aid to places that didn’t vote for him in return for unrelated concessions. The former president did this multiple times when in office, his ex-staffers have revealed , and recently threatened California with a repeat.
5. International relations shakenAs president, Trump took several months to decide to remove the US from the Paris climate agreement. “This time I think he would do that on the very first day, likely with a lot of dramatic flourish,” said Rabe.
With the US, again, out of the international climate effort, American aid to developing countries vulnerable to floods, droughts and other disasters would also be slashed, along with cooperation with nations on other initiatives, such as cutting methane and curbing deforestation.

Photograph: Iván Valencia/APTrump’s fixation upon tariffs, meanwhile, would probably stymie the import of clean energy components to the US. Retaliatory tariffs, including penalties for carbon-intensive goods, could follow. “I’d expect an aggressive ‘America first’ role which will be a very interesting moment for the European Union with their carbon border adjustments – how will they respond to a more bullying America?” Rabe said.
As in Trump’s first term, US disengagement would raise fears that other countries will also withdraw from the climate fight, causing global heating to spin out of control. China, the world’s leading emitter, has retained a level of cooperation with the Biden administration on climate despite an overall strained relationship with the US, but this faces rupture if Trump wins.
“It’s safe to assume there won’t be any climate engagement between Beijing and Washington,” said Li Shuo, a China climate policy specialist at the Asia Society Policy Institute. “It would be negative for the US and for the world. The US still looms large on the global stage, so I’d expect Trump would sow greater resistance to a climate agenda in China. We will see that commitment to climate start to crumble.”",2024-10-28
Guardian,Former Puerto Rico governor criticizes racist language at Trump rally,"Puerto Rico’s former governor Ricardo Rosselló has been closely watching the fallout from the racist comments made during Donald Trump’s campaign rally on Sunday.
As someone involved in politics for much of his life, Rosselló – who has historically supported the Democratic party – heard reactions from both Republican colleagues and previously ambivalent voters.
“On the one side, what I’m seeing is people that were leaning towards voting for Trump are now thinking of either abstaining or voting for Harris,” Rosselló said, adding that the once-ambivalent voters are now using this moment as motivation to vote for Kamala Harris.
On Sunday evening, during Trump’s New York City campaign rally, a comedian called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” and made disparaging remarks about its people. The comments prompted indignation and anger among Puerto Ricans and other voters nationwide.
Rosselló thinks the racist comments could lead to huge political ramifications for Trump in the lead-up to the 2024 election next week.
“I just believe, from my experience, that if President Trump addresses it and comes full force on it, and says, ‘I love the people of Puerto Rico, I completely reject the notion that they’re garbage, they’re the opposite of garbage, they are amazing people, they are patriots, proud US citizens’ – I’m just giving an example – then you can give something to the people directly from the horse’s mouth,” Rosselló said. “But if you don’t do that, then you let it all out for interpretation. You let it all out for doubt and for people to speculate on what the intent is. And that is a dangerous position to be put in.”
On political controversy, Rosselló can speak first-hand.

Rosselló faced tremendous backlash in 2019 when leaked messages from a group chat showed Rosselló and members of his cabinet exchanging misogynistic, racist and offensive texts. In some messages, members of the chat made fun of victims of 2017’s Hurricane Maria. In response to overwhelming protests, Rosselló, who had served as Puerto Rico’s governor for just over two years, stepped down.
“I don’t speak from a place of theory,” Rosselló said. “I speak from a place of experience. I’ve seen the power of words and what they can do, particularly what they can do when you underestimate them or when you don’t go out and define them yourself.”
For Rosselló, there is a “traditional notion” that “actions speak louder than words”, but, he added, “words speak louder than actions. And this is the reality that we’re living in right now – words are powerful things. They can be used for beautiful and amazing vision and construction. But they can be very destructive and painful.”
Also this weekend, outside Trump’s rally in New York City’s Madison Square Garden, Harris’s campaign unveiled its plans for Puerto Rico in Pennsylvania.
For some Puerto Rican voters, the stark contrast between the campaigns was significant. Rosselló said it had even led to some Republicans he works with to abandon their support for Trump.
“Our people are wonderful, beautiful, intelligent and creative people,” Rosselló said. “President Trump needs to reject these statements. I don’t see another way out. If he doesn’t, his silence will speak volumes and implicitly support the notions that were stated there.”
Trump, on Tuesday, defended the Madison Square Rally, calling it a “love fest”. At a rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania – which has a sizeable Latino population – Trump also praised Puerto Ricans later on Tuesday, saying: “Nobody loves our Latino community and our Puerto Rican community more than I do.”
And while it is unclear if the Trump administration knew of the forthcoming racist comments, Rosselló said that the Trump administration most likely knew what Hinchcliffe would say: “As somebody that knows how some of these events go – because I was in politics – my question was: how did they let a comedian come and say those things? It’s not something that was said off the cuff, it was written material. How did that pass the test?”
NBC News reported that Hinchcliffe had workshopped the racist line at a comedy club the previous night.
Puerto Rico became a colony of the US after the Spanish-American war and Puerto Ricans became US citizens in 1917. Due to the island’s status as a US territory, Puerto Ricans living on the island are unable to vote; those living in US states, however, are eligible to cast a ballot.
Under the Trump administration, tensions between the White House and the island grew. In response to the devastation from Hurricane Maria in 2017, then president Trump considered the idea of selling the island. Trump also blocked and delayed relief aid and assistance to Puerto Rico.
Rosselló, a lifelong supporter of the Puerto Rican New Progressive party, served as governor during Trump’s presidency until his resignation in 2019. His father, Pedro Rosselló, was also governor from 1993 to 2001. Now Rosselló is a shadow member of the US House of Representatives, representing Puerto Rico in Congress, and he also runs a bipartisan organization advocating for Puerto Rican statehood.
Economic, political and environmental crises have gravely affected the island in recent years. As the 2024 elections grow near, Rosselló is appealing to the US federal government for Puerto Rican statehood.
“I’ve been very clear and eager that the status issue of Puerto Rico needs to be resolved,” Rosselló said. “The territory is the root cause of many of our ills … I think that anybody that seriously wants to help Puerto Rico needs to let us make a final decision on the status, to transition away from the territory status that does not work.”
As election day approaches, the Puerto Rican voting bloc is notable – particularly in Florida, New York and Pennsylvania, a key battleground state.
“At the end of the day, they have just helped us,” the Philadelphia city council member Quetcy Lozada, a Harris supporter, said earlier this week. “They have helped the Democratic party for where we will be on November 5.”",2024-10-30
Guardian,‘Frightening to consider’: fears grow over Trump’s threats to political foes,"Donald Trump’s extremist attacks on top Democrats as “the enemy from within” and talk of deploying the military against political foes if he wins the election are stark signs Trump will endanger the rule of law in America, say former US justice department officials and scholars.
Trump’s threats – singling out ex-speaker Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff and others as “the enemy from within” and “more dangerous than China [and] Russia” – jibe with his earlier incendiary talk of using a return to the White House to seek “revenge” against political foes led by Joe Biden. He also suggested the military could be used to quell violence at the polls from “radical left lunatics”.
Those comments, along with Trump’s adamant refusal to say clearly he will accept the election results if he is defeated, prompt critics to say Trump poses unprecedented dangers to the US constitution.
Critics call Trump’s campaign rhetoric especially worrisome since it squares with his efforts after he lost the 2020 election to falsely claim the voting was rigged, while scheming to overturn the results before a mob of his allies on January 6 attacked the Capitol as Congress was certifying the results.
Alarm about a second Trump term were heightened this month when Trump’s former chief of staff and former four-star marine general John Kelly condemned him in the Atlantic as unfit to govern and having said: “I need to have the kind of generals that Hitler had.”
Ex-justice department officials are appalled by Trump’s demonizing his political foes as “the enemy from within”, words used by the demagogic senator Joe McCarthy, and ruminating about using the military against them to exact revenge.
“Trump’s anti-democratic, authoritarian rhetoric has been ratcheted up the closer we draw to the election,” said Michael Bromwich, a former inspector general at the justice department.
“Rather than keeping a covert enemies list, he publicly names his enemies against whom he vows to take action. The implications for a Trump justice department, charged with dealing with Trump’s lust to retaliate against these enemies, are frightening to consider.”
Bromwich said: “People who take their oath to the constitution seriously have trouble wrapping their heads around someone who views the constitution and the rule of law as nuisances to be circumvented rather than a set of principles to be scrupulously honored.”
Other justice department veterans express similar worries about a second Trump term.
“Trump’s rhetoric is dangerous for two reasons. Using the powers of the presidency to go after his political rivals is an incredibly dangerous deviation from democratic norms and the rule of law,” said Barbara McQuade, a former federal prosecutor in eastern Michigan and a law professor at the University of Michigan.
“The rule of law requires that we apply the law equally to everyone, and not in retaliation for political activity or speech. Second, the military is to be used against our foreign adversaries, not our own citizens. These tactics are things we see in authoritarian regimes, not democracies. Following through on these threats would change the country as we know it.”
Fears about how Trump would rule in a second term have metastasized as former senior top officials in his first administration have gone public, labeling him a fascist and unfit to be president again.
Mark Milley, Trump’s ex-chair of the joint chiefs of staff, was in quoted in Bob Woodward’s new book calling Trump “fascist to the core”.
Kelly, too, told the New York Times that Trump met the definition of a “fascist” and “prefers the dictator approach to government”, and once said that “Hitler did some good things”.
Trump in turn attacked Kelly last Friday, calling him a “whack job” and boasting that he had fired Kelly, who was a “nutjob to start off with. These are phoney stories by a general that got fired.”
Thirteen former Trump officials signed a letter supporting Kelly’s charges and attacking Trump’s “disdain for the American military and admiration for dictators like Hitler”.

Trump’s obsession with having a military loyal to him as Hitler did, fits with a larger pattern in Trump world: Trump and his allies have made it clear that loyalty to Trump will be a prerequisite to serve in a new administration, and that moderate Republicans would not be welcome.
Critics say Trump is intent on creating an administration without the kinds of guardrails that existed with people like Kelly and Milley as checks against his authoritarian instincts, a point that is underscored by Trump’s campaign talk of using the justice department to seek “revenge” on his enemies.
That mindset was palpable when Trump told the podcast host Joe Rogan on Friday that the country faces a “bigger problem … with the enemy from within” than the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, and allowed that his “biggest mistake” as president was hiring “disloyal people”.
Trump’s latest incendiary claims fit too with his call in 2022 on Truth Social for the “termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the constitution”, which he justified by citing his false claims the 2020 election was stolen.
Tim Naftali, a senior research scholar at Columbia University, said: “Trump wants a second go without any obstacles from people who will tell him what he can’t do. People who served as guardrails during his first term are now worried about what he will do if he gets a second term without guardrails. From personal experience they know that his instincts are injurious to US national security and our constitutional democracy.”
Naftali noted further that the supreme court’s much criticized ruling broadening presidential immunity “has made it easier for Trump, if he wins, to push his own people to do whatever he wants”.
“The court has made this a more permissive environment for an abusive president. If he’s re-elected, Trump can take advantage of the new permissive environment created by the supreme court which wraps his official acts in at least presumed immunity.”
Naftali’s warnings are buttressed by Trump’s repeated threats to seek revenge against his enemies, whom he has often portrayed as part of a “deep state” conspiracy against him that he claims involves a weaponized justice department waging “lawfare” against him.
Little wonder that Trump last Thursday upped his attacks on Jack Smith, the special counsel who has filed criminal charges against the former president over his election subversion efforts in 2020, and for improperly taking hundreds of classified documents with him when he left office. Trump said he would fire Smith in “two seconds” and that he should be “thrown out of the country”.
Justice department veterans voice alarm about Trump’s barrage of autocratic-style threats about seeking revenge on foes in both parties if he defeats Kamala Harris.
“For a long time, Donald Trump has been promising to use government to punish his enemies. It is shocking but not surprising that he has now adopted the language of Joseph McCarthy by labelling his likely targets ‘the enemy from within’”, said Donald Ayer, a former deputy attorney general under the former president George HW Bush.
“But this is just one more piece of his single-minded effort to divide the American people and establish his own authoritarian power by attacking the basic principles that have long united us. The American people must not let him get away with this.”
Other justice department alumni see Trump posing unprecedented dangers if he wins again.
“No one in our history has ever stressed the constitution the way Trump has,” said Ty Cobb, a lawyer who served in the Trump White House and former justice department official.
Cobb added: “The founders could not have conceived of the possibility a crippled narcissist like Trump, a court-determined rapist with dozens of criminal felony convictions, serious pending charges, some involving functional insurrection, and civil fraud liability in the hundreds of millions, could possibly be a serious presidential candidate, much less elected.”
Bromwich, too, sees the prospect of Trump in power again as frightening.
“What would a justice department staffed by senior officials willing to implement Trump’s authoritarian, unconstitutional, and retaliation-minded agenda look like? Like nothing we have ever seen: staffed by lawyers with much ambition and little principle, working for a president himself protected by the immunity from prosecution conferred by the supreme court.”",2024-10-30
Guardian,At least 64 people feared dead after torrential rain and floods in Spain,"At least 64 people are feared to have died after torrential rains hit southern and eastern Spain on Tuesday, bringing flash floods that raged through towns and cut off roads and railway lines.
As the search continued for the missing, people were urged to stay off the roads and away from swollen rivers amid warnings that the severe weather was not over and that the number of fatalities could still rise.
The Valencian government’s emergency coordination centre said its multiple victims protocol had been activated, adding that the latest number of known fatalities in the region was 62.
The central government delegation in the central Castilla-La Mancha region reported two deaths, including an 88-year-old woman found dead in the city of Cuenca.
Speaking on Wednesday morning, Valencia’s regional president said it was still too early to provide a comprehensive death toll. “These are very difficult hours for relatives and for the disappeared,” said Carlos Mazón. “We will confirm the number of victims over the coming hours but right now it’s impossible to offer a precise figure. We’re in shock.”
The regional government also urged people to stay off flooded or cut-off roads, saying the emergency services needed access and that more flood water could accumulate.
More than 1,000 soldiers from Spain’s emergency response units were deployed to the devastated areas, and the ministry of defence offered mobile morgues if needed.
Images on Spanish TV showed turbulent, muddy water surging through the town of Letur in the eastern province of Albacete on Tuesday, dragging cars through its streets.
“Yesterday was the worst day of my life,” Ricardo Gabaldón, the mayor of Utiel, a town in Valencia, told the national broadcaster RTVE. He said several people were still missing in his town. “We were trapped like rats. Cars and rubbish containers were flowing down the streets. The water was rising to 3 metres,” he said.
One elderly couple was rescued from the upper story of their house by a military unit using a bulldozer, with three soldiers accompanying them in the huge shovel.
Television reports ran videos shot by panicked residents showing waters flooding into the ground floors of flats, streams overflowing their banks and at least one bridge giving way.
Spain has experienced similar autumn storms in recent years, but nothing has compared to the devastation over the past two days.
A high-speed train with nearly 300 people on board derailed near Málaga, although rail authorities said no one was hurt. The high-speed rail service between Valencia city and Madrid was interrupted, as were several commuter lines.
Spain’s central government has set up a crisis committee to help coordinate rescue efforts.
In a televised statement on Wednesday morning, Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, called for unity, solidarity and vigilance. “We mustn’t let our guard down because the weather front is still wreaking havoc and we can’t say that this devastating episode is over,” he said.
“There are still weather warnings in Andalucía, Valencia, Aragón, Castilla y León, in Cataluña, in Extremadura, in Navarra, in La Rioja and in Ceuta. That’s why I’m asking people in those areas to take special care: to stay off the roads; to avoid travelling close to ravines, riverbanks and riverbeds, and to heed the advice of the emergency services and of the police. No one should be putting their life at risk.”
The prime minister said Spain had had more than its fair share of natural and health emergencies in recent years, mentioning the Covid pandemic, Storm Filomena in January 2021, and the volcanic eruptions in the Canary islands that year. But, he said, such adversity brought out the best in the country.
“We’re going to lend a hand and help those who can’t get into their homes or who are looking for relatives or friends or loved ones,” he said. “But most of all right now, we’re going to stand with those who are suffering the loss of their loved ones.”
Spain’s congress held a minute’s silence to commemorate the dead, while King Felipe also offered his support to the families of the dead and missing, saying he was “heartbroken” by the news of the flooding and its fatalities. “I’m sending strength, encouragement and all the necessary support to all those affected,” he said. “We recognise and appreciate all the local and regional authorities and the emergency and security services as they continue with the titanic task they have been carrying out since the very first moment.”
By 10am on Wednesday, the rains in Valencia had subsided. But Spain’s national weather service forecast more storms through Thursday, with the rains moving to the north-east of the Iberian peninsula.
The intense rain has been attributed to a phenomenon known as the gota fría, or “cold drop”, which occurs when cold air moves over the warm waters of the Mediterranean. This creates atmospheric instability, causing warm, saturated air to rise rapidly, leading to the formation of towering cumulonimbus clouds in a matter of hours and dumping heavy rain across eastern parts of Spain.

Guardian,The big lie 2.0: Trump plan to subvert 2024 election more organized than ever,"There is little doubt that Donald Trump will refuse to accept a defeat in November’s US presidential election.
The former president, who is deadlocked in the polls with Kamala Harris, has spent months priming his supporters to believe the only way he could lose is through fraud. “If I lose – I’ll tell you what, it’s possible. Because they cheat. That’s the only way we’re gonna lose, because they cheat,” he said at a rally in September.
He has refused to say, several times, that he will unequivocally accept the results of the election, only going as far to say that he will if “it’s fair and legal and good”. Having escaped any accountability for the attack on the Capitol on January 6, he has embraced those who violently attacked the US government to protest against the 2020 election results, calling it a “day of love”.
JD Vance, his running mate, has, at times, been even more forthright. The Ohio senator has said he would not have certified the 2020 race. During the vice-presidential debate in early October, he refused to say that Trump lost the 2020 election. He later said, more definitively, that he did not believe Trump lost four years ago.
But this year the Trump ticket’s efforts to pre-emptively deny the results in case of a loss of the election go beyond rhetoric. They are now backed up by widespread party support and a highly organized, massive legal apparatus.
“The effort to try to subvert the outcome is more thought-out, more strategic, more organized, more coordinated in 2020,” said Sean Morales-Doyle, director of the voting rights program at the Brennan Center for Justice.
Republicans are primed to support Trump’s efforts. Nearly one in five Republican voters believe Trump should declare the election result invalid if he loses, according to a recent survey by the Public Religion Research Institute (12% of Democrats said Harris, who has committed to accepting the election results, should do the same).
Dozens of people who have challenged the results of the last presidential election are in local offices where they have power over certifying vote totals. Led by Cleta Mitchell, a Trump ally who aided his efforts to overturn the election four years ago, Republicans have organized a massive effort to monitor election offices, challenge voters, and work in election precincts.
At least 35 officials who have refused to certify elections since 2020 will have a role over certifying the vote this fall, according to a report by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew), a watchdog group.
The Republican National Committee has spent months filing frivolous lawsuits that contain specious allegations of fraud. Legal experts say Republicans have no chance of winning the suits ahead of the election – many have already been thrown out of court – but they are instead designed to generate headlines and create the impression that something is amiss with the voter rolls.
The Harris campaign, voting rights lawyers, and civil rights groups are all preparing for the possibility of a chaotic post-election period that could include a flood of lawsuits trying to get ballots thrown out in an attempt to swing the election.
While there is little doubt that Trump will try and contest an election loss, experts are also nearly certain that he will not succeed. Judges turned away nearly every case Trump filed to try and overturn the election results – 61 in total – and experts expect that they will do so again.
Lawyers and election officials have also spent the last four years learning from what happened and are prepared to swiftly go to court at the first whiff of disruption. The month following election day could be chaotic and confusing, but they’re confident that the rightful winner of the election will ultimately be certified.
“The response to these attempts is also more coordinated and prepared. Election officials have seen what the election deniers playbook looks like over the last couple of elections and know what to prepare for,” Morales-Doyle said.
Vote-rigging allegations
Trump’s effort to contest a possible loss is likely to begin as votes are counted on election night. Just like 2020, it is likely that there will not be a winner declared on election night and key swing states are going to take hours or even days to count their ballots. The closer the election margin – and it could be very close this year – the longer it will take for news outlets to be confident enough to call the race, which could add to the uncertainty.
There’s nothing unusual about that lag. But Trump is planning to declare that the vote against him is rigged and that the slow count is evidence something is amiss, Rolling Stone reported in October.
That declaration of fraud is likely to be accompanied by swift lawsuits alleging various irregularities with the vote, supported by affidavits from people who say they saw something unusual at the polls or when workers are counting votes. While those claims are likely to be debunked, they’re likely to fuel the narrative that something wrong happened in 2020.
The Republican National Committee is already forecasting what these suits will look like. Over the last several months, they have filed suits in swing states alleging that states have dead people, non-citizens and other ineligible people on their voter rolls and asked courts to remove them. Judges have already tossed many of the lawsuits.
In Michigan, a swing state, for example, the Republican National Committee filed a lawsuit in March claiming that 76 of the state’s 83 counties had more eligible voters than citizens eligible to vote or “suspiciously high” voter registration rates. The RNC sent out a press release accompanying the suit, saying it showed Michigan had “inflated and inaccurate voter rolls ahead of the 2024 election” and the suit earned many headlines.
Michigan officials noted that the RNC had not identified a “single voter in any Michigan county who is ineligible to be registered but nonetheless appears as an active voter.” A federal judge dismissed the case on 22 October, finding that Michigan already had reasonable procedures for removing voters (federal law requires a waiting period before a state can remove a voter it suspects has moved from rolls).
The watchdog group Protect Democracy calls these and similar lawsuits “zombie lawsuits” and predicts that Trump and allies could try and revive them after election day to challenge the election results.
Nikhel Sus, a lawyer with Crew, predicted Trump and allies would revive some of the suits they’ve already filed, but that they wouldn’t go far.
“We’re going to see these zombie lawsuits come back to life in a strategic tactical way. And perhaps that was the goal from the outset,” he said. “You still need evidence to win a court case.”
Filing a case challenging voter eligibility before the election doesn’t give it a better chance of succeeding afterwards, Morales-Doyle of the Brennan Center said. Still, he said the litigation gives a false imprimatur to Trump’s claims of fraud.
“I do think you’re going to see after the election if people are upset about the outcome, pointing to “we’ve been saying for the last 8 months that they had bloated rolls and dead people on the rolls. Non-citizens on the rolls and the courts didn’t do anything about it,” he said.
After those suits are filed, Trump could move on to trying to stop certification of the vote at the local level. Long a little-followed process of elections, certification takes place at the local and state level to officialize vote totals after all of the ballots are tallied. Local boards – often staffed with party loyalists or little-known government officials – are responsible for undertaking this task, and generally do not have discretion not to certify.
But since 2020, Trump-aligned Republicans have embraced the idea that officials can refuse to certify the vote, something voting experts say is illegal. Across the country this year, officials on local boards of election have refused to certify primary and other elections, citing vague concerns about fraud. None of those efforts have been successful, and all of the boards have been forced to certify the results in the end.
Georgia, one of the seven battleground states, has been at the center of this push. Republican commissioners in Fulton county, home to Atlanta, have refused to certify elections twice this year. Trump-aligned Republicans on the State Election Board also passed last-minute rules this year that could have paved the pathway for local election officials to not certify the vote in November. A local judge blocked the rules, and said that discretion in the state is mandatory.
Nonetheless, Sus said he still expects that there will be local officials throughout the country who refuse to certify the vote, forcing groups to go to court to force certification.

“Even though it’s illegal and there will be potential stiff legal consequences for doing that sort of thing, it will cause some level of disruption,” he said. “There is a chance that by sowing distrust at the county level if president Trump loses the election that they’re going to lay the groundwork to dispute the results on January 6 2025 on the grounds that there was uninvestigated fraud or irregularities in particular states.”
Trump and Republicans could try and bring a final challenge when Congress issues the final certification of the electoral college vote on January 6, 2025. But they would find additional hurdles there.
In December 2022, Congress passed a bipartisan bill, the Electoral Count Reform Act, that made it harder to interfere with its certification of the electoral vote. Among other things, it made it harder for members of Congress to object to the electors, clarified that the vice president (Harris in 2025) cannot interfere with the vote count, and made it clear that only the governor of a state can certify a legitimate slate.
Narrative of voter fraud
In 2020, Trump pointed to the massive shift in mail-in voting and emergency changes in voting, driven by the pandemic, to create a narrative of fraud and claim the election was stolen. In 2024, Trump has shifted his focus to something else: non-citizen voting.
Several studies have shown that non-citizen voting is incredibly rare. And it is already illegal for non-citizens to vote in federal elections. Yet over the last year, Mitchell and other Republicans have led a robust campaign to seed the idea that non-citizen voting could affect Americans elections.
Earlier this year, Republicans passed a bill in the US House that would have required proof of citizenship to vote and outlawed non-citizen voting, something that is already illegal. It helped kickstart a the false narrative that Democrats are allowing non-citizens to cross the border to influence elections.
“Our elections are bad,” Trump said during the 10 September debate with Kamala Harris. “And a lot of these illegal immigrants coming in, they’re trying to get them to vote. They can’t even speak English. They don’t even know what country they’re in practically. And these people are trying to get them to vote. And that’s why they’re allowing them to come into our country.”
Other top Republicans have followed suit and amplified the false claims. And Republican election officials in a handful of states – Alabama, Texas, Virginia, and Tennessee – have all tried to back up Trump by releasing statements claiming to have found thousands of non-citizens on the rolls. Many of those announcements have been based on misleading methodology and further investigation has shown that many of those flagged have been eligible voters.
Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of X and a major backer of Trump, has significantly helped boost these lie that Democrats want non-citizens to vote, posting about it at least 52 times and racking up 700m views, according to an analysis by the Washington Post.
The Heritage foundation, a rightwing thinktank aligned with Trump, has peddled misleading videos purporting to show non-citizen registering. Other Republicans have also added to the rhetoric. “[Democrats] want illegals to vote now that they opened the border,” Steve Scalise, a top Republican in the US House, said in his speech at the Republican National Convention in July.
If Trump contests the election, the lie about non-citizen voting is likely to be at the center of his efforts.
David Becker, the executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, said the emphasis on non-citizen voting was a clear effort to set the stage to claim the election was stolen.
“This will be one of the primary, but among many, false claims made if Trump loses,” he said in September. “And it will be false, but it still could be dangerous because it could incite his supporters to believing a totally secure election was stolen.”
‘There’s real harm being done’
Even though he’s confident that any effort to overturn the results of the election will be unsuccessful, Morales-Doyle is still worried about the long-term effects on American politics.
Democracies, he said, depend on people believing that their leaders are legitimately elected and that belief is rooted in the idea that elections are legitimate. Weakening the belief in the results of an election weakens that fundamental piece of a democratic society.
As election night approaches, Morales-Doyle said he was concerned about the long-lasting effects that questioning the election results would have.
“Democracy only works if people believe in it. And this is a whole movement that’s built around distrust of our elections and spreading that distrust and I think that’s really harmful,” he said. “I’m fairly confident that our institutions will hold and we will show once again that we have a resilient democracy in 2024, but I think that there’s real harm being done in the long term to our democracy by these attacks and these attempts to sow distrust.”",2024-10-26
Guardian,Can ex-governor’s anti-Trump stance swing key Senate seat for Republicans?,"At a conservative thinktank on 14th Street in Washington DC, awaiting Larry Hogan, the Republican candidate for US Senate in Maryland, one staffer turned to another. “It’s nice having something to vote for, for a change,” the staffer wryly said. Shortly after, the former governor arrived for his speech at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (Jinsa), part of his campaign to win in a state that hasn’t elected a Republican senator since 1980.
When he left the executive mansion in Annapolis last year, Hogan told his friendly audience, he had governed for eight years as a popular moderate but had not been looking for another job – “And frankly, I didn’t yearn to be a part of the divisiveness and dysfunction in Washington,” he said.
“But when I saw a bipartisan package to secure our border and to support Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan and other American allies fail because people were told [by Donald Trump] to vote against a critical [immigration] bill that they claimed to be for, it made me frustrated enough that I knew I had to step up and try to do something about the mess in Washington.”
Washington is not Maryland but the Old Line State is just a few miles up 14th from Jinsa. There, Hogan faces the Prince George’s county executive, Angela Alsobrooks, for an open seat in November – a race in which the Democrat, who if she wins will be only the third Black woman ever elected to the US Senate, enjoys significant polling leads.
The race has become potentially decisive in determining Senate control, and a test of anti-Trump sentiment on the right. Significant spending and endorsements are pouring in. Highly regarded as a local leader and “tough on crime” Democrat, Alsobrooks defeated a DC establishment candidate, the congressman David Trone, in her primary and is now piling on praise from party grandees. She recently released an ad featuring Barack Obama and secured support from the Washington Post.
On Thursday night, the two candidates will meet for a high-stakes debate.
In practical terms, it takes 51 votes – or 50 if your party holds the presidency – to control the Senate. Democrats currently hold it 51-49 but face tough contests to hold seats in Republican-leaning states such as Montana and Ohio. It means Maryland counts this year, and Hogan’s toughest challenge may lie in persuading enough Democratic voters they can trust him should Republicans retake the chamber with him as the 51st vote. In turn, Democrats know that if they cannot hold so deep blue a state as Maryland, they will in all likelihood lose control of the Senate.
Hogan is therefore seeking to depict himself as an antidote to Trump – and his rival as too far left. At Jinsa, talking foreign policy, he criticized Trump but he also knocked Alsobrooks, including for “repeatedly demand[ing] that Israel enact an immediate and unilateral ceasefire, and [for calling] for cutting off critical military aid”.
As popular as Hogan is – he stepped down as governor with a 77% approval rating – polling suggests that message is not landing. According to 538, since one tied poll in August, Alsobrooks’s lead has ranged from five to 17 points.
Hogan begged to differ. “I think it’s a very close race,” he said. “I’ve always been an underdog in every one of my races.
“There are people out there that we’ve still got to convince,” he added, “and we’ve got [then] 34 more days to do it, and I feel confident we’re going to win the race. It’s tough, though. I mean, we’re a very blue state, and we’re overcoming a huge deficit at the top of the ticket.”
Trump has been called many things, but “huge deficit” may be a new one. Hogan has said he won’t vote for Trump (or Kamala Harris), but must nonetheless fend off persistent questions about the man who rules his party. One recent ad from Hogan’s campaign deplored the “horror” of January 6. And yet, as Republicans from Trump and the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, on down know, sometimes a candidate must be allowed away from the party line.
In Maryland, Hogan is free to be Hogan. That’s to his advantage. To his disadvantage, Democrats from the Senate majority leader, Chuck Schumer, to Alsobrooks on down know Hogan has a bigger problem.
In June 2022, in the case Dobbs v Jackson, the US supreme court to which Trump appointed three hardliners removed the federal right to abortion. Two years on, Hogan insists he will not let his party go further.
“[Alsobrooks’s campaign] want[s] to focus on making it a cookie-cutter Democratic talking points race but it’s not, because I have a different position than most Republicans,” he said at the Jinsa event. “And so, you know, I’ve promised to be a sponsor to codify Roe v Wade, the 1973 ruling that previously safeguarded abortion rights, so that nobody comes between a woman and her doctor in any state in America, and to sponsor a bill to protect IVF.”
He also insisted that “most people are concerned about the economy. They’re concerned about affordability, inflation, they’re concerned about crime in their communities, and they’re concerned about securing the border and fixing [the] broken immigration system.”
Among Democratic rejoinders: while a member of the executive committee of the Republican Governors Association, Hogan worked to elect allies in states that now have stringent abortion bans. In his own state, in 2022, he vetoed a bill to expand abortion access. The same year, he said Trump “nominated incredible justices to the supreme court”, a comment Democrats have brought back to haunt him. Hogan says he was not referring to Dobbs but Alsobrooks is happy to keep the spotlight on the issue. As she recently said: “I think my opponent’s record is very clear where abortion care is concerned.”
Many Americans fear a national abortion ban, should Trump be president again. Hogan said he had been against that for decades “and I’ll be the one of the ones standing up, regardless of who the president is or who’s in control of Senate”. But he also said he would not support reform to the filibuster, the Senate rule that requires 60 votes for most legislation, in order to codify Roe.
“I think it’s a terrible idea, because it’s actually something that … my opponent and Donald Trump both agree on. They want to be able to jam things through on a 51-vote [majority].
”Right now, [the Senate is] a deliberative body where we actually have to find bipartisan cooperation and common sense and kind of common ground for the common good. That’s what I did in Maryland with a 70% Democratic legislature. We got things done.”
A few days after Hogan’s event at Jinsa, about 40 miles (65km) north-east in Baltimore, Democrats gathered at a canvassing hub. Once a wedding venue, the Majestic Hall of Events was surrounded by less-than-majestic auto shops and down-at-heel churches. Inside, Alsobrooks addressed a crowd organized by D4 Women in Action, linked to Delta Sigma Theta, one of the Divine Nine Black women’s sororities, to which Alsobrooks belongs.
In her speech, Alsobrooks spoke about her links to Baltimore and “the number one issue across our state, and the thing that people most desire to have: economic opportunity”. She also took shots at her opponent. “What did he do [as governor] when he had the opportunity to stand up for all of our families in Baltimore? He sent back $900m to the federal government.”
That was a reference to a 2015 decision to scrap a light rail project, a call that attracted lawsuits. But Alsobrooks also looked to the national stage, and the issue she wants foremost in voters’ minds.
“This race is bigger than both of us,” Alsobrooks told the Guardian. “Bigger than Larry Hogan the person. It’s bigger than Angela the person. It’s about issues and about the future. It is about reproductive freedom.”
Alsobrooks listed other policy priorities – “sensible gun legislation … economic opportunity” – as part of a platform “that really does favor hard-working people, middle-class families, and that is about preserving freedoms and democracy”. But protecting abortion rights was a theme to which she returned.
At Jinsa, Hogan said Democrats were trying to turn a state race into a national contest. Alsobrooks embraced the charge: “The former governor thinks he’s running to go back to Annapolis. We’re actually running to go to Washington DC, and we would represent Marylanders there.”
She added: “This [Republican Senate] caucus is led by people like Ted Cruz, Lindsey Graham, Rick Scott, Mitch McConnell, and they … have really proclaimed war on the reproductive freedoms of women. They have very clear records, and [Hogan has] aligned himself with the party whose policies do not align with the average Marylander.”
Much has been made of the warm relationship Hogan and Alsobrooks enjoyed when Hogan was governor. Asked about an unearthed Hogan comment – that Alsobrooks was a better Prince George’s county executive than his own father, the late congressman Lawrence Hogan – Alsobrooks said: “He has become, in a lot of ways, the kind of politician he says he despises, one who’s very disingenuous.
“But I think that people see through it. Marylanders are very savvy and they have seen how he has changed … and I think they will see through the disingenuous nature of his campaign, and will again vote to keep Maryland Democratic.”
Keeping Maryland Democratic will require turning out the vote. At the canvassing hub, one phone-banker wearily said: “Put in two shifts this morning.” A friend smiled back: “Only a hundred more to go.”
The same Jinsa staffer who earlier had said it was “nice to have something to vote for” with Hogan also said that he hadn’t felt so good about a Senate race since 2006 – which was still a defeat – in which “getting more than 40% felt like a moral victory”.
Back then, Ben Cardin, the Democrat retiring this year, beat Michael Steele, a Hogan-esque GOP moderate. Steele went on to chair the Republican National Committee, then became an MSNBC host and Never Trumper. Asked for his view of the current Maryland race, Steele was not as convinced of an Alsobrooks win as many other observers.
“This race was not a competitive race until Larry got into it,” Steele said. “He is a popular two-term governor who left, I think, an important mark on how politics play out in Maryland for Republicans and made this very competitive out of the gate, largely because people had come to trust his style of governance.
“It’s open, it’s compassionate, it’s concerned … I think a lot of people remember that.”
Steele said Hogan had a good chance of attracting split-ticket voters – rare beasts, precious to any campaign, in this case prepared to back Harris for president but Hogan for Senate.
It all added up to a warning for anyone expecting a comfortable Democratic win.
“I think the latest polling has Alsobrooks up by 11,” Steele said. “I don’t believe that, largely because when I’m out in neighborhoods talking to people, and from everything I can piece together, this race is a lot tighter than the traditionalists who look at Maryland think it to be.”

Guardian,"If Trump wins the election, Nato can expect more turbulence ahead","Politeness and convention dictate that European leaders try to sound noncommittal when asked whether a Donald Trump presidency would hurt Nato. But despite the rhetoric about “Trump-proofing”, Nato cohesion will be at risk from a hostile or isolationist Republican president, who has previously threatened to leave the alliance if European defence spending did not increase.
“The truth is that the US is Nato and Nato is the US; the dependence on America is essentially as big as ever,” said Jamie Shea, a former Nato official who teaches at the University of Exeter. “Take the new Nato command centre to coordinate assistance for Ukraine in Wiesbaden, Germany. It is inside a US army barracks, relying on US logistics and software.”
US defence spending will hit a record $968bn in 2024 (the proportion the US spends in Europe is not disclosed). The budgets of the 30 European allies plus Canada amount to $506bn, 34% of the overall total. It is true that 23 out of 32 members expect to spend more than 2% of GDP on defence this year, but in 2014, when the target was set, non-US defence spending in Nato was 24%. Lower than now but not dramatically so.
There are more than 100,000 US personnel stationed in Europe, more than the British army, a figure increased by more than 20,000 by Joe Biden in June 2022 in response to Russia’s attack on Ukraine. US troops have long been based in Germany, but a 3,000-strong brigade was moved by Biden into Romania, a forward corps command post is based in Poland, and US troops contribute to defending the Baltic states, while fighter and bomber squadrons are based in the UK and five naval destroyers in Spain.
Boris Pistorius, Germany’s defence minister, was recently asked whether Nato was ready for Trump. “Elections will have a result whatever,” he began, before acknowledging that much of Europe had been slow to increase defence budgets, missing the warning of Russia’s capture of Crimea in Ukraine in 2014 and only reacting substantively in 2022 after Russia’s full invasion. “What we did was push the snooze button and turn around,” Pistorius said.
In office, Trump hinted at leaving Nato at a chaotic summit in Brussels in 2018, in order to force other allies to increase defence spending.
During the 2024 election campaign Trump has not quite gone as far in public, though the blustering tone has been similar. In February, the Republican suggested he would encourage Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” to any country that was “delinquent” because it had “failed to pay” its dues.
It could be argued that Trump is simply in campaign mode. But there are expected to be discussions before the next Nato summit about setting a higher defence spending target, most likely at either 2.5% or 3%, partly driven by Russia’s overt aggression in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Trump’s love of attention, tolerance for chaos and last-minute decision-making mean it is unlikely Nato’s annual summits during a four-year presidency will be smooth affairs.
Shea said that Jens Stoltenberg, Nato’s recently departed secretary general, was successful at “appealing to Trump’s ego and vanity” by persuading him that his complaints had led to other alliance members increasing defence spending. A year after the debacle of Brussels, the 2019 Nato summit was relatively uneventful, partly because Trump said he had been persuaded that Nato had become “more flexible”.
The task for Stoltenberg’s replacement, the former Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte, will be similar if the Republican wins, Shea added. “Rutte knows Trump and can appeal to him as a solid European on defence spending,” he said. On a recent trip to London, however, Rutte took a different tack – wondering if Trump would want to risk isolation in “a harsh, uncompromising world” if the US to actually withdraw from Nato.
There are two significant differences now compared with Trump’s first term. Most obvious is the effect of the war in Ukraine on the eastern flank, where Finland and Sweden have joined and frontline countries have sharply lifted defence spending, most notably in Poland, whose budget has risen above 4% of GDP. Among the weapons Warsaw is in the process of buying are 1,000 K2 tanks from South Korea and more than 350 M1A1 Abrams tanks from the US.
Przemysław Biskup, from the Polish Institute of Foreign Affairs, said: “Increasing defence spending is not a controversial issue in Polish politics. The general approach is there is homework to be done, and we have to do it.” At the same time, fears that Trump might try force Ukraine into a humiliating peace by cutting off military aid to Kyiv are “very worrying” for eastern alliance members – leaving them little choice but to carry on spending and hoping Russia does not seek to cause havoc elsewhere.
Biskup also cautioned that there is “an obvious regional divergence emerging”, with eastern frontline nations spending well over 2% of GDP. Others farther west – most notably Italy, Canada, Belgium and Spain – spend less than 1.5%, though the advantage for a country like Poland is that it is gaining a “growing relative power” within the alliance framework.
A second difference is there is more sophisticated thinking in US conservative circles which, drawing on Trump’s instinctive complaints about European defence spending, gives retreating from Nato intellectual ballast. A widely cited article from February 2023 by Sumantra Maitra advocating the idea of a “dormant Nato” essentially argues that the US needs to pivot decisively to face the rising military power of China and as a corollary “to force a Europe defended by Europeans with only American naval [support] and as a logistics provider of last resort”.
That would imply significant US troop withdrawals, though the opportunity for Russian aggression is limited by the fact that the Kremlin is heavily employed in Ukraine. Even if that war were to halt on favourable terms to Moscow – if Trump could actually force a peace on Ukraine – the estimated 600,000 casualties Russia has suffered and the destruction of military materiel would probably mean it would take perhaps a decade or more to recover further offensive potential.
Viljar Lubi, Estonia’s ambassador to the UK, argued it may be possible to link the importance of Nato supporting Ukraine in its war against Russia to longer-term US concerns about China articulated by American conservatives. “I wonder if [seeing] North Korean troops on the soil of Ukraine will change the calculus. Already we’ve seen Iranian weapons ending up in both Ukraine and the Middle East,” he said. “What if it’s a proxy war in Ukraine – and Russia is a proxy, a Chinese proxy,” he asked.
It is a neat, if chilling argument, and one that was made by Pistorius and his British counterpart, John Healey. The entry of North Korea on Russia’s side of the Ukraine war showed there was an “indivisible link with security concerns in the Indo-Pacific as well”, Healey argued. But whether it will be persuasive enough for Trump, whose politics are largely instinctive and personality-led, is less certain.
With tough spending decisions looming, and a war continuing on the edge of Europe, a Trump presidency promises, at the very least, to be bumpy. Meanwhile, the alliance’s post-cold war relevance has never been higher.",2024-10-29
Guardian,Obama says ‘you can count on Kamala’ at Philadelphia rally – as it happened,"The Guardian’s Alice Hermanwas at the rally given by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders for Harris in Wisconsin earlier.
At the rally, Ocasio-Cortez likened Donald Trump’s anti-immigrant remarks to the words of Adolf Hitler and sought to rally progressive support for Harris.
The New York congresswoman called the election a “precipice” and condemned the former president’s Madison Square Garden rally, where a comic referred to Puerto Rico as “garbage”, spurring widespread outrage on the island.
“They knew exactly what they were doing; let’s dispense with this idea that this is a joke,” said Ocasio-Cortez. She denounced Trump’s guests for saying “absolutely horrific things” about women and minorities.
“It’s the same kind of logic that says a Puerto Rican girl from the Bronx has no business connecting with the community of Madison, Wisconsin,” said Ocasio-Cortez, in a speech that sought to reject Trump’s racist rally and project a vision of unity.
Here is our full report on Obama’s rally for Harris earlier, from Matthew Cantor and Lois Beckett:
Barack Obama made an impassioned pitch for Kamala Harris at a Philadelphia rally with Bruce Springsteen on Monday, telling voters: “It’s not just policies that are on the ballot, it’s who we are.
“Whether this election is making you feel excited or scared, or hopeful, or frustrated, or anything in between: do not sit back,” the former president said. “Put down your phone and vote.”
Speaking in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania as Democrats make a final push for support, Obama – sleeves rolled up and relaxed – ripped into Donald Trump with a blend of criticism and humour. “We have to reject the kind of politics of division and hatred that we saw represented” at Sunday’s Madison Square Garden rally, where a comedian opening for Trump made a series of racist jokes.
“Here’s a good rule,” Obama said. “If somebody does not respect you, if somebody does not see you as fellow citizens with equal claims to opportunity, to the pursuit of happiness, to the American dream, you should not vote for them.”
David Simon, who wrote the TV show the The Wire, among other things, has added his name to the growing list of people cancelling their Washington Post subscriptions following the editorial board’s decision not to endorse a candidate this election.
Simon says he wasn’t going to cancel, but after reading Jeff Bezos’s op-ed explaining the decision, has decided to do so:
In his essay Bezos – who founded Amazon – said he had taken the decision because he was worried that people had lost trust in the traditional US media and were getting their news from social media, leaving them vulnerable to disinformation.
“Most people believe the media is biased. Anyone who doesn’t see this is paying scant attention to reality, and those who fight reality lose,” Bezos, one of the world’s richest men, said.
He added: “Presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election. No undecided voters in Pennsylvania are going to say: ‘I’m going with Newspaper A’s endorsement.’ None. What presidential endorsements actually do is create a perception of bias. A perception of non-independence. Ending them is a principled decision, and it’s the right one.”
Here is our full report from Trump’s rally earlier in Atlanta:
Donald Trump yet again descended upon Atlanta with a week and a day to go, looking for votes in a state that is rapidly running out of voters to woo.
“I do hear the votes are coming in very nicely,” the former president said. When he asked the crowd who had voted, about half raised their hands and cheered. “We’ve got to finish it off.”
Just before Trump took the stage on Monday afternoon across the street from the CNN debate stage that took Joe Biden out of the race, Georgia’s early vote count crossed the 3m mark. More than 40% of Georgia voters have already cast a ballot. About 5 million people voted in Georgia’s 2020 presidential race.
Trump refrained from his regular practice of trashing Atlanta, though he disparaged Fulton county’s district attorney Fani Willis and the election interference charges he still faces, referring to “Fani and her boyfriend” attempting to lock up their “political opponent”.
He described the Harris campaign as one of “demonization and hate”, then referred to her “radical, lunatic left policies”.
“They say: ‘He’s Hitler.’ They say: ‘He’s a Nazi.’ I’m the opposite of a Nazi,” he said. “How can Kamala Harris lead America when she hates Americans? … They’re very bad people who are a threat to democracy.”
Trump took issue with recent criticism made by Michelle Obama. “She was nasty,” Trump said.
There are nearly a million Puerto Ricans living in swing states, according to Politico. Because they live on the US mainland, they are eligible to vote next week.
Almost half a million live in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania.
The Archbishop of the Puerto Rico Archdiocese, Roberto O. González Nieves, has called on Trump to personally apologise for the racist anti-Puerto Rican remarks made at his Madison Square Garden rally in New York, Politico reports.
Sanders addresses voter concerns about Gaza in new video
Vermont senator Bernie Sanders has released a video addressing voter concerns about the Biden-Harris administration’s response to Israel’s war on Gaza.
In it, he seeks to address a comment and question he says he has heard repeatedly: “I disagree with Kamala’s position on the war in Gaza. How can I vote for her?”
In the video, Sanders says that his best answer is, in part, “Even on this issue, Donald Trump and his rightwing friends are worse. In the senate, in Congress, the Republicans have worked overtime to block humanitarian aid to the starving children in Gaza. The president and vice-president both support getting as much humanitarian aid as possible into Gaza as soon as possible.”
He then repeats comments made by Trump, including saying that Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu has is” doing a good job” and that the Gaza Strip would make excellent beach-front property for development.
“After Kamala wins, we will together do everything that we can to change US policy towards Netanyahu,” Sanders says.
“And let me be clear. We will have in my view a much better chance of changing US policy with Kamala than with Trump […] but let me also say this, and I deal with this every day as a US senator. As important as Gaza is, and as strongly as many of us feel about this issue, it is not the only issue in this election.”
Sanders then talks about threats to abortion and to addressing climate change.
It’s been an evening of intense overlapping rallies across the US, as Kamala Harris and Donald Trump make their final pitch to swing state voters in a race that still appears to be incredibly close. Some key updates from this evening’s political rallies:
In Atlanta, on a day his campaign is facing furious backlash for a comedian’s racist remarks about Puerto Rico and Latinos at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally the night before, Donald Trumpreturned to attacking immigrants and once again pledged to carry out the biggest mass deportation in US history. He blamed immigrants for raping and murdering American women and girls.
Trump repeatedly compared migrants and asylum-seekers to an invading army. “The United States is now an occupied country,” he said. “November 5, 2024, will be liberation day in America. On day one, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history. We are going to get these criminals out.”
In Ann Arbor, Michigan, Kamala Harris struck a characteristically more optimistic and unifying tone: “We’re not about the enemy within. We know we’re all in this together.” She also highlighted the frustrations of younger voters.
More than a dozen Gaza solidarityprotesters briefly interrupted Harris’s speech. “Stop the genocide!” one yelled. Another was carrying a sign reading “Abandon Harris.”
In Philadelphia, Barack Obama joined Bruce Springsteen to rally support for Harris, describing her as an empathetic and experienced leader, and one who would work for the people, not for herself. Mostly, Obama spent his speech ripping into Trump, including mocking the Trump-branded Bibles the candidate is selling arguing that the good economy during Trump’s first term was the result of his own eight years in office.
In the face of ongoing backlash to the Washington Post’s billionaire owner blocking the paper’s editorial board from endorsing Harris, Jeff Bezos himself has written a note in the newspaper explaining why he thinks newspaper political endorsements are a bad idea.
Jeff Bezos is now explaining his non-endorsement decision
Amid massive backlash and a reported 200,000 cancelled subscriptions to the Washington Post, the paper’s owner, billionaire Jeff Bezos, has published an explanation of his decision. You can read it here.
The first reactions have not been very positive, as some on social media are noting.
Republicans ask supreme court to weigh in on ballot-counting in Pennsylvania
An important update from Reuters:
Republicans asked the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday to block a judicial decision from Pennsylvania requiring the counting of provisional ballots cast by voters who make mistakes on their mail-in ballots, potentially affecting thousands of votes in the Nov. 5 presidential election.
The Republican National Committee and Republican Party of Pennsylvania asked the justices to put on hold the Oct. 23 Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling in favor of two Butler County voters who sought to have their provisional ballots counted after their mail-in ballots were rejected during that state’s primary election for lacking secrecy envelopes…
If the justices are not inclined to pause the state court’s ruling in its entirety, the Republicans asked for an order segregating the provisional ballots at issue in the case, which potentially would give the U.S. Supreme Court time to review the legal dispute after the election.
The Harris campaign said there were 21,000 attendees at the rally she and Tim Walz held this evening in Ann Arbor, Michigan, according to the White House pool reporter.",2024-10-29

Guardian,‘I’m walking here!’: jaywalking legalized in New York City,"Jaywalking – that time-honored practice of crossing the street outside of the crosswalk or against the traffic light – is now legal in New York City.
Legislation passed by the city council last month officially became law over the weekend after the city’s mayor, Eric Adams, declined to take action – either by signing or vetoing it – after 30 days.
Council member Mercedes Narcisse, a Brooklyn Democrat who sponsored the legislation, said on Tuesday that the new law ends racial disparities in enforcement, noting that more than 90% of the jaywalking tickets issued last year went to Black and Latino people.
“Let’s be real, every New Yorker jaywalks. People are simply trying to get where they need to go,” she said in an emailed statement. “Laws that penalize common behaviors for everyday movement shouldn’t exist, especially when they unfairly impact communities of color.”
The new law permits pedestrians to cross a roadway at any point, including outside of a crosswalk. It also allows for crossing against traffic signals and specifically states that doing so is no longer a violation of the city’s administrative code.
But the new law also warns that pedestrians crossing outside of a crosswalk do not have the right of way and that they should yield to other traffic that has the right of way.
Liz Garcia, an Adams spokesperson, declined to elaborate on the mayor’s decision to let the bill become law without his action.
But she noted the bill makes it clear that crossing against the light and mid-block is highly risky behavior. People may also still be liable in civil actions for accidents caused by jaywalking, Garcia added.
“All road users are safer when everyone follows traffic rules,” she said in a statement. “We continue to encourage pedestrians to take advantage of safety mechanisms in place – such as daylighting, pedestrian islands, and leading pedestrian intervals – by crossing in a crosswalk with the walk signal.”
Other cities and states, from Denver and Kansas City, Missouri, to California, Nevada and Virginia, have decriminalized jaywalking in recent years, according to America Walks, a Seattle-based group that’s been tracking the proposals.
“Cities that truly care about safety focus on street design, speeding and dangerously large vehicles,” Mike McGinn, the group’s executive director, said Tuesday. “Not jaywalking laws.”
The laws were pushed by the auto industry in the 1930s as a way to keep people off streets and make more room for vehicles, according to America Walks.
The term “jaywalking” dates to the early 20th century and has its roots in midwestern slang for a country bumpkin or rube, according to dictionary maker Merriam-Webster.
In New York City, where struggles between pedestrians and motorists are constant, the jaywalking law had been on the books since 1958 and carried a penalty of up to $250.
In the 1969 film Midnight Cowboy, Dustin Hoffman famously yells: “I’m walking here!” as his character is almost hit by a cab while crossing the street in Manhattan.
The Legal Aid Society called the legislation long overdue. The non-profit organization, which provides free legal representation to New Yorkers who cannot afford a lawyer, said police for decades have used the violation as a pretext to stop, question and frisk residents – especially those of color.
“With this legislation now codified, we hope that both the Adams Administration and the City Council will continue to abolish relic laws that serve no public safety purpose and only ensnare people in the criminal legal system,” the organization said in a statement.
Police department spokespeople didn’t immediately respond to emails seeking comment, and a spokesperson for its largest union declined to weigh in.
But Narcisse said officers she has spoken to say their time could be better spent on other police work, rather than issuing tickets for jaywalking.
“No one’s ever said: ‘I’m so glad they caught that jaywalker.’ By eliminating these penalties, we allow our police officers to focus on issues that truly matter,” she said.",2024-10-30
Guardian,White House blasts false claims about Hurricane Helene and relief aid,"The White House moved Saturday to quash claims that government officials control the weather, including a far-fetched rumor circulating on social media that Hurricane Helene was an engineered storm to allow corporations to mine regional lithium deposits.
“We have seen a large increase in false information circulating online related to the federal response to Hurricane Helene,” a statement said, pointing to a “number of scam artists, bad-faith actors, and others who want to sow chaos because they think it helps their political interests are promoting disinformation about the recovery effort.”
The White House said the rumors, which include claims that emergency disaster money had been spent housing immigrants and that relief funds would be limited to $750 per claim, were “wrong, dangerous” and said “it must stop immediately”.
The warning, which speaks to the intense political environment Helene figuratively crashed into, came hours after Biden told lawmakers to refill the coffers of disaster relief programs as the projected recovery and rebuilding costs related to Hurricane Helene are estimated to be as much as $200bn over 10 years.
In a letter sent to congressional leaders, the president said while the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) and the Department of Defense are able to meet “critical life-saving and life-sustaining missions and will continue to do so within present funding levels”, they will need additional funding.
“My administration has provided robust and well-coordinated federal support for the ongoing response and recovery efforts,” Biden wrote.
“As with other catastrophic disasters, it will take some time to assess the full requirements for response and recovery efforts, and I fully expect that the Congress will do its part to provide the funding needed.”
Biden said that a comprehensive disaster relief package would be necessary when Congress returns on 12 November – but said action on individual programs could be needed before then. But there are currently no plans for Congress to reconvene before the election.
The request comes as Kamala Harris cut short a campaign swing through the western states to visit western North Carolina in the southern Appalachian mountains where entire towns were washed away.
Biden viewed the damage and cleanup efforts in the Carolinas by air on Wednesday, and again in Florida and Georgia on Thursday. He said the work to rebuild will cost “billions of dollars” and additional disaster relief funding “can’t wait … people need help now”.
At least 225 people have been confirmed dead from Helene, and officials say they expect the death toll to continue to rise as recovery efforts continue. A police department spokesperson in Asheville, North Carolina, told CBS News in an email late on Friday that it is “actively working 75 cases of missing persons”. Nearly 1 million people remain without power.
In his letter to lawmakers, Biden said that funding through the Small Business Administration (SBA) “will run out of funding in a matter of weeks and well before the Congress is planning to reconvene”.
The SBA is designed to help small business owners and homeowners recoup property and equipment through the disaster relief loan program. Administration officials told CNN that the program needs $1.6bn in additional funding to meet about 3,000 Hurricane Helene-related applications it is receiving daily.
Last month, before Helene hit, the White House warned that the low funding levels could lead to the SBA “effectively ceasing operations” after paying out for weather-related costs and accidents, including the Key Bridge collapse in Baltimore, the continued recovery after Maui’s wildfires and tornado damage in the midwest.
The damage caused by Helene could cost upwards of $34bn, according to early estimates from Moody’s Analytics. The private forecaster AccuWeather put the cost of damages at $225bn to $250bn, with very little covered by private insurance.
The issue of Helene costs is already deeply political. The Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, has said lawmakers would assess the post-Helene needs in full after the election.
Former president Trump has accused Democrats of spending over $640m in Fema funds on housing migrants, a claim the White House calls “bold-faced lies”.
On Friday, in Georgia, Trump said: “A lot of the money that was supposed to go to Georgia and supposed to go to North Carolina and all of the others is going and has gone already.
“It’s been gone for people that came into the country illegally, and nobody has ever seen anything like that. That’s a shame.”
Officials say those funds, authorized by Congress, was part of an entirely different program run by Fema unconnected to disaster relief but to provide housing to immigrants applying for US citizenship.
The disaster agency responded to Trump’s claim with a fact-check page. “This is false,” Fema said in a statement. “No money is being diverted from disaster response needs.” A week after the hurricane hit, more than $45m has been dispersed to communities affected by the storm.",2024-10-05
Guardian,Memoir contradicts Republican Senate candidate’s ‘below the poverty line’ tale,"At a recent campaign event in Whitehall, Montana, the Republican US Senate candidate Tim Sheehy told voters that a decade ago, when he set up the aerial firefighting company through which he made his fortune, he and his wife were living “below the poverty line”.
“My wife and I homeschool our kids,” Sheehy said. “We made that decision several years ago. She’s a Marine, naval academy graduate, she could have a great job and even when our company was tiny, and we … were below the poverty line and making no money, we said: ‘No … the most important job in the world is being a mother.’ And she’s doing that every day.”
A little more than a month from election day, in a race that could decide control of the Senate, such hardscrabble tales are helping Sheehy lead the Democratic incumbent, Jon Tester, a longtime Montana farmer. The two men are due to debate in Missoula on Monday night.
But Sheehy’s claim about living in poverty while building his company, Bridger Aerospace, is contradicted by his own memoir.
In that book, Mudslingers, published last year, the former navy Seal writes that when he and his wife contemplated leaving the military, in 2013, they “weren’t wealthy, but … did have resources”.
This, he writes, was in part thanks to having “lived quite frugally during our time in the military, spending a lot of time deployed, accumulating savings, taking advantage of base housing and meals, and of course spending almost nothing while on deployment.
“So, we had amassed a nest egg of close to $300,000. I also had some money that my parents had been putting away for me since I was a kid. All told, we had roughly $400,000 to allocate toward building a business and establishing a new life.”
In 2014, as Sheehy got his company going, the US health department defined the poverty guideline for a family of three in Montana as $19,790. The poverty threshold, as defined by the US Census Bureau, was $19,055.
By his own account, Sheehy set out to build Bridger Aerospace with 20 times that – a sum he calls “not exactly chump change”.
Sheehy has also regularly claimed to have “bootstrapped” his company, a term the Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines as “to promote or develop by initiative and effort with little or no assistance”.
Yet in his book, Sheehy describes both receiving the $100,000 his parents had saved for him and asking his father and brother to help him pay $500,000 to buy necessary planes. His father, he writes, “backed me, financially and emotionally, without expecting anything in return”, while his brother was given an “equity stake in the business”.
Sheehy also describes how in 2017 his brother helped secure investment from Blackstone Group, the New York private equity behemoth led by Stephen Schwartzman, a top Republican donor, in order to pull off a $200m aircraft order.
Sheehy grew up in Minnesota and attended the US Naval Academy in Maryland. Describing his early days in Montana, he has often told of how he, his wife and their first child started out living in a tent. That might boost his claim of living below the poverty line, but Sheehy has also described how living under canvas was a choice.
Having purchased “60 undeveloped acres”, Sheehy writes in his book, “the simple and probably sane thing to do would have been to rent an apartment in town while we got the business off the ground”. But they chose to build a house, and to camp while the structure went up.
Sheehy’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment. News of Sheehy’s book contradicting his own claim about living in poverty, however, follows similar reporting regarding his claims about his background.
The Montana Free Press was among outlets to report that though Sheehy has said he grew up in “rural Minnesota … surrounded by farmland”, he in fact “grew up in a multimillion-dollar lake house, learned to fly under the tutelage of a neighbour, [and] attended a private high school”.
In May, the Daily Beast reported that Sheehy’s campaign trail claims about how he left the US military do not match those in his book. Sheehy’s campaign responded angrily, claiming an attack on his patriotism and service. Then, this month, the Guardian reported documents seemingly showing Sheehy did not follow Department of Defense protocol for clearing sections of Mudslingers that deal with military subjects, including deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan. The campaign did not respond.
Regardless, Sheehy seems well-placed to secure a Senate seat, holding seven- and eight-point leads over Tester, a three-term moderate Democrat.
Federal figures regarding poverty in Montana in 2014 do back up one claim in Sheehy’s book. Describing how he hired his first employees, he says he paid just $1,500 a month, amounting to $18,000 a year, to his first chief pilot, Tim Cherwin.
Cherwin brought with him “the chain-smoking desert rat Steve Taylor, who would become our director of maintenance”. Sheehy, who says he started the business with $400,000, says both men were “earning wages below the poverty line”.",2024-09-30
Guardian,Middle East crisis live: Israel orders ‘immediate’ evacuation of southern and eastern Lebanon,"Israel issues evacuation call for Lebanon’s Nabatieh region
The Israeli army urged residents of several villages in the Nabatieh area of south Lebanon to leave immediately on Wednesday, warning it was poised to attack Hezbollah targets, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).
“Hezbollah’s terrorist activities force the (Israeli army) to act forcefully against it in these areas”, military spokesperson Avichay Adraee said in a post on X, with Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency reporting strikes had already begun on the city of Nabatieh.
Hezbollah’s new leader, Naim Qassem, said on Wednesday that the Iran-backed group is fighting Israel to defend Lebanese territory, not as a result of foreign influence, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).
In a pre-recorded speech, his first as Hezbollah leader, Qassem said the movement was not “fighting on anyone’s behalf,” adding that Iran “supports us but doesn’t want anything” in return.
Hezbollah’s new leader vows to uphold predecessor Nasrallah’s 'war plan'
Hezbollah’s new leader, Naim Qassem, said on Wednesday he would stick to the war strategy laid out by his predecessor, Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed by Israel last month after full-scale fighting broke out.
“My work programme is a continuation of the work programme of our leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah,” Qassem said in his first remarks as Hezbollah leader, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).
Qassem pledged to press on with “the war plan that he (Nasrallah) developed with the leadership” of the Iran-backed group.
Israel army says it killed deputy head of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan force
The Israeli army said Wednesday it has killed the deputy head of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan force, Mustafa Ahmad Shahadi, in a strike in the Nabatieh area of south Lebanon, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).
“In an intelligence-directed strike, the Israeli air force struck and eliminated Mustafa Ahmad Shahadi, deputy commander of Hezbollah’s Radwan forces, in the area of Nabatieh,” the army said in a statement, adding that Shahadi had previously run Radwan operations in Syria and overseen “terror attacks in southern Lebanon”.

The Washington Post reports that the US government has received about 500 reports that American weapons are killing Palestinians.
The reports are received from across the government, global aid organisations, nonprofits groups, media reports and other eyewitnesses. Despite the number of reports, no single case has been acted on.
“They’re ignoring evidence of widespread civilian harm and atrocities to maintain a policy of virtually unconditional weapons transfers to the Netanyahu government,” said John Ramming Chappell, a legal and policy adviser focused on US security assistance and arms sales at the Center for Civilians in Conflict.
“When it comes to the Biden administration’s arms policies, everything looks good on paper but has turned out meaningless in practice when it comes to Israel.”
State department spokesperson Matthew Miller said that the United States was “deeply concerned by the loss of civilian life” and that Washington was seeking a “full explanation”. The Israeli military said it was “aware of reports that civilians were harmed”.
Hezbollah announces that its newly appointed leader, Naim Qassem, will deliver his maiden speech as secretary general today at 1pm GMT.
Hezbollah appointed Qassem on Monday, following Israel’s assassination of his predecessor, Hassan Nasrallah, in Beirut last month and of his presumed successor, Hashem Safieddine, earlier this month.
American diplomats are developing a plan to pause the fighting between Israel and Lebanese armed group Hezbollah, starting with a 60-day ceasefire, Reuters reports as the war enters its fourth week.
The sources – a person briefed on the talks and a senior diplomat working on Lebanon – told Reuters the two-month period would be used to finalise full implementation of UN security council resolution 1701, adopted in 2006 to keep southern Lebanon free of arms outside state control.
“We’d like to reiterate that we seek a diplomatic resolution that fully implements 1701 and gets both Israeli and Lebanese citizens back to their homes on both sides of the border,” said Sama Habib, spokesperson at the U.S. embassy in Beirut.
Meanwhile, Israel’s invasion of Lebanon continues to intensify. On Wednesday the Israeli army ordered residents of Baalbek, where tens of thousands of mostly Shia Muslim Lebanese people, including many who had fled other areas, were living.
Iran said on Wednesday that its production of missiles remained intact, after Israeli airstrikes targeting military facilities last week, reports Agence France-Presse (AFP).
“There has been no interruption in the process of producing offensive systems such as missiles,” defence minister Aziz Nasirzadeh told reporters. “The enemy tried to damage both our defensive and offensive systems,” he added.
Israel launched strikes on military sites in Iran on Saturday, citing Tehran’s 1 October missile attack that followed the killing of Iran-backed militant leaders and a Revolutionary Guards commander. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said later that the strikes “hit Iran’s defence capabilities and missile production”.
Iran’s armed forces said the attack killed four soldiers and caused “limited damage” to a few radar systems. Iranian media said a civilian was also killed.
Israel has warned Iran against retaliating, while Tehran, asserting it does not seek war, vowed an “appropriate response”.
Western governments have long criticised Iran’s missile programme which has come under severe sanctions in recent years.
In September, the European Union imposed sanctions on prominent Iranian officials and entities over their alleged involvement in transferring missiles and drones to Russia to use in its war against Ukraine, reports AFP.
Hezbollah’s new leader is to give a speech on Wednesday, a source close to the group said, his first since he was appointed earlier this week.
“A speech by the new secretary general of Hezbollah, Naim Qassem, is scheduled for Wednesday,” the source told Agence France-Presse (AFP), requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters.",2024-10-30
Guardian,Kamala Harris delivers ‘closing argument’ in Washington – as it happened,"Harris calls on Americans to 'turn the page and start writing the next chapter'
“In seven days, we have the power, each of you has the power, to turn the page and start writing the next chapter in the most extraordinary story ever told. I thank you and God bless you, and God bless the United States of America,” Harris says.
This blog is closing now, thanks for following. Here is our full story on Kamala Harris’s major address to the nation – referred to by her campaign as her “closing argument”:
US president Joe Biden has now clarified his remarks in a post on Twitter/X.
Biden said: “Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage–which is the only word I can think of to describe it. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation.”
He says that he was referring specifically to “hateful rhetoric” made by “Trump’s supporter” Tony Hinchcliffe (who he does not name) as “garbage” and not to Trump supporters in general.
Speaking at a Trump event at Madison Square Garden, Hinchliffe called Puerto Rico “a floating island of garbage”.
Conservatives claimed that Biden was referring to Trump supporters in general as garbage.
Biden said, according to one transcript,
“The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters – his, his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable and it’s un-American.”
According to another, he said, “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter’s – his, his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable and it’s un-American.”
From the video of Biden speaking, it is unclear which was his meaning, but he has now clarified, saying he was referring specifically to the person and his remarks.
There is some debate going on online over the transcript of Biden’s remarks – and whether his use of the word “supporters” contained an apostrophe.
Here is one version of the transcript, where Biden appears to refer to the floating garbage being that of a single “supporter” or his supporter’s floating garbage.
This could refer specifically to the comedian who made multiple racist remarks, including saying Puerto Rico was a “floating island of garbage” – his garbage being, presumably, the remarks he made.
So: Trump’s supporter’s remarks demonizing Latinos are the only garbage Biden sees:
However, if what Biden said contained no apostrophe, then he was saying that it was Trump’s supporters (plural) as a whole, who were themselves floating garbage.
CNN’s transcript reads as follows: “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters, his, his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable and it’s un-American.”
So: Trump’s supporters are the only floating garbage Biden sees.
The Guardian has contacted Voto Latino, which hosted the event during which Biden made the remarks, for the full video.
Robert F Kennedy Jr has claimed that if elected, Donald Trump has promised to give him “control” of multiple health and other agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Food and Drug Administration (FDA), National Institutes of Health (NIH), as well as the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).
RFK Jr is an anti-vaccination activist or anti-vaxxer. He became fixated on a belief that vaccines are not safe more than 15 years ago.
He emerged as one of the leading voices in the anti-vaccine movement and his work has been described by public health experts and members of his own family as misleading and dangerous.
RFK Jr dropped out of the presidential race to support Trump.
It is unclear whether the claim is true, but Trump has said at multiple rallies, including as recently as Sunday, that he plans to give RFK Jr a role overseeing health agencies if elected.
Kennedy has said he would expect any role would involve healthcare and food and drug policy, and reportedly sought a post overseeing health and medical issues under any new Trump administration in exchange for his support.
Here is a clip of the comments from HuffPost’s Yashar Ali:
Biden has made many gaffes, though the timing of this one – a week out from the election, and as the Harris campaign appears to be gaining support as a result of the Trump campaign going low and insulting an important group of voters – is inopportune, to say the least.
In 2016, two months before she lost the election to Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton said: “You know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump’s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right?”
The comments were seized on by Trump supporters as evidence of the Democrats’ contempt for some Americans. And conservatives on Twitter/X are seizing on this as a similar remark.
Biden’s comments appearing to compare Trump supporters to “garbage […] floating” was made during a Zoom webinar with Voto Latino, a non-profit that encourages young Latino voters to vote.
Biden was criticising racist comments made by comedian Tony Hinchcliffeat Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden, including describing Puerto Rico was a “floating island of garbage”.
In the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania, most of the 580,000 eligible Latino voters are of Puerto Rican descent.
The Trump campaign has responded to Kamala Harris’s speech – in which she repeatedly said “we’re not going back” and called on Americans to “turn the page and start writing the next chapter” – as “clinging to the past”, according to a statement from Trump campaign national press secretary, Karoline Leavitt.
Conservatives are sharing a clip of Biden appearing to cal Trump’s supporters garbage on Twitter/X.
In the clip from an interview on CNN, Biden says: “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.”
Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung has just shared the clip, along with unfounded and false claims saying that Harris and Biden will “hate Americans and will do everything to crush us if they every hold power again”:
NBC’s Gabe Gutierrez reports that the White House has sought to walk back Biden’s remarks, saying that he was referring specifically to comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who made the racist remark referring to Puerto Rico as an “island of garbage”, as himself being floating garbage – and not Trump’s supporters.
A transcript of Biden’s remarks has not been published by the White House.
The US president addressed comments made by Trump and his supporters about Puerto Rico and Puerto Ricans, saying that the only garbage he sees “floating out there is his [Trump’s] supporters”.
The Harris campaign has called Trump supporters “weird” but has otherwise been careful to avoid insulting the Republican nominee’s base as they try to avoid a repeat of Hillary Clinton’s “deplorables” comments.
After an event in Baltimore and a nearby fundraiser, Joe Biden returned home to the White House as the crowd gathered outside for Kamala Harris’s rally.
According to the reporters trailing the president today, cheers could be heard from the driveway as his motorcade returned to the White House, one week from an election he expected to be running in. The music is throbbing, with another 45 minutes before Harris is expected to give remarks.
According to the “pool report”, Biden was in for the night, meaning there is little chance he would make a surprise appearance at the rally.
A report in Axios suggested the Harris campaign has been trying to keep its distance from Biden, viewing the unpopular president as a liability in the final days.
Biden will campaign for the Democratic ticket on Saturday, in his home town of Scranton, Pennsylvania. But there are no events scheduled for him to campaign alongside Harris, who he effectively elevated after stepping aside in July.
Meanwhile in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Trump distorted an ongoing voter fraud investigation in Lancaster county, Pennsylvania. Officials there are investigating a batch of 2,500 voter registration forms after flagging suspicious similarities between them. Some of the registrations are legitimate.
Trump falsely said at his rally just now that there have been fraudulent votes, which isn’t true. “They’ve already started cheating, 2,600 votes, he said. Every vote was written by the same person. It must be a coincidence,” he said.
The comment is an example of how Trump is priming supporters to believe there was fraud in the election to prepare for contesting a possible loss.
Harris, speaking at the National Mall in Washington, which leads to the Capitol where the 6 January 2021 insurrection happened, invoked Trump’s actions that day to portray him – not for the first time – as a dangerous leader who cared only about himself.
She contrasted that with her history as a prosecutor and protector of all Americans, especially those who are vulnerable.
She portrayed herself as pragmatic, a leader focused on uniting Americans, and part of a new generation of leadership – Harris, who just turned 60, is a generation younger than her rival, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden, who she replaced on the Democratic ticket.
She also sought to portray herself as somebody who is in touch with the struggles and aims of ordinary Americans – she watched her mother work hard to save up for a house, and watched her mother worry about bills, she said at different points.
Harris also said she has “always had an instinct to protect. There is something about people being treated unfairly or overlooked that frankly just gets to me. I don’t like it.”
She said that Trump would walk into the Oval Office with a list of enemies, whereas she would walk in with a “to-do list”.
Finally, she branded Trump a “petty tyrant”, comparing the moment that faces Americans next week to the war of independence that saw America become independent from the British:
Harris calls on Americans to 'turn the page and start writing the next chapter'
“In seven days, we have the power, each of you has the power, to turn the page and start writing the next chapter in the most extraordinary story ever told. I thank you and God bless you, and God bless the United States of America,” Harris says.
“I am in this race to fight for the people, just like I always have,” Harris says.
“Nearly 250 years ago America was born when we wrested power from a petty tyrant,” Harris says.
And since then, America has proved that a “government for and by the people is strong and can endure”, she says.
The patriots at Selma, Seneca Falls and Stonewall “did not struggle and lay down their lives only to see us cede our fundamental freedoms. They did not do that only to see us submit to the will of another petty tyrant,” she says.",2024-10-30
Guardian,US emergency crews struggle as climate crisis fuels ‘unprecedented’ competing disasters,"It’s been a brutal week in weather-related disasters across the US. Large parts of the south-east are still grappling with the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene, and another potentially catastrophic storm is barreling towards Florida. At the same time, much of the west has been sweltering amid scorching temperatures, which have elevated fire risks and fueled extreme fire behavior.
Hurricanes and fires aren’t abnormal in early autumn. But the climate crisis has turned up the dial and created more opportunities for catastrophes to overlap, ultimately adding strain on relief resources, emergency response, and those who have been impacted by the dangerous and destructive events.
While federal officials have been clear that emergency response agencies have been able to lead on recovery efforts following Hurricane Helene, strongly disputing rampant misinformation about misuse or politicization of the funds in areas devastated by the storm, the competing disasters nonetheless have severely strained the agencies.
The homeland security secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, told reporters last week that Fema “does not have the funds to make it through the season”. Joe Biden echoed those concerns in a letter to Congress, calling on legislators to increase funding to ensure Fema won’t have to “forego longer-term recovery activities in favor of meeting urgent needs.
“The Congress should provide FEMA additional resources to avoid forcing that kind of unnecessary trade-off and to give the communities we serve the certainty of knowing that help will be ongoing, both for the short- and long-term,” the US president wrote.
Meanwhile, dangerous fire conditions in the west prompted officials to bump the country’s response to preparedness level 5 (PL5) on Tuesday, the highest level. The early-October designation – the latest PL5 since the system began registering the levels in 1990 – shows that resources for fighting fire are growing scarce as conditions linger into autumn.
It’s already been a busy season for firefighters, many who have logged up to 1,400 hours of overtime fighting blazes that have covered more than 7.6m acres in the US so far this year. Faced with dwindling budgets, the drawdown in seasonal crews, and deployment of more than a thousand wildfire personnel to aid in Helene recovery efforts, agencies are yet again scrambling.
In response, the National Multi-Agency Coordinating Group (NMAC), responsible for organizing the country’s fire suppression operations, called for plans for prescribed burns to be put on hold, potentially limiting how much mitigation work will be possible this autumn.
“Due to the unprecedented fire environment forecasted through mid-October, increased initial attack and growth on existing fires, competition for resources including a growing commitment of resources to Hurricane Helene, and the seasonal reduction in firefighting resources,” the agency wrote, “the NMAC urges extreme caution … in executing new prescribed fires in the current environment and would strongly caution against any reliance on national resources to achieve Rx objectives; new ignitions may pose a risk of escape due to current weather and fuels conditions which would further strain the availability of national resources.”
‘They all go hand in hand’
As the country cooks into the autumn months, stretching fire season longer and longer, the risks of devastating hurricanes climb.
“This is the normal time of year for hurricanes, but the Gulf of Mexico is so warm these storms get to be monsters really quickly,” said Dr Dave Easterling, senior climate scientist at the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI).
“Out west you have heatwaves, fire, drought – they all go hand in hand,” he added.
Meanwhile, Hurricane Milton rapidly intensified into a category 5 on Monday, as Florida prepares for what could be the biggest evacuation in seven years. The storm is surging toward population centers just weeks after Helene caused widespread destruction and became one of the deadliest hurricanes. More than 230 fatalities have been confirmed, a toll that’s only expected to rise.
Like fire season, the risks of catastrophic hurricanes could linger longer, adding complications to response and recovery, as warm temperatures stretch across more months of the year.
This year is already on track to rank among the hottest on record with a good chance at replacing 2023 at the top. Heat can be a deadly event all on its own, but it also sets the stage for destructive – and expensive – catastrophes. The US in 2023 logged 28 billion-dollar-disasters, an unprecedented number according to officials at NOAA, which called them “just the latest examples of the extremes we now face that will continue to worsen due to climate change”.
It’s not the first time disaster funding has become a concern. Costs associated with weather catastrophes are on the rise and even with boosts to the budget, agencies have struggled to keep up, according to Jonathan Sury, a senior staff associate at the national center for disaster preparedness at Columbia University.
“Even though there has been a lot more money going to Fema’s budget to respond to these things, the scale of these disasters has really been sucking that money up,” he said, noting the rising amount of repeated events like the back-to-back hurricane threat.
He has contributed to a product called the natural hazards index, which maps community vulnerability, and said it’s now much more common to see extreme events overlap or compound, hammering communities one after the other, and taxing emergency management, first responders, and affected communities.
Future planning, especially at the community level, will be essential to prepare for and adapt to the present threats that are only expected to worsen as the world warms.
“We know heat is coming and will get worse. Some parts of that we can’t stop but there are ways we can adapt our communities and livelihoods to better manage ourselves and our resources during future disasters,” he said.
In the meantime, Easterling has cautioned all to take imminent warnings seriously. In his community outside Asheville, North Carolina, the onslaught from Helene showered more than 17in (43cm) of rain in mere days. Neighbors, though, saw roughly double that. Friends barely escaped their home before it washed away in the floods, which broke records set in 1916.
“The bottom line is when you hear warnings, take them seriously,” he said. “We are not going to necessarily see more hurricanes in the future but when the sea surface temperatures are as warm as they are, especially in the Gulf, we are going to see more powerful ones.”",2024-10-09
Guardian,Harris and Cheney pitch Republican voters – as it happened,"Harris and Cheney blast Trump over election lies as they make pitch to Republican voters in Wisconsin
Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris held a campaign event with former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney, and Republican royalty, in the swing state – and birth of the Republican party – Wisconsin.
Cheney focused her speech on Trump’s actions on 6 January and his refusal to accept the 2020 election results.
“The most conservative of conservative values is fidelity to our constitution,” she said. “I have never voted for a Democrat, but this year I am proudly casting my vote for President Kamala Harris.”
“Vice-President Harris is standing in the breach at a critical moment in our history,” Cheney said.
Any person who would do these things can never be trusted with power again,” Cheney said. “We must defeat Trump on November 5.”
Harris, too, focused her speech on Trump, rather than her policies as the Democratic candidate. The speech was pitched as encouraging voters to cast their ballots for Harris to prevent Trump from taking power, regardless of whether they identified as Republicans.
Harris said she has never wavered from upholding her oath to the American people and democracy unlike Trump. “Donald Trump lost the 2020 election,” Harris said. “And as you have heard and know, he refused to accept the will of the people and the results of an election that was free and fair.”
The candidates spoke with large protective glass barriers on either side of them.
Liz Cheney, one of Donald Trump’s most prominent conservative critics, appealed to the millions of undecided Americans who could decide the outcome of the 2024 election, asking them to “reject the depraved cruelty” of the former president.
A former representative from Wyoming, Cheney cast the stakes in November as nothing less than the future of American democracy as she appeared alongside Kamala Harris in Ripon, Wisconsin, on Thursday, the symbolic birthplace of the modern Republican party.
The daughter of Dick Cheney, the Republican former vice-president, said she had never voted for a Democrat before, but would do so “proudly” to ensure Trump never holds a position of public trust again. Her father will join her in casting his ballot for Harris.
“I know that the most conservative of conservative values is fidelity to our constitution,” Cheney said, speaking from a podium adorned with the vice presidential seal. The crowd broke into a chant: “Thank you, Liz!” A large sign looming over them declared: “Country over Party.”
Harris praised Cheney’s “courage” for being willing to cross party lines to endorse – and campaign alongside – the Democratic nominee. During the event, a remarkable joint appearance that would have been unimaginable in the pre-Trump era, Cheney pitched Harris as a unifying leader who will safeguard American institutions.
Cheney and Harris agree on little politically – only that Trump should not be allowed to serve a second term. But their union is part of an effort by the Harris campaign to win over Republican voters who, like Cheney, believe in “limited government” and “low taxes” but are repelled by Trump and his Maga movement.
“No matter your political party, there is a place for you with us and in this campaign,” Harris said. “I take seriously my pledge to be a president for all Americans.”
Chain Bridge Bancorp, a lender popular among Republicans since its inception, priced its US initial public offering at $22 per share on Thursday to raise $40.7m, Reuters reports.
The bank sold 1.85m shares in the IPO, which valued it at about $141m. It had initially aimed for a sale of 1.85 million shares priced between $24 and $26 each.
Chain Bridge has worked with the campaign of every Republican Party presidential nominee since John McCain in 2008.
The bank, with just one branch and 84 employees, has beaten bigger financial rivals to become a must-have partner for political work.
Its fortunes are closely tied to the Republican Party. It warned in its paperwork that “any event that negatively impacts the Republican Party could lead to significant deposit outflows.”
Still, the bank’s strong credit quality might appeal to investors. While worries about bad loans have battered many industry players, Chain Bridge has had no non-performing loans in the last 12 years.
The 5 November election between Harris and Republican Trump is expected to be tight, especially in battleground states like Michigan, home to a large Muslim American population. The US continues to back Israel as it targets Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Though Emgage has endorsed Harris, other Muslim groups have urged supporters not to back her in the election, especially after Democrats rejected requests for a Palestinian speaker at the party convention in August.
Harris has offered no substantive policy differences on Israel from Biden, who stepped aside as presidential candidate in July.
Trump has said he would reinstate a “travel ban” he imposed as president restricting the entry into the United States of people from a list of largely Muslim-dominant countries. Biden rolled back the ban shortly after taking office in 2021.
“The scale of death and destruction in Gaza is staggering and devastating,” Walz said. Harris is working to ensure “the suffering in Gaza ends now, and the Palestinian people realize the right to dignity, freedom and self determination.”
The Israeli military offensive in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children.
Israel’s bombardment of Gaza and limiting of aid have caused a humanitarian crisis, displacing nearly all of its 2 million people and causing children to die from starvation.
Here is more from Tim Walz’s event with Muslim voters earlier:
Walz promised Muslim Americans an equal role in their administration should they win the election, as Democrats scramble to win back Muslim backing that has eroded over US support for Israel.
Vice-president Harris and Walz, the governor of Minnesota, are trying to woo Muslim voters furious over President Joe Biden’s administration’s staunch backing of Israel during its year-old war in Gaza against Hamas.
Harris has pledged continued support for Israel while emphasizing her push for a ceasefire, words Walz echoed on Thursday, while promising a role for Muslims.
“Vice-president Harris and I are committed that this White House … will continue to condemn in all forms anti-Islam, anti-Arab sentiments being led by Donald Trump, but more importantly, a commitment that Muslims will be engaged in this administration and serve side by side,” Walz said during an online meeting organised by Emgage Action, a Muslim American advocacy group that recently endorsed Harris.
According to the filing, Trump’s day on 6 January started at 1am, with a tweet pressuring Pence to obstruct the certification of the results. Seven hours later, at 8.17am, Trump tweeted about it again. Shortly before his speech at the Ellipse, Trump called Pence and again pressured him to “induce him to act unlawfully in the upcoming session”, where Pence would be certifying the election results. Pence refused.
At this point, according to the filing, Trump “decided to re-insert into his campaign speech at the Ellipse remarks targeting Pence for his refusal to misuse his role in the certification”.
Trump gave his speech, and at 1pm, the certification process began at the Capitol.
Trump, meanwhile, “settled in the dining room off of the Oval Office. He spent the afternoon there reviewing Twitter on his phone, while the dining room television played Fox News’ contemporaneous coverage of events at the Capitol.”
It was from the dining room that Trump watched a crowd of his supporters march towards the Capitol. He had been there less than an hour when, at “approximately 2.24pm, Fox News reported that a police officer may have been injured and that ‘protestors ... have made their way inside the Capitol.’
“At 2.24pm, Trump tweeted, writing, ‘Mike Pence didn’t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our country and our constitution, giving states a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify. USA demands the truth!’”
The filing reads: “The content of the 2.24pm tweet was not a message sent to address a matter of public concern and ease unrest; it was the message of an angry candidate upon the realization that he would lose power.”
A minute later, the Secret Service evacuated Pence to a secure location.
As it seeks to make the case that Trump was acting in a private capacity, the filing looks back to election day for Trump’s use of private advisers: “As election day turned to November 4, the contest was too close to project a winner, and in discussions about what the defendant should say publicly regarding the election, senior advisors suggested that the defendant should show restraint while counting continued. Two private advisors, however, advocated a different course: [name redacted] and [name redacted] suggested that the defendant just declare victory. And at about 2.20am, the defendant gave televised remarks to a crowd of his campaign supporters in which he falsely claimed, without evidence or specificity, that there had been fraud in the election and that he had won.”
On 4 January, the filing says, a White House counsel was excluded from a meeting during which Trump sought to pressure Pence to help overturn the election result. Only a private attorney was present, the filing says: “It is hard to imagine stronger evidence” than this that Trump’s conduct was private.
In a court filing unsealed on Wednesday, federal prosecutors argue that Donald Trump is not immune from prosecution over the January 6 riots because he acted in a private capacity, and took advice from private advisers.
The indictment seeks to make this case – that Trump acted in his private capacity, rather than his official one – because of a US supreme court ruling in July that former presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution for official actions taken as president.
It also reveals further details about Trump’s alleged mood and actions (or lack of action) on the day, building on evidence that was provided in earlier briefs.
In response to the new filing, the Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung called the brief “falsehood-ridden” and “unconstitutional”. On Truth Social, Trump, writing in all-caps, called it “complete and total election interference.”
Let’s look at some key points made in the filing:
The filing alleges that Trump’s plan that day was “fundamentally a private one”, and therefore not related to his duties as president but instead as a candidate for office.
It reads: “The defendant asserts that he is immune from prosecution for his criminal scheme to overturn the 2020 presidential election because, he claims, it entailed official conduct. Not so. Although the defendant was the incumbent president during the charged conspiracies, his scheme was fundamentally a private one.
“He extensively used private actors and his campaign infrastructure to attempt to overturn the election results and operated in a private capacity as a candidate for office.”
The US ports strike that shut down shipping on the east and Gulf coasts for three days came to an end on Thursday after dock workers struck a tentative deal with port operators.
The International Longshoremen’s Association announced that the union had reached anagreement with the United States Maritime Alliance on wages,suspending their walkout until January. Work would resume immediately, the union said.
The strike – which involved 45,000 workers across 36 ports, from Texas to Maine – was the first to hit the east and Gulf coast ports of the US since 1977.
The tentative agreement is for a wage hike of about 62%, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Both sides said in a statement that they would return to the bargaining table to negotiate all outstanding issues.
The launch of a strike so soon to the election prompted scrutiny of key figures’ political views. ILA president Harold Daggett faced questions about his relationship with Donald Trump, while the Guardian uncovered social media posts by David Adam, chair and CEO of USMX, that were staunchly critical of Democrats.
More from what singer Bruce Springsteen said in his endorsement of Harris:
“Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are committed to a vision of this country that respects and includes everyone, regardless of class, religion, race, your political point of view or sexual identity.
“And they want to grow our economy in a way that benefits all, not just a few like me on top.
“That’s the vision of America I’ve been consistently writing about for 55 years.”
Springsteen joined other famous faces, including Taylor Swift, who have endorsed the Democratic nominees.
“Donald Trump is the most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime,” Springsteen continued.
“We are shortly coming upon one of the most consequential elections in our nation’s history.
“Perhaps not since the Civil War has this great country felt as politically, spiritually and emotionally divided as it does then at this moment.
“It doesn’t have to be this way. The common values, the shared stories that make us a great and united nation are waiting to be rediscovered and retold once again.
“Now that will take time, hard work, intelligence, faith, and women and men with the national good guiding their hearts.
“America is the most powerful nation on earth, not just because of her overwhelming military strength or economic power, but because of what she stands for, what she means, what she believes in.
“Freedom, social justice, equal opportunity, the right to be and love who you want. These are the things that make America great.”
Trump has promised to make Michigan the “car capital of the world again” as he told a rally in the bellwether county of Saginaw that he will bring back thousands of jobs lost when General Motors moved more than a dozen factories to Mexico.
However, the former president made similar promises to Rust belt states before he was elected in 2016, with little result.
Trump, speaking at Saginaw Valley State University campus with groups of students and union workers in Teamsters for Trump T-shirts behind him, directly addressed the huge loss of industrial jobs in Michigan, a key swing state, over the past three decades.
The speech was Trump’s 11th in the key swing state of Michigan during this election. Kamala Harris is targeting Michigan, alongside the other Rust belt states of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, as her clearest path to victory.
The state remains up for grabs, with opinion polls giving Harris a slight edge. Saginaw county is widely regarded as a bellwether of which way the election is going in Michigan.
Trump beat Hillary Clinton in the county by just 1.1% of the vote in 2016. Four years later, he lost Saginaw to Joe Biden by 303 votes.
Trump dismissed recent polls that have shown Harris leading by small margins in most of the swing states saying she got a boost after she became the candidate in July, but that is now waning.
“We’re up in every state. They had a honeymoon period,” he said.
'Our hearts are broken': Walz addresses Muslim voters during virtual event
Melissa Hellmann
Here is our report from the Walz event with Muslim voters.
“As-salaam alaikum (peace be unto you) everyone and good evening,” vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz greeted Muslim voters in Arabic during a virtual event Thursday evening. In a final push to engage Muslim voters ahead of the election, Walz joined Muslim advocacy group Emgage Action’s “Million Muslim Votes: A Way Forward” summit the day after the vice-presidential debate.
“Here in Minnesota, I’ve got the privilege to represent an incredible and vibrant Muslim community,” Walz said as light streamed through a large window behind him. He shared that he and his wife, Gwen, held the first iftar, the fast-breaking evening meal during Ramadan, at the Minnesota governor’s residence in 2019. And last year, Walz also passed interest-free down payment assistance for first-generation homebuyers to increase home ownership among Muslim Americans.
During his speech, Walz also acknowledged a collective pain among Muslim and Arab American communities due to Israel’s war on Gaza, where more than 40,000 Palestinians have been killed since 7 October. “Our hearts are broken,” Walz said. “The scale of death and destruction in Gaza is staggering and devastating. Tens of thousands of innocent civilians killed, families fleeing for safety over and over again.”
“We all know on here, this war must end and it must end now. The vice-president’s working every day to ensure that, to make sure Israel is secure, the hostages are home, the suffering in Gaza ends now. And the Palestinian people realize the right to dignity, freedom, and self determination.”
The virtual event came shortly after Emgage Action endorsed Kamala Harris and Tim Walz as President and Vice-President.

The Boss has chosen: US singer Bruce Springsteen has endorsed Kamala Harris for president, calling Donald Trump “the most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime”.
The 75-year-old rocker said Harris and her running mate Tim Walz have pledged a vision of the country which “respects and includes everyone”, while Mr Trump “doesn’t understand the meaning of this country”.
“His disdain for the sanctity of our constitution, the sanctity of democracy, the sanctity of the rule of law and the sanctity of the peaceful transfer of power should disqualify him from the office of president ever again,” The Boss said in a video on Instagram.
Walz added, “The Vice President’s working every day to ensure [an end to the war]. To make sure Israel secure, the hostages are home, the suffering in Gaza ends now, and the Palestinian people realize the right to dignity, freedom and self determination.”",2024-10-04
Guardian,"Kamala Harris makes 'closing argument' speech, calling for 'new generation of leadership' – video","With the presidential race deadlocked a week before election day, Kamala Harris pledged to seek common ground in her 'closing argument' speech from a park near the White House, where Donald Trump spoke in 2021 before a mob of his supporters stormed the US Capitol in a last-ditch effort to overturn his 2020 loss. Harris cast her opponent as a divisive figure, planning to leverage the power of the presidency against his political enemies rather than in service of the American people",2024-10-30
Guardian,Kamala Harris calls for ‘new generation of leadership’ in Washington speech,"With the White House illuminated behind her, Kamala Harris asked the vanishing slice of undecided Americans to elect a “new generation of leadership”, likening Donald Trump to a “petty tyrant” who had stood in the very same spot nearly four years ago and, in a last-gasp effort to cling to power, helped incite the mob that stormed the US Capitol.
The choice between her and Trump in the deadlocked presidential contest was “about whether we have a country rooted in freedom for every American or ruled by chaos and division”, Harris said, from the Ellipse near the White House’s South Lawn, where tens of thousands of supporters gathered one week before the final votes of the 2024 election are cast.
“I ask for your vote,” she told the crowd, which spilled beyond the park, toward the Washington monument, and the many more watching at home.
In a speech her campaign billed as the former prosecutor’s “closing argument” with the American people as her jury, Harris repeatedly gestured behind her as she described the progress she hoped to make as the 47th president of the United States on lowering prices, protecting abortion rights and addressing immigration.
“In less than 90 days, either Donald Trump or I will be in the Oval Office,” she said as the crowd – which the campaign placed at 75,000 – erupted into chants of “Kamala! Kamala!” “On day one, if elected, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list,” she continued. “When elected, I will walk in with a to-do list.”
The oval-shaped park also served as reminder of Trump’s actions on January 6, when he exhorted his followers to “fight like hell” and walk to the Capitol where Congress was certifying Joe Biden’s 2020 victory. Aggrieved and “obsessed with revenge”, Trump was “out for unchecked power” , Harris warned, charging that he would spend the next four years focused on his problems, not the country’s.
Although Harris framed the stakes of the 2024 election as nothing less than the preservation of US democracy, she sought to offer an optimistic and hopeful tone, in stark contrast to the dark, racist themes that animated Trump’s grievance-fueled rally at Madison Square Garden. Harris called on Americans to “turn the page” on the Trump era and “start writing the next chapter in the most extraordinary story ever told”. Americans had forgotten, she said, that “it doesn’t have to be this way”.
From his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida earlier on Tuesday, Trump waved off criticism of the rally, calling it an “absolute love fest”.
The daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica, Harris recalled attending civil rights marches with her parents as a toddler and the memory of her mother, “a cup of tea in hand”, poring over bills at the kitchen table.
“I’ve lived the promise of America,” Harris said, and without an explicit reference to the history-making nature of her candidacy, she grounded it in a fight for “freedom” that had propelled generations of “patriots” from Normandy to Selma, Seneca Falls and Stonewall.
“They did not struggle, sacrifice, and lay down their lives only to see us cede our fundamental freedoms, only to see us submit to the will of another petty tyrant,” she said, her voice building as she declared: “The United States of America is not a vessel for the schemes of wannabe dictators.”
In recent days, Harris has amplified warnings of her opponent’s lurch toward authoritarianism and open xenophobia. Her campaign is running ads highlighting John Kelly, a marine general and Trump’s former chief of staff, saying that Trump met the definition of a fascist. Harris has said she agrees.

In her remarks, Harris attempted to balance the existential and the economic – focusing on the threat Trump poses to US institutions while weaving in her plans to bring down prices and build up the middle class. She portrayed Trump as a tool of the billionaire class who would eliminate what is left of abortion access and stand in the way of bipartisan compromise when it does not suit him politically.
Responding to her Ellipse speech, a Trump campaign spokesperson accused the vice-president of “lying, name-calling, and clinging to the past”.
Polls show the contest between Trump and Harris virtually tied in the seven battleground states likely to decide the presidential election.
Trump has sought to rewrite the history of January 6, the culmination of his attempt to cling to power that resulted in the first occupation of the US Capitol since British forces set it on fire during the war of 1812. Trump recently declared the attack a “day of love” and said he would pardon the January 6 rioters – whom he has called “patriots” and “hostages” – if he is elected president.
Hundreds of supporters have been convicted and imprisoned for their conduct at the Capitol, while federal prosecutors have accused Trump of coordinating an effort to overturn his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden. Trump maintains that he played no role in stoking the violence that unfolded, and still claims baselessly that the 2020 election was stolen from him.
In a press call on Tuesday morning, Harris’s campaign expressed a bullishness about her prospects. “We know that there are still a lot of voters out there that are still trying to decide who to support or whether to vote at all,” Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, Harris’s campaign’s chair, told reporters before her remarks on Tuesday. She said many Americans were “exhausted” by the tribalism and polarization Trump has sharpened since his political rise in 2016.
In an abbreviated 100-day campaign that Harris inherited from Biden after he stepped aside in July, the Democratic nominee has unified her party, raised more than $1bn, blanketed the airwaves and blitzed the battleground states. And yet the race remains a dead heat nationally and in the seven swing states that will determine who wins the White House.
After her speech, Harris will return to the campaign trail, where she will keep a frenetic pace ahead of what her campaign has called a “margin-of-error election”.
“We see very good signs for us across the battleground states, in particular in the blue wall,” O’Malley Dillon said on the Tuesday morning call, referring to Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, where Harris has barnstormed in recent weeks. “And we see that we’re on pace to win a very close election.”",2024-10-30
Guardian,JD Vance hits out at critics over Trump ‘fascist’ claim,"JD Vance hit back at those who say Donald Trump is a fascist, accusing Kamala Harris and her allies of disrespecting second world war veterans as he campaigned on Tuesday in one of the most hotly contested regions of battleground Michigan.
A week before the election that will decide the next occupant of the White House and control of Congress and state legislatures nationwide, Democrats have increasingly argued that Trump – who has baselessly insisted that his 2020 election loss was fraudulent and recently proposed unleashing the military against his political opponents – is a follower of the far-right philosophy associated with Adolf Hitler.
They have been aided in making their case by Trump’s former White House chief of staff John Kelly, who last week said his former boss fitted the definition of a fascist, and by Trump’s Sunday evening rally in New York’s Madison Square Garden, where Trump spent considerable time unleashing vitriol against immigrants and “the enemy from within”, as he describes his political opponents.
Speaking at a recreational center in Saginaw, the seat of a central Michigan county of the same name that narrowly voted for Trump when he won the state in 2016, and then broke for Biden when he reclaimed it four years later, Vance sought to turn the tables on Democrats.
“Look, politics is politics. I volunteered for this job – criticize me, attack me, insult me, it’s what I signed up for. But don’t you dare insult the brave Americans who are fighting for this movement. Don’t attack the voters of the United States of America. That’s what Kamala Harris is doing,” he said.

Vance turned to the Madison Square Garden rally, avoiding mention of warm-up act Tony Hinchcliffe describing Puerto Rico as an “island of garbage”, comments that have sparked fury among Latinos, a key voter group. Instead, he called the event “an incredible thing”, then decried how Democrats have compared it to a gathering of Nazis, such as the one held by American Hitler supporters in 1939.
“I think it’s disgusting … and a person who would close out her campaign by running and attacking her fellow Americans has no business leading the greatest nation on Earth,” Vance said. Noting the presence of a war veteran who had led the pledge of allegiance at his event in Saginaw, Vance said: “It occurs to me that when they attack us as Nazis, it’s so disgraceful, because there are people in this room right now who have grandparents, who have parents, or who they themselves fought in world war two.”
Last week, Harris said she agreed that Trump is a “fascist” and accused him of seeking “unchecked power”. The vice-president is searching for an edge in a race for president that, by all accounts, appears tied, with polls of Michigan and other swing states showing her neck-in-neck with the former president.
Later on Tuesday, Harris is set to make what her campaign has billed as her closing argument to the American people from a park near the White House where Trump addressed his supporters before they attacked the US Capitol on January 6.
Harris’s pitch to voters has centered on warnings that Trump is unfit for the presidency, and on promises to build an “opportunity economy” that would see the US government promote cutting-edge technologies and help Americans afford down-payments on their homes and care for their children and elders.
Trump, by contrast, has described America as a country “destroyed” by foreign influence, from the undocumented migrants who have entered from Mexico to the manufacturers have have moved jobs overseas. Speaking in Saginaw, a medium-sized city that, like so many in Michigan and across the upper midwest, saw its manufacturing-centered economy collapse decades ago, Vance likened the struggles of American soldiers against Nazis to Trump’s own quest to win the presidency.
“[Do] you think that the men who stormed the beaches at Normandy did it to give taxpayer-funded sex changes to illegal aliens? Do you think that the men who stormed the beaches at Normandy did it to ship all of our good manufacturing jobs off to China? Do you think the men who stormed the beaches at Normandy did it for a president who wants to open the American southern border?” Vance asked. “I don’t think so.”",2024-10-29

Guardian,"US presidential election briefing: Obama, Sanders and AOC, rally for Harris as Trump says he is ‘opposite of a Nazi’","With eight sleeps to go until Americans head to the polls on Tuesday 5 November, campaigning kicked up another notch on Monday as Kamala Harris and Tim Walz appealed to young, first-time voters in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Barack Obama and Bruce Springsteen spoke in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania – where the former US president described Donald Trump’s event in Madison Square Garden as featuring “the most racist, sexist, bigoted stereotypes”.
In Wisconsin, the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, appearing with the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, also addressed the racist remarks, specifically those made by a comedian about Puerto Rico. AOC, who is of Puerto Rican descent, said: “They knew exactly what they were doing; let’s dispense with this idea that this is a joke,” and added that Trump’s words echoed those of Adolf Hitler.
Trump, meanwhile, told voters in Atlanta, Georgia, that he was the “opposite of a Nazi”; and the billionaire Jeff Bezos wrote a column in the Washington Post, the paper he owns, explaining the decision taken by its editorial board not to endorse a candidate this election, for the first time in 30 years.
Here’s what else happened on Monday:
Kamala Harris election news and updates
-
Campaigning for Harris in Wisconsin, Bernie Sanders said: “You have Mike Pence saying I can’t support the guy I worked with for four years” and “We cannot allow someone to be president of the United States who is a pathological liar and who is working night and day to undermine American democracy.”
-
Sanders also released a video addressing voter concerns over the Biden-Harris administration’s record on Gaza, saying: “After Kamala wins, we will together do everything that we can to change US policy towards Netanyahu.”
-
Before performing at a rally with Obama in Pennsylvania, Bruce Springsteen said: “I’m Bruce Springsteen and I’m here today to support Kamala Harris and Tim Walz and to oppose Donald Trump and JD Vance … I want a president who reveres the constitution, who does not threaten but wants to protect and guide our great democracy, who believes in the rule of law and the peaceful transfer of power, who will fight for women’s rights … [and] create a middle-class economy that works for all our citizens.”
-
Anita Hill, a former clerk to the US supreme court justice Clarence Thomas, has said “racist, misogynist and sexist insults” aimed at Kamala Harris “must sting”. In a New York Times opinion piece published on Monday, the Brandeis University professor – who was famously brought before Thomas’s confirmation hearings only to have her sexual harassment allegations against him picked apart by sitting senators – wrote that she sympathises with the US vice-president.
Donald Trump election news and updates
-
Donald Trump faced mounting suspicion of hatching a plot to steal next week’s presidential election as Democrats and commentators focused on his references to a “little secret” at Sunday night’s tumultuous Madison Square Garden rally.
-
Outrage is continuing to mount following the racist anti-Puerto Rican remarks at that rally in New York as Democrat politicians, celebrities and even some Republicans condemned the scenes there.
-
The Philadelphia district attorney’s office has filed a lawsuit seeking to stop Elon Musk’s political action committee giving $1m daily to registered voters in swing states. The lawsuit by the district attorney, Larry Krasner, accuses the tech billionaire and his America Pac group of attempting to influence voters in the US presidential election with hopes of winning a cash prize.
-
Trump’s aides have floated the idea of granting immediate security clearances to officials in a second term and doing away with FBI background checks for appointees who might otherwise fail the process, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Elsewhere on the campaign trail
-
Hundreds of early ballots cast for the US presidential election have been burned in two suspected attacks in Washington and Oregon, exacerbating tensions ahead of next Tuesday’s knife-edge contest. Police believed the fires in the two states were connected and a vehicle involved had been identified, the Associated Press reported.
-
Jeff Bezos argued that the Washington Post editorial board’s decision not to endorse a candidate was taken in order to avoid the perception of bias. Bezos – who founded Amazon – said he had taken the decision because he was worried that people had lost trust in the traditional US media and were getting their news from social media, leaving them vulnerable to disinformation. The decision not to endorse has rocked the Post and seen the loss of 200,000 subscribers who have cancelled their subscriptions.

Just before Trump took the stage on Monday afternoon, Georgia’s early vote count crossed the 3m mark. More than 40% of Georgia voters have already cast a ballot. About 5 million people in Georgia voted in the 2020 presidential race.

Guardian,Two hurricanes stir up voter backlash to Florida Republicans’ climate denialism,"The climate emergency was already a hot-button political issue in Florida long before devastating back-to-back hurricanes named Helene and Milton barreled into the state in recent weeks.
Ron DeSantis, the Republican governor who considers global warming “leftwing stuff”, angered environmental advocates by signing a bill in May scrubbing the words “climate change” from state statutes and in effect committing Florida to a fossil fuel-burning future.
They saw his comments and actions as merely the latest acts of an extended period of climate denialism by state leaders – including Rick Scott, his predecessor as governor who is seeking re-election as US senator next month in a tight race with the Democrat Debbie Mucarsel-Powell.
Scott also censored talk of the climate crisis. Nicknamed “Red Tide Rick” by opponents for slashing $700m in water management funding intended to fight toxic algae blooms, Scott “systematically” disassembled “the environmental agencies of this state”, according to the Democratic former senator Bill Nelson.
Now, as weary Floridians head for the polls next month, many in areas still devastated by the deadly storm surge and high intensity winds from two hurricanes, there is evidence that the twin disasters are fueling something of a backlash.
DeSantis is not on the ballot, but Scott is, and so are many among the Republican supermajority in the state house and senate who have been blindly loyal to both governors’ agendas.
Some voters say climate issues have become uppermost in their minds, having experienced or witnessed the wrath of Helene and Milton, as well as other recent Florida cyclones, and frustration over the long history of inaction or denial in the face of rising sea levels and record ocean heat that experts say is powering ever-stronger storms.
The movement is pronounced among younger and first-time voters, whom advocates say have been registering and voting early in unprecedented numbers.
Jayden D’Onofrio, chair of Florida Future Leaders, said canvassing efforts by his group and others have spurred “record-breaking early turnout” on several campuses including Florida State University, Florida Atlantic University and the University of Miami, with students fired up by the climate debate.
“There was a video of a meteorologist in south Florida who ended up crying on air. A number of my friends, who are not political, sent me that video saying, like, ‘Hey, pretty insane dude. What the hell is going on over here?’” he said.
“So if something like that resonates with youth voters who just generally are out of the political sphere, that says a lot, and that’s why we are hammering hard on that issue. We’re distributing over 175,000 pieces of literature all across the state, and 40,000 are on climate change.”
D’Onofrio said his group was deliberately targeting politicians for their records.

“Rick Scott is the worst of the worst on climate, so we’ve sent thousands of text messages to youth reminding them about climate change and how the Republicans have voted on the issue, especially Scott,” he said.
“You have all these Republican congressmen that voted no on Fema [Federal Emergency Management Agency] funding. When we’re campaigning in these districts that have those congresspeople it’s an easy thing for us to bring up: ‘Hey, your congressman voted no on federal funding for Fema and emergency supplies in your county, which just got absolutely hit by a hurricane. What do you think about that?’
“Of course, the answer is like, ‘What the hell is wrong with that guy or girl or whoever it is?’ It really is so simple.”
Tatiana Bell, 20, a third-year student studying business administration at the Tampa campus of the historically Black Florida A&M University (Famu), said the hurricanes were a “stressful” time, with both Helene and Milton at one point forecast to make a direct hit on the city.
“They’re like, ‘OK, all students can stay in their dormitories,’ then like a couple hours later they’re like, ‘OK, students have to leave campus, you have to go to shelters or simply go home,” said Bell, a campus representative for DoSomething, a youth-centered service and activism group.
“People were very anxious, trying to find out if you can go home. Not every student is fortunate enough to be able to get on a plane or do different things to find safety in a situation like this.”
Bell said that anxiety and threat to their personal safety from severe weather events had made many students even more cognizant of the climate emergency as an election issue.
“Honestly, it’s like top two, just after funding for our universities. It shouldn’t be like this, [you start] the fall semester and next thing you know hurricanes are coming,” she said.
Ben Groenevelt, a resident of Coral Springs, relocated to south Florida from Wisconsin with his family in 2009, and has become increasingly concerned by changes to the environment. Last year, he won election to the board of a local water management district and helped save thousands of trees it wanted to fell so they would not be a threat during hurricanes.
“Since we moved, I’ve been seeing more powerful hurricanes, more issues with rising sea levels, flooding, and things like that,” he said.
“It’s such a big issue here, and we need more awareness of what is going on. On a personal level, I think that to deny it, especially being a leader in the state of Florida, I just don’t think that’s an appropriate position they have.”
Groenevelt will vote for Democratic candidates on 5 November. His middle daughter of three, Whitney, has just turned 18 and will be voting for the first time.
“We have conversations, and there’s definitely a concern when they’re talking and thinking about their own futures, and what it’ll be like, you know, is there going to be snow or no snow? Will it be too hot? Or too cold? These things come up,” he said.
D’Onofrio said it would be younger voters, such as Groenevelt’s daughters and the students he has been working with on campuses, who will drive a generational change in climate politics, which is why he said the work of groups such as Florida Future Leaders was so important.
“One thing people always say is that youth voters don’t turn out, but my answer is always it’s not that they don’t care, it’s that they’ve never felt seen, or heard, or talked to,” he said.
“What’s different now is because we are all youth talking to youth, we understand our generation, we know how to talk to them. You don’t want an 80-year-old talking to a 20-year-old about climate change, or any issue. It just doesn’t work. We’re all 20-year-olds talking to 20-year-olds. We understand it, so it resonates.”",2024-10-27
Guardian,Harris to call for tougher border action on Arizona visit; Trump threatens to prosecute Google for ‘bad stories’ – as it happened,"Harris meets border patrol agents on tour of border wall in Arizona
Kamala Harris has arrived at the US-Mexico border in Arizona, where the vice-president was briefed by two customs and border protection officials.
Harris stepped out of her motorcade on a dusty desert road outside Douglas, Arizona, and shook hands with two men, the Associated Press reported. Harris chatted with the uniformed agents as they walked along the rust-colored border wall in temperatures that neared 100F (38C).
The section of the wall Harris is viewing was constructed during Barack Obama’s administration, in 2011-2012, according to the White House pool reporter.
Harris’s conversation with the CBP officers was not audible to the pool reporter on scene. A White House official told him that Harris had “heard directly from CBP officials on their efforts to combat traffickers and transnational criminal organizations”.
Kamala Harris delivered a speech on immigration policy, laying out the balance she wants to strike: what’s important to her about the US immigration system is that “it works in an orderly way, that it is humane and that it makes our country stronger”.
Donald Trump threatened to prosecute Google for “displaying bad stories” about him. In the middle of a busy day of presidential campaign events in Michigan, a key swing state, Donald Trump posted on his social media platform that, if elected president, he plans to prosecute Google for, he alleged, “only revealing and displaying bad stories about Donald J Trump” while “only revealing Good stories about Kamala Harris”.
And, the Department of Justicefiled a lawsuit against the state ofAlabama for last-minute voter purges. The justice department is suing Alabama for what it alleges is an illegal attempt to remove voters from the rolls too close to November’s election.
Here’s what else happened today:
Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke after his meeting in New York with Donald Trump and said the two men had a “very productive” talk. Ukraine’s president said the two “thoroughly reviewed” the situation in Ukraine since Russia’s invasion more than two-and-a-half years ago, Reuters reports.
In a video address on Friday, the FBI director, Christopher Wray, spoke of the indictment of three Iranian nationals for their role in a “wide-ranging hacking campaign sponsored by the government of Iran”. Wray said: “These individuals, employees of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, targeted a US political campaign, current and former US officials, and members of the American media, all in an attempt to sow discord and undermine our democracy.”
Kamala Harrisarrived in Tucson, Arizona, from Washington DC for election campaign events, including a visit to the US-Mexico border.
Kamala HarrisandDonald Trumpare tied among voters in North Carolina, a new poll shows. The CNN poll, released today and conducted from 20 to 25 September, shows Harris and Trump both receiving 48% of support among likely voters in North Carolina.
Eric Adams, the New York City mayor, pleaded not guilty to corruption charges when he appeared in court in Manhattan. He denies federal bribery and fraud charges. The mayor’s arraignment began just after noon local time at a federal courthouse in New York. It is the first time that a sitting mayor of the city has been charged with crimes.
AfterKamala Harrisspoke about her policies related to the southern border during a speech inDouglas, Arizona, the National Border Patrol Council, the labor union representing the US border patrol, said that Harris “has ignored the border problem she created for over three years”.
“She goes down there for 20 minutes for a photo op and decides to repeat some of the things the NPBC has said before. But again, where has she been the last 3 1/2 years?” the union wrote on X, repeating a Trump talking point.
Google followed up on Donald Trump’s claim that the search engine is illegally using a system to only reveal bad stories about him and good stories about Kamala Harris by issuing a statement:
Both campaign websites consistently appear at the top of Search for relevant and common search queries,.
Following up on a report by Fox News, Google continued: “This report looked at a single rare search term on a single day a few weeks ago, and even for that search, both candidates’ websites ranked in the top results on Google.”
Here’s some more in-depth reporting from the Associated Press, capturing how the reality of what is happening at the border has changed dramatically in the past few months, even as the political rhetoric (Trump’s in particular) really hasn’t:
As midnight nears, the lights of El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, fill the sky on the silent banks of the Rio Grande. A few months ago, hundreds of asylum-seeking families, including crying toddlers, waited for an opening to crawl through razor wire from Juarez into El Paso.
No one is waiting there now.
Nearly 500 miles away, in the border city of Eagle Pass, large groups of migrants that were once commonplace are rarely seen on the riverbanks these days.
In McAllen, at the other end of the Texas border, two Border Patrol agents scan fields for five hours without encountering a single migrant.
It’s a return to relative calm after an unprecedented surge of immigrants through the southern border in recent years. But no one would know that listening to Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump talking about border enforcement at dueling presidential campaign events. And no one would know from the rate at which Texas is spending on a border crackdown called Operation Lone Star – $11 billion since 2021.
If you’re looking to put both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris’sclaims about what’s happening at the US-Mexico border in context, this article from August is a good place to start:
Here’s how Hamed Aleaziz, a longtime immigration reporter, summed up the substance of Harris’s immigration policy today for the New York Times:
In a sign of how the politics of immigration have changed, Harris is promoting a policy that resembles a Trump-era effort to ban asylum for those who cross the border illegally. Harris says that she understands that people are desperate to come into the United States, but that the system must be ‘orderly.’
In the same speech, Harris slammed Trump for separating immigrant children from their families and putting “children in cages”, and called for a gentler rhetoric about immigrants, and a focus on solutions, rather than blame and attacks.
Harris is getting big cheers from a Democratic audience as she shifts from talking about tough enforcement and Congress’s failures to pass immigration reform to talking about legal paths to citizenship for immigrants who have been in the US for years, the importance of helping “Dreamers” – undocumented young people who came to the US as children – and the many contributions of immigrant farm workers.
Harris is repeating a central part of her immigration rhetoric: that Donald Trump deliberately torpedoed a bipartisan immigration reform bill because “he prefers to run on a problem than fixing a problem.”
Harris’s campaign, like the Biden administration previously, is highlighting Mitch McConnell’s own remarks about Trump’s influence on the legislation.
The White House has been using this approach to the immigration issue since early this year: “Congressional Republicans do not care about securing the border or fixing America’s broken immigration system,” Biden said in a statement in early 2024. “If they did, they would have voted for the toughest border enforcement in history.”
As Kamala Harris begins her speech on immigration policy, she lays out the balance she wants to strike: what’s important to her about the US immigration system is that “it works in an orderly way, that it is humane and that it makes our country stronger”.
Among the people who introduced Kamala Harris, who is beginning her remarks on immigration and border policy, was Theresa Guerrero, a woman from Tucson, Arizona, who has become an activist after her son, Jacob, died of a fentanyl overdose.
Trump’s campaign also previously featured remarks, during the Republican national convention, from a parent of a child lost to fentanyl.
The Harris campaign is already attacking Donald Trump using a video of his comments from Warren, Michigan, tonight, talking about tariffs and how prosperous the US was in the 1890s.
Trump has been making the case for high taxes on imported goods, which Congressional Republicans who oppose tariffs hope they can “water down” if he’s elected, the Washington Post reported yesterday.
Mark Kelly,the US senator from Arizona, has been shepherding Harris during her visit to the border town of Douglas on Friday.
Kelly began his remarks by sending greetings from his wife, the former Arizona representative Gabby Giffords, setting off a round of cheers for the beloved former representative.
He retold the story of negotiating the bipartisan border deal in Congress only to see Trump torpedo the package by pressuring Republican senators to reject it.
“This is the most hypocritical thing I’ve seen in three-and-a-half years in Washington,” Kelly said, calling the plan “the deal that Arizona needs”. Harris has vowed to revive the bill, if elected, and said she would have signed it into law.
Kelly ended his remarks by saying that the playbook for winning in November was simple: hard work.
“This is not rocket science. If it was, I could help,” the former astronaut quipped, as he campaigned for the vice-president.
Biden embraced a more Trump-like border policy. Trump still claims Harris is weak.
Some context, as we wait for Harris to give a campaign speech in the border town of Douglas, Arizona, where she is expected to call for tougher action at the US border with Mexico:
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris made criticism of Trump’s harsh immigration policies part of their bid for the White House in 2020. But the Democratic administration has increasingly moved right on immigration, leading to criticisms that, though Biden certainly does not verbally attack and revile immigrants as Trump does, Biden’s actual policy regarding the US-Mexico border made him a kind of Trump 2.0.
Harris, who supported decriminalizing undocumented border crossings in 2019 during her brief presidential run, has moved away from that stance in her new campaign, also striking a more law-and-order tone, which she is expected to continue in her border policy speech today.
Trump has made political attacks against Harris, blaming her for the border crisis, a central part of his campaign against her. Polls have suggested US voters trust Trump more than Harris on immigration.
The global picture: in the US, as in the UK and Europe, wealthy democracies have spent decades trying to deter immigrants from coming across their borders to seek a better life by making border crossings increasingly surveilled, militarized and deadly. This has not, broadly speaking, stopped people from continuing to migrate in hopes of finding safer lives for themselves and their families, particularly as wars, climate change and other crises provide reasons to seek asylum elsewhere. But deterrence policies do mean that children and adult attempting to migrate are more likely to die because of the conditions that wealthy countries create at their borders, in hopes of persuading people that it’s too dangerous to migrate.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll last month found that 43% of voters favored Trump on the issue of immigration and 33% favored Harris, while 24% either didn’t know, chose someone else or declined to answer, Reuters reports.
Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s town hall in Warren, Michigan, is running about an hour behind schedule, the New York Times reports. (The Detroit Free Press has a livestream here, should you wish to follow along.)
PBS also has a livestream of Kamala Harris’s expected campaign remarks on border policy in Douglas, Arizona, that will go live in about a half-hour.
Asked what she had learned from her conversation with customs and border protection officials, Kamala Harris told today’s White House pool reporter:
They’ve got a tough job and they need, rightly, support to do their job. They are very dedicated. And so I’m here to talk with them about what we can continue to do to support them. And also thank them for the hard work they do.",2024-09-28
Guardian,Johnson followed McCarthy in working with Democrats. Can he avoid his fate?,"The Republican House speaker, Mike Johnson, pursued the same strategy as his predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, to prevent a government shutdown this month – working with Democrats to pass a bipartisan funding deal.
Now Johnson has to hope he can avoid the same fate as McCarthy, the California congressman who was ousted from the speakership by hard-right members of his own conference last year just days after the House voted to keep the government open.
The House voted 341 to 82 on Wednesday to extend government funding through 20 December, averting a shutdown that was set to begin next week. The stopgap funding bill, known as a continuing resolution, attracted the support of 132 Republicans and 209 Democrats in the House.
But 82 House Republicans, representing more than a third of Johnson’s conference, voted against the legislation. That widespread opposition could spell trouble for the future of Johnson’s speakership.
It was only a year ago that eight hard-right Republicans joined 208 Democrats to oust McCarthy from the speaker’s chair less than a year after his election. The congressman Matt Gaetz, who led the charge against McCarthy, had fiercely criticized the then speaker for working with Democrats to keep the government open.
In the days leading up to the shutdown deadline last year, McCarthy initially tried to pass a more rightwing funding proposal with only Republican support. That bill failed after 21 House Republicans, including Gaetz, voted against it. The failure forced McCarthy to take up a more neutral funding bill that ultimately received more support from Democrats than Republicans, just as Johnson’s bill did on Wednesday. McCarthy’s act of bipartisanship prevented a shutdown but cost him his job, after Gaetz forced a vote on a motion to vacate the chair.
That historic vote kicked off weeks of chaos in the House, as Republicans repeatedly tried and failed to unify around a new speaker. In the end, Johnson, who was House Republicans’ fourth speaker nominee in the three weeks after McCarthy’s removal, emerged victorious and seized the gavel.
Now Johnson finds himself in the same position that McCarthy did. Last week, Johnson tried to pass a more rightwing funding bill that was combined with the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (Save) Act, which would require people to show proof of citizenship when they register to vote. But that bill failed to pass, as 14 House Republicans and all but two House Democrats voted against the proposal.
After that setback, Johnson reckoned with a reality he had ignored for weeks: that the only way to fund the government would be to pass a continuing resolution narrow enough to win Democrats’ support.
The concession sparked outrage among some hard-right Republicans, who condemned the continuing resolution as another symptom of reckless government spending. But it remains unclear what their frustration will mean for the speaker’s future, and unlike McCarthy, Johnson’s prospects may benefit from the election calendar.
With less than six weeks left until election day, Johnson repeatedly warned fellow Republicans that it would be “political malpractice” to shut down the government. In a “Dear Colleague” letter sent on Sunday, Johnson cited polling showing that 63% of independent voters, who will play a crucial role in House elections, opposed a government shutdown.
Johnson has bristled at comparisons between him and his predecessor, insisting his strategy is nothing like McCarthy’s because of the “very different circumstances” of the latest funding fight. And Johnson has already survived one threat to his speakership, after the House easily quashed the congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene’s resolution to oust him back in May. Greene had attacked Johnson over his reliance on Democratic support to pass several major bills, but a bipartisan coalition voted to kill Greene’s motion to remove the speaker.
But more Republicans may turn against Johnson if Donald Trump lashes out against the speaker over the shutdown fight. Trump had previously called on Republican lawmakers to reject any funding deal unless it was linked to “election security” measures, a demand that was not met. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Johnson insisted there was “no daylight” between his position and Trump’s.
“President Trump understands the current dilemma and the situation that we’re in,” Johnson said. “I keep him apprised all the time of everything that’s happening because he is our nominee for president, and he’s going to be the next president, so we’ll continue working closely together. I’m not defying President Trump. We’re getting our job done, and I think he understands that.”
Even if Johnson can keep Trump in his corner, his efforts to keep the speakership may be for naught depending on the results of the elections in November. Democrats only need to win five more seats than they did in 2022 to retake the majority, which would probably elevate the House minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, to the position.
Asked about his expectations for November, Johnson said he was “very optimistic”, but he sidestepped a question about whether he would run for minority leader if Republicans lost the House.
“We’ll cross that bridge when we come to it,” Johnson said on Wednesday after the vote. “I believe we’re going to hold the House, and I intend to be the speaker in the new Congress.”
Time will tell whether Johnson’s colleagues have other plans for him.",2024-09-26
Guardian,I followed Trump and Joe Rogan into the manosphere – and it was not pretty | Zoe Williams,"According to Forbes, Donald Trump talked about five important things in a three-hour-plus podcast with Joe Rogan: whether the 2020 election was stolen; whether Kamala Harris was a “low IQ person”; whether he trusts polls; whether there is life on Mars (some “great pilots” have seen “things, sir, that were very strange” and “there’s no reason not to think that Mars and all these planets don’t have life”); and whether he would, if elected, eliminate federal income tax (he might). The New York Times highlighted the same points, adding a meandering discussion about the environment, where Trump suggested that environmental regulations were just a scheme to enrich consultants.
The BBC, meanwhile, took away seven points: most of the above, plus what Trump considers his biggest mistake (hiring the wrong people during his presidency, “neocons or bad people or disloyal people”); his own state of health (“unbelievable” – he meant in a good way); foreign affairs (he said to Kim Jong-un: “Little Rocket Man, you’re going to burn in hell,” but they got on fine after that, because that’s how little rocket men like to be spoken to). The BBC also included a segment on The Apprentice: how NBC tried to talk Trump out of running for president, not because it feared he might be unfit and dangerous, but because it wanted to keep the show on the road.
And those are all reasonable talking points of course: if tax is to be abolished and replaced with tariffs, that sounds like something a citizen ought to know. If the peaceful transfer of democratic power is still hotly contested in Trump’s mind – if he blankly cannot conceive of an election in which he was not victorious, without assuming fraud – then it’s surely worth thinking about what that could look like in a fortnight’s time.
But there are other themes easily as dominant, easily as recurring, that respectable people are too polite to mention, because it’s like listening to a drunk Alan Partridge, his subconscious just gaping open. As Trump imagineers himself into a mixed martial arts changing room with Rogan, you can’t help but travel there with them, however much you’d prefer not to. “You love going in there after the fight and they’re sweating all over you, they’re slopping all over you, they’re bleeding sometimes,” Trump said. His strange, lascivious disgust sometimes sounds as though it’s about to capsize him, but somehow his psyche always comes to the rescue, drags him back to a happy place, with pilots, or film stars, or better still, the film stars of the past.
Here he is, again with Rogan, on Air Force One – “These guys are specimens. I always say they’re better looking than Tom Cruise. OK? And they’re even taller, like perfect specimens … You could see the pilot, a perfect looking human being, his co-pilot. Everybody was perfect. They were all like movie stars.” Back in March, his animating issue was what Cary Grant would have looked like, aged 81, or 100, in a bathing suit (he “wouldn’t look too good, and he was pretty good-looking, right?”). A week ago, playing dress-up in McDonald’s, he got to the point – because really, what are bathing suits, and sweat, and blood, and beauty, except a tease? All you really need to know, particularly about deceased golfers, is what’s underneath. “Arnold Palmer was all man,” Trump told reporters, who definitely hadn’t asked. “When he took the showers with other pros, they came out of there. They said: ‘Oh my God. That’s unbelievable.’”
In an astonishing attempt at sane-washing, the Wall Street Journal called this a “ribald tribute” – “crude talk that plays to his most ardent backers, particularly men”. Fair play, I don’t spend that much time in the locker room or its online equivalent, the manosphere, but I’m medium-sure their crude talk is actually quite low on other men’s remarkable penises. Or, where they do crop up, there’s some narrative drive, some beginning, middle and end.
It’s like listening to a man who’s been hypnotised. The truly remarkable thing about disinhibition is that it throws all the embarrassment back on to the audience, which shuffles away, averting its gaze, talking about polls, concentrating on tax and North Korea.

Guardian,Steve Bannon released from prison a week before US election,"Maybe my own childhood with a narcissistic, abusive, seductive father was what gave me eyes to see Trump for what he is",2024-01-01
Guardian,Alexi Lalas keeps tweeting Maga propaganda. Does it matter?,"As the US men’s national team prepared to kick off against Panama earlier this month, Soccer Twitter warmed up for the first game of the Mauricio Pochettino era.
Amid his routine match analysis, America’s most prominent soccer pundit retweeted old footage of Barack Obama discussing immigration policy that surfaced in an attempt to make the former president appear hypocritical and discredit Kamala Harris by association.
The jarring mix of sports and politics is normal for Alexi Lalas, who stands out among soccer broadcasters for his open engagement with the imminent American presidential election and for his party affiliation.
Lalas gave an interview on the Fox Business channel in July from the Republican National Convention which careened from how the event is “a cool place to be” to a discussion of the Barcelona prodigy Lamine Yamal. Speaking on Fox News radio from the convention, Lalas said he wants to challenge “the stereotype that exists when it comes to Republicans and certainly the right side of the political spectrum … I live in California, I work in soccer, I’m like a unicorn when it comes to politics out there and yet there are a lot of things that can unite us.”
To judge by the volume of online abuse he attracts and airs on X – and to which he often responds with wit and generosity – his political output is having the opposite effect. That’s not surprising when his feed amplifies right-wing talking points, such as Lalas’ recent rehashing of video of a publicity stunt in which Donald Trump served fries to fawning supporters at a Pennsylvania McDonald’s in a specious attempt to taunt Harris.
The ginger-bearded face of American soccer in the 1990s, a defender and rock musician who played in Serie A and won 96 caps for the USMNT, Lalas played every minute of the host nation’s four matches at the 1994 World Cup and became, wrote The Los Angeles Times, “the cult figure of America’s high summer”. After retirement he worked as an MLS executive, including for the Los Angeles Galaxy when they signed David Beckham.
The mellow, mumbling kid who let David Letterman trim his pumpkin-hued goatee after USA ’94 is now a 54-year-old greying purveyor of indignant tirades for Fox Sports, proudly repping a segment of society who equate the profundity of their patriotism with the prominence of their Stars and Stripes flags and the decibel level of their bellowing about American greatness.
With viral clips often attracting more views than live broadcasts on traditional TV channels, there is clear value in being the blowtorch of hot-take merchants. Given the sonic vanilla that is the corporate agenda-driven coverage of MLS on Apple TV, there may be a market for a celebrated American personality who provides and provokes trenchant opinions. But does that hold true when the talk moves from Pochettino’s right-wing to that of the GOP?
“When you’re in the entertainment sector, going political tends to have very little upside because this country seems to be perpetually split, 49 to 48, and just in general it’s not going to make one side love you more because they’re just looking at what you’re doing on the field and in the announcer booth. But it will set off the other side,” says Mike Lewis, professor of marketing at Emory University and author of Fandom Analytics, a data-driven analysis of sports supporters.
Lalas, a Ron DeSantis fan whose soccer podcast is called State of the Union in a nod to the president’s annual address, has more than 400,000 followers on X. “It’s my channel. I program it with what I like and what I find interesting. If it offends your sensibilities, there are millions of other channels for you to choose from. Go in peace,” Lalas wrote this month to a reader baffled by his divisive posts, which are typically retweets without additional commentary – an unusually coy style for him.
That’s true for social media. But given his centrality to Fox’s coverage and the exclusivity of their rights, viewers will find it harder to swerve Lalas if they want to watch some of the biggest matches in the sport. And given how polarised and piqued the nation is and how intertwined party affiliation has become with personal identity, if viewers are aware of his political leanings, can they divorce that from his on-screen presence, even when he’s purely talking soccer? Do liberals want to hear a verdict on Christian Pulisic from Lalas any more than they want to buy a Tesla from the Trump super-booster Elon Musk?
“It’s almost like a reflexive thing,” Lewis says, “that that’s an enemy now, and I don’t want to listen to an enemy while I watch the US men’s soccer team.” The risk of alienating roughly half your consumer base may be partially offset by the appeal of being perceived as bucking the liberal consensus as an unafraid and unfiltered Republican ambassador from deep blue Los Angeles in a progressive-leaning sport historically disparaged by conservatives.
Like Trump, Lalas suggested the US were too woke after they went out of last year’s Women’s World Cup, and did not deviate from Republican orthodoxy in 2020 with a critical tweet when NWSL players took the knee for the national anthem. The Republican Party’s widespread antipathy towards diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging initiatives conflicts with the mission statement of the US Soccer Federation, which declares, “we integrate DEIB into everything we do”.
There is a balancing act in playing a high-profile role in a mainstream channel – Fox, after all, has the rights to the 2026 World Cup – then sliding into the right-wing media ecosystem, where many conservatives have found audiences by stoking grievances and trolling the libs. One recent Lalas repost reads: “I check X for two reasons. Elon’s latest meme and seeing who Alexi ticked off today”.
Fox Sports and Lalas declined to comment for this article. Like Fox News, Fox Sports is part of the Fox Corporation, which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch and family. So is the conservative-leaning sports news site, Outkick, which vows to question “the consensus and [expose] the destructive nature of ‘woke’ activism” and often cites Lalas.
Politics and soccer are far from strangers. Two of the UK’s leading soccer broadcasters, Gary Lineker and Gary Neville, drew ire from British right-wingers for their criticism of the last Conservative government, with Lineker briefly removed from the BBC’s flagship football programme in 2023 for tweets about asylum policy that the broadcaster said breached impartiality rules.
The American landscape, however, has changed since Jemele Hill was suspended by ESPN in 2017 for calling Trump a “white supremacist” on X and the network introduced a social media policy discouraging employees from openly taking sides and offering commentary beyond sports. Sticking to sports now seems blinkered. The ESPN star, Stephen A Smith, frequently opines on politics on other platforms and recently sparred with Fox News’ Sean Hannity. Fox Sports’ Colin Cowherd also talks politics, as does Dan LeBatard, who started his own podcast after criticisms of Trump contributed to his departure from ESPN.
“There’s a price to pay for it. That’s why it is so hard to figure out the right policy, it’s very challenging to sort through what is a restriction on someone’s free speech” versus protecting the employer’s brand and reputation, says Patrick Crakes, a media consultant and former Fox Sports executive.
“One of the reasons a lot of major sports personalities don’t [talk politics] is because you are a very general market, and do you really want to have to take 50% of the people that see you and fight them, or alienate them or make them uncomfortable with you? Sports, traditionally, I feel it was neutral ground. That’s increasingly changed.”
Though political talk remains rare during game broadcasts and few commentators have overtly revealed political stances, perceptions of partisanship have become ingrained. “Republican-identifying sports media consumers find NBC Sports to be the most biased sports media outlet; Democratic-identifying sports media consumers find Fox Sports to be the most biased sports media outlet,” according to a survey for the University of Texas’ annual Politics in Sports Media report. “This suggests that the sports networks are reputationally connected to their parent news organizations.” The poll also found that 80% of Republicans do not want athletes to share their political beliefs compared with only 42% of Democrats.
The line has also blurred between voters and spectators. “In the Trump era, we’ve started to see these political rallies that look like sporting events where you can have guys essentially face-painted up, they’ve got the red hats, the matching uniforms,” Lewis says. “I think there’s really powerful similarities between sports and politics in the way fandom works, particularly in the way fandom is so closely related to people’s identities.”
The subordination of issues to identity and policies to personality means affiliations are ossified and compromise impossible, with Democrats no more likely to switch to supporting Republicans than would a Liverpool fan change allegiance to Manchester United. “If I’m teaching a class on sports marketing and I’m talking about fandom and I ask someone a question, ‘who are you a fan of,’ if they start to tell me two teams, there’s almost a reaction: ‘well, you’re not really a fan. You can’t like the Yankees and the Mets!’” Lewis says.
“I think of it all as culture at this point. There’s almost this seamless connection across all these categories, entertainment to sports to politics,” he adds. “They are the culture, they are all happening simultaneously and all affecting each other.” Strangely, when everything is linked it feels like everything is fractured.
Last year, Lalas wrote of the USWNT: “Politics, causes, stances, & behavior have made this team unlikeable to a portion of America.” Well, they could respond: right back at ya. And left-leaning observers might doubt the analytical prowess of a professional critic who, to apply a football metaphor to the politics on his X feed, focuses on one team’s shirt-pulling while ignoring the two-footed tackles flying in from the other side, and hails the “authenticity” of a serial liar and flip-flopper.
More broadly, though, in a climate where it’s standard that politicians speak out on sports and countless celebrities issue political opinions and endorsements, why shouldn’t sports personalities enjoy the same freedom of expression? If we feel Lalas should keep quiet, shouldn’t we also feel that way about Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift?
One difference: other forms of artistic expression, such as music, drama and writing, are often conceived and performed as explicit political statements while sports have been treated as a break from reality, not a reflection of it. That’s no longer sustainable as social media entangles news and opinion, the public and the personal. Wisely or not, Lalas isn’t only opposing a liberal consensus, he’s contributing to the erasure of a naive illusion.",2024-10-30
Guardian,Republican former congressional candidate charged with stealing ballots in Indiana,"A Republican former congressional candidate was charged with stealing ballots during a test of a voting system in Madison county, Indiana, state police said on Tuesday.
During the test on 3 October, which involved four voting machines and 136 candidate ballots marked for testing, officials discovered that two ballots were missing, according to the Indiana state police.
Voter fraud is rare in the United States, and courts dismissed multiple lawsuits of alleged electoral fraud brought by former president Donald Trump and some of his Republican allies who accused Democrats of stealing the 2020 election. Trump faces the Democratic vice-president, Kamala Harris, in a 5 November presidential election.
For four years, Trump has maintained his false claim, supported by a majority of Republicans in Congress, that the 2020 election was stolen. As a result, some states and counties have stepped up precautions.
Surveillance video showed Larry Savage, 51, a precinct committee member, folding and placing both ballots in his pocket after receiving instructions about the validity of the test ballots, the police said.
A search warrant was issued and Savage’s residence was subsequently searched, police said, adding that officers found the missing ballots in his vehicle.
“We unequivocally condemn any form of criminal election interference. We appreciate law enforcement’s efforts in pursuing justice and we will continue to monitor this situation as the process unfolds,” Griffin Reid, the communications director for Indiana’s Republican party, said in a statement.
Savage faces charges of destroying or misplacing a ballot, and theft, according to online records. No defense lawyer is listed for him, and he was released on bond.
Before turning himself in on Tuesday morning, Savage said he was innocent and described the charges as “bumped up”.
Savage unsuccessfully ran to be the Republican candidate for Indiana’s fifth congressional district. He secured less than 2% of the vote in his party’s primary.",2024-10-30
Guardian,"Where do Trump and Harris stand on housing, taxes and other policies?","The economy looms large over next month’s presidential election as tens of millions of Americans begin casting their votes.
Employers are hiring and inflation is fading but consumers are still counting the cost of years of soaring prices. Polls show voters of all persuasions remain unhappy about the state of the economy.
Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have laid out plans they say will transform the world’s largest economy – and tackle voters’ concerns. Come 5 November, those plans are likely to have played a large part in who will win the White House. So where do the two candidates stand on the key economic issues?
Taxes
The US-vice president has pledged to expand the child tax credit, including a $6,000 credit for new parents. She has also pledged expanding earned income tax credit for lower-income workers who are not raising children at home.
While Harris has promised that no one earning less than $400,000 would pay “a penny” more in taxes under her plan, for Americans earning over $1m a year, the tax rate on long-term capital gains would increase from 20% to 28%.
Tax cuts introduced under Trump in 2017 are due to expire at the end of next year. He has pledged to “make permanent” some of the measures in the legislation, including a higher standard deduction for taxpayers and a child tax credit boost.
Both candidates have pledged to end taxes on tips. Trump has also signaled his support for eliminating taxes on overtime pay, and argued that seniors should not pay tax on social security benefits.
The Tax Foundation estimates Trump’s proposals will add $3tn to the 10-year budget deficit. The thinktank estimates that the net effect of Harris’s policies would increase deficits by $2.3tn over the next decade.
Cost of living
Harris has pledged to call on Congress to introduce a federal ban on price gouging. Her administration would also crack down on “unfair” corporate mergers and takeovers that consolidate power within the food industry.
Trump, meanwhile, has pledged to end “market-distorting” restrictions on oil, natural gas and coal – a move his campaign has claimed would lower fuel and energy prices by boosting production. The proposal has prompted widespread criticism from climate experts and campaigners.
Both candidates have pledged to reduce healthcare costs. Harris has proposed making permanent tax credit enhancements under the Affordable Care Act, and extending a $35 cap on insulin. Trump has promised wider access to affordable healthcare and prescription drugs, without providing much detail.
Business
Under Harris, the federal corporate tax rate would rise from 21% to 28% – part of a strategy she says would make firms “pay their fair share”. An excise tax on stock buybacks by publicly traded corporations, currently set at 1%, would be quadrupled.

During Trump’s first term, the corporate tax rate was cut from 35% to 21%. Now he wants to reduce it further, to 15% for companies that manufacture their products in the US, in a bid to boost America’s industrial heartlands.
Harris has also pledged to expand the start-up expense tax deduction from $5,000 to $50,000 and has set a target of 25m new business applications in four years.
Trump promised to end an “unAmerican” crackdown on cryptocurrencies, repeal artificial intelligence regulations brought in under Joe Biden, and “create a robust Manufacturing Industry in Near Earth Orbit” in a bid to encourage innovation.
Trade
“Tariffs” is the “most beautiful word in the dictionary”, Trump has said on the campaign trail. A baseline levy of 10% on all foreign imports is at the heart of the former president’s plan to reduce the US trade deficit. While he has pledged to bring down prices, economists say this risks increasing them.
Trump is also threatening to impose higher tariffs on China, and has pledged to ban companies that outsource jobs overseas from doing business with the federal government.
Harris has pledged to stand up for American businesses that are “threatened” by unfair trade practices, citing areas including shipbuilding, electric vehicles and intellectual property. While Trump has made clear he plans to shake up the global economic system, Harris “believes in upholding and strengthening international economic rules and norms that protect fair trade and create predictability and stability”, according to a policy book released by her campaign.
Labor
Harris pledged to sign “landmark pro-union legislation” including the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, which is designed to protect workers’ rights to form unions, and the Public Service Freedom to Negotiate Act, which would expand collective bargaining rights to all public sector workers.
A Harris administration would also “fight to raise the minimum wage” and “end the sub-minimum wage” for tipped workers and people with disabilities, according to her campaign.
Both campaigns have promised to spur job creation. Trump has pledged to do this by cutting regulations, although his policy platform did not provide details of which would be cut.
The former president has outlined plans for the “largest deportation program in American history”, claiming that immigrants are “taking your jobs”. Economists say that immigration has boosted the US economy, and warn that deporting millions of migrant workers – as Trump has outlined – would hit it hard.
Housing
The soaring cost of housing is a major campaign issue.
While Trump has pledged to “reduce mortgage rates by slashing inflation” to help Americans buy homes, he has been warned that some of his policies, such as tariffs, would stoke inflation. He has also suggested he would try to influence the Federal Reserve, the central bank responsible for setting interest rates, raising questions about its independence.
The former president has vowed to open up “limited portions” of federal land for homebuilding and provide unspecified tax incentives and support to first-time buyers.
Harris, meanwhile, has pledged to provide first-time buyers with $25,000 in down-payment assistance, and introduce a “significant” tax cut for homebuilders who construct properties sold to “working families”.
She has also committed to expand low-income housing tax credits for private and non-profit developers to build affordable rental housing, and create a neighborhood homes tax credit to support the new construction or rehabilitation of more than 400,000 owner-occupied homes in lower-income communities.",2024-10-29
Guardian,The change agent v the tyrant: Harris’s big speech focuses on Trump,"Whither the politics of joy? Kamala Harris’s solid if unspectacular closing argument for why she should be elected US president was not about Kamala Harris. It was first and foremost about Donald Trump.
The Democratic nominee’s big speech in Washington mentioned Trump by name 24 times and Joe Biden only once. It confirmed that, even when Trump is not commander-in-chief, he still commands the American psyche.
A week before election day, Harris chose her venue carefully: the Ellipse, a park just south of the White House. Trump “stood at this very spot nearly four years ago”, she noted, adding that he sent an armed mob to the US Capitol to overturn his 2020 election defeat.
A very different, more diverse, larger crowd – some estimated 75,000 – gathered here on Tuesday, basking in unseasonal afternoon heat, wrapping against an evening chill. They waved “USA” signs and the stars and stripes and wore wristbands glowing blue or red. They chanted “Kamala! Kamala!” and “We’re not going back!” They were surrounded by great symbols of the republic: the Washington monument, the Jefferson memorial, the White House itself.
Speaking at a lectern behind protective glass, Harris went on to warn of Trump’s enemies list and intention to turn the military against those who disagree with him. “This is not a candidate for president who is thinking about how to make your life better,” she said. “This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power.”
The vice-president went on to sketch out some of her own biography as a prosecutor and law enforcement officer fighting for the people. Yet somehow the argument again came back to the Republican nominee. “On day one, if elected, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list,” she said. “When elected, I will walk in with a to-do list.”
It was a far cry from the start of the Harris candidacy, which launched with joyous euphoria and her running mate, Tim Walz, branding Trump and his allies “weird”. That felt like a refreshing tonic after years of anxiety and misery in the Trump era. At the Democratic national convention in Philadelphia, speaker after speaker mocked Trump and made him seem small (Barack Obama even parodied his manhood).
Notably, even then, Harris began to adopt a more serious tone about the threat he poses, and in recent weeks she embraced former Trump officials’ use of “fascist” to underline his authoritarian ambitions, though she did not deploy that word here. His rally at New York’s Madison Square Garden on Sunday, and its echoes of a pro-Nazi rally that took place there in 1939, provided more fodder.
There is some political logic to this choice: make the election a referendum on Trump rather than Harris; make him seem like the incumbent and Harris the change agent. “It is time to turn the page on the drama and conflict, the fear and division,” she said. “It is time for a new generation of leadership in America.”
That would explain why she has sought to distance herself from Biden and is reportedly brushing off his offers to campaign for her. Although her Tuesday rally in Washington was Bidenesque in its dire warnings about the Trump threat, it used the president’s favoured word, “democracy”, only once. Instead, the word “freedom” was spelled out on three giant blue banners, along with “USA”.
Some Democrats are also eager for Harris to separate herself from Biden on the issue of the war in Gaza. A protester was led away shouting: “Stop arming Israel! Arms embargo now!” But Harris did not throw a bone to the peace movement during her remarks.
Whereas Biden used to tout job growth and economic good news, Harris again offered some practical promises: tax cuts for working people and the middle class, the first-ever federal ban on price gouging on groceries, a cap on the price of insulin and help for first-time home buyers.
These were important things that ought to win votes. But they were not accompanied by a grand vision. Mario Cuomo’s old adage was campaign in poetry, govern in prose, but there was not a great deal of soaring rhetoric in Harris’s address. A decade of Trump had been bad for the soul.
The vice-president did deliver a memorable image towards the end, however, recalling how, nearly 250 years, America wrested itself free from a petty tyrant (British monarch George III) and how generations of Americans have preserved that freedom. “They did not struggle, sacrifice and lay down their lives, only to see us cede our fundamental freedoms, only to see us submit to the will of another petty tyrant,” she said. “The United States of America is not a vessel for the schemes of wannabe dictators.”
Then, from fear, a pivot to hope: “The United States of America is the greatest idea humanity ever devised. A nation big enough to encompass all our dreams. Strong enough to withstand any fracture or fissure between us. And fearless enough to imagine a future of possibilities.”
Doug Emhoff joined Harris on stage with a hug and a kiss as the crowd cheered. Next Tuesday, they will be back in Washington for the most nail-biting presidential election since George W Bush v Al Gore in 2000. They will be hoping this Democratic vice-president fares better than Gore did. A wafer-thin margin of a few thousand votes in a swing state or two may determine whether Harris’s closing argument looks like strategic genius or a catastrophic miscalculation.
She told the crowd: “Donald Trump has spent a decade trying to keep the American people divided and afraid of each other. That’s who he is. But America, I am here tonight to say: that’s not who we are.”
The phrase “this is not who we are” has been used often in the Trump era. Sometimes the evidence says otherwise. Next week, the country will find out who we really are.",2024-10-30
Guardian,The Guardian view on the US presidential election 2024: a Democratic government is the one we need,"It is hard to imagine a worse candidate for the American presidency in 2024 than Donald J Trump. His history of dishonesty, hypocrisy and greed makes him wholly unfit for the office. A second Trump term would erode the rule of law, diminish America’s global standing and deepen racial and cultural divides. Even if he loses, Mr Trump has shown that he will undermine the election process, with allies spreading unfounded conspiracy theories to delegitimise the results.
There are prominent Republicans – such as the former vice-president Dick Cheney – who refused to support Mr Trump owing to the threat he poses. Gen Mark Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff under Mr Trump, calls his former boss a “fascist”. America was founded in opposition to absolute monarchy. The Republican nominee models himself after the leader he most admires: Russia’s autocratic president, Vladimir Putin.
Mr Trump’s authoritarianism may finish US democracy. He has praised and promised to pardon those convicted in the January 6 insurrection. He has suggested bypassing legal norms to use potentially violent methods of repression, blurring the lines between vigilantism, law enforcement and military action, against groups – be they Democrats or undocumented immigrants – he views as enemies.
His team has tried to distance itself from the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 and its extreme proposals – such as mass firings of civil servants and erasing women’s rights – that poll poorly. But it is likely that, in office, Mr Trump would adopt many of these intolerant, patriarchal and discriminatory plans. He aims to dismantle the government to enrich himself and evade the law. If Republicans gain control of the Senate, House and White House, he would interpret it as a mandate to silence his critics and entrench his power.
Mr Trump is a transactional and corrupting politician. His supporters see this as an advantage. Christian nationalists want an authoritarian regime to enforce religious edicts on Americans. Elon Musk wants to shape the future without regulatory oversight. Both put self-interest ahead of the American people. Democracy erodes slowly at first, then all at once. In office, Mr Trump appointed three supreme court justices, who this summer blocked efforts to hold him accountable for trying to overturn the 2020 election: their immunity ruling renders the president “a king above the law”, in the words of the liberal justice Sonia Sotomayor.
A historic president
Since Kamala Harris stepped into the spotlight following Joe Biden’s exit, her campaign has been a masterclass in political jujitsu, deftly flipping Mr Trump’s perceived strengths into glaring weaknesses. With a focus on joy, the vice-president sharply contrasted with Mr Trump’s grim narrative of US decline. In their sole televised debate, Ms Harris skillfully outmaneuvered Mr Trump, who fell into her traps, appearing angry and incoherent. She is confident and composed. He sounds unhinged.
The Trump agenda threatens to dismantle voting rights, women’s rights and minority rights – not just reversing decades of social progress but burying it. Mr Trump was behind the shredding of reproductive rights. The conservative forces rallying to him are now intent on imposing a national abortion ban, with – should he win – dire implications for IVF and birth control. Republicans have been hurt in the polls by being associated with such unpopular policies – a weak spot that Ms Harris should keep exploiting.
The vice-president has energised Democrats with savvy media appearances while appealing to swing voters. Progressives, determined to defeat Mr Trump, remain committed to freedom and equality. But Ms Harris has disappointed those who have urged her to take a stand on US complicity in Israel’s bombing of civilians in Gaza and Lebanon. Downplaying war crimes, as arms flow to Israel, has already harmed Democratic chances in key swing states like Michigan.
In a political system where style often rivals substance, perception is crucial. While Ms Harris hasn’t made her race and gender central to her campaign, her victory would be historic: she would be the first woman, and the first woman of color, to be president. Symbolism matters to her base. Her candidacy rallied key constituencies – the young, women, African Americans and Hispanics – who were cooling on Mr Biden. This election is a leap of faith in Ms Harris, who offers a sense of possibility for the future, while Mr Trump clings to a reactionary past.
Protecting democracy
Despite his criminal conviction and being declared a rapist by a judge, Mr Trump remains dangerously close to reclaiming the presidency. Many voters still back a man who was the worst US president ever. But probably not a majority of US voters. Republicans benefit from a skewed electoral system: Democrats have won the popular vote in all but one election since 1992, and secured the overall popular majority for the Senate in every six-year cycle since 1996. Yet the country has often been led by Republican presidents and a GOP-controlled Senate, and therefore a Republican-dominated supreme court. In a close race in November, that could mean Mr Trump doesn’t need to win the election – just a court case.
Mr Biden has been a transformational political figure, but he didn’t transform the country. He aimed to tackle inequality, broken public services and the climate crisis with a $4tn plan funded by taxing the rich. His goal was to restore his party’s political credibility by marrying social liberalism with economic justice. But corporate influence and the Democrats’ slim Senate majority shrank his ambitions. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine shifted his focus to national security, as America experienced rising prices. However, Mr Biden made historic investments to green the economy and refocused industrial policy to take on China. Ms Harris’s plans aim to recapture the spirit of Mr Biden’s insurgency.
The US economy is stronger than it has been in decades, yet Mr Trump consistently outpolls Ms Harris on economic issues. This perhaps reflects decades of neoliberalism. Real wages for blue-collar workers have stagnated since the 1970s, while inflation-adjusted house prices have doubled. Polls show 70% of Americans feel significant political and economic reform is needed, putting Democrats at a disadvantage as they are linked to the status quo.
Political hope fades when we settle for what is, instead of fighting for what could be. Ms Harris embodies the conviction that it’s better to believe in democracy’s potential than to surrender to its imperfections. The Republican agenda is clear: voter suppression, book bans and tax cuts for billionaires. Democrats seek global engagement; the GOP favours isolation. The Biden-Harris administration laid the groundwork for a net zero America. A Trumpian comeback would undo it. A Harris win, with a Democratic Congress, means a chance to restore good governance, create good jobs and lead the entire planet’s climate efforts. Defeating Mr Trump protects democracy from oligarchy and dictatorship. There is too much at stake not to back Ms Harris for president.",2024-10-23
Guardian,The key US Senate races that could determine who controls the chamber,"The Democrats are fending off a Republican offensive aimed at overturning their tiny majority in the Senate.
Retaking control of the US Congress’s upper chamber may represent the GOP’s best opportunity of success in November’s election, according to analysts, surpassing their chances of retaking the White House or even retaining control of the House of Representatives.
But with a burst of enthusiasm from Kamala Harris’s campaign, Democrats are still competitive.
What is the Senate’s current makeup?
The Democrats currently hold 48 of the 100-member chamber’s seats plus having the support of three independent senators who sit with the party’s caucus and back it on important votes. The Republicans have 49 seats, meaning they only need to gain two in November – when one-third of the seats are up for grabs – to regain control.
How likely are Republicans to take control?
On the face of it, the GOP have the edge. The retirement of Joe Manchin, a centrist Democrat from West Virginia with a track record of taking Republican-friendly positions, is almost certain to result in a GOP gain in a state that has become a party stronghold.
If Donald Trump were to retake the White House, winning West Virginia alone would be enough to in effect hand the Senate to the Republicans, with the vice-president being awarded the casting vote under the US constitution in a 50-50 split scenario.
Where are sitting Democrats most vulnerable?
Two Democratic incumbent senators in GOP heartland states are seen as particularly vulnerable; Jon Tester of Montana and Sherrod Brown of Ohio. The latter is a one-time election battleground that has been won by Trump in recent elections and is now considered solid Republican territory.
In states that have become increasingly conservative, both Tester and Brown have sought to stay competitive by emphasising their independence from the more liberal national party organisation. Each stayed away from August’s Democratic national convention in Chicago to focus on wooing independent and swing voters whose support is deemed vital to holding their seats. The Cook Political Report has designated Montana as leaning Republican and Ohio as a toss-up.
Montana
John Tester v Tim Sheehy
Tester, who has held the seat since 2006, is running for a fourth term in a state Trump won by 16 points four years ago against Tim Sheehy, a former Navy Seal and businessman, who has the former president’s backing.
Read David Smith’s reporting about the Montana Senate race here.
Ohio
Sherrod Brown v Bernie Moreno
Brown has been in the Senate for as long as Tester and is also seeking his fourth term. His opponent, Bernie Moreno, is another Trump-backed candidate who was not the choice of the Republican establishment in Ohio.

Key presidential battleground states where the Republicans hope to make gains
Nevada
Jacky Rosen v Sam Brown
Jacky Rosen, a first-term senator elected in 2018, is facing a challenge from Sam Brown, a Republican with a bracing back story but a thin political résumé. Brown, a graduate of West Point military academy and veteran of the long US-led military effort in Afghanistan, barely survived a roadside bomb attack in Kandahar that left him permanently scarred. Like Tester and Brown, Rosen opted to skip the recent Democratic convention to focus on her Senate defense.
The Cook Report categorizes the race as leaning Democrat.
Wisconsin
Tammy Baldwin v Eric Hovde
The two-term senator Tammy Baldwin is up against Eric Hovde, a wealthy GOP banker and businessman who is funding his own campaign. But his local bona fides have been questioned by Democrats who have stressed his connections to southern California.
The race is judged as a toss-up by the Cook Report.
Read Alice Herman’s reporting about the Wisconsin Senate race here.
Pennsylvania
Bob Casey v David McCormick
The three-term incumbent Democratic senator Bob Casey is pitted against David McCormick, former chief executive of Bridgewater Associates, one of the world’s largest hedge funds.
Casey is favoured to hang on to his seat, partly because of strong local name recognition. His opponent has already suffered defeat in a Pennsylvania Senate race, having narrowly lost the Republican state primary in 2022 to Mehmet Oz, who then lost to Democrat John Fetterman in the election for a seat that had been left vacant by the retirement of a GOP incumbent, Pat Toomey, one of only seven Senate Republicans to vote to convict Trump over the January 6 attack on the US Capitol at his second impeachment trial.
The Cook Report also classes it as a toss-up.
Read Joan E Greve’s reporting about the Pennsylvania Senate race here.
Arizona
Ruben Gallego v Kari Lake
A seat left vacant by the retirement of Kyrsten Sinema, a former Democrat who quit the party to become an independent, is now a key target of Kari Lake, a one-time television news anchor who has positioned herself as a vocal Trump supporter and arch-exponent of the lie that the 2020 election was stolen. She repeated the tactic when she lost the 2022 Arizona governor’s race to Democrat Katie Hobbs. Her opponent is Gallego, a Democratic member of the House and former Marine who served in Iraq.
The Cook Report judges the contest as leaning Democrat.
Read Lauren Gambino and Rachel Leingang’s reporting about the Arizona Senate race here.
Michigan
Elissa Slotkin v Mike Rogers
Here the Republicans are on the offensive to replace a retiring Democratic senator, Debbie Stabenow, who is stepping down after 24 years. Trying to fill her shoes will be Elissa Slotkin, currently a Democratic member of the House, who will be in a race with Mike Rogers, a mainstream Republican who once said his party had to move beyond Trump before changing tack to embrace him, earning the former president’s endorsement.
The race is considered a toss-up by the Cook Report.
Maryland
Angela Alsobrooks v Larry Hogan
Solidly Democratic Maryland, which includes the liberal suburbs of Washington DC, is crucial to the party’s hopes of clinging to its Senate majority.
Instead, it’s turning into a dogfight between the Democratic candidate, Angela Alsobrooks, the executive of one of Maryland’s biggest counties, and the state’s former Republican governor Larry Hogan. An American Association of Retired Persons poll showed the pair at 46% each – despite Harris holding a 20% state lead in the presidential race. Part of the explanation is the moderate public profile of Hogan, a traditional Republican who has positioned himself as anti-Trump and has said he does not seek the former president’s endorsement.
Indeed, buoyed by the recent poll, Hogan has now gone further, marketing himself in a fresh ad as one of the few Republicans who has never “caved” to Trump and extolling his decision to dispatch the Maryland national guard to put down the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol.
The state that Trump lost to Joe Biden by 33 points in 2020 is in likely Democratic territory, according to the Cook Report.

Guardian,"The truth about immigration? As Elon Musk shows, borders are always open for the rich | Arwa Mahdawi","When is an illegal immigrant not an illegal immigrant? When they’re a privileged white person, of course. In that case the correct classification is “enterprising expat” operating in a “legal grey area”.
No prizes for guessing who I’m referencing here. Yep, it’s America’s most irritating immigrant: Elon Musk. Over the years, the South African-born multibillionaire has amplified numerous anti-immigrant conspiracy theories and declared: “We should also not be allowing people in the country if they’re breaking the law.” Which is interesting, because the Washington Post reported on Saturday that Musk almost certainly worked in the US without correct authorisation in 1995 after he dropped out of Stanford to launch a startup called Zip2.
This isn’t entirely new news: Kimbal Musk, the billionaire’s younger brother, has been very open about working in the US without proper legal status. During an interview at a conference in 2013, for example, Kimbal bluntly stated that the brothers were “illegal immigrants” when they started Zip2. Elon interjected that it was a “grey area” and the crowd laughed. Breaking the law is very funny when you’re a certain type of person.
Musk isn’t the only big name in Maga circles with a dubious work history. According to a 2016 investigation by the Associated Press, Melania Trump (America’s second-most irritating immigrant) was paid for 10 modelling jobs in the US that occurred shortly before she had legal permission to work there. Which hasn’t stopped her husband raging about immigrants “invading” the country.
While he might not be in the Magasphere, the Duke of Sussex is another example of how immigration laws are black and white for some people and rather more “grey” for others. In his memoir, Spare, Prince Harry talked openly about taking illegal drugs such as cocaine. Whether he was quite so open about his drug use in his US visa application is another story. If he lied, it may be grounds for deportation. A recent lawsuit from a rightwing think tank attempted to get Harry’s immigration records released but was unsuccessful. We’ll probably never know the truth, but one thing is clear: immigration rules don’t apply to everyone equally. Borders are always open for the rich.

Guardian,Republicans vexed as Senate challengers fall behind Trump in polls,"Republican Senate contenders are falling behind Donald Trump in voter polling, vexing GOP leaders who had thought that aspiring senators would catch up to the party’s presidential candidate.
In Ohio, Trump is polling at an average of 8.7 percentage points above the Republican Senate nominee Bernie Moreno, RealClear Politics averages suggest. In Wisconsin, Trump has polled 2.2 points ahead of the Senate candidate Eric Hovde; they also both remain under 50% in the polls.
In Arizona, Trump is at 49.3% compared with Kari Lake’s 43.4%. In Nevada, Sam Brown is at 40.7% while Trump has 47.6%.
Meanwhile, Democratic Senate contenders are still besting Republican candidates in “every key battleground” in the presidential race, per the Cook Political report. But the site noted that their leads were tighter than in August, and that Wisconsin and Michigan Senate races could be prime opportunities for Republicans.
Polling has even prompted concerns over the US Senate race in deep-red Texas. Texas’s Senate race has shifted from “likely Republican” to “lean Republican”, suggesting that the Democratic representative Colin Allred might be gaining steam against the GOP incumbent Ted Cruz, the Hill reported.
Some data still indicates that Republicans have a strong chance of landing a Senate majority. They could potentially win simply by ousting Montana’s Democratic senator Jon Tester, per the website.
The polling nonetheless marks a dramatic shift for GOP senators, who just weeks ago had privately told mega-donors that the Senate was all but guaranteed for them, per Axios. Their optimistic speculation that the party would land 52 Senate seats came as top Republicans implored donors to contribute to cover funding gaps in several battleground states.
The situation is flipped in Maryland, a heavily Democratic state where former governor Larry Hogan has outpaced Trump by almost 30 points in the polls. Hogan has built a wall between himself and the former president, notably rebuffing his endorsement, Axios points out, citing the Real Clear Politics data.
For Democrats, it’s the opposite. Kamala Harris reportedly lags behind the Democratic Senate candidate in four of five battleground states.
The polling gap between presidential and Senate candidates is slimmer than Trump’s, about one or two points, as Harris’s split marks an improvement over Joe Biden’s. Harris is showing a one-point advantage over Elissa Slotkin, representative from Michigan, Axios said.
This new polling is among a mountain of data indicating that the presidential election remains a near toss-up. Harris had secured a four-point lead over Trump in Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, according to New York Times and Siena College polls conducted from 5 August to 9 August.
But data from New York Times and Siena College from surveys between 21 and 26 September reveal that Harris’s lead has slimmed. In Michigan, Harris and Trump are respectively polling at 48% and 47%, “well within the poll’s margin of error”, according to the Times.
The polling is even more striking in Wisconsin. While Harris has 49% compared with Trump’s 48%, the newspaper notes that Wisconsin polling has “a history of overstating support for Democrats”.
There is potentially good news for Harris from Nebraska’s second congressional district. There, Harris is besting Trump by eight percentage points.
The district’s only electoral vote might prove crucial in the electoral college for a Harris victory. Should Harris win Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, this district could deliver the 270 electoral college votes she needs if Trump wins key Sun belt contests, per the Times.
This polling comes just before Tuesday night’s vice-presidential debate has raised still more questions about the race’s trajectory. Unlike the Trump-Harris face-off, which featured the ex-president’s characteristically brash behavior, JD Vance and Tim Walz focused on policy and remained civil.
Some believe that Vance outperformed Walz, and vice versa, while others believed there was no clear winner.",2024-10-02
Guardian,Walz asks America to ‘stand up’ for democracy – as it happened,"Here are some of the key lines from the debate between the Democratic and Republican vice-presidential candidates, Tim Walz and JD Vance:
On the Middle East:
Both candidates were asked whether they would support a pre-emptive strike by Israel on Iran. Walz said: “Israel’s ability to defend itself is absolutely fundamental” after the Hamas attacks on 7 October. He said Trump’s own national security advisers have said it’s dangerous for Trump to be in charge. “When our allies see Donald Trump turn towards Vladimir Putin, turn towards North Korea, when we start to see that type of fickleness about holding the coalitions together – we will stay committed,” Walz said.
Vance said it was up to Israel to decide what it needs to do. He said Trump “consistently made the world more secure”.
On the climate crisis:
Vance said he and Trump “support clean air, clean water” when asked what responsibility the Trump administration would have to reduce the impact of climate change. “If we actually care about getting cleaner air and cleaner water, the best thing to do is to double down and invest in American workers and the American people,” he said. He did not answer when asked whether he agreed with Trump that climate change is a hoax.
Walz praised the Biden administration for the Inflation Reduction Act, and criticized Trump for calling climate change a “hoax”. “My farmers know climate change is real,” he said.
On immigration:
Walz criticized Trump for derailing a legislative package that he described as “the fairest and the toughest bill on immigration that this nation’s seen”.
Walz accused Vance of having “vilified a large number of people who worked legally in the community of Springfield”, adding that those immigrants had been “dehumanized”. “This is what happens when you don’t want to solve it,” he said. “You demonize it.”
Vance said the people he was most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, “are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris’s open border”.
At one point, CBS News muted the microphones for both candidates as the moderators tried to turn the debate to the economy.
On the economy:
Walz said presidents should seek advice from advisers around them. “If you’re going to be president, you don’t have all the answers. Donald Trump believes he does,” he said. “My pro-tip is this: if you need heart surgery, listen to the people at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, not Donald Trump.”
On abortion:
Vance said he “never supported a national ban”. He said that Ohio had passed an amendment protecting the right to an abortion, and that it taught him that his Republican party “have got to do a better job of winning back people’s trust”.
Walz rejected Trump’s claim that he supports abortion in the ninth month of pregnancy, saying the accusation “wasn’t true”. He said that under Project 2025, there would a “registry of pregnancies” and that it would “get more difficult, if not impossible, to get contraception and limit access, if not eliminate access, to infertility treatments”.
On mass shootings:
Walz said his 17-year-old son had witnessed a shooting at a community center. He referred to his record in Minnesota, where there are enhanced background checks and red-flag laws in place. “We understand that the second amendment is there, but our first responsibility is to our kids to figure this out,” he said.
Vance said that the country needs to buckle down on border security, and strengthen safety in schools. “We have to make the doors lock better, we have to make the doors stronger,” he said.
On the candidates’ previous comments:
Walz stumbled when asked about his misleading claims that he made about being in Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen protests. “I’ve not been perfect, and I’m a knucklehead at times,” he initially said. When pushed for an answer, he conceded that he “misspoke”.
Vance said he was “wrong about Donald Trump” when asked about his previous criticisms of his running mate. He accused the media of spreading false stories about Trump that he believed, and said he supports Trump because he “delivered for the American people”.
On healthcare:
Vance, when asked how a Trump administration would protect Americans with pre-existing conditions who were able to secure health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act, said there were laws and regulations on the books that should be kept in place. He said the functionality of the health insurance marketplace also needed to be improved.
On paid family leave:
Walz did not give a definitive answer when asked how long employers should be required to pay workers for parental leave. He said paid family leave is beneficial for families because it “gets the child off to a better start”.
Vance said the nation should “have a family care model that makes choice possible”. He said the issue was important to him because he is married to a “beautiful woman” and “incredible mother” who is also a “very brilliant corporate litigator”.
On the January 6 attack on the Capitol:
Walz said democracy is “bigger than winning an election”, and that a “president’s words matter”. He said the January 6 attack “was a threat to our democracy in a way that we have not seen” and that it manifested itself because of Trump’s inability to accept that he had lost the 2020 election.
Vance claimed that Trump wanted protesters to remain peaceful on January 6. He said he believes the biggest threat to democracy is “the threat of censorship”.
Walz directly asked Vance whether Trump lost the 2020 election. Vance declined to answer, instead saying that he was “focused on the future”. “That is a damning non-answer,” Walz said.
Closing remarks:
Walz said he was as “surprised as anybody” at the broad coalition of support that Harris had built, including progressives like Bernie Sanders and Republicans like Dick Cheney. He said Vance had made it clear that he would stand with Trump’s agenda, adding that Harris is “bringing us a politics of joy”.
Vance said that Harris’s polices were to blame for key needs like heat, housing and food being harder to afford. Harris has proposed a lot of things that she wants to accomplish on day one, Vance said, but he noted that Harris has been vice-president for three-and-a-half years and that “day one was 1,400 days ago”.
As the Middle East spiraled towards full-scale war, the US vice presidential debate focused largely on domestic issues, like school shootings and the cost of housing, healthcare, and childcare.
The CBS News debate moderators largely declined to fact-check JD Vance or Tim Walz, asking them instead to respond to each other.
Here are some key takeaways from the debate between the Republican senator from Ohio who wrote a bestselling memoir about poverty in Appalachia and the Democratic football-coach-turned-governor of Minnesota:
The topics of abortion and the likelihood of Trump accepting this year’s result if he loses led to the most interesting moments during the debate.
Walz demanded that Vance agree to abide by the results of the election and commit to a peaceful transfer of power. And he asked Vance whether Trump lost the 2020 election.
“Tim, I’m focused on the future,” Vance replied.
“That is a damning non-answer,” Walz shot back.
Walz noted that Vance was only on the stage because Trump cut ties with his former vice-president, Mike Pence, for certifying the results of the last election.
Vance did not answer the question about whether Trump, who continues to falsely claim the 2020 election was marred by widespread fraud, lost four years ago. The exchange served as a reminder of one of Trump’s biggest vulnerabilities heading into the election, one that the Harris campaign will continue to highlight in the coming weeks.
Reuters has this interesting bit of analysis of Vance’s performance tonight, writing that the Vance on stage was the one the Trump campaign had in mind when Trump selected him as his number two in July.”
The idea then was that the 40-year-old first-term senator and best-selling author of “Hillbilly Elegy” could serve as an articulate and rational voice for Trump’s Make American Great Again movement as well as perhaps one day become a generational torchbearer.
But instead Vance had a rocky rollout on the campaign trail, becoming the target of online scorn and mockery while most often serving as Trump’s attack dog. The headlines were mostly negative, and his approval ratings suffered.
On Tuesday, Vance largely kept his message positive, while taking every opportunity to advocate for Trump.
Vance seemed to be succeeding at a vice-presidential running mate’s primary task: Making the candidate at the top of the ticket more palatable to the viewers at home.
It was clear as the evening progressed, that it was this, rather than trying to smear Walz, that was the goal of the Trump campaign in this debate.
When Harris was considering Walz as her vice-presidential candidate, he reportedly told her that he was a bad debater, and at the outset Vance, wearing a sharp blue suit, a pink tie, plenty of make-up and hair gel, looked the more polished performer. Walz, a former high school teacher and football coach, cut a more bustling figure in a loose black suit.
Vance, the Ohio senator who has been a regular on rightwing news channels for years, was polished from the off, comfortably dodging a question about whether he believes the climate crisis is a “hoax” to lament how much money has been spent on solar panels.
Walz rose to the vice-presidential nomination, in part, through his confident appearances on cable news – it was from there that his famous “weird” characterization of Vance and Trump was born – but appeared initially nervous, and did not reprise his searing critique of his opponents.
Tim Walz and JD Vance took to the stage on Tuesday night for a vice-presidential debate that served up less drama than September’s presidential debate, but offered revealing differences on abortion, school shootings, and immigration.
Three weeks ago Kamala Harris and Donald Trump had endured a contentious hour-and-a-half, with an emotional Trump being goaded into ranting about the number of people who attend his rallies and declaring the vice-president to be a “Marxist”, before reportedly threatening to sue one of the debate moderators. Harris enjoyed a brief polling uptick from that performance.
But on Tuesday, Walz and Vance largely avoided attacks on each other, and instead concentrated their fire on each other’s running mates. It was a more policy-driven discussion than that of their running mates’, but one with a few gaffes that might overshadow some of the substance in coming days.
In a key exchange over abortion, Walz, the governor of Minnesota, followed Harris’s lead in using personal stories.
Trump “brags about how great it was that he put the judges in and overturned Roe v Wade”, Walz said. He noted the case of Amanda Zurawski, who was denied an abortion in Texas despite serious health complications during pregnancy – Zurawski is now part of a group of women suing the state of Texas – and a girl in Kentucky who as a child was raped by her stepfather and became pregnant.
“If you don’t know [women like this], you soon will. Their Project 2025 is going to have a registry of pregnancies,” Walz said, which Vance refuted.
Both candidates were seen more favourably after the debate than before it, according to CNN:
Following the debate, 59% of debate watchers said they had a favorable view of Walz, with just 22% viewing him unfavorably – an improvement from his already positive numbers among the same voters pre-debate (46% favorable, 32% unfavorable).
Debate watchers came away with roughly net neutral views of Vance following the debate: 41% rated him favorably and 44% unfavorably. That’s also an improvement from their image of Vance pre-debate, when his ratings among this group were deeply underwater (30% favorable, 52% unfavorable).
CNN’s snap poll has viewers split over who won the debate – but Vance narrowly wins.
The poll of 574 registered voters saw 51% say that Vance won the debate, with 49% choosing Walz.
Polled before the debate, 54% of voters thought Walz was likelier to win.
CNN adds this caveat: “The poll’s results reflect opinions of the debate only among those voters who tuned in and aren’t representative of the views of the full voting public. Debate watchers in the poll were 3 points likelier to be Democratic-aligned than Republican-aligned, making for an audience that’s about 5 percentage points more Democratic-leaning than all registered voters nationally.”",2024-10-02
Guardian,"‘I’ve lost friends’: in bitterly divided Georgia, can Democrats score another win?","Mary Holewinski lives in Carrollton, Georgia, home turf for the far-right congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. But Holewinski is a Kamala Harris supporter and has a sign in her yard. It draws some nasty looks, she said. “I’ve lost neighbor friends.”
It helps that Carrollton is a college town, and discussing politics is possible – to an extent. “I feel like the people I live around, you can sit down and have a conversation with them, and they are willing to listen … but not everybody. There are some people who don’t want to hear your side of it.”
These tensions are ratcheting up, because for voters in Georgia, it can feel like the entire US election is on the line. The state went for Biden in 2020 by 11,779 votes, out of 5m ballots cast – the first time since 1992 that the state turned blue. Its 16 electoral college votes were a bulwark – psychological as well as practical – for Democrats, illustrating the nation’s rejection of Donald Trump, however slim.
Georgia has personal significance for Trump, and his war on the 2020 election results. The former president still faces charges in an election interference case in Atlanta’s Fulton county, after he made what he described as a “perfect phone call” to the Georgia secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, asking him to “find” another 11,800 votes. A Georgia win would represent belated validation for the former president.
Now the question is which Georgia will turn out in greater force this year: the Democratic-leaning Georgia represented by the burgeoning Atlanta suburbs, or the Georgia where conservatism holds sway in its smaller towns and rural regions. Polling suggests that Trump has a lead of one to two points, well within the margin of error.
The election is already under way. About 7 million Georgians are registered to vote and about 3 million voters – more than 40% of the electorate – have already gone to the polls, setting early voting records each day.
Both Harris and Trump may as well have leased apartments in Buckhead, an upscale part of Atlanta, for all the time they are spending in Georgia in the last-minute election push. Earlier this month, Trump rallied at a sports arena in the northern Atlanta suburb of Duluth, in the middle of one of the most diverse areas of the state. Harris appeared on Thursday with Barack Obama and Bruce Springsteen.
Suburban moderates in the Atlanta region turned on Trump in 2020, and he appears to have done little in the years since to win their favor. Much has been made of Republican hopes of targeting Black men – about 1 million of Georgia’s 7 million registered voters – as a potential swing bloc for votes. The difference between a Democrat winning 80% and 90% of their votes will probably be larger than the overall margin of victory.
But Georgia is no longer a state defined by Black and white voters. Asian and Latino population growth has changed the political landscape in suburban Atlanta, which helped drive the Biden victory there in 2020. Turnout in that voting demographic has been a challenge for both parties.
The politics of Georgia are a delicate dance of cooperation between Atlanta, which tends Democratic, and the rest of the state. More than half the state’s population lives in the metro area of Atlanta. Music by Atlanta’s hip-hop artists has long dominated the charts. Marvel films its movies on Atlanta’s streets. Dozens of Fortune 500 companies are headquartered in the Atlanta area, from Home Depot, UPS and Southern Company to mainstays Coca-Cola and Delta.

Outside Atlanta, Savannah and pockets of Black voters in south Georgia’s historic Black belt, Georgia is solidly conservative. The Republican governor, Brian Kemp, remains the most popular political figure in the state. Moderate liberals approve of how he handled Trump’s election interference claims. Even Maga Republicans grudgingly acknowledge that his resistance to pandemic closures and libertarian gun position matched their interests.
Rural, conservative Georgia is more likely to be religiously fundamentalist, less diverse and occasionally reactionary. Georgia has a six-week abortion ban because even the business wing of the Republican party in Georgia, which is solidly in charge of the state’s government, crosses evangelicals on that issue at its peril.
The party’s challenges are exemplified by Rabun county, in Georgia’s picturesque, tourist-friendly mountains on the border of North Carolina. Here, and elsewhere, it is attempting to heal the standing conflict between conventional conservative Republicans and the Maga insurgency on the right.
Rabun county Republicans have hosted a range of events, from a traditional low-country boil to a firearm raffle and screenings of a Reagan biography at the last remaining drive-in, said Ed Henderson, secretary of the Rabun county Republican party. Local Republicans have established a detente between the Maga wing and traditional conservatives, he said.
“We’re not imposing purity tests on candidates,” Henderson said. They also don’t view Democrats as an existential threat. “They’re not demons with horns on their head, or Satan worshippers. They’re the opposition.”
People from traditionally Democratic areas began moving into Rabun county during the pandemic, attracted by its lower cost of living and extraordinary natural beauty. The area historically favors Republicans by about four to one.
But in a close race, chipping away at that margin may make the difference, said Don Martin, chair of the Rabun county Democrats. “If we can get Republicans down to 70% here, we will win the state.”
Both parties now see early voting as key. Trump has reversed his skepticism of early voting and absentee ballots, a posture that may have made the difference between winning and losing in 2020. His repeated refrain on the road in Atlanta is for turnout to be “too big to rig”, falsely suggesting that Democrats stole the 2020 election and intend to steal this one.
Historically in Georgia, Democrats have been more likely to vote early than Republicans. But Trump has pointedly instructed his supporters to vote early in person in Georgia, and many appear to be doing just that. So far this year, there’s little difference in turnout between metro Atlanta counties with large Democratic voting majorities and Republican-heavy rural counties.
Ralph Reed, director of the Faith and Freedom Coalition and a venerable figure on the Christian political right, made a point of telling conservative voters to vote early at a recent faith town hall in Zebulon, about 90 minutes south of Atlanta.
“We cannot and must not wait until election day to vote,” he said. “If you let them dominate the early vote for two or three weeks and run up a million- or a million-and-a-half-vote margin, then we are like a football team trying to score three touchdowns in the fourth quarter … If you want the texts and calls to stop, you need to vote, and you need to vote early.”
And early concerns about Hurricane Helene disrupting the election appear to be unfounded so far. Turnout in areas affected by the devastating September storm is only slightly below that of the rest of the state.
Gwendolyn Jordan lives in Grovestown, two and a half hours east of Atlanta and in the damage zone of Hurricane Helene. Two weeks ago, as early voting started, some residents were still without power, she said.
Yet early turnout in her county is very slightly above the state average. Though Columbia county went almost two to one for Trump in 2020, Jordan is a Harris supporter. The role of the federal government and the competence of a presidential administration is no abstraction in the wake of a hurricane, she said.
“I believe there’s going to be a big difference, because Kamala Harris is more for the people under the $400,000 income range, the people that really need the help,” Jordan said. “You know that’s who is struggling right now. We just had a hurricane that did a lot of damage to people.”
In 2020, it took two weeks for Biden’s victory in Georgia to be confirmed. This year there was the prospect of other delays, after an effort by the Trump-aligned state board of elections to allow local elections officers the right to withhold certifications, to conduct open-ended investigations into poll irregularities and to mandate hand-counts of ballots on election night.
But two superior court judges ruled the changes unconstitutional and the state’s superior court let the rulings stand pending appeal, which will not be heard until after the election.
Georgia’s wounds from the fight over the election results in 2020 haven’t completely healed. And people are preparing themselves for a fresh round after voting concludes in November.
“I could care less about whether you like [Trump] or not. It’s not a popularity contest,” said Justin Thompson, a retired air force engineer from Macon. “It’s what you got done. And he did get things done before the pandemic hit. And the only reason why he didn’t get re-elected was because the pandemic hit.”",2024-10-29
Guardian,Elon Musk hopes Trump victory will help his $44bn Twitter bet pay off,"Two years ago, there was some trepidation among advertisers, anti-hate-speech groups and staff about Elon Musk’s acquisition of Twitter.
Those concerns have been borne out: advertisers have sharply reduced spending on the platform, Musk has sued nonprofits over their coverage of a rise in controversial content and about eight out of 10 employees have been sacked.
The service, now rebranded as X, is not worth the $44bn Musk paid for it on 27 October 2022 – later tweeting “the bird is freed” in a reference to its corporate logo. The plunge in value reflects the damage done to its advertising-dependent business model.
But its continued influence as a news source and its role as an outlet for broadcasting its owner’s rightwing views to his 200 million-plus followers, means the benefit to the world’s richest person does not need to be measured in financial benchmarks alone.
“It’s still setting the political agenda and has had some success in promoting his libertarian views,” says Nic Newman, a senior research associate at the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism.
Worldwide traffic on X is up compared with a year ago, according to data from Similarweb, with 4.3bn desktop and mobile web visits, a 3.8% rise on the same period last year. However, that number was running at 5bn before the Tesla chief’s takeover.
Growth on the platform is also slowing in terms of users, with the Financial Times reporting that the number of global daily users in the second quarter of this year was 251 million – though that was still a rise of 1.6% on the same quarter in 2023.
But under the old Twitter model, those user numbers would be expected to lure in advertisers keen to push their message on a social media site that was valued for its ability to get people talking.
Yet advertisers have shied away from a platform that, under the ownership of a self-confessed “free speech absolutist”, has allowed the reinstatement of accounts belonging to British far-right activist Tommy Robinson, misogynist influencer Andrew Tate and US conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
Investment group Fidelity recently wrote down the value of its small stake in X, implying that the platform now has a value of $9.4bn. This reflects a slump in advertising revenue, an income stream that accounted for nearly 90% of Twitter’s $5.1bn in annual revenue in 2021, the last year for which it published annual results as a listed company.
Musk’s latest reaction to that boycott is unlikely to win back advertisers. In August, X sued a global advertising alliance and several large companies, including big advertisers such as Unilever and Mars, accusing them of conspiring to boycott the platform and cause it to lose money.
X’s chief executive, Linda Yaccarino, an advertising industry veteran, said last year that the historically loss-making platform could turn a profit in 2024, having slashed costs – and said advertisers were returning. The company also has to service a $13bn debt burden, placed on its balance sheet as part of the financing for the takeover, at a cost of $300m a quarter.
Advertising experts say the platform remains off-bounds for many big brands. “X has definitely dropped off the radar for a lot of advertisers who previously would have included it in their media mix,” says Farhad Divecha, managing director of the London-based digital marketing agency AccuraCast. “I don’t see them going back to X now that Musk has made it abundantly clear that he doesn’t care about ad revenue and would rather maintain X as a loosely moderated platform that could pose significant brand risk.”
Lou Paskalis, chief executive of AJL Advisory, an advertising consultancy, says that under the Tesla billionaire’s ownership, X is “not brand-safe at all”, which is “largely because of Musk’s rhetoric”.
Referring to its owner’s ambition to turn X into an “everything app” akin to China’s WeChat, Paskalis adds: “I am assured there is a future business at X that will reinvent how it realises revenue. But I have seen no evidence of that.”
With a $270bn fortune, Musk can sustain X financially, but Newman says that he will weigh the cost of the deal against the publicity for his political views, his even higher public profile since the takeover and whether his personal and financial support for Donald Trump pays off at the US presidential election next month.
“Whether all that was worth $44bn remains an open question and may partly depend on whether a grateful Trump is re-elected,” adds Newman.
X was approached for comment.",2024-10-27
Guardian,US presidential election updates: Kamala Harris delivers closing address while Trump and Biden talk ‘garbage’,"From the Ellipse – the Washington park where Donald Trump delivered his speech before the 6 January 2021 storming of the Capitol – Kamala Harris addressed the nation on Tuesday evening with a week to go before the election. She portrayed herself as in-touch with the worries of ordinary Americans, while labelling her opponent a “petty tyrant”.
With thousands watching on in person, Harris urged Americans to vote in the most important election of their lifetimes for a “new generation” of leadership. Harris is a generation younger than Trump – and than Joe Biden, whom she replaced on the Democratic ticket.
Meanwhile Trump said of America that “It’s like we’re a giant garbage can” and of the Puerto Rican community – a large and influential group of voters repeatedly insulted by the Republican campaign – that nobody loves them like he does.
Meanwhile, Biden sought to clarify remarks after it appeared that he had referred to Trump supporters as “garbage” during a town hall with young Latino voters. Biden said his comment referred only to the “hateful rhetoric” of a comedian at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally.
Here is what else happened on Tuesday:
Kamala Harris election news and updates
-
Josh Shapiro, the Pennsylvania governor and high-profile Democrat backer of Harris, said he would not call Trump supporters “garbage” as Biden was interpreted as having done. Speaking on CNN, Shapiro was shown video of the comment Biden made earlier. He was asked for a response. “I would never insult the good people of Pennsylvania or any Americans even if they chose to support a candidate that I didn’t support,” Shapiro replied.
-
Harris will spend election night at her alma mater, Howard University, in Washington, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss her campaign’s plans. If elected, Harris would be the first graduate of a historically Black university to occupy the Oval Office.
-
The leader of the United Auto Workers (UAW) made a last plea to union members to vote for Harris, casting the election as a fight between the interests of the working class and billionaires.
-
Michelle Obama took the stump in Georgia. The former first lady’s organisation When We All Vote hosted a rally for more than 2,000 people at an arena in College Park, near Atlanta’s airport – a slickly produced event that was dominated by earnest pleas to vote from a star-studded roster.
Donald Trump election news and updates
-
Urged by some allies to apologise for racist comments made by speakers at his weekend rally, Donald Trump took the opposite approach on Tuesday, saying it was an “honour to be involved” in such an event and calling the scene a “lovefest” – the same term he has used to describe the 6 January insurrection at the US Capitol.
-
The supreme court on Tuesday rejected an emergency appeal to remove Robert F Kennedy Jr from presidential ballots in Wisconsin and Michigan. Kennedy wanted to remove himself from the ballot in the two crucial swing states after dropping his independent bid and endorsing Donald Trump. He argued that keeping him on violated his first amendment rights by wrongly implying he still wanted to be elected president.
-
Trump’s Truth Social stock market valuation is now greater than the estimated value of Elon Musk’s X after an extraordinary rally ahead of next week’s election. Some context around that, though: Twitter/X’s valuation is calculated to have tanked by as much as 90% since Musk took over. Shares in Trump Media & Technology Group (TMTG), the former president’s tiny social media empire, rose 8.8% on Tuesday. Trading of the stock was suspended several times due to volatility.
-
JD Vance hit back at those who say Trump is a fascist, accusing Harris and her allies of disrespecting second world war veterans as he campaigned on Tuesday in one of the most hotly contested regions of battleground Michigan.
-
In a new book, Rudy Giuliani claims his extensive legal problems and those of Trump are the results of persecution by “a fascist regime” run by Harris and Biden – all while avoiding mention of a $150m defamation award against him won by two Georgia election workers. The book repeats the lies about electoral fraud that saw him lose law licences in New York and Washington DC.
Elsewhere on the campaign trail
-
Powered by consumer spending, the US economy likely kept expanding at a healthy pace from July through September despite the pressure of still-high interest rates. The commerce department is expected to report on Wednesday that gross domestic product – the economy’s total output of goods and services – grew at a 2.6% annual pace last quarter, according to a survey of forecasters by the data firm FactSet. That would be down from a 3% annual rate in the April-June period.
-
China’s government on Wednesday implied that if Trump wins he could “discard” Taiwan given the US has always pursued an “America first” policy. Trump has made several comments on the campaign trail saying Chinese-claimed Taiwan should pay to be protected and accusing the island of stealing American semiconductor business.

Guardian,The Guardian doesn’t ‘sanewash’ Trump or take orders from a billionaire owner. That’s why I’m proud to write here | Rebecca Solnit,"The Guardian is unafraid. And it’s independent. (No billionaire bosses.) In this media climate, those qualities are as rare as they are crucial to good journalism.
Good journalism is also crucial to the informed citizens we need for a functioning democracy. From too many legacy media outlets based in the US we’re getting something else entirely: horse race coverage, scraped-up and reheated scandals of little significance, credulous repeating of claims, polite evasions about the threats and crimes of the right, and what’s been dubbed “sanewashing”: the translation of the luridly loopy utterances of Donald Trump and his minions into coherent-sounding policy statements. And now we’re seeing billionaire owners of major papers suppress their own editorial department’s endorsements.
As we face another momentous election in the United States, I think hard about what the last several years might have been like if these institutions did their job with the fearlessness of the Guardian when it comes to calling lies lies, crimes crimes, and threats threats.
I believe that the deference and evasiveness of legacy US media organizations comes from many causes, including fear and the habit of pursuing the appearance of even-handedness even at a time when the national political situation is wildly lopsided. Lopsided, that is, because one side is pursuing attacks on democracy and the constitution, and seeks to institute an authoritarian regime while stripping rights away from most of us: from women, immigrants and refugees, queer people and trans people, and the rights of workers to be safe in their workplaces.
The other side has its flaws, its timidities and eagerness for compromise, and the Guardian covers them well, but it is at worst a status-quo party seeking to hold off the coup. That is, the two are not alike, and good journalism does not create the false appearance of symmetry – does not engage in “bothsiderism”, as it’s sometimes called. The situation we’re in is so new we’ve had to reach for new words to describe it. Strikingly, both sanewashing and bothsiderism unpack the failure to accurately represent the realities of the situation. They’re diagnoses of diseases that weaken truth-telling, and thereby democracy.
The Guardian has become a major US source, in terms both of its readership and its coverage of the local and national scene. It has reporters on the ground from protests in the north-west to disaster response in the south-east, has some of the best political journalists at work covering Washington, funds investigative journalism and a wide bench of opinion-writers (yeah, including me, and I’m loyal to the Guardian because it’s the one place I can write what I think without it being edited into something much more tame and mainstream). It’s been bold and uncompromising in its support for reproductive rights and women’s rights, as well as immigrant and other human rights.
The Guardian also does more and better climate journalism than any other newspaper out there and that’s been true for a long time. What if all the major news outlets had given climate the centrality it should have in our public conversations, our politics, our reporting, as the Guardian does? The climate is a physical reality and its future depends on political action – it, too, is something at stake in the current election. The climate is the physical circumstances of our existence on earth, and of all the other species from polar bears to coral reefs. When it goes haywire, systems break down and nature and people suffer, as we’ve seen this year from climate-intensified hurricanes in the south-east to extreme heat in the south-west.
Climate deserves centrality in our news coverage and our conversations, and that’s another one of the important reasons I’m proud to write for the Guardian – and to support it financially myself, too. We can’t change what all the other newspapers do, but we can keep doing what we do, and you can keep supporting fearless, independent news that covers what matters – including the failures of the mainstream media.",2024-10-29
Guardian,US Republican sparks outrage for racist post attacking Haitian immigrants,"A Republican congressman provoked a hail of outrage after posting a racist attack on Haitian immigrants on social media, which he subsequently deleted amid calls for him to be censured.
Clay Higgins used his congressional X account to repeat debunked accusations – spread by Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee – about Haitians eating pets and broadened the attack to call them “thugs” and brand Haiti as “the nastiest country in the Western hemisphere”.
“These Haitians are wild. Eating pets, vudu, nastiest country in the western hemisphere, cults, slapstick gangsters,” the Louisiana representative posted, purportedly in response to a legal action filed against Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, by a non-profit group representing Haitians in Springfield, Ohio.
“But damned if they don’t feel all sophisticated now, filing charges against our President and VP. All these thugs better get their mind right and their ass out of our country before January 20th.”
The vitriolic post followed a pledge by Trump – who has doubled down on his baseless pet-eating allegations, which he first voiced at this month’s debate with Kamala Harris – to get Haitians “the hell out of Springfield”, even though most members of the community in the city are in the US legally.
It drew widespread condemnation from House Democrats, with the party’s Congressional Black caucus tabling a motion to censure Higgins.
“Rep. Clay Higgins’ vile & hateful remarks abt Haitians are unacceptable. Today, it is Haitians, but who will it be tomorrow?” the caucus posted on its X account.
Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic House minority leader, called Higgins’s post “disgusting … vile, racist and beneath the dignity of the United States House of Representatives.
Higgins was “an election-denying, conspiracy-peddling racial arsonist who is a disgrace to the people’s House” who “must be held accountable for dishonorable conduct that is unbecoming to a member of Congress”, Jeffries wrote.
Higgins deleted the post after being approached by Mike Johnson, the Republican House speaker and a fellow Louisianian. But the congressman did not apologise and later told CNN that he stood by it.
Johnson – who has appointed Higgins to a taskforce investigating attempts to assassinate Trump – told journalists that after speaking with him, Higgins “prayed about it and he regretted it and he pulled the post down.
“That’s what you want the gentleman to do,” Johnson added.
The GOP House majority leader, Steve Scalise, rejected the censure motion, arguing it was unnecessary because the post had been deleted.
A former captain in a Louisiana sheriff’s office, Higgins was forced to resign in 2016 after he described members of a predominantly Black gang as “animals” in a video that went viral. He won his House seat months later.
A Washington Post report at the time called him a “God-fearing man of the law with a deep southern drawl” whose no-nonsense, tough-talking approach had earned him folk-hero status.",2024-09-26
Guardian,Sweden and Norway rethink cashless society plans over Russia security fears,"Sweden and Norway are backpedalling on plans for cashless societies over fears that fully digital payment systems would leave them vulnerable to Russian security threats, and concern for those unable to use them.
A combination of good high-speed internet coverage, high digital literacy rates, large rural populations and fast-growing fintech industries had put the Nordic neighbours on a fast track to a future without cash.
Swish, a mobile payment system that six banks launched in 2012, is ubiquitous in Sweden, from market stalls to coffee shops and clothes stores. The Norwegian equivalent, Vipps, which merged with Danish MobilePay in 2022 to form Vipps MobilePay, is also very popular. Last month, it also launched in Sweden.
The former deputy governor of Sweden’s central bank predicted in 2018 that Sweden would probably be cashless by 2025.
But Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and a subsequent rise in cross-border hybrid warfare and cyber-attacks blamed on pro-Russia groups have prompted a rethink.
The Swedish government has since completely overhauled its defence and preparedness strategy, joining Nato, starting a new form of national service and reactivating its psychological defence agency to combat disinformation from Russia and other adversaries. Norway has tightened controls on its previously porous border with Russia.
The security rethink extends to the fundamentals of how people pay for goods and services.
In a brochure with the title If Crisis or War Comes that will be sent to every home in Sweden next month, the defence ministry advises people to use cash regularly and keep at least a week’s supply in various denominations as well as access to other forms of payment such as bank cards and digital payment services. “If you can pay in several different ways, you strengthen your preparedness,” it says.
The government is also considering legislation to protect the ability to pay in cash for certain goods. Cash is legal tender in Sweden, but shops and restaurants can effectively make themselves cashless as long as they display a notice setting out their restrictions on payment methods.
Norwegian retail customers have always had the right to pay in cash, but it has not been enforced and in recent years increasing numbers of retailers have gone cashless, locking out about 600,000 people who do not have access to digital services. The government acted over the summer, bringing in legislation under which retailers can be fined or sanctioned if they do not accept cash payments from 1 October.
The justice and public security ministry said it “recommends everyone keep some cash on hand due to the vulnerabilities of digital payment solutions to cyber-attacks”. It said the government took preparedness seriously “given the increasing global instability with war, digital threats, and climate change. As a result, they’ve ensured that the right to pay with cash is strengthened”.
The country’s justice and emergencies minister, Emilie Enger Mehl, said earlier this year: “If no one pays with cash and no one accepts cash, cash will no longer be a real emergency solution once the crisis is upon us.” Prolonged power cuts, system failures or digital attacks on payment systems and banks could leave cash as “the only alternative that is easily available”, she said.
Max Brimberg, a researcher at Sweden’s central bank, said the move away from cash had been driven largely by the private sector. Many of the country’s banks abolished cash in local branches some time ago, which made digital payment services easy to roll out to a very willing public.
The percentage of cash purchases in physical shops has fallen from almost 40% in 2012 to about 10% in recent years, and Brimberg said there was growing concern about cash becoming obsolete.
“That’s something that we as a central bank and also the central government see as a potential risk, especially for the people who still haven’t adopted the digital economy and also for preparedness if there were to be a weaponised attack or armed attack against Sweden or a close country,” he said. “So cash fills a very specific role in the payment system, both because it’s issued by the state but also because it’s the only form of payment that we can use if the systems for electricity or communications networks don’t work as they usually do.”
Because all Swedish payment systems were part of one ecosystem, an attack could bring society to a standstill, he said.
“Pretty much any function that you do in society you have to use some sort of payment or verification analysis, either by electronic ID or electronic payment,” he said. “All of those would be at risk of undermining the functionality of the entire system in Sweden if it were to fail.”
The central bank is looking into creating and issuing an “e-krona” that would act as a “digital complement to cash”, but implementation would require a political mandate.
Hans Liwång, a professor of systems science for defence and security at the Swedish Defence University, said there was a lack of evidence about whether cash was better than digital payments in the face of modern threats. Pointing to Ukraine, where digital systems have proved vital to its resilience, he said: “Ukraine is a very good example of moving into the future when there is war rather than backwards.”",2024-10-30
Guardian,The killing of Natalie Shotter: what the death of a beloved mother and daughter reveals about rape,"Dr Cas Shotter Weetman was steeling herself to face the man who killed her daughter. “All the fibres of your body are on high alert. The fight-or-flight instinct kicks in. Sometimes he looked at me for a good few seconds but I was determined to stare him out.”
In the dock at the Old Bailey, Mohamed Iidow appeared detached. He rarely flinched, even when grainy CCTV footage was shown to the jury as part of the prosecution case that his victim, Natalie Shotter, was orally raped by him “until she died” while she lay unconscious on a park bench. Some members of the jury could not hide their distress.
But every so often Iidow, 35, made eye contact with members of Natalie’s family who were sitting to the left of the dock. Cas, 63, a lead advanced cardiology practitioner who has worked for the NHS for 45 years and refers to Iidow as “the monster”, did not drop her gaze. Iidow was convicted of Natalie’s rape and manslaughter on 18 October, in a highly significant case that found oral rape as a cause of death. He had pleaded not guilty but chose not to give evidence in his own defence.
Natalie, 37, was found dead on a bench in Southall Park, west London, just before 6am on the morning of 17 July 2021. She was an NHS clinical admin worker who lived in Heston, a couple of miles from Southall, and a much-loved mother of three children – two teenage boys and a 21-month-old daughter. She adored them all and enjoyed a close relationship with other members of the family including her mother and her younger brother, Harry.
At the time of her death she was suffering from postnatal depression. She had given birth to her daughter during the pandemic and, like many others, struggled with the isolation. Because Cas was working on the NHS frontline during the pandemic, she was unable to visit her daughter and her new grandchild regularly for fear of infecting them with Covid.
Natalie was small in stature – about 5ft (1.52 metres) tall and weighing just 6½st (41kg). She had recently told the doctor that when she drank alcohol she would black out and fall into a deep sleep. She had not been on many nights out since the birth of her daughter, but on the evening of 16 July, she had arranged to go out with friends, while her partner and family members looked after the children.
Cas was in Yorkshire at the time, caring for her terminally ill father. She said she did not know that her daughter was in Southall that evening. Although it is not far from Heston, she did not think it was an area her daughter was familiar with. CCTV footage was shown to the court of someone playing drums on a street in Southall and Natalie dancing.
“If she heard music you couldn’t stop Nat from dancing,” says Cas. The footage showed Natalie looking well. After the dancing she was seen walking down the street and looking at her phone. A man who did not give evidence during the trial, but provided a statement, said he had met her that night and they sat together on a bench in Southall Park. It is thought that they took amyl nitrate “poppers”. He said she became unwell and lay down on the bench. At 11.56pm, he went to search for help after she appeared to become unconscious, and found two police officers outside the park. But they said they were busy dealing with something else and could not go and attend to an apparently drunk woman in the park. (The Metropolitan police says the officers “advised the individual to call police for additional support”.) The man returned to her briefly at 12.05am before leaving the park.
Cas feels certain that had the police, who were close to the park when Natalie became unconscious, responded to the request for help, her daughter would still be alive today. Meanwhile, criminal proceedings are ongoing against a different police officer accused of misconduct for allegedly possessing and sharing CCTV footage of Natalie’s and another woman’s case. The officer denies the charges.
According to the CCTV footage, at 12.16am, Iidow approached Natalie. He appeared to have been stalking her before he approached her as she lay unaware of him on the park bench. He orally raped her, moving her into different positions. He left her at 12.32am before returning briefly at 12.48, leaving again at 12.51 and driving away from the park. On his way home to his wife and children, he stopped off at a Shell garage to pick up some mouthwash and cat food.
Alison Morgan KC, prosecuting, told the jury during the trial: “[Natalie] was vulnerable because she found herself in a park late at night where the defendant was a man stalking the park looking for sexual services. She did not die of natural causes. She did not die because alcohol was consumed, she did not die because of a particular drug. She died because she was raped by the defendant again and again. He saw walking past her on three occasions that she was vulnerable. Natalie Shotter was deeply unconscious but alive when the defendant raped her.”
The following morning, Cas received a concerned message from Natalie’s partner, saying that a young female had been found dead in Southall. She wasn’t sure what to make of it because she had no idea her daughter had been in that area the previous evening. Then she received a call from a Metropolitan police officer breaking the news. “I felt sick. In those initial moments I was thinking about Southall because I didn’t know why Nat would have been there.”
The enormity of the loss and the circumstances of it have been unbearable. “I was absolutely in such horrific grief,” she says. “The level of shock I was in was unbelievable.”
Cas had been very close with her daughter and had been doing everything she could to support her through her postnatal depression. Natalie was due to see a counsellor about it the following week. “She was going through a really difficult time and she was so vulnerable,” says Cas.
Her daughter had always been creative and loved the performing arts. She understudied the actor playing Éponine in Les Misérables in the West End at the age of 12, had appeared in a few roles on TV as well as adverts, and attended the Brit school in south London.
“Nat was the most beautiful baby and a fabulous kid,” says Cas. “She loved everything outdoors, especially the beach and the water. If I was trying to hammer home that she should be studying some Shakespeare for her GCSEs she would just do a little dance in front of me. She was very creative, she loved to paint and draw and she was never afraid of laughing at herself.”
Before working in the NHS she had jobs with the British Heart Foundation and Alzheimer’s Society. “She was the most incredible person. She really did have the heart of a lion. She was completely selfless and would quite literally give her last pound to anyone who needed it,” says Cas.
When she met with the police after her daughter’s death and they discussed CCTV footage from the night, she told the officers: “I want answers and I want him found. If you can’t do it, I will. I’ll go out and search for him on buses and in shops.”
A few weeks later police found and arrested Iidow. When officers interviewed him he kept changing his account about what had happened that night. At one point he told police there was consensual sex between him and Natalie, then he said he had paid her £10 or £20 to give him a blowjob and then switched to saying she was already dead at the time of oral penetration. His DNA was found around her mouth.
But although police had arrested Iidow, Cas’s fight for justice for her daughter was just beginning. “I kept saying to the police: ‘Natalie was killed, Natalie was killed.’ I’m very tenacious and if I think something isn’t right I can’t let it go.”
Natalie’s death was initially treated as asphyxiation and the cause of death was found by the pathologist to be “unascertained”. Her heart was found to be healthy and no disease was found. Pathology determined that although she had high levels of alcohol in her blood, neither the alcohol nor the poppers would have killed her.
After a couple of months the police agreed to seek a review of the pathology. During the trial, the pathologist Dr Ashley Fegan-Earl gave evidence that he believed Natalie had died as a result of manslaughter because she had suffered something called cafe coronary syndrome, with the nerves in the back of her throat being overstimulated, leading to a fatal cardiac attack.
“The pathologist was so brave and his evidence was so compelling,” says Cas, who hailed the jury’s manslaughter conviction, which she hopes will help other women who have been subjected to oral rape. More commonly with this syndrome the culprit is food fragments, but she believes that the evidence put forward by Fegan-Earl could be vital in other cases where oral rape has led to the death or non-fatal cardiac arrest of the victim.
“I believe that what Iidow did was premeditated,” she says. “He was stalking her. He wasn’t dithering, he didn’t just come across her by chance. He was out that night purposely looking for someone to rape. He seemed to think he was untouchable. I keep thinking about his poor wife and children. I saw that every time the CCTV footage of him raping Nat was played during the trial, his father, who was in the public gallery, got up and left the court.” It was revealed after the trial that Iidow had a previous conviction for trying to groom young people online.
Shotter Weetman says the police team who supported her and other members of the family through the case were superb, but everything about the trial was gruelling. Their trauma was compounded when, on two days during the first week of the trial, Iidow was not brought to court due to administrative failures at Belmarsh prison where he was being held, causing delays to proceedings. Professionals at the court remarked that delays and failures to bring defendants to court were a common occurrence and not only held up many trials, causing distress to victims and their relatives, but also added significant costs to the public purse. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson told the Guardian that while the department does not record data on these failures, “this is a truly heartbreaking case and we sincerely apologise to Ms Shotter’s loved ones for the delays caused by administrative errors”.
After a nerve-racking wait of just over 24 hours for the jury to give their verdict, the family were overjoyed when Iidow was found guilty of rape and manslaughter. “We are celebrating getting justice for Nat. This is a landmark case in terms of the medical evidence which helped to convict Mohamed Iidow. All of the family are jubilant and ecstatic about the verdict,” said Cas after leaving the courtroom. Iidow will be sentenced on 13 December.
Although Cas has welcomed the jury’s verdict, she has vowed to continue her fight for justice for her daughter. She wants to raise awareness of the new evidence brought forward in the trial about how oral rape can lead to manslaughter, by working with campaigners against violence towards women and girls. She is also determined that the two police officers who were near the park on the night her daughter was killed are held to account.
The Metropolitan police’s directorate of professional standards says it investigated a complaint made about the two police officers’ decision not to go to Natalie’s aid and concluded they should be referred to the Metropolitan police service’s unsatisfactory performance procedure, but that their actions did not amount to misconduct. Natalie’s family had a right of review to the Independent Office for Police Conduct of the investigation into the complaint and an IOPC spokesperson says that their review of this matter is “nearing conclusion”.
The family are struggling without Natalie. Her killing has left gaping holes in the lives of everyone who loved her. At the time of her death she had been planning celebrations for her children’s birthdays, but did not live to enjoy sharing these milestones with them.
“This is a tragedy which is playing out all the time. It’s the day to day getting on that is the hardest,” says Cas. “Everyone loved Nat. She was a guiding light, life and soul. She was a lovely mum, a great sister and daughter, a really good kid. We are missing a beautiful girl.”",2024-10-30
Guardian,Is Kamala Harris alienating progressives as she courts anti-Trump Republicans?,"As the daughter of a man who drove George W Bush’s invasion of Iraq, Liz Cheney seemed a strange political bedfellow for a Democratic candidate intent on reclaiming disaffected Arab support in one of the US presidential election’s key battlegrounds.
But Cheney, the former third-ranking Republican in Congress before her career was derailed by her enmity with Donald Trump, was cast in precisely that role with Kamala Harris last week.
The pair, whose ideologically conflicting views on abortion and a host of other issues would once have put them at loggerheads, appeared together in the vice-president’s trawl for votes in critical swing states, including Michigan. The state is home to a large ethnic Arab voting bloc that still remembers Dick Cheney’s controversial role as Bush’s vice-president but is now reassessing its traditional pro-Democratic sympathies amid anger over the Biden administration’s support for Israel’s war in Gaza.
Trump, who has suggested that Cheney should be tried by a military tribunal for her congressional role in investigating his attempt to overturn the 2020 election, mocked it as a political gift.
“Arab Voters are very upset that Comrade Kamala Harris … is campaigning with ‘dumb as a rock’ War Hawk, Liz Cheney, who, like her father, the man that pushed Bush to ridiculously go to War in the Middle East, also wants to go to War with every Muslim Country known to mankind,” he posted on his Truth Social platform.
The argument – however warped in its expression – summarises one part of Harris’s conundrum in Michigan. She faces a serious hurdle after the Uncommitted movement, a pro-Palestinian protest group that is calling for an immediate ceasefire in the Gaza war and an arms embargo on Israel, declined to endorse her as she has sought to steer a careful middle path on the issue. The movement won more than 100,000 votes in Michigan when it contested last February’s Democratic primary against Joe Biden when he was still the party’s nominee.
“I don’t think having Liz Cheney on the team helps at all, because she doesn’t bring a flock of votes with her,” said James Zogby, president of the Arab-American Institute and a member of the Democratic National Committee.
Yet the endorsement from Cheney – along with that of her father, who has also publicly backed the Democratic nominee – highlights a broader aspect of Harris’s campaign; to win, she is relying on the public support of high-profile anti-Trump Republicans to persuade enough hitherto GOP voters to set aside old habits and vote for her on 5 November.
To that end, Harris’s coalition tent has expanded to include a broad swath of anti-Trump Republican refuseniks, including members of his former administration who have pledged themselves to the Democratic nominee in the interests of stopping him.
Among them are Stephanie Grisham, a former White House press secretary, Olivia Troye, a national security adviser to Mike Pence, Miles Taylor, a former homeland security department chief of staff, as well as Adam Kinzinger, a former Illinois congressman who - like Cheney - served on the House of Representatives committee investigating the 6 January 2021 attack on the US Capitol by a Trump-incited mob.
Other Republican Harris-endorsers include Alberto Gonzales, the former attorney general in the Bush administration and a man generally acknowledged as a legal architect of the US torture programme used in the post-9/11 “war on terror”. And last week, Fred Upton a former Michigan congressman who served for three decades before retiring in 2022 after voting to impeach Trump over January 6.
Harris’s campaign has welcomed them all, though few so warmly as Cheney.
The strategy has been accompanied by Harris moving to the centre by jettisoning previously held leftwing positions such as Medicare for all and support for a fracking ban, while embracing a tougher stance on immigration, Trump’s most emblematic campaign theme.
Prominent Democrat progressives like the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the outspoken House member for New York, have remained quiescent in the interests of maintaining a united front – until now.
Sanders, who had previously defended the vice-president’s retreat from progressive policies as “pragmatic” and essential to “win the election” broke cover last week, warning that her embrace of Republicans risked “losing the working class”.
“The truth of the matter is that there are a hell of a lot more working-class people who could vote for Kamala Harris than there are conservative Republicans,” Sanders – who has spoken at two dozen campaign events for Harris in October alone but, unlike Cheney, not appeared on a podium with her – told the Associated Press.
“She has to start talking more to the needs of working-class people.”
Joseph Geevarghese, executive director of Our Revolution, a leftwing group founded as a spin-off of Sanders’ 2016 presidential bid, told AP that Harris’s approach could cost her 10% of the progressive vote – with some possibly casting a ballot for Trump.
Zogby agreed. “Having an entire campaign focus on winning over quote-unquote moderate Republicans – and Liz Cheney is not a moderate Republican,” makes voters anxious, he said. “When somebody hears Liz Cheney being considered for a cabinet position, that makes people go into the panic mode. It may actually cost votes.
“There is an importance in reaching moderate Republicans. [But] the definition of a moderate Republican is not somebody who rejects Donald Trump. It’s somebody who espouses policies that are themselves moderate in terms of their economic and foreign policy agenda.”
But Mark Bergman, a veteran Democratic operative who has liaised with Republicans who have offered Harris their support, said that such ideological distinctions overlooked the personal risk many were taking by publicly disavowing Trump.
“These people were not asked by the campaign. They took it upon themselves to act,” Bergman said. “By speaking out, they are putting a target on their backs. They deserve our utmost respect. There are lists of people [to be targeted if Trump wins] floating around. These are real conversations.”
John Conway, strategy director of Republican Voters Against Trump – a group canvassing conservative-leaning voters to back Harris on the grounds that a second Trump presidency would endanger democracy – said it was a “false choice” to cast Harris’s embrace of dissident Republicans as a trade-off with maintaining her Democratic base.
“This election is going to be decided by what the independents and centre-right swing voters do,” he said. “If Kamala Harris can win enough of them, she can win Pennsylvania, Michigan [and] Wisconsin and reach 270 electoral college votes.”
For the strategy to succeed, Conway argued, Harris needed the example of GOP grandees of Cheney’s stature to win over diehard Republicans repelled by Trump but fearful of crossing a psychological barrier by voting Democrat.
“It’s really important that she get all the endorsements from the right she can. So when somebody like Liz Cheney says, ‘I feel the same way you do. I’ve been a Republican like you’ve been. I’m going to get there on Kamala Harris, because we need to make sure that Donald Trump can never be president again,’ I think that does help [persuade] reluctant Republican voters.”",2024-10-28

Guardian,"After a hurricane, Democrats try to snatch rare victory in swing state North Carolina","Eric “Rocky” Farmer is stoking a bonfire of what’s left of his life. Billows of smoke rise from a mound of debris burning in front of what he once called his home – a large two-storied house that is now a contorted mass of twisted metal and broken beams.
When Hurricane Helene struck western North Carolina last month, the North Fork New River that runs beside his property broke its banks, rising more than 20ft. The raging waters lifted up a mobile home from upstream as effortlessly as if it were a rag doll, slamming it into the corner of his house and causing the structure to crumple.
Farmer, 55, will have to dismantle the mess and rebuild it, largely with his own hands. “It’s a bad scene, but we’ll get back up,” he said, sounding remarkably serene.
Farmer’s struggle has now become entangled in the painfully close and hyper-tense election in North Carolina. The state is one of seven battlegrounds that will decide the outcome of the presidential race on 5 November.
Several tracker polls, including the Guardian’s, show the contest between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris to be neck-and-neck in the state.
With polls so tight, the impact of Hurricane Helene has made a complicated election look as mangled as Farmer’s house. What the disaster does to turnout, and with that to the candidates’ chances, could tip the race.
Amid the wreckage of his home, Farmer is taking a philosophical approach. “Politics is like mother nature,” he said. “You just watch what it does from the sidelines, then deal with the consequences.”
Though he plans to vote on 5 November, he is still not sure whether that will be for Trump or Harris. “Guess I’ll go with the lesser of the two evils – they’re both evil as far as I’m concerned,” he said.
The hurricane that struck on 26 September hit the Appalachian mountain region of western North Carolina hard, killing at least 96 people. Many roads are still closed and thousands of people have been displaced or remain without power and running water.
More than 1.2 million voters live in the stricken region – about one in six of the state’s total electorate. The obvious fear is that turnout will be depressed.
“Nobody’s talking about politics here, because it doesn’t matter,” said Shane Bare, 45, a local volunteer handing out donated coats. “If you can’t flush your toilet or get to your mailbox, you could care less about the election.”
Bare expects he will vote in the end, probably for Trump, whom he doesn’t much like but thinks has the edge on economic policy.
Other voters are more upbeat about the election. Kim Blevins shared her passion for Trump as she was picking up free tinned food and bottled water from a relief station in Creston.
“If Trump doesn’t get in, it’s going to be worse than the hurricane,” she said. “It’ll be world war three. Kamala Harris wants to make us a communist country.”
Harold Davis, 68, a Harris supporter salvaging lumber from the side of the river, told the Guardian that he also cares more than ever about the election. “It’s so important. Maga is really Mawa – Make America White Again – and the sooner we can get back to treating everyone as equals the better,” he said.
For Trump, the stakes in North Carolina could not be greater. For decades, the state has veered Republican, only backing Democrats twice in almost half a century (Jimmy Carter in 1976 and Barack Obama in 2008).
If Trump can take the state, as he did four years ago by a razor-thin 75,000 votes, along with Georgia and Pennsylvania, he will return to the White House. Without it, his path is uncertain.
“It’s very hard for us to win unless we’re able to get North Carolina,” Trump’s running mate, JD Vance, has said.
Trump descended on North Carolina for two days this week, scrambling between Asheville in the storm zone to Greenville and Concord, and then Greensboro. He has been busily spreading lies about the hurricane response, accusing the Biden administration of refusing aid to Republican voters and falsely claiming that federal money has been redirected to house undocumented immigrants.
His frenetic schedule and lies are perhaps indications of Trump’s anxieties about the impact of the hurricane on his electoral chances. Of the 25 counties hit by the disaster, 23 voted for Trump in 2020.
“Outside the cities of Asheville and Boone, which are pretty Democratic, most of the hurricane area went strongly for Trump in 2020. So if turnout is down because of the disaster, it is likely to hit Trump most,” said David McLennan, a political scientist at Meredith College who runs the Meredith opinion poll.
Republicans in the state have drawn comfort from the record-breaking early voting. In the first week of in-person early voting, almost 1.6 million people cast their ballots, surpassing the total crop of early votes in 2020.
Four years ago, Republican early voting slumped in the wake of Trump’s false claims about rampant fraud. But this year’s record-smashing turnout suggests that the party has now put that behind it – Republicans and Democrats are virtually tied in their early voting numbers.
“Despite all the challenges, people have shown they are determined to come and vote, a lot of them specifically against Kamala Harris,” said Matt Mercer, communications director for the North Carolina Republican party. “So we are feeling optimistic.”
In the tranquil tree-lined suburbs on the north side of Charlotte, the effort to squeeze out every vote for Kamala Harris is entering its final heave. Here, sandwiched between the solidly Democratic city and the heavily Trumpian countryside, the suburban voters, women especially, could hold the key.
Fern Cooper, 83, standing at the door of her detached suburban house, said she was powerfully motivated to vote because of her disdain for Trump. As a former New Yorker from the Bronx, she’s observed his flaws up close.
She recalled how he was gifted huge sums of money from his real estate father; how he called for Black young men known as the Central Park Five to be executed for a rape they did not commit and for which they were later exonerated; how he treated his first wife, Ivana Trump, badly.
“I know everything about Trump,” she said. “He’s not getting my vote.”
Hannah Waleh, 66, is also all-in for Harris, for more positive reasons: “She will bring change, she is real, not a liar. She is for the poor and working-class people.”
Waleh, a medical technician, has been urging her colleagues at her hospital and church to get out and vote early for the Democratic candidate: “I’m begging them. If everybody votes, I’m sure she will win.”
She might be right. The Meredith poll has tracked the extraordinary transformation in the race after Harris took over the Democratic nomination from Joe Biden.
“Biden was losing North Carolina,” McLennan said. “Harris’s entry into the race returned the state to being 50-50 again – it’s back to being purple.”
It is one thing bringing North Carolina back into contention and quite another to win. Part of the challenge is that, according to the poll, 2% of voters are still undecided, a tiny slice of the electorate that both campaigns are now frantically chasing.
“I’ve never seen undecideds that low so close to the election,” McLennan said.
They include Faith and Elizabeth, both 27, who have erected a 15ft Halloween skeleton on the lawn outside their house in the Charlotte suburbs. They told the Guardian that the most important issue, in their view, is abortion and the rights that women have already had taken away from them under Trump.
And yet they still haven’t committed to voting for Harris. “We want to be certain,” Faith said.
The Democrats are prioritising such suburban women, including those who formed part of the 23% of Republicans who backed Nikki Haley in the Republican presidential primary. They are doing so by focusing on abortion rights, with the Harris-Walz campaign warning that the state’s current restrictive 12-week abortion ban would be tightened under a Trump administration to a total nationwide abortion ban.
They have also sought to tie Trump to extreme Republicans further down the ballot. The main target is the Republican candidate for governor, Mark Robinson, who has described himself as a “Black Nazi” and has been revealed to have made extreme racist remarks.
During the past 18 months, Democrats have invested in the state, opening 28 offices with more than 340 staffers. They have even pushed into rural counties that previously had been assumed to be beyond the party’s reach.
“The Democrats have prioritized getting the party’s message out in more rural parts – on the grounds that a vote from rural areas is just as useful as from the city,” said Jason Roberts, a political scientist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Bolstering the party’s ground game is a vast alliance of non-profit progressive organizations such as the Black-led group Advance Carolina and Red Wine & Blue, which works with suburban women. The alliance, which playfully calls itself Operation We Save Ourselves, has a goal of knocking on 4m doors to promote candidates with progressive values – the largest independent program of its sort in North Carolina’s history.
If hard work were all it took to win presidential elections, Harris would already have one foot inside the Oval Office. But anxieties continue to swirl around the Democratic ticket, led by concerns that early turnout from African American voters, who in past cycles have swung overwhelmingly Democratic, is lower this year than at the same stage four years ago (37% in 2020, compared with 20% today).
As the months remaining until election day turn into days, and days into hours, the Harris-Walz campaign will be making last-ditch efforts to persuade Black voters to get out and vote – voters like Christian Swims, 21, a student at community college, who would be voting in his first presidential election.
If he votes at all, that is.
“I don’t follow the election much,” he said. “My friends don’t talk about it. People round here aren’t very political.”
Or Joseph Rich, a Fedex worker, 28. “I don’t know too much about Trump and Kamala Harris,” he said. “I’ll read up on them, but now I’m not sure.”
Time is running out for Democrats to connect with voters like Swims and Rich. Whether or not they succeed could make all the difference.",2024-10-28
Guardian,Marjorie Taylor Greene condemned over Helene weather conspiracy theory,"Far-right congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene is facing condemnation following several conspiratorial comments amid the devastation of Hurricane Helene that seemed to suggest she believed the US government can control the weather.
In a post last week shared with her 1.2 million X followers, the US House representative from Georgia wrote: “Yes they can control the weather. It’s ridiculous for anyone to lie and say it can’t be done.”
Greene does not specify to whom “they” is referring, but she has a history of promoting conspiracy theories around the federal government and other groups.
She appeared to double down on these comments with a post on Saturday, sharing a clip from a 2013 CBS News broadcast about experimental efforts to induce rain and lightning using lasers. “CBS, nine years ago, talked about lasers controlling the weather,” Greene wrote, apparently mistaking the year of the broadcast.
Greene, who is no stranger to misinformation including once raising the idea of Jewish space lasers being behind wildfire outbreaks, was met with a wave of criticism for her blatantly false statements.
The US government’s top disaster relief official condemned on Sunday false claims made about Helene and its relief efforts, stating that such conspiracy theories, including those made by Donald Trump as he seeks a second presidency, are causing fear in people who need assistance and “demoralizing” the workers who are providing assistance.
“It’s frankly ridiculous, and just plain false. This kind of rhetoric is not helpful to people,” said Deanne Criswell, who leads the Federal Emergency Management Agency. “It’s really a shame that we’re putting politics ahead of helping people, and that’s what we’re here to do.”
Shawn Harris, who is running for Greene’s congressional seat, condemned the incumbent’s comments.
“Marjorie Taylor Greene’s conspiracy theories are sickening, but she does it to distract from her failed effort to block crucial funding for Fema as Hurricane Helene was making landfall,” Harris wrote in a post on X.
Ryan Maue, a meteorologist and popular internet personality, seemed to poke fun at Greene’s comments while also factchecking her false claims.
He suggested on X that some conspiracy theories turn out to be true – but added: “I can assure you that the Hurricane Helene weather modification theory is not one of them.
“I would know, too.”
In an email to his supporters, the Republican US senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina also seemed to condemn conspiracy theories about Hurricane Helene, though he did not specify the rightwing source of the theories.
“The destruction caused by Helene is incomprehensible and has left many communities in western North Carolina absolutely devastated. The last thing that the victims of Helene need right now is political posturing, finger-pointing, or conspiracy theories that only hurt the response effort,” the email stated.
In an opinion piece on Saturday by its editorial board, North Carolina’s Charlotte Observer criticized Trump because of his falsehoods over the government response to Helene, saying the state’s affected parts were “not a political football” and “not a campaign opportunity”.
Criticism of Greene’s conspiracy theories even made it to the sports world, with the tennis legend Martina Navratilova using her platform to call out not only Greene as well as Trump’s running mate in November’s election, JD Vance. Vance had praised Greene at a rally just hours after she posted her conspiracies.
“Marj is even more stupid than we thought possible,” Navratilova wrote on X. “And Vance is not stupid – he is just a cowardly sycophant. Which is actually worse.”
Greene is also facing criticism for her hypocrisy of peddling conspiracy theories about Hurricane Helene while she was photographed in attendance at the University of Alabama’s home football game against the University of Georgia with Trump on 28 September. She reportedly left her state of Georgia to attend the game in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, while Helene devastated communities across the state she was elected to represent.",2024-10-07
Guardian,Mike Johnson promises ‘massive’ healthcare changes if Trump wins,"Vice-President Kamala Harris may have received another last-minute helping hand from Republicans after the House speaker, Mike Johnson, said there would be “massive” healthcare changes if Donald Trump wins next Tuesday, including abolishing Obamacare.
“Healthcare reform’s going to be a big part of the agenda,” Johnson, speaking at a rally in Pennsylvania on Monday, told the crowd. “When I say we’re going to have a very aggressive first 100 days agenda, we got a lot of things still on the table.”
“No Obamacare?” one rally-goer asked Johnson, referring to the law Democrats passed in 2010, also known as the Affordable Care Act.
“No Obamacare,” Johnson replied, according to NBC News. “The ACA is so deeply ingrained, we need massive reform to make this work and we got a lot of ideas on how to do that.”

Harris outpolls Trump on healthcare in battleground states, where it rates as the fourth-most important issue among voters, according to a Washington Post-Schar school poll, behind the economy, inflation and threats to democracy.
During the presidential TV debate in September, Trump said he had formed “the concepts of a plan” for replacing Obamacare.
The former president proposed a reform plan in the 2020 budget that said it supported “several initiatives to empower States and consumers to regain control over healthcare and increase affordability and consumer choice”. The plan incorporated a repeal of the ACA’s premium subsidies and Medicaid expansion, replacing them with a block grant to states, and would have capped federal spending on Medicaid. The plan could have reduced federal healthcare spending by more than $1tn over a decade.
In their election platform, Democrats argue that more than 20 million Americans have gained healthcare coverage and that the uninsured rate has been cut almost in half under Obamacare, including 2.3 million young adults. They note that healthcare discrimination based on pre-existing conditions is now illegal.
“Democrats have been fighting to secure universal health care for the American people for generations, and we are proud to be the party that passed Medicare, Medicaid, and the Affordable Care Act,” the policy statement reads.
A return to pre-Obamacare policies would mean a return to “free-market” healthcare that would harm healthcare safeguards for vulnerable sections of the population, Democrats argue.
“We want to take a blowtorch to the regulatory state,” Johnson reportedly said. “These agencies have been weaponized against the people, it’s crushing the free market; it’s like a boot on the neck of job creators and entrepreneurs and risk takers.”",2024-10-30
Guardian,The Washington Post is a reminder of the dangers of billionaire ownership | Siva Vaidhyanathan,"Last week the Washington Post refrained from endorsing a candidate in the presidential race for the first time in 36 years. The decision was reportedly ordered by Jeff Bezos, the Post’s owner and one of the richest men in the world. The Seattle billionaire, who owns Amazon, purchased the flailing newspaper in 2013 in a rare fit of civic duty.
The blowback was immediate and substantial. Within 48 hours of the announcement as many as 200,000 paying readers cancelled their subscriptions to the already money-losing news organization, according to reporting by NPR.
Such withholding of revenue is usually more a symbolic message than a real threat to the viability of a company. But for the Post, which has been teetering for decades, any loss in subscribers is threatening. Hundreds of good journalists who had no influence on Bezos’s decision remain unsure of the viability of their employer. Residents of the District of Columbia and much of Virginia and Maryland also rely on the Post for coverage of state and local issues, culture and sports. All of this is threatened by Bezos’s decision and the public uprising against it.
Some angry citizens also cancelled their subscriptions to Amazon Prime, the service that provides free shipping for many Amazon products and access to video and music streaming.
While a widespread Prime resignation would not damage the public sphere or the prospects for democracy and good government the way that hurting the Washington Post does, it’s still a futile gesture that probably will not alarm or injure Bezos in the slightest.
That’s because Prime is a classic loss-leader feature: Amazon uses the service to crush competitors by offering cheaper goods and services while the company makes its money elsewhere. Prime has about 180 million members in the United States, so if a few thousand quit, Amazon would hardly notice and Bezos hardly care.
Amazon and Bezos are far more powerful than most people realize. The company’s power is deep, broad and largely invisible. The books and dog toys we buy through Amazon remind us of its public face and original mission. But it’s not 2004 any more.
Amazon is not a normal retail company or a normal company in any way; it’s a sprawling leviathan wrapped around the essential processes of major governments, commerce and culture of most of the world.
Amazon’s major source of revenue and profit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is the leading provider of computing and data services in the world, ahead of Microsoft and Alphabet. AWS hosts the sites and data of more than 7,500 governmental agencies and offices in the US alone, including those of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Reserve.
Just about everything a 21st-century state or firm might want to do probably goes through Amazon and makes Bezos wealthier and more powerful in the process. All of this happened over the past 20 years as we enthusiastically chose convenience and mobility over all other human values. We clicked Bezos into power – and not by buying things through Amazon retail; we did it by choosing the internet again and again.
In blocking the Washington Post endorsement, Bezos is not acting cowardly as much as slyly. Secure in his fortune and status regardless of the potential rise of fascism in the US, he has some more selfish concerns about the nature of the next administration.
One potential Bezos-centric consequence of the election on 5 November is that Donald Trump will prevail over a bacchanal of greed and corruption, potentially opening federal contracts to all sorts of favored players and – more importantly – stifling investigations and prosecutions into firms and people Trump might favor.
The other possible consequence is that a Kamala Harris administration would continue the aggressive and much-needed investigations into the ways internet companies like Amazon have restrained trade, concentrated wealth and solidified power by leveraging networks and scale.
Bezos also founded and owns Blue Origin, a rocket and space technology firm that has many government contracts. Limiting the government’s regulatory oversight over space technology or contracting is in Bezos’s interest, which might explain why Blue Origin staff met with Trump around the same time as the Post announced its decision not to endorse. It’s also likely Bezos would like to muscle out Trump’s pal Elon Musk and his company, SpaceX, for what is to come.
Given all this, it makes sense that Bezos, who is generally liberal and supports Democratic candidates, would try to limit how much Trump hates him (and Trump has long hated Bezos – a lot), if there is a small chance to curry favor with the once and future president. Perhaps Bezos figures his newspaper should not help Harris more than it already has by reporting the basic news.
So there are many reasons to fear a Bezos-Trump rapprochement. Still, it does not make much sense to cancel a Post subscription or Prime membership. Neither would hurt Bezos at all.
Most boycotts, especially when they are tiny, disorganized, ad-hoc, emotional and aimed at enormous, global companies, are mere expressions of self-righteousness. They have no significant influence on the world but they can make the boycotter feel a bit better for a few days. What’s worse, they often distract energy from real political action that might curb the excesses of the companies in question.
Here is the problem: billionaires are mostly immune to consumer pressure. That’s how they became and remain billionaires.
So how do we solve a problem like a billionaire? First, we must be blunt about the nature and scope of their power. It’s not a matter of describing their wealth, which flashes before us in numbers we can’t properly grasp or feel. We must describe their influence and how they control things in the world.
Second, we must find ways to limit their wealth by taxing the various ways they accumulate and hide it.
Third, we must be enthusiastic about breaking up big companies that do too many things in too many markets and thus crush or purchase potential competitors and insurgents. It’s not about prices. It’s about power.
Most of all, we should do our best to elect leaders who are not beholden to billionaires, but actively seek to turn them back into millionaires.

Guardian,Californians want controls on AI. Why did Gavin Newsom veto an AI safety bill? | Garrison Lovely,"Governor Gavin Newsom of California recently killed SB1047, a first-of-its-kind artificial intelligence safety bill, arguing that its focus on only the largest AI models leaves out smaller ones that can also be risky. Instead, he says, we should pass comprehensive regulations on the technology.
If this doesn’t sound quite right to you, you’re not alone.
Despite claims by prominent opponents of the bill that “literally no one wants this”, SB1047 was popular – really popular. It passed the California legislature with an average of two-thirds of each chamber voting in favor. Six statewide polls that presented pro and con arguments for the bill show strong majorities in support, which rose over time. A September national poll found 80% of Americans thought Newsom should sign the bill. It was also endorsed by the two most-cited AI researchers alive, along with more than 110 current and former staff of the top-five AI companies.
The core of SB1047 would have established liability for creators of AI models in the event they cause a catastrophe and the developer didn’t take appropriate safety measures.
These provisions received support from at least 80% of California voters in an August poll.
So how do we make sense of this divide?
The aforementioned surveys were all commissioned or conducted by SB1047-sympathetic groups, prompting opponents to dismiss them as biased.
But even when a bill-sympathetic polling shop collaborated with an opponent to test “con” arguments in September, 62% of Californians were in favor.
Moreover, these results don’t surprise me at all. I’m writing a book on the economics and politics of AI and have analyzed years of nationwide polling on the topic. The findings are pretty consistent: people worry about risks from AI, favor regulations, and don’t trust companies to police themselves. Incredibly, these findings tend to hold true for both Republicans and Democrats.
So why would Newsom buck the popular bill?
Well, the bill was fiercely resisted by most of the AI industry, including Google, Meta and OpenAI. The US has let the industry self-regulate, and these companies desperately don’t want that to change – whatever sounds their leaders make to the contrary.
AI investors such as the venture fund Andreessen Horowitz, also known as a16z, mounted a smear campaign against the bill, saying anything they thought would kill the bill and hiring lobbyists with close ties to Newsom.
AI “godmother” and Stanford professor Fei-Fei Li parroted Andreessen Horowitz’s misleading talking points about the bill in the pages of Fortune – never disclosing that she runs a billion-dollar AI startup backed by the firm.
Then, eight congressional Democrats from California asked Newsom for a veto in an open letter, which was first published by an Andreessen Horowitz partner.
The top three names on the congressional letter – Zoe Lofgren, Anna Eshoo, and Ro Khanna – have collectively taken more than $4m in political contributions from the industry, accounting for nearly half of their lifetime top-20 contributors. Google was their biggest donor by far, with nearly $1m in total.
The death knell probably came from the former House speaker Nancy Pelosi, who published her own statement against the bill, citing the congressional letter and Li’s Fortune op-ed.
In 2021, reporters discovered that Lofgren’s daughter is a lawyer for Google, which prompted a watchdog to ask Pelosi to negotiate her recusal from antitrust oversight roles.
Who came to Lofgren’s defense? Eshoo and Khanna.
Three years later, Lofgren remains in these roles, which have helped her block efforts to rein in big tech – against the will of even her Silicon Valley constituents.
Pelosi’s 2023 financial disclosure shows that her husband owned between $16m and $80m in stocks and options in Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Nvidia.
When I asked if these investments pose a conflict of interest, Pelosi’s spokesperson replied: “Speaker Pelosi does not own any stocks, and she has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions.”
SB1047’s primary author, California state senator Scott Wiener, is widely expected to run for Pelosi’s congressional seat upon her retirement. His likely opponent? Christine Pelosi, the former speaker’s daughter, fueling speculation that Pelosi may be trying to clear the field.
In Silicon Valley, AI is the hot thing and a perceived ticket to fortune and power. In Congress, AI is something to regulate … later, so as to not upset one of the wealthiest industries in the country.
But the reality on the ground is that AI is more a source of fear and resentment. California’s state legislators, who are more down-to-earth than high-flying national Democrats, appear to be genuinely reflecting – or even moderating – the will of their constituents.
Sunny Gandhi of the youth tech advocacy group Encode Justice, which co-sponsored the bill, told me: “When you tell the average person that tech giants are creating the most powerful tools in human history but resist simple measures to prevent catastrophic harm, their reaction isn’t just disbelief – it’s outrage. This isn’t just a policy disagreement; it’s a moral chasm between Silicon Valley and Main Street.”
Newsom just told us which of these he values more.

Guardian,Where will abortion be on the ballot in the 2024 US election?,"This November, abortion will be on the ballot in 10 states, including the states that could determine the next president.
In the two years since the US supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, abortion has become the kind of issue that decides elections. Outrage over Roe’s demise led Republicans to flounder in the 2022 midterms, and abortion rights supporters have won every post-Roe abortion-related ballot measure, including in red states such as Ohio, Kentucky and Kansas.
This year, most of the ballot measures are seeking to amend states’ constitutions to protect abortion rights up until fetal viability, or about 24 weeks of pregnancy. Because a number of the measures are in states that have outlawed abortion, they could become the first to overturn the post-Roe ban. Others are in states where abortion is legal, but activists say the measures are necessary to cement protections so they can’t be easily overturned if Republicans control the government.
These are the states slated to vote on abortion this election day.
Arizona
Abortion rights supporters in Arizona, a key battleground state in the presidential election, are vying to pass a measure that would enshrine the right to abortion up until viability in the state constitution. A provider could perform an abortion after viability if the procedure is necessary to protect the life or physical or mental health of a patient.
Arizona currently bans abortion past 15 weeks of pregnancy. Earlier this year, the state supreme court reinstated a 19th-century near-total abortion ban, generating nationwide outrage that prompted the state legislature to quickly repeal it in favor of letting the 15-week ban stand.
Colorado
Colorado’s measure would amend the state constitution to block the state government from denying, impeding or discriminating against individuals’ “right to abortion”. This measure also includes a one-of-a-kind provision to bar Colorado from prohibiting healthcare coverage for abortion – which could very well pass in the deep-blue state.
Because Colorado permits abortion throughout pregnancy and neighbors five states with bans – Oklahoma, Texas, Arizona, Utah and Nebraska – the state has become a haven for people fleeing abortion bans, especially those seeking abortions later in pregnancy.
Florida
Once the last stronghold of southern abortion access, Florida in May banned abortion past six weeks of pregnancy, which is before many women know they’re pregnant. Its measure, which needs 60% of the vote to pass, would roll back that ban by adding the right to an abortion up until viability to the state’s constitution. Providers could perform an abortion after viability if one is needed to protect a patient’s health.
Florida Republicans’ tactics in the fight against the measure has alarmed voting rights and civil rights groups. Law enforcement officials have investigated voters who signed petitions to get the measure onto the ballot, while a state health agency has created a webpage attacking the amendment.
Maryland
Legislators, rather than citizens, initiated Maryland’s measure, which would amend the state constitution to confirm individuals’ “right to reproductive freedom, including but not limited to the ability to make and effectuate decisions to prevent, continue, or end the individual’s pregnancy”. Like Colorado, Maryland has become an abortion haven because it permits the procedure throughout pregnancy. It is also relatively close to the deep south, which is blanketed in bans.
Missouri
Abortion opponents went to court to stop Missouri’s measure from appearing on voters’ ballots, but the state supreme court rejected their arguments and agreed to let voters decide whether the Missouri constitution should guarantee the “fundamental right to reproductive freedom, which is the right to make and carry out decisions about all matters relating to reproductive healthcare, including but not limited to prenatal care, childbirth, postpartum care, birth control, abortion care, miscarriage care, and respectful birthing conditions”.
Missouri, which was the first state to ban abortion after Roe fell, only permits the procedure in medical emergencies. If the measure passes, it is expected to roll back that ban and permit abortion until viability.
Montana
In the years since Roe fell, Montana courts and its Republican-dominated legislature have wrestled over abortion restrictions and whether the right to privacy embedded in Montana’s constitution includes the right to abortion. Abortion remains legal until viability in Montana, but the measure would amend the state constitution to explicitly include “a right to make and carry out decisions about one’s own pregnancy, including the right to abortion” up until viability. Providers could perform an abortion after viability to protect a patient’s life or health.
Nebraska
Nebraska, which bans abortion past 12 weeks of pregnancy, is the lone state with two competing ballot measures this November. One of the measures would enshrine the right to abortion up until viability into the state constitution, while the other would enshrine the current ban. If both measures pass, the measure that garners the most votes would take effect.
Nevada
Alongside Arizona, Nevada is one of the most closely watched states in the presidential election. Its measure would amend the state constitution to protect individuals’ right to abortion up until viability, or after viability in cases where a patient’s health or life may be threatened. Nevada already permits abortion up until 26 weeks of pregnancy.
New York
New York state legislators added a measure to the ballot to broaden the state’s anti-discrimination laws by adding, among other things, protections against discrimination on the basis of “sex, including sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive health”.
Although sky-blue New York passed a law protecting reproductive rights in 2019, advocates say this measure could be used to defend abortion rights against future challenges. However, the ballot language before voters will not include the word “abortion”, leading advocates to fear voters will not understand what they are voting on. Democrats pushed to add the word “abortion” to the description of the measure, but a judge rejected the request, ruling that the amendment poses “complex interpretive questions” and its exact impact on abortion rights is unclear.
South Dakota
South Dakota’s measure is less sweeping than other abortion rights measures, because it would only protect the right to abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. Under this measure, South Dakota could regulate access to abortion “only in ways that are reasonably related to the physical health of the pregnant woman” in the second trimester of pregnancy. In the third trimester, the state could ban abortion except in medical emergencies. Right now, South Dakota only allows abortions in such emergencies.
Although this measure will appear on the ballot, there will be a trial over the validity of the signatures that were collected for it. Depending out the outcome of the trial, the measure – and any votes cast for it – could be invalidated.",2024-09-26
Guardian,The Guardian view on the US presidential election 2024: a Democratic government is the one we need,"It is hard to imagine a worse candidate for the American presidency in 2024 than Donald J Trump. His history of dishonesty, hypocrisy and greed makes him wholly unfit for the office. A second Trump term would erode the rule of law, diminish America’s global standing and deepen racial and cultural divides. Even if he loses, Mr Trump has shown that he will undermine the election process, with allies spreading unfounded conspiracy theories to delegitimise the results.
There are prominent Republicans – such as the former vice-president Dick Cheney – who refused to support Mr Trump owing to the threat he poses. Gen Mark Milley, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff under Mr Trump, calls his former boss a “fascist”. America was founded in opposition to absolute monarchy. The Republican nominee models himself after the leader he most admires: Russia’s autocratic president, Vladimir Putin.
Mr Trump’s authoritarianism may finish US democracy. He has praised and promised to pardon those convicted in the January 6 insurrection. He has suggested bypassing legal norms to use potentially violent methods of repression, blurring the lines between vigilantism, law enforcement and military action, against groups – be they Democrats or undocumented immigrants – he views as enemies.
His team has tried to distance itself from the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 and its extreme proposals – such as mass firings of civil servants and erasing women’s rights – that poll poorly. But it is likely that, in office, Mr Trump would adopt many of these intolerant, patriarchal and discriminatory plans. He aims to dismantle the government to enrich himself and evade the law. If Republicans gain control of the Senate, House and White House, he would interpret it as a mandate to silence his critics and entrench his power.
Mr Trump is a transactional and corrupting politician. His supporters see this as an advantage. Christian nationalists want an authoritarian regime to enforce religious edicts on Americans. Elon Musk wants to shape the future without regulatory oversight. Both put self-interest ahead of the American people. Democracy erodes slowly at first, then all at once. In office, Mr Trump appointed three supreme court justices, who this summer blocked efforts to hold him accountable for trying to overturn the 2020 election: their immunity ruling renders the president “a king above the law”, in the words of the liberal justice Sonia Sotomayor.
A historic president
Since Kamala Harris stepped into the spotlight following Joe Biden’s exit, her campaign has been a masterclass in political jujitsu, deftly flipping Mr Trump’s perceived strengths into glaring weaknesses. With a focus on joy, the vice-president sharply contrasted with Mr Trump’s grim narrative of US decline. In their sole televised debate, Ms Harris skillfully outmaneuvered Mr Trump, who fell into her traps, appearing angry and incoherent. She is confident and composed. He sounds unhinged.
The Trump agenda threatens to dismantle voting rights, women’s rights and minority rights – not just reversing decades of social progress but burying it. Mr Trump was behind the shredding of reproductive rights. The conservative forces rallying to him are now intent on imposing a national abortion ban, with – should he win – dire implications for IVF and birth control. Republicans have been hurt in the polls by being associated with such unpopular policies – a weak spot that Ms Harris should keep exploiting.
The vice-president has energised Democrats with savvy media appearances while appealing to swing voters. Progressives, determined to defeat Mr Trump, remain committed to freedom and equality. But Ms Harris has disappointed those who have urged her to take a stand on US complicity in Israel’s bombing of civilians in Gaza and Lebanon. Downplaying war crimes, as arms flow to Israel, has already harmed Democratic chances in key swing states like Michigan.
In a political system where style often rivals substance, perception is crucial. While Ms Harris hasn’t made her race and gender central to her campaign, her victory would be historic: she would be the first woman, and the first woman of color, to be president. Symbolism matters to her base. Her candidacy rallied key constituencies – the young, women, African Americans and Hispanics – who were cooling on Mr Biden. This election is a leap of faith in Ms Harris, who offers a sense of possibility for the future, while Mr Trump clings to a reactionary past.
Protecting democracy
Despite his criminal conviction and being declared a rapist by a judge, Mr Trump remains dangerously close to reclaiming the presidency. Many voters still back a man who was the worst US president ever. But probably not a majority of US voters. Republicans benefit from a skewed electoral system: Democrats have won the popular vote in all but one election since 1992, and secured the overall popular majority for the Senate in every six-year cycle since 1996. Yet the country has often been led by Republican presidents and a GOP-controlled Senate, and therefore a Republican-dominated supreme court. In a close race in November, that could mean Mr Trump doesn’t need to win the election – just a court case.
Mr Biden has been a transformational political figure, but he didn’t transform the country. He aimed to tackle inequality, broken public services and the climate crisis with a $4tn plan funded by taxing the rich. His goal was to restore his party’s political credibility by marrying social liberalism with economic justice. But corporate influence and the Democrats’ slim Senate majority shrank his ambitions. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine shifted his focus to national security, as America experienced rising prices. However, Mr Biden made historic investments to green the economy and refocused industrial policy to take on China. Ms Harris’s plans aim to recapture the spirit of Mr Biden’s insurgency.
The US economy is stronger than it has been in decades, yet Mr Trump consistently outpolls Ms Harris on economic issues. This perhaps reflects decades of neoliberalism. Real wages for blue-collar workers have stagnated since the 1970s, while inflation-adjusted house prices have doubled. Polls show 70% of Americans feel significant political and economic reform is needed, putting Democrats at a disadvantage as they are linked to the status quo.
Political hope fades when we settle for what is, instead of fighting for what could be. Ms Harris embodies the conviction that it’s better to believe in democracy’s potential than to surrender to its imperfections. The Republican agenda is clear: voter suppression, book bans and tax cuts for billionaires. Democrats seek global engagement; the GOP favours isolation. The Biden-Harris administration laid the groundwork for a net zero America. A Trumpian comeback would undo it. A Harris win, with a Democratic Congress, means a chance to restore good governance, create good jobs and lead the entire planet’s climate efforts. Defeating Mr Trump protects democracy from oligarchy and dictatorship. There is too much at stake not to back Ms Harris for president.",2024-10-23
Guardian,Trump’s greatest feat has been convincing ordinary Americans that he’s on their side. He is not | George Monbiot,"Dear US voters, in the spirit in which I would beg a dear friend not to get a facial tattoo, I’m writing to ask you not to vote for Donald Trump. While the decision to do so would make a statement, signalling your justifiable anger about the pain you have suffered, it is likely to disfigure you, damage your life chances and prove irreversible. In the wake of his rally at Madison Square Garden, no one can now doubt what he intends to do to you.
I can guess where you think I’m coming from, but I have no love for the Democrats. Unlike the UK Labour party staffers campaigning for Kamala Harris, I have no affiliations. While there have been some improvements under Joe Biden, for decades, regardless of which party was in power, the value generated by the middle and working classes has been mopped up by the very rich. This is the result of 45 years of neoliberalism, a life-sapping programme to which both parties subscribe. I share the horror and disgust many of you feel towards Biden’s foreign policy, especially his support for the Israeli government while it pursues its genocidal onslaught in Gaza and invasion of Lebanon.
But all these things would be worse under Trump. Of Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump said last week, “he’s doing a good job” but “Biden is trying to hold him back … and he probably should be doing the opposite, actually”. Earlier this year, he said of the Israeli government, “They’ve got to finish what they started.” If, as Trump allegedly threatened, he “will not give a penny” to Ukraine in aid, Vladimir Putin could do to Ukraine what Netanyahu has done to Gaza. Any prospect of peace on either front would shift from improbable to impossible.
For all their faults, at least Biden and Harris seek, however unevenly, to shield the people of the United States from the worst aspects of capitalism. But Trump is the worst aspects of capitalism, condensed into human form: the greed, the lies, the rip-offs. While he remains vague on the detail, a collection of rightwing goons, under the aegis of Project 2025, have laid out the road he will most likely follow. During his first presidency, Trump attempted, but thankfully failed, to destroy the Affordable Care Act. If he wins again, he will fail less often. His team will rip down the threadbare public protections for the middle and working classes. Trump’s plans would hasten the insolvency of social security and Medicare. He will gut the government, replacing experienced officials with loyalists. Head Start, which provides childcare and preschool education, offering at least a prospect of opportunity for all, will be erased: if you are born poor, you will be even more likely to remain poor.
Never underestimate the vengeful nihilism at the heart of this movement. The glitter-eyed fanatics behind Project 2025 and other such programmes will smash whatever is most precious to you, partly at the behest of commercial interests – but also to enjoy watching the pain it inflicts. They will crush beauty, joy, community and hope precisely because other people value them.
Even if, in 2028, Trump or his designated successor somehow permits a change of government, which seems unlikely, some of the impacts of another single term will be irrevocable, particularly as his team attacks the living world.
His climate policies will rush us even faster towards the Earth systems horizon. There will be no recovery of the beautiful wild places he will hand to fossil fuel extractors, to mining and ranching companies, to construction firms. When catastrophes strike, he will not be there for you. During his first term, Trump, a modern-day Nero, withheld disaster aid from states he deemed insufficiently loyal to him. His callous and chaotic response to the Covid-19 pandemic helped cause the death of 350,000 Americans in 2020. Contrast this, for instance, to Taiwan, whose highly effective policies ensured that only seven lives were lost that year. This is the iron rule: Trump serves only himself.
Some of you might gain from a new Trump presidency, but only at the expense of others. His is, and has always been, a zero-sum game. His friends may rise, but only as his enemies fall. And the nature of the enemy will constantly evolve.
Already, you can see the net widening. Trump has made it clear that people who don’t originate from “nice countries” – he listed Denmark, Switzerland and Norway – are “poisoning the blood” of the US. Your blood, in his worldview, becomes no less “poisonous” over time. Already, he has lined up Jews as the scapegoats if he loses the election, a gambit as old as the hills.
Perhaps you are white and Christian. But you might discover, some years down the line, that you are the wrong kind of white, or the wrong kind of Christian. Gay? Disabled? Long-term sick? It may not be long before you too are “poisoning the blood” of the country. As his capture of the judiciary advances, women will be reduced once more to second-class citizens whose primary purpose is to serve men. Who is the “your” in “I am your retribution”? Trump is careful never to spell it out. But of one thing you can be sure: the answer will keep changing.
It is not hard to see the militias supporting Trump mutating into death squads if he wins, protected by sympathetic police, a tame judiciary and presidential pardons. If so, they would be used to instil terror into his opponents. Every outrage will blunt the edge of the next one, until you are so inured to outrage that you have no remaining capacity to respond. And as Trump is now empowered by almost full-spectrum immunity, there will be nothing anyone can do to stop him.
The rest of the establishment and the less extreme media, the professions, government officials and legislators – will they seek to protect you? Most will fall into line, out of fear and favour, the two forces to which almost everyone in public life succumbs. This is how it works, and has always worked.
Men like Trump, damaged, frightened, pathologically insecure, resistant to love and therapy, can relieve their pain only by inflicting pain on others. Compassion is a foreign concept to him. There is no curiosity, no wonder, no kindness, no connection with the hearts of others, no lightness of spirit. In their place are ego, rage, resentment, impulsiveness and cruelty. Those who are not at peace with themselves destroy other people’s peace.
We need to build a world in which one can gain without another losing, a world in which kindness, decency and community prevail, where the fortunate help the less fortunate to avoid disaster. The Democrats will deliver less of this than they should. But Trump will make everything worse. Please, dear friends. Don’t do it to yourselves.

Guardian,How local radio plays a pivotal role in securing Latino votes in Colorado,"When Yadira Caraveo, a Democratic party member, won the race to represent Colorado’s eighth district in the House of Representatives in 2022, she eked out a victory, winning by the narrowest margin of any Democrat in the country. This November, Caraveo is facing yet another close race – one that could determine the balance of Congress.
In a district where nearly 40% of residents identify as Hispanic or Latino, the community will be decisive in crowning a winner. The battle for their votes is mostly playing out not on TV or in town halls, but on social media and local radio.
“[Latino voters] are listening to social media and the radio,” said Sonny Subia, Colorado’s volunteer state director for Lulac, the League of United Latin American Citizens, the largest and oldest Hispanic organization in the country.
CD-8 stretches from the suburbs of Denver, where voters lean Democratic, to the agricultural areas around Greeley, where voters lean Republican. Caraveo, a pediatrician whose Mexican parents raised their four children in what is now the eighth district, is highlighting her efforts to lower healthcare costs and her ability to work across the aisle to represent a split constituency.
Her Republican challenger, Gabe Evens, is also Latino. Evans is campaigning on his experience as a farmer and his background in law enforcement and the military, sharing how his Mexican grandfather received two Purple Hearts in the second world war.
In CD-8, “people aren’t just one-sided”, said Angel Merlos, strategic director in Colorado of the Libre Initiative, a conservative organization that mobilizes the Hispanic vote around principles of limited government. “You have to make your case as to why you want their vote.”
In a race that close, the battle for votes can be fierce. And voting rights groups have been sounding the alarm about disinformation targeting Latinos in the US. In September, the US justice department intervened in operations by Russian state media to spread disinformation about the general election to US audiences, including citizens “of Hispanic descent”.
Roughly one in five Latinos prefers to get news from social media, where misinformation has found fertile ground. The key to the potency of mis- and disinformation in 2024 is how much cheaper and easier it is for lies to proliferate on social media platforms that enhance engaging material, said Laura Zommer, CEO and co-founder of Factchequeado, a Spanish-language factchecking organization.
Spanish-language radio, too, has at times been a source of misleading and inaccurate information, repeating and reinforcing false narratives that are circulating in the wider information ecosystem. Nearly half of Latinos tune into the radio for news, and Latino immigrants are much more likely than U.S.-born Latinos to say they mainly consume news in Spanish.
A 2024 study from the Digital Democracy Institute of the Americas found that Latinos are not necessarily more vulnerable to misinformation than the rest of the population. But, the authors concluded, there is a need for culturally competent information, especially targeting more susceptible subgroups including Latinos who are Spanish-dominant and consume more broadcast news and Spanish-language media.
In CD-8, a program that compares radio recordings against thousands of factchecked statements from respected organizations identified only a few instances of potential misinformation in a week’s worth of recording nine local Spanish-language stations.

For example, on a Monday evening at the end of October on KNRV a news bulletin inaccurately stated that Donald Trump was leading in national polls by nearly 8%, when most polls that day showed Harris in the lead by nearly 2 points. The station advertises that it rents air space to a variety of programs and hosts; this evening news segment came from the Mexican radio network Radio Formula.
An ad in another news segment incorrectly cited a recent poll from the Colorado Health Foundation that asked respondents about their major concerns. The ad exaggerated how many Latino respondents expressed extreme worry about not being able to feed their families in the next year.
Disinformation uses “content that activates our ire, our grievances, sometimes an incredible hope”, said Zommer. Sometimes the goal is to persuade someone of a lie, and sometimes it can be to sow doubt and mistrust or divide people. “Many times the most successful disinformation has an element of truth and it’s taken out of context, or it has an element of truth and it’s exaggerated,” she said.
Conversations heard on the radio in CD-8 reflect heightened tensions around immigration in the local Latino community. Stacy Suniga, president of the Latino Coalition of Weld county said Latinos in her district are hearing more insults in public places like grocery stores. “I think there are issues on top of their issues, with the radical display of racism,” she said.
In some instances, the tension is between Latinos. Merlos said Latinos are complaining to Libre organizers about Venezuelan immigrants getting what they see as preferential treatment from the government. On a midday program in mid-October KNRV, a caller expressed frustration with how Denver, like Chicago and New York, had deployed city resources to help newly arrived Venezuelans. “I’m going to go with Trump although he’s not someone I consider a good person,” he said, “but I’m against Biden’s party for what he’s done at the border.”
This could be part of a misleading narrative using the arrival of Venezuelan immigrants to drive a wedge between voters. Zommer highlighted the power of “fragmenting, dividing, between whites and Latinos, but also between Latinos: Latinos living, working, paying taxes – and the new Latinos.”
Callers and guests are often a source of misleading and inaccurate claims that air on the radio. A 2021 report that analyzed disinformation about January 6 on four Spanish-language radio stations in south Florida found that hosts play an important role in contextualizing and correcting callers on the air. It’s important, as well, for stations to clearly distinguish between news segments and programs that air opinions or commentary.
On KNRV, the host immediately jumped in, correcting the caller’s belief that the southern border is “open”, explaining that Venezuelans received political asylum for the crisis happening in their country, and insisting that while it felt unfair, Latinos should not let this issue divide them.
For Zommer, this conflict is part of a wider disinformation narrative in effect updating “the big lie”, or the baseless claim that the 2020 election was stolen, for 2024: that the Biden administration has allowed for an open southern border so immigrants can cross and vote in the election. “In this new narrative of disinformation, there is no way to factcheck it because it’s what they’re saying is going to happen in the future.”

Guardian,Trump wants you to believe that the US economy is doing terribly. It’s untrue | Steven Greenhouse,"If Donald Trump wins next week’s election, it would be the first time in US history that a candidate wins based on such a huge lie – his falsehood that we have “the worst economy ever”. The former president’s big lie has distorted the views of millions of Americans, wrongly convincing many that the US economy is in bad shape.
There’s no denying that many Americans are struggling economically and that inflation was painfully high back in 2022, but inflation is far lower now, and most economists agree that our economy is strong. The unemployment rate is low, inflation is way down, economic growth is solid, and job growth has been remarkably strong. Indeed, the country has added nearly 18m jobs – a record – under the Biden-Harris administration. Not only that, median household income has climbed to $80,610, higher than it was in Trump’s last year in office.
“In the 35 years I’ve been an economist, I’ve rarely seen an economy performing as well as it is,” Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics, said recently. “I’d give it an A+.” But the US public, still upset about the surge in inflation several years ago, sees things very differently: 62% say the economy is in bad shape, while just 38% say it’s in good shape, according to an October AP-NORC poll.
The public holds this negative view even though there’s been very good news for blue-collar workers: the US has added more than 700,000 factory jobs under the Biden-Harris administration, far more than during Trump’s presidency, indeed more than under any president since the 1970s. There’s also been good news for small businesses – a record 19m new business applications have been filed under Biden. There’s also good news for the wealthy – the stock market has climbed to record levels, which is Wall Street’s way of saying the economy is in excellent shape. Let’s not forget that Trump warned that if Biden was elected president, the stock market would crash. Wrong again, Donald. Under Biden, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is 36% higher than when Trump left office, and the S&P 500 is 53% higher.
Trump’s repeated claim that today’s economy is the worst ever shows either an appalling ignorance of history or an appalling contempt for the truth. The truth is that the economy was in far worse shape during Trump’s last year in office, when the unemployment rate soared to 14.8% during the pandemic, compared with 4.1% now. Moreover, there were many other times when the economy was in worse shape – it was worse during the 2008 recession under George W Bush, far worse during the 1980-81 and 1974-75 recessions, and catastrophically worse during the Great Depression of the 1930s. When Trump tells his Maga crowds that today’s economy is the worst ever, he’s taking everyone for an idiot.
The US economy has grown the fastest among major industrial nations since the pandemic began. Our economy has grown twice as fast as Canada’s, three times as fast as France’s and Japan’s, and four times as fast as Britain’s. Under Biden, the average unemployment rate has been lower than under any president since Lyndon Johnson.
If Harris loses to Trump, historians and economists will long debate why she lost while Ronald Reagan was re-elected in a landslide in 1984 even though unemployment was far higher back then (7.2% versus 4.1% today), inflation was higher (4% versus 2.4% today), and the Federal Reserve’s interest rates were far higher (10% versus 5% today). One thing working for Reagan was that GDP growth was strong in 1984.
Don’t get me wrong, today’s economy has serious problems. Millions of Americans are struggling, but it’s wrong to blame Biden and Harris for that. I’ve been writing about America’s workers and economy for more than 40 years – from Reagan to Clinton to Trump to Biden – and under every president, millions of American have struggled economically. Trump makes believe that far more Americans are struggling now than ever before, but that’s just not true. Take this important statistic: 11.1% of Americans currently fall below the poverty line. That’s essentially the same percentage as under Trump and is only slightly above its lowest point in half a century.
Many Americans say the economy is in poor shape mainly because of their lingering dismay about the high inflation from mid-2021 to mid-2023. But they may not know that wages have risen faster than inflation over the past two years and that real wages are higher than before the pandemic. Trump blames Biden and Harris for causing inflation, but they weren’t the cause. The two main causes were the pandemic’s closing factories and disrupting supply chains worldwide and Russia’s war against Ukraine, which increased energy and food prices. Americans complain that gas prices are higher, but that’s Vladimir Putin’s and Opec’s fault, not Biden’s or Harris’s. US oil production has hit record levels.
Housing affordability remains a big problem. Not only have housing prices soared, but high interest rates – which are finally coming down – have made it far too difficult for many Americans to buy a house. Again, the housing squeeze is not Biden’s or Harris’s fault; it was caused by a huge slowdown in housing production that began during the 2008 recession.
It’s unfortunate that Trump’s dishonesty and deceit too often make us focus on his lies rather on something far more important: the future, and what a second Trump term would mean for the country. Many economists warn of disaster if Trump wins. They warn that his plan to impose tariffs or taxes on all imported goods will send inflation soaring and ignite a dangerous trade war that could cause a recession and throw millions out of work. Economists also warn that Trump’s plans, including his plan to slash taxes on the wealthy and corporations, not only will increase the federal debt by a colossal $7.8tn, but could bankrupt the social security system and lead to a 33% across-the-board cut in social security benefits.
No wonder 23 Nobel Prize-winning economists signed a recent letter calling Trump’s economic agenda “counterproductive” and warning that it “will lead to higher prices, larger deficits, and greater inequality”.
In contrast to Trump, Kamala Harris has specific plans to improve the economy and help Americans cope with high prices. She has pledged to build 3m new housing units to help bring down housing prices. She also plans to give $25,000 in down payment assistance to first-time homebuyers. To help with the high cost of raising a family, she has called for creating a $3,600 tax credit per child and $6,000 for newborns. Recognizing how expensive caregiving needs can be, she wants to create a trailblazing Medicare at Home program to help pay for care for ageing parents.
Nobel-winning economists said Harris’s economic agenda is “vastly superior” to Trump’s and “will improve our nation’s” employment opportunities, health, investment and fairness.
American voters have a clear choice. They can choose Harris’s agenda, which promises a stronger, fairer economy, or Trump’s agenda, which will bring a worse, less stable economy with higher prices and less fairness.
Unlike Trump, I’ll be honest and won’t claim that his economic agenda will bring the worst economy ever, even though his agenda looks plenty dangerous.

Guardian,"To defeat Trump, Harris must talk more about the economy | Robert Reich","I don’t know about you, but I’m feeling more anxious about the outcome of the upcoming election. I’m still nauseously optimistic, but the nausea is growing.
I’m as skeptical of polls as any of you, but when all of them show the same thing – that Kamala Harris’s campaign stalled several weeks ago, yet Donald Trump’s continues to surge – it’s important to take the polls seriously.
The US vice-president will give her closing message to the American people on Tuesday at a rally on the Ellipse on the Washington mall.
Over the last several weeks she’s focused on a woman’s right over her body and the rights of all Americans to a democracy. Obviously, Trump threatens both.
Tuesday night, though, she needs to respond forcefully to the one issue that continues to be highest on the minds of most Americans – the economy.
She must tell Americans simply and clearly why they continue to have such a hard time despite all the economic indicators to the contrary. It’s because of the power of large corporations and a handful of wealthy individuals to siphon off most economic gains for themselves.
Most Americans are outraged that they continue to struggle economically at the same time as billionaires are pulling in ever more wealth. Most know they’re paying too much for housing, gas, groceries and the medicines they need. They also know that a major cause is the market power of big corporations.
They want someone who’ll stand up to big corporations and the politicians in Washington who serve them.
They want a president who’ll be on their side. A president who will crack down on price-gouging, who will bust up the monopolies and restore competition, who will fight to cap prescription drug costs, who will get big money out of politics and stop the legalized bribery that rigs the market for the rich and who will make sure corporations pay their fair share and end tax breaks for billionaire crooks.
A president who will put working families first – before big corporations and the wealthy.
Harris needs to say she will be this president.
Her policy proposals suggest this. She’s committed to strong antitrust enforcement – cracking down on mergers and acquisitions that give big food corporations the power to jack up food and grocery prices, prosecuting price-fixing and banning price gouging. She needs to remind voters of this.
She also says she’ll raise taxes on the rich, provide $25,000 in down-payment assistance to help Americans buy their first home, restore the expanded child tax credit to $3,600 to help more than 100 million working Americans, and implement a new $6,000 tax cut to help families pay for the high costs of a child’s first year of life.
All should be parts of her speech this Tuesday about why she will be the champion of working people.
She wants to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, make stock buybacks more expensive and expand Medicare to cover home healthcare – paid for with savings from the expansion of Medicare price negotiations with drug manufacturers.
She needs to frame all of this as a response to the power of big corporations and the wealthy – and say in no uncertain terms that she’s on the side of the people, not the powerful.
If she fails to do this in her closing argument, Trump’s demagogic response will be the only one the public hears – that average working people are struggling because of undocumented workers and the “enemy within”, including Democrats, socialists, Marxists and the “deep state”.
Harris should fit her message about democracy inside this economic message. If our democracy weren’t dominated by the rich and big corporations, fewer of the economy’s gains would be siphoned off to them. Average working people would have better pay, more secure jobs, and be able to afford homes, food, fuel, medicine, childcare and eldercare.
A large portion of the public no longer thinks American democracy is working. According to a new New York Times/Siena College poll, only 45% believe our democracy does a good job representing ordinary people. An astounding 62% say the government is mostly working to benefit itself and elites rather than the common good.
In her closing argument, Harris should commit herself to reversing this, so the government works for the common good.
Harris started her campaign in July and early August by emphasizing these themes about the economy and democracy. But in more recent weeks, she’s focused on Trump’s threat to democracy. Her campaign seems to have decided that she can draw additional voters from moderate Republican suburban women upset by Trump’s role in fomenting the attack on the US Capitol.
That’s why she’s been campaigning with Liz Cheney, and gathering Republican officials as supporters. And why she has chosen to give her closing message on the Ellipse – where Trump summoned his followers to march on the Capitol on 6 January 2021.
But when she shifted gears to Trump’s attacks on democracy, Harris’s campaign stalled. I think that’s because Americans continue to focus on the economy and want an answer to why they continue to struggle economically.
If Trump gives them an answer – although baseless and demagogic – but Harris does not, he may sail to victory on 5 November.
Hence, in her closing message she must talk clearly and frankly about the misallocation of economic power in America – lodged with big corporations and the wealthy instead of average Americans – and her commitment to rectify this.

Guardian,Biden clarifies ‘garbage’ comments threatening to overshadow Harris’s message of unity – US election live,"Biden clarifies ‘garbage’ comments as Harris makes closing speech in Washington
Welcome to our ongoing coverage of the US election campaign as Kamala Harris and Donald Trump continue to make their pitches to voters with less than a week to go to election day.
Current president Joe Biden was forced to clarify comments he made on Tuesday after he was seen in an edited video clip saying “the only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters”.
He said that a pro-Trump comedian’s “hateful rhetoric” about Puerto Rico was “garbage”.
Republican politicians and rightwing media outlets quickly picked up the clip to argue that Biden had called Trump’s supporters garbage, comparing his remarks with Hillary Clinton’s labeling of half of Trump supporters as belonging in “a basket of deplorables” in 2016.
Elsewhere:
Urged by some allies to apologise for racist comments made by speakers at his weekend rally, Donald Trump took the opposite approach on Tuesday, saying it was an “honour to be involved” in such an event and calling the scene a “lovefest” – the same term he has used to describe the 6 January insurrection at the US Capitol.
Harris will spend election night at her alma mater, Howard University, in Washington, according to a person familiar with the matter. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss her campaign’s plans. If elected, Harris would be the first graduate of a historically Black university to occupy the Oval Office.
Michelle Obama took the stump in Georgia. The former first lady’s organisation When We All Vote hosted a rally for more than 2,000 people at an arena in College Park, near Atlanta’s airport – a slickly produced event that was dominated by earnest pleas to vote from a star-studded roster.
Aformer Republican congressional candidate has been charged with stealing ballots in Indiana.
Reuters reports:
A Republican former congressional candidate was charged with stealing ballots during a test of a voting system in Madison county, Indiana, state police said on Tuesday.
During the test on 3 October, which involved four voting machines and 136 candidate ballots marked for testing, officials discovered that two ballots were missing, according to the Indiana state police.
Voter fraud is rare in the United States, and courts dismissed multiple lawsuits of alleged electoral fraud brought by former president Donald Trump and some of his Republican allies who accused Democrats of stealing the 2020 election. Trump faces the Democratic vice-president, Kamala Harris, in a 5 November presidential election.
Walz says election will be close but hails Democrat ground game
Tim Walz appeared on Good Morning America, saying, “We know it’s going to be close but we’re going to win this thing.”
Speaking to host George Stephanopoulos, Walz said, “We’ve got the better ground game, we’ve got the excitement, we’ve got the momentum on our side.”
He added that his biggest concern was that “that Donald Trump has brought up a pessimism to folks, that folks don’t believe that their vote matters. Those votes do matter … Make sure you participate in this democracy. I think you’re going to see Donald Trump continue to spiral downward in this really difficult and hateful rhetoric.”
In response to Joe Biden’s “garbage” remark, Walz said, “The president’s clarified his remarks, but let’s be very clear: the vice-president and I have made it absolutely clear that we want everyone as a part of this. Donald Trump’s divisive rhetoric is what needs to end … and what I say is, there’s a place for all of us here.”
With the election just a few days away, here is what the presidential and vice-presidential candidates are going to be up to today, according to Politico:
Donald Trump will hold a rally in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, at 1pm ET then a rally in Green Bay Wisconsin at 7pm ET.
JD Vance will hold a town hall with Democrat-turned-Republican Tulsi Gabbard in Bedford, Pennsylvania at 5.30pm ET.
Kamala Harris will hold rallies in Raleigh, North Carolina, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, and Madison, Wisconsin.
Tim Walz will make appearances on Good Morning America and CBS Mornings before holding campaign events in Charlotte, Greensboro and Asheville, North Carolina.
Nikki Haley: 'not a time to have anyone criticize Puerto Rico or Latinos'
In a new interview on Fox News, Nikki Haley, a Donald Trump critic-turned ally, said now was “not a time to have anyone criticize Puerto Rico or Latinos”.
Haley, who ran against Trump earlier this year before dropping out the presidential race, added:
“You’ve got Americans who are absolutely not going to vote for Trump. And then you’ve got a percentage in the middle who like Trump’s policies but don’t like his style. That is what they need to focus on. So when you look at these things, it has got to be a story of addition. This is not a time to have anyone criticize Puerto Rico or Latinos. This is not a time for them to get overly masculine with this bromance thing that they’ve got going. 53% of the electorate are women with will vote. They care about how they’re being talked to, and they care about the issues …”
When Yadira Caraveo, a Democratic party member, won the race to represent Colorado’s eighth district in the House of Representatives in 2022, she eked out a victory, winning by the narrowest margin of any Democrat in the country. This November, Caraveo is facing yet another close race – one that could determine the balance of Congress.
In a district where nearly 40% of residents identify as Hispanic or Latino, the community will be decisive in crowning a winner. The battle for their votes is mostly playing out not on TV or in town halls, but on social media and local radio.
“[Latino voters] are listening to social media and the radio,” said Sonny Subia, Colorado’s volunteer state director for Lulac, the League of United Latin American Citizens, the largest and oldest Hispanic organization in the country …
Local newspapers are just as relevant as ever this election, as the DNC takes out attack ads.
The adverts that paint Donald Trump as “unhinged, unstable, unchecked” are running in 25 local newspapers in the seven battleground states. The papers include the Delco Times and Erie Times-News in Pennsylvania or the Macomb Daily and Northern Express in Michigan.
On of the ads takes up a full page and is plastered with Trump’s infamous mugshot snapped during his indictment on racketeering charges in Georgia. The ad calls the former president “unhinged, unstable, unchecked” and “unfit to lead”.
“In the final week of the election, Democrats are not leaving any stone unturned, reminding voters in key battleground states that their vote means the difference between chaos and revenge with Donald Trump, or a New Way Forward with Vice President Harris,” Jaime Harrison, the chair of the DNC, told the New York Times.
Donald Trump’s extremist attacks on top Democrats as “the enemy from within” and talk of deploying the military against political foes if he wins the election are stark signs Trump will endanger the rule of law in America, say former US justice department officials and scholars.
Trump’s threats – singling out ex-speaker Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff and others as “the enemy from within” and “more dangerous than China [and] Russia” – jibe with his earlier incendiary talk of using a return to the White House to seek “revenge” against political foes led by Joe Biden. He also suggested the military could be used to quell violence at the polls from “radical left lunatics”.
Those comments, along with Trump’s adamant refusal to say clearly he will accept the election results if he is defeated, prompt critics to say Trump poses unprecedented dangers to the US constitution …
Election too close to call less than a week from polling day
The latest polls show Kamala Harris enjoys a small lead over her rival Donald Trump. However, the election is still too close to call and a small margin of error could see either candidate in the White House.
The key battleground states, so named because there is no entrenched support for Democrats or Republicans and could swing either way, are Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan and North Carolina.
Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe’s controversial set continues to be used as a political football by both sides of the aisle as election night draws closer.
The joke that got everyone’s back up was when Hinchcliffe compared Puerto Rico to a floating island of garbage.
President Joe Biden said Puerto Ricans are “good, decent honorable people. The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters — his, his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American.”
Republicans seized on the president’s line, comparing it to Hilary Clinton’s “basket of deplorables,” comment during the 2016 election campaign.
Senator JD Vance of Ohio, Trump’s running mate, said: “This is disgusting. Kamala Harris and her boss Joe Biden are attacking half of the country.” Just one day earlier, Vance brushed off the Puerto Rico island-of-garbage comment, saying, “We have to stop getting so offended at every little thing in the United States of America.”
Biden backpedalled somewhat on social media: “Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage – which is the only word I can think of to describe it,” he wrote. “His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation.”
If Donald Trump wins next week’s election, it would be the first time in US history that a candidate wins based on such a huge lie – his falsehood that we have “the worst economy ever”. The former president’s Big Lie has distorted the views of millions of Americans, wrongly convincing many that the US economy is in bad shape.
There’s no denying that many Americans are struggling economically and that inflation was painfully high back in 2022, but inflation is far lower now, and most economists agree that our economy is strong. The unemployment rate is low, inflation is way down, economic growth is solid, and job growth has been remarkably strong. Indeed, the country has added nearly 18m jobs – a record – under the Biden-Harris administration. Not only that, median household income has climbed to $80,610, higher than it was in Trump’s last year in office…

Guardian,Giuliani’s book is silent on $150m award for defamation but noisy on election lies,"In a new book, Rudy Giuliani claims his extensive legal problems and those of Donald Trump are the results of persecution by “a fascist regime” run by Kamala Harris and Joe Biden – all while avoiding mention of a $150m defamation award against him won by two Georgia elections workers and repeating the lies about electoral fraud which saw him lose law licenses in New York and Washington DC.
Giuliani’s book also ignores the widely reported autocratic tendencies of Trump, which have triggered numerous warnings, including from former staffers, that he is a fascist in waiting, should he return to the White House.
The New York mayor turned Trump lawyer even avoids mention of fascistic sympathies in his own family, specifically those harbored by his mother, whose own sister-in-law said she “liked Mussolini”, the dictator who ruled Italy from 1922 to 1943.
Giuliani’s book, The Biden Crime Family: The Blueprint for their Prosecution, is released in the US on Tuesday. The book’s title betrays the reason for its delayed release – it is largely a propagandistic election-season attack on Biden, the president who stepped aside in July, amid concern that at 81 he was too old for a second term, ceding the Democratic nomination to Harris, his vice-president.
Giuliani’s book is finally released a week from election day but even he may not have foreseen it landing amid explosive debate over whether Trump is a fascist himself.
Mark Milley, formerly the chair of the joint chiefs of staff under Trump, and John Kelly, another retired general who was Trump’s second White House chief of staff, have said Trump deserves the label.
Speaking to the reporter Bob Woodward, Milley said Trump was “fascist to the core”. Last week, Vice-President Harris said: “It is clear from John Kelly’s words that Donald Trump is someone who, I quote, ‘certainly falls into the general definition of fascists’, who, in fact, vowed to be a dictator on day one and vowed to use the military as his personal militia to carry out his personal and political vendettas.”
On Sunday, outside a Madison Square Garden Trump event many observers compared to a Nazi rally at the same New York venue in 1939, Giuliani told reporters Trump was “the furthest from a fascist imaginable”.
On the page, Giuliani’s case against Biden is undercut by omission of inconvenient details – as in the passage in which he complains of persecution by a “fascist regime”.
“They … have sued me, sent me to bankruptcy court, and tried to force me to sell my homes,” Giuliani writes – not mentioning that such dire financial straits are the result of being ordered to pay around $150m for defaming Shaye Moss and Ruby Freeman, the Georgia elections workers, while pushing Trump’s lie about voter fraud in the 2020 election. This week, Giuliani was ordered to give the women control of his New York apartment, his Mercedes-Benz, several luxury watches and other assets.
Giuliani was disbarred in Washington DC and New York. Claiming such moves were politically motivated, he nonsensically claims: “I have never been disciplined by the bar association and my record is unblemished.” His legal troubles, he insists, are the result of being “but one” political opponent of Biden and Harris.
“They’ve indicted and attempted to disbar legal friends and colleagues like John Eastman and Jeffrey Clark for their work on trying to correct the stolen election results,” Giuliani writes, of disgraced lawyers who also worked on Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election.
“Others, like [Trump advisers] Peter Navarro and Steve Bannon, actually had to serve four months in federal prisons for misdemeanor of contempt of Congress – while their cases were on appeal!”
Bannon, Trump’s former campaign chair and White House strategist, was released from prison in Connecticut on Tuesday. He provides a short introduction for Giuliani’s book.
Giuliani also cites court cases involving “a Florida social media influencer … arrested by eight FBI and other law enforcement agents for the ‘crime’ of posting memes mocking Hillary Clinton supporters on Twitter” and a “75-year-old grandmother with a medical condition sentenced to jail for two years for protesting outside an abortion center”.
“These are the actions of a fascist regime,” Giuliani writes, adding, “So is the lawfare leveled against President Donald J Trump”, in reference to 88 criminal charges, 34 having produced guilty verdicts regarding hush-money payments, the rest remaining outstanding as election day nears.
Giuliani does admit in his book to having “some criminal issues in my family background” – namely his father’s 1930s conviction and prison time for robbery, an uncle’s work as a loan shark, and a cousin who “turned out to be head of an auto-theft ring and died in a shootout with the FBI”. Such ties are well known but tellingly, in light of his accusation of “fascist” behavior by Biden and Harris, Giuliani chooses not to mention another famous family detail: his mother’s liking for Mussolini.
In 2000, the Village Voice published an examination of Giuliani’s family background by Wayne Barrett, the legendary New York investigative journalist. Entitled Thug Life, the extract from Barrett’s biography of the then New York mayor told the story of Giuliani’s criminal father, including his work as a mafia enforcer. But Barrett also described conversations around the dinner table during the second world war.
“The fact that their homeland was an Axis country did not diminish Helen Giuliani’s sense of patriotism,” Barrett wrote of the future mayor’s mother. “‘Helen was a little sticking up for the Italians, a little on the Italian side,’ recalled Anna, Rudy Giuliani’s aunt.
“‘She liked Mussolini and things like that.’”",2024-10-29
Guardian,"No, Trump is not a fascist. But that doesn’t make him any less dangerous | Jan-Werner Mueller","Trump’s former chief of staff has just confirmed the ex-president is a fascist. The former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff went on record saying the ex-president is a fascist. Historians of the highest stature say he’s a fascist – shouldn’t all this be enough to settle what has come to be known in the US as “The Fascism Debate” – a debate that has long been acrimonious and surprisingly personal?
There’s no disagreement among the participants in this debate that Trump must be stopped. Any yet disputes around the F-word have made leftists and liberals assemble in a circular firing squad. Those using the fascism analogy have found themselves attacked for ignoring that all was not well with US politics before 2016; those refusing historical parallels are faulted for complacency. Yet it is perfectly possible to find the label fascism inappropriate (and possibly counterproductive), without in any way minimizing the dangers Trump poses, or turning a blind eye to fascist strands in US history, such as the KKK.
Fascism is a form of authoritarianism, but not all authoritarians are fascists. Fascists have a transformative political project: to create a homogeneous people devoted to a messianic leader and to mobilize society for the sake of violent racial conflict. By contrast, monarchs or technocratic authoritarians – think of military dictatorships in Latin America – can be perfectly self-effacing: Europe’s longest-lasting dictatorship during the 20th century was headed by a decidedly uncharismatic Portuguese economist, António Salazar. Fascists, on the other hand, base their legitimacy on popular acclamation: they celebrate mass rallies and create a spectacle of power.
So far so Trumpist, it would seem: the cult of personality administered at large rallies; the increasingly open racism which singles out Trump’s supporters as “the real people” – an expression Trump used as he incited his fanatical followers at the Ellipse on January 6. But a collective project centered on violence? Not quite. To be sure, Trump couldn’t be prouder of the Proud Boys; add to that the militarization of civilian life, driven by a supreme court endlessly creative in inventing 18th-century traditions to justify the proliferation of arms. What’s more, Kevin Roberts, head of the Heritage Foundation, today’s leading Trumpist thinktank, has promised a “second American revolution” which, Roberts clarified, “will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be” – as clear a threat of violence as one can imagine. Yet all this is still not the same as fascist leaders glorifying mortal combat as the ultimate meaning of life.
It is not an accident that all fascist movements emerged from the experience of violence during the first world war (Mussolini preached that the conflagration had created a “trenchocracy”, an aristocracy of warriors); and it is not an accident that all fascist states eventually went to war – which is also why losing in war dealt such a blow to fascist ideology after 1945: how could hardened fascist men have possibly been defeated by the flabby plutocracies in the west?
Trump has not exactly proved a warmonger. True, his incitement of violence inside the country isn’t just kayfabe, and plans to use the military for mass deportations are reminiscent of horrendous 20th-century experiences of ethnic cleansing, while using the military against domestic enemies recalls the practices of Latin American generals. What’s more, the promise to make American Men Great Again very much aligns with an idealization of masculinity that would have been instantly recognizable to 20th-century fascists.
And yet Trump is also both product and promoter of a consumer capitalism that seeks to demobilize people politically. It’s hard to see that young people today would find the idea of marching around in uniforms the essence of the good life; Trump’s promise to his “real people” – from the rural folks of the supposed “heartland” to lily-white suburbs – is precisely that they don’t need to make sacrifices. His former chief of staff reports that Trump, visiting Arlington, claimed not to see the point of dying in war. But no real fascist leader would have denied that heroic death in combat had meaning.
So should we just relax? Absolutely not. Trump is similar to far-right populists like Narendra Modi and Viktor Orbán who claim uniquely to represent the people, who delegitimize their political opponents as traitors, and who incite hatred against already vulnerable minorities. Such a strategy has authoritarian consequences; those in turn enable crony capitalism, or outright kleptocracy, which has been crucial for the consolidation of regimes like Orbán’s.
Here’s a lesson that is more useful than the general analogy with fascism. Contrary to the liberal tendency to blame political ills on the supposedly irrational people, it is elites who decide that they are done with democracy. The parallel with the Weimar Republic is usually deployed to suggest that majorities elect fascists. But Hitler was handed power by old Prussian and industrial elites for whom he might not have been the ideal chancellor, but good enough in the face of communism. Fascists marched on Rome in 1922, but Mussolini arrived comfortably by sleeper car from Milan, as traditional Italian elites had invited him to govern.
Trump has a real movement, but, as Hannah Arendt recognized when diagnosing a peculiar 20th-century alliance between what she called the “mob” and elites, a movement is not enough. American billionaires and CEOs have been falling over themselves to support a candidate who promises to lower taxes and deregulate like crazy; supreme court justices have pre-approved an authoritarian playbook with their grant of presidential immunity. Calling this fascism isn’t particularly illuminating; but withholding the F-word does not make the prospect of Trump’s second coming any less dangerous for the US and, in fact, the world as a whole.

Guardian,Therapy-speak and 80s hairstyles: will Harris’s Brené Brown sit-down swing white female voters?,"In the quest to win over white female voters – 53% of whom showed up for Donald Trump in 2020 – Kamala Harris made her case on a podcast hosted by one of their beloved avatars, the vulnerability researcher Brené Brown. The episode, released on Monday, was a mostly fluffy discussion about leadership, trauma and the notion of voting as agency in an uncontrollable news cycle.
Brown, a University of Houston professor and bestselling author who has spent two decades studying social sciences, became an overnight celebrity after giving a 2010 Ted Talk called “the power of vulnerability”. One could argue the talk, which birthed Brown’s Oprah-approved speaking empire, also spawned our culture’s current obsession with therapy-speak.
Brown’s mottos, such as “courage over comfort” and “what we know matters, but who we are matters more”, align with Harris’s oft-maligned tendency toward a self-help speaking style and vibes-only posturing. Brown’s podcast, Unlocking Us, leads the relationship genre on Apple Podcasts. The vice-president’s campaign might have also hoped that an endorsement from Brown, a 58-year-old church-going Texan, will swing undecided white female voters – a crucial demographic that would help shore up Harris’s record support among women and counterbalance Trump’s popularity with men.
That’s not to say Brown’s own politics are inscrutable: she reportedly donated to the White Women for Kamala Harris fundraiser, and she kicked off the episode by declaring herself an “unapologetic Harris/Walz supporter”. Thus began an hour-long chat about “courageous leadership”.
Harris spoke about the importance of family and friends as a support system for leaders. She spoke lovingly of her mother, a late cancer researcher, and of her lifelong girlfriends whom she considers just as valuable, if not more so, than romantic partners – a line that probably resonated with gen Z women, who increasingly prioritize platonic relationships, and the many older women who are learning to live alone. When asked about her two biggest values in a leader, Harris called out “fairness and justice”. “That’s so powerful,” Brown cooed back.
With just a week to go before election day, as she struggles to communicate policy issues with voters, Harris cycled through her greatest hits. While speaking on reproductive rights, she said she was the first sitting vice-president to have visited an abortion clinic. She imagined Trump in the Oval Office on the first day of his second presidency drafting an “enemies list”, unlike the “to-do list” she would be looking at – he’ll stew while she gets to work. In this vein, much of the conversation focused on fear of another Trump presidency. Using a favorite therapy buzzword, Harris said Americans were “traumatized” by the “cruelty” of Trump’s Maga movement. “Trauma blunts our senses,” and voting blue was a way to take back some of the power, she said.
Harris seems to genuinely enjoy speaking to people in these lower-stakes, conversational formats, and some of her standout bits with Brown appeared off the cuff. We learned that her college nickname was “C Cubed”, which stood for “cool, calm and collected”. And despite having what Brown described as a “Depeche Mode haircut” in her 20s (a closely cropped, asymmetrical look), Harris said she was never big on the goth sound – though her husband, Doug Emhoff, loves the group.
Except for the two women’s emphatic support of abortion rights, the chat came off as cozy and largely apolitical. That tactic could play well with Unlocking Us listeners, who probably come to Brown’s lovey-dovey podcast as an escape from the hyper-partisan news cycle. Harris seemed, if not the candidate you want to have a beer with, then the pleasant-enough person sitting next to you at an airport bar sipping on a glass of chardonnay.
Positioned against Trump’s macho posturing, which reached an apex this weekend with an appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast and the racist Madison Square Garden bonanza, Brown’s interview with Harris was like a cardigan on the first day of fall. And we know how much white women love fall.",2024-10-28
Guardian,Many Republicans take a tough line on China despite their own business ties to Beijing,"In testimony to Congress last year, David McCormick, now the Republican candidate for US Senate in Pennsylvania, said that as CEO of Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge fund in the world, he “held deep reservations” about “the moral and patriotic hazards of doing business in China”.
As CNN reported, between 2017 and 2021, such qualms did not stop McCormick overseeing an increase in Bridgewater’s Chinese holdings from $1.6m to $1.77bn. Nor, according to Bloomberg, did Bridgewater flinch from significant investments in companies that supply the Chinese military. It has also been reported that McCormick oversaw investment in a Chinese fentanyl producer and, as HuffPost put it, “profited from China trade policies he helped shape” as a deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs under George W Bush.
Denying wrongdoing, McCormick throws claims of hypocrisy back at his opponent, the incumbent Democrat Bob Casey, over his own investment links to companies from China and other countries.
As election day nears, with Senate control up for grabs in such battleground state races, both parties are seeking to emphasize China’s threat to the US economy and national security. But a review of reporting and documentation reveals many other Republicans taking a tough line on China despite their own business and investment links to Beijing.
In Wisconsin, Eric Hovde, a banker, has said that if he was in the Senate, “I’d be very focused on what China is doing and why we are allowing them to come to our communities and buy up our land, especially around military bases.” He has also accused his opponent, Tammy Baldwin, of failing to address a fentanyl addiction crisis fueled by Chinese imports.
According to the Daily Beast, before entering politics, Hovde’s family tried to launch an investment vehicle in China. A spokesperson for Hovde insisted he was not involved.
In Michigan, the former US House intelligence committee chair Mike Rogers says he was “among the first to sound the alarm on the economic and national security danger posed by China” – while the Detroit News reports that Rogers and his wife “have gained hundreds of thousands of dollars in wealth through companies that have partnered with Chinese firms”. Heartland Signal has highlighted Rogers’ ties with Nokia, a Finnish telecoms firm that “has conducted extensive business deals with Chinese tech companies like Huawei”, which is subject to US sanctions.
Rogers denies wrongdoing – and attacks his opponent for a Senate seat, congresswoman Elissa Slotkin, alleging she signed an NDA concerning a planned electric vehicle battery plant in Big Rapids to be built by a company connected to the Chinese Communist party. Slotkin denies that, and says she “worked to bring manufacturing back to the United States” while Rogers “supported trade deal after trade deal – including Nafta – that helped ship jobs to places like China”.
Meanwhile, Montana is no Rust-belt battleground but it is a rare Republican-dominated state represented by a Democrat in a Senate split 51-49. The Republican candidate, the US Navy Seal turned businessperson Tim Sheehy, has called for the US to “get tough” on China while attacking the incumbent, Jon Tester, as “weak” on the issue.
Last December, HuffPost reported that Sheehy “sold off shares in the Chinese tech giant Tencent, earning between $200 and $1,000 in dividends, according to his Senate campaign financial disclosure”. The same report said Sheehy maintained significant investments with financial institutions with “deep ties to China”.
Sheehy responded by attacking Tester for getting “six times richer as a career politician hobnobbing with lobbyists in Washington for nearly two decades”. Sheehy’s own wealth comes from Bridger Aerospace, a company dedicated to fighting forest fires. Heartland Signal reported that Sheehy “endorsed and attempted to utilize Chinese drones built by a company which was sanctioned by two administrations for leaking American data to the Chinese Communist Party”. Sheehy did not comment.
In Ohio, where the Democrat Sherrod Brown is seeking to keep his seat, China is an issue too, if over thousands rather than millions of dollars. The Republican candidate, auto salesperson Bernie Moreno, has claimed to have refused to sell a Chinese-made SUV. Spectrum News showed that Moreno did sell such vehicles. A spokesperson said Moreno stopped selling them after a local plant closed down.
And in Florida, Democrats dream of defeating Rick Scott, the former healthcare executive and governor who won his seat narrowly in 2018. Earlier this year, Mother Jones reported that though Scott has urged voters to “stop buying [Chinese] stuff[,] stop helping them[,] stop investing in China”, because “you don’t do business with your enemies,” he “has a long record of supporting Chinese investment in the United States and personally making money off Chinese commerce”.
The magazine laid out such links. A Scott spokesperson attacked the outlet and said the senator would be “happy to put his record up against” Democrats “pushing [Joe] Biden’s pro-China agenda”.
The Guardian asked the National Republican Senatorial Committee for comment about Republican candidates voicing bellicose campaign rhetoric about China despite reported ties to Beijing. It did not reply.",2024-10-28
Guardian,Were you better off four years ago? Seven US voters weigh their options,"This story is co-published with and supported by the journalism non-profit the Economic Hardship Reporting Project
This election may well come down to one critical question: whether voters feel like they are better off now than they were four years ago. Although experts say important economic metrics are doing well or trending in a positive direction, some Americans may not feel it when they stress about their tight budget.
Like many Americans, I’ve experienced my share of financial challenges. At the end of last year, a contract gig I’d had for five years – one that represented more than half my income – suddenly ended due to lack of funding. During the past year, other members of my household experienced a job loss or significant reduction in their work hours.
Our household income is now roughly 25% of what it was two years ago. We survive on much less, with each dollar stretched thin as we’re feeling the impact of rising interest rates and the rapidly increasing cost of essentials like groceries.
Much of this can be linked to the pandemic. Almost everything we buy is more expensive – in large part due to corporate greed. Businesses, including grocery stores, that hiked their prices during the pandemic kept them high. Layoffs are happening everywhere as companies that received pandemic-related assistance like Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans – which in some cases required them to maintain staffing levels – seem to have reached a point where they feel comfortable reducing their workforce.
With the aftermath of economic uncertainty still hanging over the country, I reached out to voters to see how their financial situations will influence their decision this election.
Sa’iyda Shabazz, 38
Location: Los Angeles, California
Occupation: digital media editor/creator
Household: lives with wife, 44, and son, 11
Shabazz has become adept at financial juggling. Her total annual household income is less than $70,000 – which doesn’t go far in an area with a high cost of living. “Rent is almost $4,000 a month not counting utilities,” she says. Groceries are the family’s other biggest expense. “We spend easily $300-$400 a month for a family of three that includes a growing boy who likes fruit. Everything has gotten more expensive. Groceries, gas, rents.”
Shabazz works in digital media, and says: “My opportunities to work have slowed considerably, which has majorly impacted my ability to make money and stay above water when it comes to affording life. We try to tighten the purse strings, but there aren’t any to tighten.”
Shabazz plans to vote for Kamala Harris, saying: “As a low-income person, I can’t fathom voting for Trump, whose solution to current economic issues is to make other countries pay for our problems. I’m definitely paying attention to the Harris campaign’s stances on inflation, price gouging, and how she plans to handle things like grocery prices and gas prices …
“I really hope that they look into the astronomical rise in housing costs. Housing eats up so much of our monthly finances, and there’s no reason for it.”
Melanie Sparks, 49
Location: Lexington, Kentucky
Occupation: small-business owner
Household: lives with husband, 56, and daughter, 13.
Sparks, who describes her income as lower-middle to middle class, says her mortgage is her largest expense – currently almost $1,800 including the loan, home insurance and property taxes: “The payment has steadily increased every year since we bought it in 2020.” The family’s second-largest expense is food, including groceries and restaurants, which in total costs $1,200-$1,500 in a typical month.
Then there are unpredictable expenses, like needing new tires or her dogs getting sick. Sparks says her business isn’t doing as well as it was a few years ago, and revenue has dropped by 20-30%: “Just about every expense has gone up, from the mortgage increasing $90 a month this summer, to the propane budget plan going up $50 a month. Car insurance is up; food costs are up; interest rates on my credit card debt went up. …
“It feels like I’m drowning … We are one crisis away from going broke.”
Sparks’ biggest concern this election is the economy, but she isn’t excited about the choices. “Frankly, I’m sick of the arguing and pettiness from both parties and wish we had a viable third party. I’m not confident in either candidate at this point. And I’m anxious about what will happen after the election, regardless of who wins,” she says.
Anne Marsh
Location: North Carolina
Occupation: nanny
Anne Marsh recently moved from Texas to North Carolina with the family she nannies for, receiving a 20% raise from last year. “In 2020, when Biden/Harris were elected, I was ‘temporarily retired’ (read: unemployed), but I had a healthy inheritance to live on, thanks to my aunt and uncle,” she said. Since then, she said, prices have increased around her but she’s been using loyalty cards and other discounts to make do.
There’s no doubt in Marsh’s mind about whom to support in this election. “I’m a die-hard Harris voter,” Marsh says, noting she would have voted for Biden if he had stayed in the race. “I think the president has done an incredible job of pulling us out of some of the debt that [Trump] incurred, as well as ensuring that unemployment and job growth have gone in the right directions and getting us through most of Covid without requiring us to drink bleach or use lights on our insides.”
Marsh is also basing her vote on the reproductive health issues, saying: “Most of all, I’m voting for Harris and Walz because they’re actual human beings with sympathy and empathy and consideration for others, unlike their opposition.”
Leigh Shulman, 52
Location: Argentina, but votes as a Georgia overseas voter
Occupation: author and writing mentor
Household: lives with husband, 52, and son, 10. Also has a daughter, 20, who is away at college
Shulman, who describes her household income as upper middle-class, says her family is doing better financially than during the last year of the Trump administration: “My financial situation is better now than it was four years ago. Our investments have gone up quite a bit. I live in Argentina, where the dollar goes farther, and while inflation here has been awful, the dollar rate to peso rate means we don’t pay more for things than we did four years ago.”
How does their financial situation affect her vote? “Not at all,” she says. “I’d vote for Kamala over Trump any day. To be honest, the idea of having Trump back in the White House is horrifying. He was so much worse than I thought he’d be the first time around. I can’t imagine what he’ll do this time. But this isn’t a hold-your-nose-and-vote situation for me, though. I’m actually happy to vote for Kamala. The main issues for me are women’s rights and education. Healthcare comes a close second, too. As an educator, I believe a leader who doesn’t support education wants an uneducated populace who won’t push back.”
Deseri Eaton, 35
Location: Marin county, California
Household: single mother to a 10-year-old son
Occupation: sporadic gig work; currently looking for a job
Deseri Eaton and her son are surviving on $1,000–$1,300 per month, mostly income she earns from house-sitting and pet-sitting. Her largest expense is her car payment of nearly $600 (car insurance is about another $200), and her son’s school tuition, along with utility expenses, credit cards and essentials like her son’s braces.
“The thing that had the biggest impact was not getting into my master’s program. Leaving me jobless and relying on a stipend I didn’t receive. Also, not getting the free [guaranteed income] pilot money any more,” she says. Eaton had been participating in Marin county’s guaranteed income pilot program, which ended this spring: “I’m trying to get a job. Working my business as much as I can. And might surrender my vehicle, which is the biggest bill right now.”
Eaton says she is currently unsure who she will vote for – with so much of her time and energy focused on basic survival, she hasn’t watched any of the debates.
Jaclyn Cirinna, 26
Location: Florida
Occupation: youth and juvenile justice advocate
Household: lives alone
“The past four years have been a roller coaster, professionally and personally,” Cirinna says. She has worked most recently for a non-profit focused on justice and is pursuing full-time entrepreneurship.
“Being my boss allows me to have more flexibility and control over my job security and accommodates my current health needs due to a car accident,” she says. “I moved from Massachusetts to Florida to try and reduce my cost of living, but Florida feels just as expensive.”
She says many issues matter to her in this election, saying: “As a woman in her peak childbearing years, I like that Kamala Harris has made reproductive rights a central part of her campaign.” The economy and cost of living are important to her, too, especially in the wake of her recent layoff and health issues that limit the types of work she can do.
“I like that VP Harris supports small businesses. I want to hear more about her strategy. Trump constantly talks about fighting inflation and making America affordable, but at what cost? I do not necessarily have faith in his ability to complete this promise. He wants to fix inflation by reducing the rights of immigrants. I do not support this. In general, I wish that both candidates talked about issues that impact everyone – I want community solutions at the forefront, not just for specific Americans. Such as inflation, gas prices, housing accessibility and affordability, food costs, it’s all connected!”
Ned Barnett, 73
Location: Nevada
Occupation: freelance writer and writing consultant
Household: lives with wife
Ned Barnett says his income would probably be considered middle-class. “My wife and I live on social security, plus any gig work we can do,” he says. “She is a highly skilled book editor, and is currently editing a novel. I am a freelance writer and a consultant to other writers, and the money we bring in covers what social security doesn’t, but our income varies.”
Barnett says one core issue is very important to him in this election: “With the economy what it is, including rent, we are definitely planning to vote with our wallets.” He notes that the presidential race “has been back and forth, but I think Trump is moving into the lead – not because he’s tamed his wild-man tweets and comments, but because my memory allows me to remember what the economy (and our lifestyle) was four years ago, versus what it is today.
“When Trump was president before, our economy boomed. Now, not so much.”
Barnett said he didn’t vote for Trump in 2016. “His bombast outweighed his sensible (to us) policy predictions, his tough stance internationally, and all the rest. But he’s a boor. However, we don’t like Hillary, so we voted independent. We knew it was a wasted vote, but we believe in voting. But in 2020, we’d begun to realize that there was more to Trump than Truth Social – his policies worked, the economy worked, and we got by without me having to work more than part time. Now, four years on, we can’t afford even our reduced lifestyle, and want Trump and his ‘magic wand’ back to turn things around.”",2024-10-30
Guardian,‘He’s lying’: Ohio Senate candidate blames staffers and family for errors,"Bernie Moreno, the Republican candidate for US Senate in Ohio, came to the US from Colombia at the age of four. He has said he learned English through Ronald Reagan’s speeches. That claim has been questioned, but if Moreno did learn the language that way, it seems one famous speech may not have fully sunk in.
At the Republican convention in 1968, Reagan said: “It is time to restore the American precept that each individual is accountable for his actions.”
Throughout a tight race – in which defeat for Sherrod Brown, the incumbent Democrat, could decide control of the Senate – Moreno has displayed a distinctly un-Reaganlike tendency to dodge responsibility for questions about his own actions, choosing repeatedly to blame others instead, a review of reporting and court documents shows.
Last month, after Moreno was shown to have falsely claimed to hold an MBA from the University of Michigan, including signing legal documents containing the claim, his campaign blamed “a staffer who made a mistake”.
Moreno told a radio host: “I’m proud that I got a bachelor’s of business administration, and I thank some of the reporting pointing out that it was with high distinction. There was a clerical error made by one of my admins, seven, eight, nine years ago, that put that I had an MBA. It was a BBA.”
Moreno may have been right that his opponents “want[ed] a headline” on the issue but he also claimed they wanted “to confuse people, say, this guy lied by going to college. Absolutely not.”
That is not what Democrats say. Bill DeMora, an Ohio state senator, said: “The new reports that prove he is lying about having an MBA from that school up north are disqualifying. Anyone who lies about having a made-up-business degree from Michigan has no business representing Ohioans.”
The episode of the phantom MBA is not the only one in which Moreno has blamed others for alleged missteps.
Also in September, as Brown faced reporting about his late payment of property taxes, Politico reported that “a trust belonging in part to the wealthy Republican Senate candidate [Moreno] was more than a year late on paying a $20,000 tax bill on a house that it owns” in Key Largo, Florida, “leading to the issuance of a lien in June 2023”.
The debt was paid the day of the report, Politico said. A spokesperson for Moreno said the error was not his fault.
“Bernie does not manage the finances related to the house,” Reagan McCarthy said. “One of his siblings does and it was an unfortunate oversight.”
Nor have such moments been confined to the general election campaign. Similar issues affected Moreno during the Republican primary, which he won in May, Donald Trump’s coveted endorsement propelling him past what the Associated Press called “more moderate alternatives”.
In January, multiple outlets reported a Massachusetts case from 2017 in which Moreno was sued for non-payment of overtime at his auto company. According to court records, a judge said Moreno “either did not retain or shredded … monthly reports” that he “knew or should have known” he was required to keep. Ultimately, a jury found Moreno liable for withholding wages and ordered him to pay $416,160 in damages.
Primary opponents raised the issue. Moreno claimed political bias, calling the jury in the case “ridiculous” and the judge “a Harvard elitist lunatic”. The judge in question was appointed by Republicans.
Moreno also blamed the plaintiffs, whom he called “two of my worst salespeople, the guys that never even showed up on time, who didn’t punch in or punch out, who had no proof that they worked overtime”, and blamed the overtime pay issue on a staff member who he said “actually managed payroll”. In court, the staffer testified that she had not been responsible for such matters.
More luridly, back in March, the AP reported that Moreno, who it said had “shifted from a public supporter of LGBTQ+ rights to a hardline opponent” was “confronting questions about the existence of a 2008 profile seeking ‘Men for 1-on-1 sex’ on a casual sexual encounters website called Adult Friend Finder”.
Moreno’s lawyer said the candidate was not behind the account, and provided a statement in which a former Moreno intern, Dan Ricci, said he created the account as “a juvenile prank”.
Contacted for comment, Moreno’s spokesperson did not immediately respond.",2024-10-21
Guardian,2024 US presidential polls tracker: Trump v Harris latest national averages,"On 21 July, Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Kamala Harris. This historic move changed the landscape of the election and how many felt about the race. As the election enters its final weeks, Guardian US is averaging national and state polls to see how the two candidates are faring. We will update our averages once a week, or more if there is major news.
Latest analysis: Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are locked in a nail-bitingly close US presidential election race. Harris maintains a single point advantage over her Republican rival.
The mood between the camps for the two candidates, though, are jarringly different, despite the coin-toss chance. Taken at face value, the figures are no disaster for Harris and hardly represent a triumph for Trump. If they match the outcome on 5 November, Harris will win a majority of votes in the electoral college.

Notes on data
To calculate our polling averages, Guardian US took a combination of head-to-head and multi-candidate polls and calculated a rolling 10-day average for each candidate. Our tracker uses polls gathered by 538 and filters out lower-quality pollsters for national polls. Our state polling averages use a lower quality threshold for inclusion due to the small numbers of state polls. If there were no polls over the the 10-day period, we leave the average blank. On 11 Oct Guardian US began rounding averages to the nearest whole number to better reflect the lack of certainty in the polling figures.
Polling averages capture how the race stands at a particular moment in time and are likely to change as the election gets closer. Averages from states with small numbers of polls are also more susceptible to errors and biases. Our averages are an estimate of the support that the candidates have in key swing states and on the national stage. The election is decided by the electoral college, so these averages should not be taken as a likelihood of winning the election in November.

Guardian,"To defeat Trump, Harris must talk more about the economy | Robert Reich","I don’t know about you, but I’m feeling more anxious about the outcome of the upcoming election. I’m still nauseously optimistic, but the nausea is growing.
I’m as skeptical of polls as any of you, but when all of them show the same thing – that Kamala Harris’s campaign stalled several weeks ago, yet Donald Trump’s continues to surge – it’s important to take the polls seriously.
The US vice-president will give her closing message to the American people on Tuesday at a rally on the Ellipse on the Washington mall.
Over the last several weeks she’s focused on a woman’s right over her body and the rights of all Americans to a democracy. Obviously, Trump threatens both.
Tuesday night, though, she needs to respond forcefully to the one issue that continues to be highest on the minds of most Americans – the economy.
She must tell Americans simply and clearly why they continue to have such a hard time despite all the economic indicators to the contrary. It’s because of the power of large corporations and a handful of wealthy individuals to siphon off most economic gains for themselves.
Most Americans are outraged that they continue to struggle economically at the same time as billionaires are pulling in ever more wealth. Most know they’re paying too much for housing, gas, groceries and the medicines they need. They also know that a major cause is the market power of big corporations.
They want someone who’ll stand up to big corporations and the politicians in Washington who serve them.
They want a president who’ll be on their side. A president who will crack down on price-gouging, who will bust up the monopolies and restore competition, who will fight to cap prescription drug costs, who will get big money out of politics and stop the legalized bribery that rigs the market for the rich and who will make sure corporations pay their fair share and end tax breaks for billionaire crooks.
A president who will put working families first – before big corporations and the wealthy.
Harris needs to say she will be this president.
Her policy proposals suggest this. She’s committed to strong antitrust enforcement – cracking down on mergers and acquisitions that give big food corporations the power to jack up food and grocery prices, prosecuting price-fixing and banning price gouging. She needs to remind voters of this.
She also says she’ll raise taxes on the rich, provide $25,000 in down-payment assistance to help Americans buy their first home, restore the expanded child tax credit to $3,600 to help more than 100 million working Americans, and implement a new $6,000 tax cut to help families pay for the high costs of a child’s first year of life.
All should be parts of her speech this Tuesday about why she will be the champion of working people.
She wants to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, make stock buybacks more expensive and expand Medicare to cover home healthcare – paid for with savings from the expansion of Medicare price negotiations with drug manufacturers.
She needs to frame all of this as a response to the power of big corporations and the wealthy – and say in no uncertain terms that she’s on the side of the people, not the powerful.
If she fails to do this in her closing argument, Trump’s demagogic response will be the only one the public hears – that average working people are struggling because of undocumented workers and the “enemy within”, including Democrats, socialists, Marxists and the “deep state”.
Harris should fit her message about democracy inside this economic message. If our democracy weren’t dominated by the rich and big corporations, fewer of the economy’s gains would be siphoned off to them. Average working people would have better pay, more secure jobs, and be able to afford homes, food, fuel, medicine, childcare and eldercare.
A large portion of the public no longer thinks American democracy is working. According to a new New York Times/Siena College poll, only 45% believe our democracy does a good job representing ordinary people. An astounding 62% say the government is mostly working to benefit itself and elites rather than the common good.
In her closing argument, Harris should commit herself to reversing this, so the government works for the common good.
Harris started her campaign in July and early August by emphasizing these themes about the economy and democracy. But in more recent weeks, she’s focused on Trump’s threat to democracy. Her campaign seems to have decided that she can draw additional voters from moderate Republican suburban women upset by Trump’s role in fomenting the attack on the US Capitol.
That’s why she’s been campaigning with Liz Cheney, and gathering Republican officials as supporters. And why she has chosen to give her closing message on the Ellipse – where Trump summoned his followers to march on the Capitol on 6 January 2021.
But when she shifted gears to Trump’s attacks on democracy, Harris’s campaign stalled. I think that’s because Americans continue to focus on the economy and want an answer to why they continue to struggle economically.
If Trump gives them an answer – although baseless and demagogic – but Harris does not, he may sail to victory on 5 November.
Hence, in her closing message she must talk clearly and frankly about the misallocation of economic power in America – lodged with big corporations and the wealthy instead of average Americans – and her commitment to rectify this.

Guardian,"No, Trump is not a fascist. But that doesn’t make him any less dangerous | Jan-Werner Mueller","Trump’s former chief of staff has just confirmed the ex-president is a fascist. The former chairman of the joint chiefs of staff went on record saying the ex-president is a fascist. Historians of the highest stature say he’s a fascist – shouldn’t all this be enough to settle what has come to be known in the US as “The Fascism Debate” – a debate that has long been acrimonious and surprisingly personal?
There’s no disagreement among the participants in this debate that Trump must be stopped. Any yet disputes around the F-word have made leftists and liberals assemble in a circular firing squad. Those using the fascism analogy have found themselves attacked for ignoring that all was not well with US politics before 2016; those refusing historical parallels are faulted for complacency. Yet it is perfectly possible to find the label fascism inappropriate (and possibly counterproductive), without in any way minimizing the dangers Trump poses, or turning a blind eye to fascist strands in US history, such as the KKK.
Fascism is a form of authoritarianism, but not all authoritarians are fascists. Fascists have a transformative political project: to create a homogeneous people devoted to a messianic leader and to mobilize society for the sake of violent racial conflict. By contrast, monarchs or technocratic authoritarians – think of military dictatorships in Latin America – can be perfectly self-effacing: Europe’s longest-lasting dictatorship during the 20th century was headed by a decidedly uncharismatic Portuguese economist, António Salazar. Fascists, on the other hand, base their legitimacy on popular acclamation: they celebrate mass rallies and create a spectacle of power.
So far so Trumpist, it would seem: the cult of personality administered at large rallies; the increasingly open racism which singles out Trump’s supporters as “the real people” – an expression Trump used as he incited his fanatical followers at the Ellipse on January 6. But a collective project centered on violence? Not quite. To be sure, Trump couldn’t be prouder of the Proud Boys; add to that the militarization of civilian life, driven by a supreme court endlessly creative in inventing 18th-century traditions to justify the proliferation of arms. What’s more, Kevin Roberts, head of the Heritage Foundation, today’s leading Trumpist thinktank, has promised a “second American revolution” which, Roberts clarified, “will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be” – as clear a threat of violence as one can imagine. Yet all this is still not the same as fascist leaders glorifying mortal combat as the ultimate meaning of life.
It is not an accident that all fascist movements emerged from the experience of violence during the first world war (Mussolini preached that the conflagration had created a “trenchocracy”, an aristocracy of warriors); and it is not an accident that all fascist states eventually went to war – which is also why losing in war dealt such a blow to fascist ideology after 1945: how could hardened fascist men have possibly been defeated by the flabby plutocracies in the west?
Trump has not exactly proved a warmonger. True, his incitement of violence inside the country isn’t just kayfabe, and plans to use the military for mass deportations are reminiscent of horrendous 20th-century experiences of ethnic cleansing, while using the military against domestic enemies recalls the practices of Latin American generals. What’s more, the promise to make American Men Great Again very much aligns with an idealization of masculinity that would have been instantly recognizable to 20th-century fascists.
And yet Trump is also both product and promoter of a consumer capitalism that seeks to demobilize people politically. It’s hard to see that young people today would find the idea of marching around in uniforms the essence of the good life; Trump’s promise to his “real people” – from the rural folks of the supposed “heartland” to lily-white suburbs – is precisely that they don’t need to make sacrifices. His former chief of staff reports that Trump, visiting Arlington, claimed not to see the point of dying in war. But no real fascist leader would have denied that heroic death in combat had meaning.
So should we just relax? Absolutely not. Trump is similar to far-right populists like Narendra Modi and Viktor Orbán who claim uniquely to represent the people, who delegitimize their political opponents as traitors, and who incite hatred against already vulnerable minorities. Such a strategy has authoritarian consequences; those in turn enable crony capitalism, or outright kleptocracy, which has been crucial for the consolidation of regimes like Orbán’s.
Here’s a lesson that is more useful than the general analogy with fascism. Contrary to the liberal tendency to blame political ills on the supposedly irrational people, it is elites who decide that they are done with democracy. The parallel with the Weimar Republic is usually deployed to suggest that majorities elect fascists. But Hitler was handed power by old Prussian and industrial elites for whom he might not have been the ideal chancellor, but good enough in the face of communism. Fascists marched on Rome in 1922, but Mussolini arrived comfortably by sleeper car from Milan, as traditional Italian elites had invited him to govern.
Trump has a real movement, but, as Hannah Arendt recognized when diagnosing a peculiar 20th-century alliance between what she called the “mob” and elites, a movement is not enough. American billionaires and CEOs have been falling over themselves to support a candidate who promises to lower taxes and deregulate like crazy; supreme court justices have pre-approved an authoritarian playbook with their grant of presidential immunity. Calling this fascism isn’t particularly illuminating; but withholding the F-word does not make the prospect of Trump’s second coming any less dangerous for the US and, in fact, the world as a whole.

Guardian,Spain flash floods: dozens of people killed as Spanish prime minister says ‘devastating episode’ is not over – latest updates,"Pedro Sánchez has just addressed the nation. My colleague Sam Jones has this dispatch from Madrid:
In a televised statement on Wednesday morning, Sánchez, called for unity, solidarity - and vigilance.
“We mustn’t let our guard down because the weather front is still wreaking havoc and we can’t say that this devastating episode is over,” he said.
“There are still weather warnings in Andalucía, Valencia, Aragón, Castilla y León, in Cataluña, in Extremadura, in Navarra, in La Rioja and in Ceuta. That’s why I’m asking people in those areas to take special care: to stay off the roads; to avoid travelling close to ravines, riverbanks and riverbeds, and to heed the advice of the emergency services and of the police. No one should be putting their life at risk.”
The prime minister said that Spain had had more than its fair share of natural and health emergencies in recent years - mentioning the Covid pandemic, Storm Filomena in January 2021, and the volcanic eruptions in the Canary Islands that same year - but said such adversity brought out the best in the country.
“We’re going to lend a hand and help those who can’t get into their homes or who are looking for relatives or friends or loved ones,” he added. “But most of all, right now, we’re going to stand with those who are suffering the loss of their loved ones.”
More pictures are coming in to us now from flood-hit Valencia – as the clean-up starts. Spain’s prime minister, Pedro Sánchez. has told those affected to remain ‘on their guard’
Today’s flash floods are reported to have been the worst to have affected Spain since 1996.
Back then, 87 people died when torrential rain hit an area in a town in the Pyrenees mountains.
As we reported in our post earlier at 11.38GMT, climate scientists have warned torrential rains are set to get stronger as the planet heats up.
Ernesto Rodríguez Camino, senior state meteorologist and member of Spanish Meteorological Association, said: “These types of intense and exceptional, rare rainfall events are going to become more frequent and more intense and, therefore, destructive.”
At least 64 people are now reported to have died after torrential rain battered eastern and southern Spain on Tuesday, bringing flash floods that raged through towns and cut off roads and railway lines. At least 62 people died in Valencia while two were killed in the central region of Castilla La Mancha.
Rescuers continue to scour the floodwaters but Carlos Mazon, the regional leader of Valencia, said some areas remain “absolutely impossible” to reach.
The German government has offered its help to Spain, with a spokesperson adding they were in direct contact with Madrid should they need any assistance
As we reported earlier, the EU has offered support to Spain.
In a post on social media, Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the EU Commission noted that “Europe is ready to help.”
Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, she reiterated the message, adding that the EU’s thoughts were with the victims of the floods as well as the rescue teams working frantically to locate the missing.
She added:
What we are seeing is devastating; entire villages are covered with mud, people seeking refuge on trees and cars swept away by the fury of the waters.”
Emergency services in the eastern region of Valencia have confirmed the deaths of 62 people, while the central government office in the Castilla-La Mancha region said two people had been killed.
Relatives continue to frantically search for their loved ones
Social media and television outlets across Spain have been filled with appeals as people scramble to track down loved ones who remain missing.
Leonardo Enrique told broadcaster RTVE that his family had last spoken to his 40-year-old son on Tuesday around 7pm. His son had been driving a delivery van near the industrial town of Ribarroja, and had sent a message saying that it was raining heavily.
In a second message, he said his van was flooding and that he had been hit by another vehicle. “We haven’t heard anything,” Enrique said. “He’s not answering his phone.”
As the rain begins to subside in Valencia, details have continued to emerge about the storm’s powerful impact across the region.
Along with extraordinary amounts of rainfall, the storm gave rise to a freak hailstorm, punching holes in car windows and greenhouses, as well as a tornado.
Residents have described how the deluge of rain swiftly mixed with mud and refuse, making streets unrecognisable.
“The neighbourhood is destroyed, all the cars are on top of each other, it’s literally smashed up,” Christian Viena, a bar owner in the Valencian village of Barrio de la Torre, told the Associated Press news agency.
“Everything is a total wreck, everything is ready to be thrown away. The mud is almost 30 centimetres deep.”
The Guardian’s Community team would like to hear from people in Spain about the impact of the flooding. Have you been affected by the recent flooding? How are you coping?
Spain’s state weather agency has described the rainfall in parts of the country as “extraordinary”
In the area between municipalities such as Utiel and Chiva, more than 300 litres fell per square metre, the agency said on social media.
Chiva, a small town that is home to 17,000 people, was particularly hard hit, with 491 litres falling per square metre. “Practically as much rain as would be seen in a full year,” the agency noted.
The mayor of the small town of Utiel, in the Valencia region, has said emergency services were still scrambling to track down several people who are missing in his town.
“Yesterday was the worst day of my life,” Ricardo Gabaldón told national broadcaster RTVE.
He added:
We were trapped like rats. Cars and trash containers were flowing down the streets. The water was rising to three meters.”
Climate scientists have warned that torrential rains are set to get stronger as the planet heats up.
Ernesto Rodríguez Camino, senior state meteorologist and member of Spanish Meteorological Association, said: “These types of intense and exceptional, rare rainfall events are going to become more frequent and more intense and, therefore, destructive.”
He said scientists would be able to quantify the role of climate change after the event but could not do so on the fly.
María José Sanz, scientific director of the BC3 Basque Centre for Climate Change, said hotter oceans meant there was more water in the atmosphere. Changes in the jet stream also appear to be keeping areas of low pressure in one place for longer.
The air can hold 7% more water for every degree celsius the planet heats. The world has heated about 1.3C and Europe has warmed by about double that.
Liz Stephens, a climate risk scientist at the University of Reading, said “the tragic consequences of this event show that we have a long way to go to prepare.”
A red weather warning was issued for the region with enough time for people to move out of harm’s way, she added, but a red warning alone doesn’t communicate what the impact will be or what people should do.
“People shouldn’t be dying from these kinds of forecasted weather events in countries where they have the resources to do better.”
Speaking to reporters in the Canary Islands, Spain’s King Felipe has spoke of the “enormous destruction” caused by the floods.
There are still difficulties when it comes to accessing some areas, so we do not have complete information on the extent and possible victims.
""I am comforted by the knowledge that all possible means available are at the disposal of the authorities and emergency services. They are all working and the important thing is to let them work in a coordinated manner”.",2024-10-30
Guardian,Jamaica welcomes US move to clamp down on gun trafficking to Caribbean,"Jamaica’s deputy prime minister has welcomed a campaign by the New York attorney general, Letitia James, to push through new measures and legislation to tackle gun trafficking from the US to the Caribbean.
Horace Chang, who is also Jamaica’s minister of security, praised a coalition of 14 US attorneys general, led by James, that is backing the passing of the Caribbean Arms Trafficking Causes Harm Act. Introduced in both houses of the US Congress earlier this year, the act aims to help curb illicit arms trafficking from the United States to the Caribbean.
In a letter to Congress, the attorneys general outlined actions that need to be taken, including improving resources for US port inspectors and increasing funding for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).
The letter highlights Jamaica’s alarming homicide rate of 53.3 per 100,000, pointing out that it is “currently the highest rate of countries with reliable statistics”. It also flags that, according to Jamaican government estimates, at least 200 guns are trafficked into the country from the US every month, adding that these guns are fueling violent crime and enabling drug smuggling networks that traffic drugs to the US.
“It is not an exaggeration to say that overdoses in American communities are made possible in part by the trafficking of firearms from the United States to the Caribbean,” the letter argues.
Chang said that Jamaica already had an “extremely good relationship” with US law enforcement agencies, particularly the ATF, but admitted that the flow of guns was still a big problem.
He hoped the AGs’ campaign would support Jamaica’s efforts to combat gun crime, which he said include improving border control and creating new legislation.
He said: “It’s good to hear the American attorneys general asking for [legislative changes] because the source of the firearms that are killing Jamaican citizens in very large numbers is largely from the United States, so we are happy to hear them taking strong actions to prevent the flow of guns to Jamaica.
“We brought in the most aggressive firearms act in the region, and it will impact the issue in short order and penalise all aspects of the illegal firearm trade … We have taken a lot of steps to protect our borders and to identify and find the firearms and to implement strong punishment to the individuals involved.”
Dr Diana Thorburn, from the thinktank Caribbean Policy Research Institute, said that the US taking some of the responsibility for this issue was a step in the right direction, but added that, while tackling gun trafficking was critical, it was important to recognise that it did not get to the root of the problem.
She said: “80% of Jamaica’s murder rate is directly or indirectly related to gangs, and if you take that 80% out, Jamaica’s murder rate is below the world average.
“The problem of gun trafficking exists because of the demand for guns in the Caribbean, just as drug trafficking to the US exists because of the high demand for drugs in the US. In Jamaica, the demand for guns exists because of the gangs, and they are the ones responsible for the high murder rate. If they weren’t getting guns from the US, they’d get them from somewhere else because, though most of the guns recovered in Jamaica are from the US, not all are. There are other sources.”",2024-10-03
Guardian,Trump’s greatest feat has been convincing ordinary Americans that he’s on their side. He is not | George Monbiot,"Dear US voters, in the spirit in which I would beg a dear friend not to get a facial tattoo, I’m writing to ask you not to vote for Donald Trump. While the decision to do so would make a statement, signalling your justifiable anger about the pain you have suffered, it is likely to disfigure you, damage your life chances and prove irreversible. In the wake of his rally at Madison Square Garden, no one can now doubt what he intends to do to you.
I can guess where you think I’m coming from, but I have no love for the Democrats. Unlike the UK Labour party staffers campaigning for Kamala Harris, I have no affiliations. While there have been some improvements under Joe Biden, for decades, regardless of which party was in power, the value generated by the middle and working classes has been mopped up by the very rich. This is the result of 45 years of neoliberalism, a life-sapping programme to which both parties subscribe. I share the horror and disgust many of you feel towards Biden’s foreign policy, especially his support for the Israeli government while it pursues its genocidal onslaught in Gaza and invasion of Lebanon.
But all these things would be worse under Trump. Of Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump said last week, “he’s doing a good job” but “Biden is trying to hold him back … and he probably should be doing the opposite, actually”. Earlier this year, he said of the Israeli government, “They’ve got to finish what they started.” If, as Trump allegedly threatened, he “will not give a penny” to Ukraine in aid, Vladimir Putin could do to Ukraine what Netanyahu has done to Gaza. Any prospect of peace on either front would shift from improbable to impossible.
For all their faults, at least Biden and Harris seek, however unevenly, to shield the people of the United States from the worst aspects of capitalism. But Trump is the worst aspects of capitalism, condensed into human form: the greed, the lies, the rip-offs. While he remains vague on the detail, a collection of rightwing goons, under the aegis of Project 2025, have laid out the road he will most likely follow. During his first presidency, Trump attempted, but thankfully failed, to destroy the Affordable Care Act. If he wins again, he will fail less often. His team will rip down the threadbare public protections for the middle and working classes. Trump’s plans would hasten the insolvency of social security and Medicare. He will gut the government, replacing experienced officials with loyalists. Head Start, which provides childcare and preschool education, offering at least a prospect of opportunity for all, will be erased: if you are born poor, you will be even more likely to remain poor.
Never underestimate the vengeful nihilism at the heart of this movement. The glitter-eyed fanatics behind Project 2025 and other such programmes will smash whatever is most precious to you, partly at the behest of commercial interests – but also to enjoy watching the pain it inflicts. They will crush beauty, joy, community and hope precisely because other people value them.
Even if, in 2028, Trump or his designated successor somehow permits a change of government, which seems unlikely, some of the impacts of another single term will be irrevocable, particularly as his team attacks the living world.
His climate policies will rush us even faster towards the Earth systems horizon. There will be no recovery of the beautiful wild places he will hand to fossil fuel extractors, to mining and ranching companies, to construction firms. When catastrophes strike, he will not be there for you. During his first term, Trump, a modern-day Nero, withheld disaster aid from states he deemed insufficiently loyal to him. His callous and chaotic response to the Covid-19 pandemic helped cause the death of 350,000 Americans in 2020. Contrast this, for instance, to Taiwan, whose highly effective policies ensured that only seven lives were lost that year. This is the iron rule: Trump serves only himself.
Some of you might gain from a new Trump presidency, but only at the expense of others. His is, and has always been, a zero-sum game. His friends may rise, but only as his enemies fall. And the nature of the enemy will constantly evolve.
Already, you can see the net widening. Trump has made it clear that people who don’t originate from “nice countries” – he listed Denmark, Switzerland and Norway – are “poisoning the blood” of the US. Your blood, in his worldview, becomes no less “poisonous” over time. Already, he has lined up Jews as the scapegoats if he loses the election, a gambit as old as the hills.
Perhaps you are white and Christian. But you might discover, some years down the line, that you are the wrong kind of white, or the wrong kind of Christian. Gay? Disabled? Long-term sick? It may not be long before you too are “poisoning the blood” of the country. As his capture of the judiciary advances, women will be reduced once more to second-class citizens whose primary purpose is to serve men. Who is the “your” in “I am your retribution”? Trump is careful never to spell it out. But of one thing you can be sure: the answer will keep changing.
It is not hard to see the militias supporting Trump mutating into death squads if he wins, protected by sympathetic police, a tame judiciary and presidential pardons. If so, they would be used to instil terror into his opponents. Every outrage will blunt the edge of the next one, until you are so inured to outrage that you have no remaining capacity to respond. And as Trump is now empowered by almost full-spectrum immunity, there will be nothing anyone can do to stop him.
The rest of the establishment and the less extreme media, the professions, government officials and legislators – will they seek to protect you? Most will fall into line, out of fear and favour, the two forces to which almost everyone in public life succumbs. This is how it works, and has always worked.
Men like Trump, damaged, frightened, pathologically insecure, resistant to love and therapy, can relieve their pain only by inflicting pain on others. Compassion is a foreign concept to him. There is no curiosity, no wonder, no kindness, no connection with the hearts of others, no lightness of spirit. In their place are ego, rage, resentment, impulsiveness and cruelty. Those who are not at peace with themselves destroy other people’s peace.
We need to build a world in which one can gain without another losing, a world in which kindness, decency and community prevail, where the fortunate help the less fortunate to avoid disaster. The Democrats will deliver less of this than they should. But Trump will make everything worse. Please, dear friends. Don’t do it to yourselves.

Guardian,‘Zombie-like’: the US trade agreement that still haunts Democrats,"More than 30 years have passed since President Bill Clinton persuaded Congress to ratify the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) and yet the trade agreement still infuriates many voters and hangs over Kamala Harris’s – and the Democrats’ – chances in this year’s elections.
Zombie-like, Nafta just keeps coming back, decades after many Democrats believe it should have died. At the Republican convention, Donald Trump attacked Nafta, calling it “the worst trade agreement ever”. In speech after speech, Nafta is a topic Trump turns to as he seeks to woo the voters in the pivotal blue-collar communities of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – many of whom remain angry about the job losses it caused.
There were early warning signs. “A lot of people were saying Nafta was going to be a disaster economically,” said David Bonior, a former Democratic congressman from Michigan who led the congressional fight to defeat Clinton’s push for Nafta. “I could see it was going to be a disaster politically, too.”
Nafta acted like a slow-motion poison for Democrats. After Congress ratified it in 1993, year by year more factories closed and more jobs disappeared as manufacturers moved operations to Mexico to take advantage of that country’s lower wages. The Economic Policy Institute, a progressive thinktank, estimates that the US lost 682,000 jobs due to Nafta, which largely eliminated tariffs between the US, Mexico and Canada.
“It’s a lingering issue in Michigan,” said Ron Bieber, president of the Michigan AFL-CIO, the US’s largest federation of unions. “Everyone knows someone here in Michigan who lost their job due to Nafta. The door was cracked open to outsourcing before Nafta, but Nafta threw the door open after it was passed.”
JJ Jewell, who works at a Ford axle plant in Sterling Heights, Michigan, was born two years before Nafta was ratified. The trade pact has been part of the background of his life, he says. Jewell said he often discussed trade problems with other auto workers, even when they didn’t directly discuss Nafta. “It’s an issue,” he said. “Nafta helped expedite the loss of jobs from our country to a country where wages are cheaper. I have friends, family members, neighbors who lost their jobs as a direct result of Nafta. It still affects things decades later.”
While Trump talks tough on trade and protecting factory jobs, Jewell said that Trump, while president, fell badly short in his vows to bring back manufacturing jobs. “It’s empty promises,” he said.
Liz Shuler, the president of the AFL-CIO, the country’s main labor federation, agreed, saying that Trump’s tough words on trade have done little for workers. “This is an example of Trump’s rhetoric not matching reality,” Shuler said. “He talks a good game, but there’s no action to back it up. When he had the ability to make a difference, when he was president, he went to different places and pretended to be a savior, and you followed up and you saw that those plants closed and jobs were moved to Mexico. He did nothing to fix it.”
Seeing all the lingering discontent about Nafta, many Democrats say it’s unfair for Trump and others to blame their party for the agreement. The idea for Nafta arose under Ronald Reagan, they say, and George HW Bush negotiated the deal, both Republicans. More Republicans in Congress voted to ratify Nafta than Democrats. The vast majority of Senate Republicans also voted for it, while most Democratic senators voted against ratification.
Still, Bonior said that Clinton and his administration “get the blame because their top guy was for it”, he said. “Clinton was instrumental in making it happen.”
Many workers who lost jobs due to Nafta were able to find other jobs, said Bonior, but their pay was 20% less on average. “Lifestyles were enormously downgraded in my district,” said Bonior, who served as House majority whip. “Clinton bought into Nafta, but a lot of working-class people saw that as a betrayal.”
On Nafta, Clinton won strong backing from economists and corporate America. Brushing aside labor’s warnings that Nafta would speed the loss of jobs to Mexico, nearly 300 economists on the right and the left, including several Nobel Prize winners, signed a pro-Nafta letter, saying: “The assertions that Nafta will spur an exodus of US jobs to Mexico are without basis.”
Many economists argued that Nafta would increase the number of manufacturing jobs in the US because the nation had a higher-skilled, more productive workforce than Mexico and would thus, in theory, gain factory jobs in an expanded free-trade zone. Pro-Nafta forces also argued that the closer economic integration of the US, Mexico and Canada would create a North American powerhouse to counter China’s fast-growing economic power.
Jeff Faux, a former president of the Economic Policy Institute, said many economists failed to realize something important that was happening when Nafta was negotiated: “The US was losing its manufacturing base. It was deindustrializing.”
Faux, one of the most outspoken economists against Nafta, said Clinton embraced Nafta because he was eager to present himself as a different type of Democrat and “was trying to ingratiate himself with the business community”. “Clinton saw Nafta as an opportunity to present himself as not just another liberal Democrat,” Faux said. “It was the beginning of the notion that came to dominate the Democratic party that its future is not in working people, that it’s in professionals, in women, in minorities and various ethnic groups. They wanted to put together a new coalition, and labor would be a thing of the past.”
Michael Podhorzer, a former AFL-CIO political director, said many blue-collar workers remain angry about Nafta because it was such a departure from President Franklin Roosevelt’s emphatically pro-worker Democratic party. Podhorzer said: “Nafta is the catchall for a series of things that Democrats did that showed they had a greater concern for business interests and a kind of insensitivity to the consequences that accelerating deindustrialization would have on people’s lives.”
Trump was shrewd to seize on Nafta, he said: “It’s a way for him to sort of wave a flag, but it doesn’t actually mean he’s on the workers’ side. It channels pretty effectively the frustration that many Americans feel in seeing their jobs go offshore or to Mexico or seeing their communities hollowed out or seeing fewer economics prospects for their kids.”
In the view of many labor leaders and workers, the Democrats doubled down on misguided trade policy when Clinton successfully pushed Congress in 2000 to approve normal trade relations with China. That move encouraged many US corporations to outsource operations to lower-wage China, with one study finding that the country lost 2m jobs, including 985,000 factory jobs, because of the normalized trade relations with China. The number of factories in the US also declined by 45,000 from 1997 to 2008, with many workers blaming Nafta and the China trade deal.
What’s more, many unions faulted Barack Obama for pushing for another free trade agreement: the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a pact with 12 Pacific Rim countries. TPP’s supporters said the deal would increase US exports and build a powerful economic bloc to counter China. TPP was signed in 2016 under Obama’s presidency, but soon after Trump became president, he withdrew the US from TPP, preventing it from taking force.
“Obama wasn’t great shakes on trade either,” Bonior said. “A lot of working people said they had enough. They decided we’re not going to be with the Democrats any more, and Trump came along and filled the void. That was very smart for Trump to do.”
In a 2016 campaign appearance in Pittsburgh, Trump made a major speech on trade that denounced Nafta and cited several Economic Policy Institute studies that criticized the trade pact. Lawrence Mishel, who was the institute’s president at the time, said: “Trump never really explained what he would do about Nafta or trade. He ended his speech with a call for deregulation and tax cuts for the rich, which was far more pro-Chamber of Commerce than pro-worker.”
While Joe Biden voted to ratify Nafta when he was a senator, labor leaders say the president’s current pro-worker stance on trade shows that he recognizes his Nafta vote was a mistake. For Bonior, it might be too little too late.
“Biden has been very good on working-class issues. Biden is trying to make up for his vote on Nafta,” Bonior said. “But a lot of working-class people are turned off so much to the Democrats that they’re not hearing of the things Biden and Harris have done for them. They’re not listening. They’re gone. I don’t know if we’ll ever get them back.
“They’re to some degree mesmerized by Trump even though Trump has never been for working people,” Bonior continued. “Those plants he said he would restore – he never did any of that.”
Many union leaders slam Trump for a speech he gave in Youngstown in which he told thousands of workers that he would bring back all the factory jobs that Ohio had lost. “They’re all coming back,” he said. They didn’t. And when General Motors closed its huge assembly plant in nearby Lordstown, Ohio, in 2019, Trump did little to stop the plant closing or bring back the lost jobs.
“He said all those jobs would be coming back, and then he did nothing,” said Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers (UAW). “The auto industry abandoned Lordstown, and Trump did nothing.”
When Trump was running for president in 2016, he vowed to renegotiate Nafta, and he followed through, reaching a new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) in 2018. Labor leaders had attacked Nafta not only for encouraging companies to move factory jobs to Mexico and but also for failing to effectively protect Mexican workers whose employers had violated their right to unionize or other rights.
Union leaders agree that USMCA created a stronger mechanism to crack down on labor violations by Mexican companies, although the Trump administration negotiated that improved enforcement mechanism only after the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and House Democrats demanded that Trump go further in the negotiations. But under USMCA, often called “Nafta 2.0”, US companies have continued moving manufacturing operations to Mexico.
Even though USMCA made only minor changes to Nafta, Trump called it, “the best trade deal ever made”. For her part, Harris was one of 10 senators to vote against USMCA, saying it didn’t improve Nafta sufficiently.
Faux said many workers applaud Trump on trade because “he did something” about it by renegotiating Nafta, while “the Democrats did nothing”.
Labor leaders have differing views of USMCA. David McCall, president of the Pittsburgh-based United Steelworkers, said: “I think Nafta 2.0 was helpful. It’s gotten some better labor protections.”
But the UAW’s Fain was merciless in attacking USMCA. “I like to call it Trump’s Nafta,” Fain said. “Trump’s Nafta only made problems worse. Trump’s Nafta only gave the billionaires more profits. Trump’s Nafta only killed more American jobs. Trump’s Nafta only shipped more work to Mexico.”
Both Harris and Trump say they will renegotiate USMCA if elected. Trump also says he will protect factory jobs by imposing a 20% tariff on all imports, but the Steelworkers’ McCall says that’s a terrible idea. “I don’t think the solution to the problem is to have tariffs for the sake of having tariffs,” McCall said. “That’s protection. I think trade is a good thing. It’s an economic stimulator.” He said the US should use tariffs not in a blunderbuss way, but to “punish cheaters or countries that dump their various products”.
McCall said the Biden-Harris administration had had a far better strategy for protecting factory jobs. “It’s the first time in generations that we’ve had an industrial policy in this country,” he said, praising three important laws passed under Biden: the infrastructure law, the green energy law and the Chips Act to encourage semiconductor production. McCall said those laws, along with Biden’s targeted tariffs “against countries that cheat”, give the US “an opportunity to be the most productive producers of many products”.
While many blue-collar workers like Trump’s views on trade, McCall said: “He’s not a friend of unions or labor. For Trump it’s all about him, not about the person that’s working on the job: the steelworker, the electrical worker, the teamster or the UAW member.”",2024-10-28
Guardian,This race could affect Pennsylvanians more than the presidential election. Can Democrats win?,"In a Pennsylvania suburb whose voters are coveted by both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, Nicole Ruscitto walked from house to house on a gloomy Tuesday afternoon, informing residents that there is another important race in November.
“I’m Nicole, I’m running for state senate in your district,” she told voters on the doorsteps of their red brick houses in Bethel Park, a town about 30 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh, which, if yard signs and election results are any gauge, is about evenly divided between Trump and Harris supporters. “I want to go to Harrisburg to help our families.”
In a swing state that’s considered by both Trump and Harris as perhaps the most important to deciding the presidential election, Ruscitto is running for an office that receives less attention than the occupant of White House or members of Congress, yet may have far more impact on the day-to-day life of Pennsylvanians.
For three decades, Democrats have been locked out of power in the state’s general assembly. On 5 November, the party is hoping the elections of Ruscitto, a school teacher and former town councilmember, and three other candidates to the state senate will change that.
Should they wind up with control of the senate and the house of representatives – the party’s majority in the latter is just one seat – Democrats will finally be able to send Josh Shapiro, the Pennsylvania governor, a host of legislation that Republicans are currently blocking, ranging from increasing the minimum wage to abortion rights.
“If we could have that trifecta, Governor Shapiro would be able to do so many great things for the people here in Pennsylvania, and I plan on doing that 100%,” Ruscitto said in an interview at her campaign office.
While many Americans are fixated on the presidential election, there are 5,808 legislative seats in 44 states up for grabs in November, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, and voters’ choices may be more impactful than ever before. State governments across the United States have in recent years picked up the policymaking slack from Washington DC, where partisan gridlock and uncooperative Congresses have meant successive presidents have failed to enact many of their campaign promises.
The results can be seen in the stark differences between laws in red and blue states.
Where Democrats rule, governors have enacted laws to protect abortion access, cut down on emissions tied to climate change, curb gun violence and streamline the process to cast ballots. Republican-led states, meanwhile, have banned abortion to varying degrees, targeted gender-affirming care for transgender youths, restricted cities from passing gun control measures and expanded the role of religion in public education.
Many states have legislatures and governor’s mansions controlled by the same party. A smaller group of states, including Wisconsin, Kansas and North Carolina, have governors of one party and legislatures controlled by the other. Pennsylvania is the only state in the union where the two houses of the general assembly are held by different parties.
Considered a part of Democrats’ “blue wall” along the Great Lakes, the Keystone state has supported the party’s presidential candidates in most recent elections, though this year’s polls show Trump and Harris essentially tied. Democrats have also seen victories at the state level with the election of Shapiro and the US senator John Fetterman in 2022.
But control of the general assembly has eluded them since 1994. John J Kennedy, a political science professor at West Chester University and an expert on the state legislature, credited that to a push by Republicans to draw district maps in their favor, as well as Democratic voters’ tendency to be clustered in states’ urban areas.
“Democrats are at a natural disadvantage when it comes to the geography of a state like Pennsylvania, because they waste more votes,” he said. “Democrats are so concentrated, they’re at a sort of a natural disadvantage when it comes to accumulating a majority of seats.”
The tide began to turn two years ago, when Democrats barely took control of the house in midterm elections that saw the party perform far better than expected nationwide, fueled by voters’ outrage at the US supreme court for overturning Roe v Wade. But Republican control of the state senate has meant many of their legislative ambitions – including a bill intended to protect abortion seekers in the state, where the procedure is legal up until about 24 weeks of pregnancy – have gone nowhere.
Vincent Hughes, a Democratic senator who is the campaign chair of the Pennsylvania senate Democratic campaign committee, said he believes more voters are aware of the importance of legislative races, citing Trump’s attempts to get Republicans in Pennsylvania and other swing states to go along with his plan to block Joe Biden from taking office in 2020.
“What has happened is that the importance of state legislators nationally has become much clearer in the last four or five years, and I think that will lead to more folks getting more engaged in down-ballot races at the state legislative level,” he said in an interview.
Democrats’ hopes for a majority hinge on winning purple districts around the city of Erie, the state capital Harrisburg, and two in Pittsburgh’s suburbs – including the one in its western outskirts where Ruscitto is running against incumbent Devlin Robinson. A Marine Corps veteran and businessman, Robinson unseated a Democratic officeholder four years ago and promptly signed a letter, along with many of his colleagues, encouraging the top Republicans in Congress to delay certifying Pennsylvania’s election results as part of Trump’s disproven campaign of election denialism.

Ruscitto hopes her emphasis on cost-of-living issues and personal experience as a teacher, as well as attacks on Robinson for voting for a state constitutional amendment that could be used to curb abortion access, will give her an edge.
“We have the lowest minimum wage, and it sits in our state senate, and it’s not getting passed. And, to me, that’s absurd,” she said.
Residents of the district say Robinson has been stepping up his outreach to constituents as election day approaches. Joyce Reinoso, a retired teacher and campaigner for candidates who backs organized labor and public education, said he also has the power of incumbency.
“I don’t care what party, it’s always harder to beat the incumbent because the name recognition, if nothing else,” she said.
The Ruscitto campaign’s internal polling has found her leading Robinson by a mere two percentage points, within their survey’s margin of error. This week, the University of Virginia’s center for politics rated Pennsylvania’s house as a toss-up, but said the GOP has the edge in keeping the senate.
In Bethel Park, which was briefly thrust into the national spotlight in July when a man from the town tried to kill the former president, houses with Trump yards signs and flags sit across the street from those backing Harris, and the two candidates’ ads are ubiquitous online and on television. But signs for Ruscitto and Robinson are relatively scarce – as are strong opinions.
As she sat down for an early dinner at Ma and Pop’s Country Kitchen, Sandy Messiner, a retired bookkeeper, expressed no doubts about voting for Trump again.
“If Trump gets in, my investments will go up. We need a businessman to run this country,” the 70-year-old said. And though she knew less about them, she planned to vote for all the other Republicans on the ballot.
“I don’t care who gets in as long as they’re Republican.”
Sitting at the other end of the counter was Pam Cirucci, an 83-year-old retired nurse who was sure she would not be voting for Trump, because “he doesn’t respect females”.
A former Republican, Cirucci was less concerned with who controlled the legislature – or what the lawmakers in Harrisburg were up to at all.
“There are so many things that are more important,” she said.",2024-10-24

Guardian,US economy continues to grow at robust rate days before presidential election,"The pace of US economic growth slowed over the summer but continued its two-year expansion, according to data released on Wednesday, days before millions of voters decide whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump is best placed to lead it forward.
US gross domestic product (GDP) – a broad measure of economic health – rose by 2.8% in the third quarter, short of economists’ expectations of 3.1%, and down from the previous quarter’s 3% reading. The increase was driven primarily by consumer spending, exports and federal government spending
US policymakers scrambled to bring down inflation from its highest level in a generation two years ago. The Federal Reserve rapidly increased interest rates to tamp down prices in a move that economists feared risked tipping the world’s largest economy into recession. Such warnings failed to materialize.
“Despite earlier fears that the US economy was headed for recession, growth continued to outperform,” said Paul Ashworth, chief North America economist at Capital Economics. “Overall, the US economy appears to be doing just fine.”
US economic growth has been surprisingly resilient under Joe Biden, with only one quarter – the first of 2022 – in decline, as the shockwaves of the Covid-19 pandemic continued to rattle the global economy.
Inflation has fallen from a generational high of 9.1% in June 2020 to an annual rate of 2.4% in September, its lowest rate in over three years.
But many Americans still aren’t feeling it. Almost half wrongly believe the US is in recession, according to a Harris Poll conducted exclusively for the Guardian last month. Years of rising prices continue to take their toll.
In a speech in Washington on Tuesday, Harris once again tried to allay voters’ fears. Harris promised to assist first-time homebuyers, ban price-gouging at supermarkets and cap the price of insulin. “I will deliver tax cuts to working people and the middle class ... I will lead in honoring the dignity of work,” she said.
Trump has sought to portray the Biden administration as a “destroyer” of jobs, despite US employers adding millions of jobs in recent years. Harris, Biden’s vice-president, has acknowledged that the cost of living remains “just too high” for many, and has pledged to take action to help.
The latest GDP report was released ahead of closely watched jobs data for October, out on Friday. Economists expect the economy to have added about 125,000 new positions over the month, the last report before the election report. That figure would be a sharp drop from the 250,000 jobs added in September, when hiring unexpectedly accelerated, and will probably reflect the strike at Boeing and the impact of Hurricanes Helene and Milton.
But there are signs that the US’s resilient jobs market may also shake off last month’s disruptions.
On Wednesday ADP, the US’s largest payroll supplier, said private companies hired 233,000 new workers in October, the best month for job creation since July 2023, up from 159,000 in September and far ahead of the estimated 113,000.
“Even amid hurricane recovery, job growth was strong in October,” the ADP chief economist, Nela Richardson, said. “As we round out the year, hiring in the US is proving to be robust and broadly resilient.”",2024-10-30
Guardian,UAW leader Shawn Fain makes final appeal to divided membership,"The leader of the United Auto Workers (UAW) made a last plea to union members to vote for Kamala Harris on Tuesday night casting the presidential election as a fight between the interests of the working class and billionaires.
“I want you to know where your union stands. I want you to listen to how your UAW leadership thinks about this election and I want you to keep an open mind,” said Shawn Fain, president of the 391,00-strong union.
“I know that so much of our political system in this country is focused on bullshit, the back and forth, the name-calling, the focus on things that don’t affect our day-to-day lives as working-class people.”
Fain said the union had a responsibility to get involved in political activity, quoting the late UAW president Walter Reuther that “there’s a direct relationship between the ballot box and the bread box and what the union fights for and wins at the bargaining table can be taken away in the legislative halls”.
Fain characterized the past 40 years in the US as a one-sided class war on the working class that the billionaire class has been winning, citing the decimation of labor unions in the 1980s, the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) in the 1990s, the concessions made by the working class in the wake of the 2008 recession, and what he referred to as the “new Gilded Age” in the 2010s.
“We’re in a vicious cycle where the billionaire and corporate class take more and more for themselves and rewrite the rules of the game to keep it that way,” added Fain, who placed the Democratic party and Republican party on two opposing sides of this class war. “The Democratic party is interested in working-class people and what they have to say and they want to be in our coalition. On the other side, we have the Republicans who, on a national level in particular, have embraced the billionaire class. They embraced their billionaire candidate.”
The union formally endorsed Harris in August 2024. Fain spoke at the Democratic national convention and has been a vocal critic of Trump throughout the election. The majority of his members are in the crucial swing state of Michigan, home to the US auto industry.
Earlier this month, Fain criticized Trump over comments he made disparaging autoworkers in which he claimed “you could have a child do it”, in characterizing the work auto workers do in the US, and has frequently called Trump a “scab” in reference to Trump’s record on labor rights and support for employers over workers during strikes.
In the livestreamed speech to union members, Fain asserted the stark differences on labor issues and on policies affecting auto workers, between Trump and Harris.
According to the union, a majority of its members are supporting Harris over Trump.
“You can disagree with me and you can vote however you’re going to vote,” Fain continued. “But you cannot ignore our duty as a union to fight like hell for social and economic justice for every single member of this union and every single member of the working class.”
A poll conducted by the union in October 2024 found UAW members favor Harris over Trump by 22 percentage points, with 57% of members supporting Harris and 32% of members supporting Trump. The poll was conducted among union members in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada.
Members who reported hearing from the union about the election support Harris over Trump by 29 percentage points. The poll noted the union engaged with 293,000 active and retired UAW members and their families.
In Michigan, the poll found UAW members support Harris over Trump by 20 percentage points.
“We can’t sit this one out,” concluded Fain. “Every organizing campaign, every contract, every grievance settlement will be impacted by this election. If the billionaires take back our presidency through their lap dog, that lap dog Donald Trump, you can be damn sure that every single CEO in this country will smell blood in the water.”",2024-10-30
Guardian,The Washington Post is a reminder of the dangers of billionaire ownership | Siva Vaidhyanathan,"Last week the Washington Post refrained from endorsing a candidate in the presidential race for the first time in 36 years. The decision was reportedly ordered by Jeff Bezos, the Post’s owner and one of the richest men in the world. The Seattle billionaire, who owns Amazon, purchased the flailing newspaper in 2013 in a rare fit of civic duty.
The blowback was immediate and substantial. Within 48 hours of the announcement as many as 200,000 paying readers cancelled their subscriptions to the already money-losing news organization, according to reporting by NPR.
Such withholding of revenue is usually more a symbolic message than a real threat to the viability of a company. But for the Post, which has been teetering for decades, any loss in subscribers is threatening. Hundreds of good journalists who had no influence on Bezos’s decision remain unsure of the viability of their employer. Residents of the District of Columbia and much of Virginia and Maryland also rely on the Post for coverage of state and local issues, culture and sports. All of this is threatened by Bezos’s decision and the public uprising against it.
Some angry citizens also cancelled their subscriptions to Amazon Prime, the service that provides free shipping for many Amazon products and access to video and music streaming.
While a widespread Prime resignation would not damage the public sphere or the prospects for democracy and good government the way that hurting the Washington Post does, it’s still a futile gesture that probably will not alarm or injure Bezos in the slightest.
That’s because Prime is a classic loss-leader feature: Amazon uses the service to crush competitors by offering cheaper goods and services while the company makes its money elsewhere. Prime has about 180 million members in the United States, so if a few thousand quit, Amazon would hardly notice and Bezos hardly care.
Amazon and Bezos are far more powerful than most people realize. The company’s power is deep, broad and largely invisible. The books and dog toys we buy through Amazon remind us of its public face and original mission. But it’s not 2004 any more.
Amazon is not a normal retail company or a normal company in any way; it’s a sprawling leviathan wrapped around the essential processes of major governments, commerce and culture of most of the world.
Amazon’s major source of revenue and profit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is the leading provider of computing and data services in the world, ahead of Microsoft and Alphabet. AWS hosts the sites and data of more than 7,500 governmental agencies and offices in the US alone, including those of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Reserve.
Just about everything a 21st-century state or firm might want to do probably goes through Amazon and makes Bezos wealthier and more powerful in the process. All of this happened over the past 20 years as we enthusiastically chose convenience and mobility over all other human values. We clicked Bezos into power – and not by buying things through Amazon retail; we did it by choosing the internet again and again.
In blocking the Washington Post endorsement, Bezos is not acting cowardly as much as slyly. Secure in his fortune and status regardless of the potential rise of fascism in the US, he has some more selfish concerns about the nature of the next administration.
One potential Bezos-centric consequence of the election on 5 November is that Donald Trump will prevail over a bacchanal of greed and corruption, potentially opening federal contracts to all sorts of favored players and – more importantly – stifling investigations and prosecutions into firms and people Trump might favor.
The other possible consequence is that a Kamala Harris administration would continue the aggressive and much-needed investigations into the ways internet companies like Amazon have restrained trade, concentrated wealth and solidified power by leveraging networks and scale.
Bezos also founded and owns Blue Origin, a rocket and space technology firm that has many government contracts. Limiting the government’s regulatory oversight over space technology or contracting is in Bezos’s interest, which might explain why Blue Origin staff met with Trump around the same time as the Post announced its decision not to endorse. It’s also likely Bezos would like to muscle out Trump’s pal Elon Musk and his company, SpaceX, for what is to come.
Given all this, it makes sense that Bezos, who is generally liberal and supports Democratic candidates, would try to limit how much Trump hates him (and Trump has long hated Bezos – a lot), if there is a small chance to curry favor with the once and future president. Perhaps Bezos figures his newspaper should not help Harris more than it already has by reporting the basic news.
So there are many reasons to fear a Bezos-Trump rapprochement. Still, it does not make much sense to cancel a Post subscription or Prime membership. Neither would hurt Bezos at all.
Most boycotts, especially when they are tiny, disorganized, ad-hoc, emotional and aimed at enormous, global companies, are mere expressions of self-righteousness. They have no significant influence on the world but they can make the boycotter feel a bit better for a few days. What’s worse, they often distract energy from real political action that might curb the excesses of the companies in question.
Here is the problem: billionaires are mostly immune to consumer pressure. That’s how they became and remain billionaires.
So how do we solve a problem like a billionaire? First, we must be blunt about the nature and scope of their power. It’s not a matter of describing their wealth, which flashes before us in numbers we can’t properly grasp or feel. We must describe their influence and how they control things in the world.
Second, we must find ways to limit their wealth by taxing the various ways they accumulate and hide it.
Third, we must be enthusiastic about breaking up big companies that do too many things in too many markets and thus crush or purchase potential competitors and insurgents. It’s not about prices. It’s about power.
Most of all, we should do our best to elect leaders who are not beholden to billionaires, but actively seek to turn them back into millionaires.

Guardian,Donald Trump says he will meet Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday – as it happened,"Donald Trump said he would meet with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday morning at Trump Tower.
Yesterday, the former president attacked Zlenskyy directly and accused him of “refusing” to negotiate a peace deal with Russia’s Vladimir Putin. “The president of Ukraine is in our country. He is making little nasty aspersions toward your favourite president, me,” Trump said. “We continue to give billions of dollars to a man who refuses to make a deal: Zelenskyy.”
A fued between Trump and Zelenskyy has escalated in recent days, as my colleague Andrew Roth reports:
Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with Joe Biden at the White House, and with Kamala Harris. The Ukrainian leader is also expected to meet with Donald Trump tomorrow – amid an escalating feud between the two. Trump has suggested that Ukraine should have made concessions to Russia before it invaded, and accused Zelenskyy of making “aspersions” toward him.
Here’s what else is going on:
As part of the US’s “surge” in security assistance to Ukraine, Biden has directed the defense department to allocate all of its remaining security assistance funding that has been appropriated for Ukraine by the end of his term.
Biden and Harris introduced a new executive order to tackle gun violence, creating a task force to investigate the threats of machine-gun conversion devices and 3D-printed guns, and instructing the federal government to create guidelines on school active shooter drills, which can be traumatizing to students.
New York City mayor Eric Adams was charged in a 57-page federal indictment with crimes relating to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, federal program bribery and receiving campaign contributions by foreign nationals, wire fraud, solicitation of a contribution by a foreign national and bribery. He has maintained his innocence.
Federal prosecutors called Adams’s alleged misconduct a grave breach of public trust. The US attorney for the southern district of New York, Damian Williams , strongly criticized the mayor at a press conference. Charges against Adams also include acceptance of illegal foreign campaign contributions including from Turkish government officials. Williams said the mayor “kept the public in the dark”.
The voting machine company Smartmatic and the conservative outlet Newsmax have settled a closely watched defamation lawsuit days before it was scheduled to go to trial in Delaware.
In a characteristically rambling news conference, Trump ripped into Harris for planning a visit to the US border – and unleashed a slew of fiction and fear-mongering about the border and immigrants.
Meanwhile, back at the White House, Joe Biden outlined the grave necessity of programs to address gun violence.
His new executive order entails:
The creation of federal taskforce to evaluate the threats posed by machine gun conversion devices, which can alter handguns or other semi-automatic firearms to match the rate of fire of military machine guns. The taskforce will also investigate further the threats posed by 3D-printed firearms that are impossible to trace.
Orders to develop new guidelines for schools, colleges and universities on how to conduct active shooter drills. Most schools conduct these drills, but evidence suggests they can be traumatic to students.
US and European officials have noted with varying levels of alarm the potential for a Trump administration to sharply reduce US aid to Ukraine in order to force Zelenskyy to accept terms for a ceasefire.
Asked if the Democrats wanted to “Trump-proof” aid to Ukraine before a potential Trump presidency, a senior state department official said: “I don’t ever talk in those terms” but that the primary goal was to make sure Ukraine “has all the equipment it needs to keep fighting and manpower and other things”.
“At the end of the year, regardless of who wins our election in December, as at the end of this fighting season, Zelenskyy and Putin need to look at the battlefield and say, here’s what we think next year will look like,” the official said.
“And the primary factor there is, do I think the other side has all the equipment it needs to keep fighting and manpower and other things?”
On Wednesday, the House speaker, Mike Johnson, a Republican, accused Zelenskyy of election interference and demanded he fire his ambassador to Washington DC over a visit to an ammunitions factory in the battleground state of Pennsylvania. Johnson claimed the Ukrainian ambassador had failed to invite any Republicans to the event and called it a “partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats”.
Zelenskyy sought to reduce tensions on Thursday as he thanked the US for the new arms package and praised political leaders’ “strong bipartisan support” in “Ukraine’s just cause of defeating Russian aggression”.
“I am grateful to Joe Biden, [the] US Congress and both parties, Republicans and Democrats, as well as the entire American people for today’s announcement of major US defence assistance for Ukraine, totalling $7.9bn and sanctions against Russia,” Zelenskyy wrote.
Donald Trump said he would meet with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday morning at Trump Tower.
Yesterday, the former president attacked Zlenskyy directly and accused him of “refusing” to negotiate a peace deal with Russia’s Vladimir Putin. “The president of Ukraine is in our country. He is making little nasty aspersions toward your favourite president, me,” Trump said. “We continue to give billions of dollars to a man who refuses to make a deal: Zelenskyy.”
A fued between Trump and Zelenskyy has escalated in recent days, as my colleague Andrew Roth reports:
The joint appearance of Biden and Harris today highlights Harris’s role overseeing the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention.
“Over the years, I’ve held the hands of far too many mothers and fathers to try and comfort them after their child was killed by gun violence. And let us all agree, it does not have to be this way,” Harris said. “We know how to stop these tragedies, and it is a false choice to suggest you are either in favor of the second amendment or you want to take everyone’s guns away.”
The president today is marking the roll-out of an executive order that includes several gun-related measures, including the creation of a task force to assess the threat of machine gun conversion devices.
Joe Biden took the podium to chants of “Thank you Joe.”
The audience at the White House is full of survivors and the families of those killed by gun violence. Biden was also introduced by Birmingham mayor Randall Woodfin, whose city was rocked by gun violence on Saturday in the Five Points entertainment district. Four people were killed and 17 injured.
“I know the scream of a mother when her child is killed. I know that because I heard it from the voice of my own mother when my brother was killed by gun violence,” Woodfin said. “I heard that scream again this past Saturday.”
Joe Biden and Kamala Harris deliver remarks on addressing gun violence
The president and vice-president are speaking from the White House, and were introduced by a student who was 15 when a gunman opened fire on students and staff at Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school.
In a characteristically rambling news conference, Donald Trump ripped into Kamala Harris for visiting the border – and unleashed a slew of fiction and fear-mongering about the border and immigrants.
Among his claims was that the CBP One app, which people arriving at the US southern border must use to schedule appointment for an asylum screening, was being used by “virtually unlimited numbers of illegals to press a button schedule their illegal immigration appointment at our ports of entry”.
Using the app to schedule an asylum screening, is, of course one way to legally immigrate to the US. Seeking asylum is legal.
Trump also repeated his fictitious claim about migrants contributing to increased crime, and that crime overall was “up” – dividing ABC’s presidential debate moderators for fact-checking his claims.
Murder dropped by more than 11% from 2022 to 2023, the largest single-year decline in two decades, according to FBI data released on Monday.
Meanwhile, the broader category of violent crime nationwide decreased about 3%, said the data, which is audited and confirms earlier reporting from unaudited statistics.
Monday’s release of audited data contradicts a talking point that Donald Trump has made on the campaign trail as the Republican presidential nominee seeks a return to the White House during the 5 November election: that crime has been rampant and out of control without him in power.
In its annual Crime in the Nation summary, the FBI said rape decreased by an estimated 9.4%, property crime dropped 2.4% and burglary fell by an estimated 7.6%.
After the 2020 election, Newsmax aired several false claims about the company, whose voting machines were only used in Los Angeles county in 2020. The network repeatedly aired false claims from Trump allies that the software was widely used across the country and that it had been hacked to change votes.
Smartmatic sued Newsmax, Fox, One America News Network (OANN) and others for broadcasting their false claims. It settled the case with OANN earlier this year and the Fox case is still pending in New York.
Smartmatic said in a statement: “We are very pleased to have secured the completion of the case against Newsmax. We are now looking forward to our court day against Fox Corp and Fox News for their disinformation campaign. Lying to the American people has consequences. Smartmatic will not stop until the perpetrators are held accountable.”
First amendment scholars were closely watching the case and several others like it to see whether libel law can be used as an effective tool to police misinformation.
The case was set to be a kind of sequel to the defamation litigation between Dominion, another voting machine company, and Fox over 2020 election lies. That case settled just before the trial was set to begin, with Fox agreeing to pay Dominion $747.5m. Eric Davis, the judge who oversaw the Fox case, also was overseeing the Newsmax case.
The voting machine company Smartmatic and the conservative outlet Newsmax have settled a closely watched defamation lawsuit days before it was scheduled to go to trial in Delaware.
A spokesperson for the Delaware courts said the case had settled on Thursday. He did not offer additional details.
Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Kamala Harris made an appearance together after meeting.
Harris emphasized: “Nothing about the end of this war can be decided without Ukraine.”
She also referenced, without explicitly mentioning, Donald Trump, who has said that Ukraine should have made concessions to Russian president Vladimir Putin before Russia’s attack:
“There are some in my country who would instead force Ukraine to give up large parts of its sovereign territory,” she said. “These proposals are the same as those of Putin. Let us be be clear. They are not proposals for peace. Instead, they are proposals for surrender.”
New York City mayor Eric Adams was charged in a 57-page federal indictment with crimes relating to conspiracy to commit wire fraud, federal program bribery and receiving campaign contributions by foreign nationals, wire fraud, solicitation of a contribution by a foreign national and bribery. He has maintained his innocence.
Federal prosecutors called Adams’s alleged misconduct a grave breach of public trust. The US attorney for the southern district of New York Damian Williams strongly criticized the mayor at a press conference a little earlier.
Williams vowed to continue to investigate the mayor’s case and to “hold more people accountable”. Charges against Adams include bribery, wire fraud and acceptance of illegal foreign campaign contributions including from Turkish government officials. Williams said the mayor “kept the public in the dark”.
The indictment against Adams includes many luxury trips that were not put in annual disclosure forms, prosecutors say. Trips cost many thousands of dollars and included visiting Turkey and flying via Turkey while visiting countries such as China, India, France, Hungary and Ghana.
Federal agents raided Adams’s official residence, Gracie Mansion, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in the early hours today, as reports emerged of the mayor being hit with a federal indictment. The raid reportedly included a group of nearly a dozen people in suits entering the property, with several carrying briefcases, backpacks or duffel bags.
Joe Biden and Volodymyr Zelenskyy are meeting at the White House as the Ukrainian president attempts to shore up support for his country’s war aims in its fight against Russia. Before the meeting, Zelenskyy thanked the US president for his support, saying:“Your determination is incredibly important for us to prevail … We must restore normal life, and we greatly value your leadership.”
Before their meeting, Biden released a statement, saying: “I am proud to welcome President Zelenskyy back to the White House today.”As part of the US’s “surge” in security assistance to Ukraine, Biden has directed the defense department to allocate all of its remaining security assistance funding that has been appropriated for Ukraine by the end of his term.",2024-09-26

In depth
For the 10 years that I have been a writer, I have grappled with the question of where I fit, both as a journalist and audience. Growing up in 1980s Sudan, we had only one television channel, imaginatively named Sudan TV. After school, I would watch the only cartoon, a Japanese animation voiced over in Arabic. At 11pm, after the evening news, the channel shut down for the night after playing the national anthem and then there was only static. That was when I knocked on my parents’ bedroom door and my father, in what became a nightly ritual, handed over his old radio for the evening.
I would stay up late fiddling with the dials until I got a clear transmission to send me off to sleep. The strongest signal was BBC World Service but others sometimes burst through. Voice of America drawled with dry news of Ronald Reagan and the Iran-Contra affair. The Christian Science Monitor and Radio Monte Carlo, crackled with static into my bedroom in Khartoum. With them came an education and integration into a foreign world centred on London, Washington and Paris. For years, my consumption was an incoherent diet of pop music, western politics, gossip and comedy that I rarely understood.
I never once noticed that there was no one like me on those airwaves, or that none of what I was listening to reflected – or was interested in – the world I lived in. If there was any mention of Sudan, Africa or Black people, it was in passing or in crisis – famine, war, climate catastrophe, racism and discord. I internalised that erasure and diminishment – I didn’t believe there was anything about my existence, culture or social life that was worthy of global media coverage.
Then, seemingly overnight, the radio with a bent aerial was replaced with screens and apps and podcasts and websites. As I grew older and work and life took me from Khartoum to Nairobi, Cairo and London, and as conflict, love and financial need displaced family and friends, a good internet connection was all I needed for me to feel as if I could be anywhere.
For me, the Black diaspora is like a large, sprawling family. But I also feel I have so many unanswered questions about those family members: how we passed our food and culture and habits down and across the world, how we mixed recipes, languages, shared music, and picked which national sports teams to cheer on. I wanted more. The only way I can describe this yearning is a sort of constant state of homesickness.
I had left the country in which I was born and raised, but there was a global community, a home, that I knew was out there.
To me, identity is an intersection not a terminus – a part of the mainstream, rather than a sealed-off corner of it. If I hadn’t been lucky enough to be able to turn down endless requests asking me to write “as a Black woman”, with set ideas of what that meant, I wouldn’t be here at all. In a way, that worked out too well – now I write about whatever I like but the space for all that I like seems too small.
And so we – a team of writers and editors from various backgrounds – sketched out a dream scenario. If we did have that space, if we could decide what we wanted to talk about and how to talk about it, if we could reach anywhere in the world and explore and highlight Black life, what would that look like?
The answer was The Long Wave. Our newsletter where, from Europe to the Caribbean, life is shown in all its texture. Where we are not restricted by the template of what is considered newsworthy. Where we profile interesting people doing interesting things, highlight music, sport, film and literature, and explore hot topics that are so often contained to the group chat.
It will be brought to you by me and my editor, Jason Okundaye, who, despite being from a younger generation, shares the same frustrations about how Black life around the world is covered. He has never actually used a radio – but we won’t hold that against him.
This time, the frequency is ours. I no longer want to experience the world in the style of the old-school radio transmissions – I want to reclaim those centres of broadcasts. Long-wave frequencies travel across the world, piercing mountains and crossing vast distances to reach their destination, as we hope to reach you wherever you are. What I can promise you is that, above all else, we will be curious.

Guardian,Donald Trump at Madison Square Garden: the ultimate daddy projection screen | V (formerly Eve Ensler),"I went to the Trump rally at Madison Square Garden on Sunday. Or I tried to. I wanted to see it, to feel it, to know it. I spent two hours smushed in a crowd of thousands, waiting in the cold, unable to move, in the midst of belligerent conversations, alcohol consumption, rantings and racist posturings. There were older Jewish men, Black families, Asian couples and young Latina women. I heard south Asian men calling Kamala Harris hateful slurs, others saying women needed to just shut up and listen to men. I saw working men showing off their jackets with artistic renderings of Trump as bullfighter slaying the deep state dragon. What I mainly heard and felt was grievance.
I’ve always thought America was a mean place. And what I mean by that is that it’s structured for meanness. It’s a place of winners and losers, people who matter and those who can be disposed of, a country built on violent theft of Indigenous lands and hundreds of years of enslavement of millions of Black people. It’s a place where when a person rises in status, they show it off to those who have less, rather than bringing them along. Where the rich and famous flaunt their wealth and clothes and fabulous lives every single day, and watching is a national past time. A place where most people get lost or abandoned, forgotten or judged. Where an ambitious few can turn that suffering into gold, but most get swallowed in self-hatred and despair.
We’re almost 250 years into this American experience and I would say the one common thing that this patriarchal racist capitalism has wrought is a primal insecurity that what you have can easily be taken away and who you are can be suddenly and forever erased.
And that insecurity is the rub.
For when fascists come, when those narcissistic tyrannical daddy figures arrive looking bigger than life, they instinctively know how to manipulate that insecurity. They usually do it by creating a class of people or a group of people who are less, who are othered, making the majority feel special, superior and safe. It’s the oldest, but most effective trick in the fascist handbook. Externalize the abstract self-hatred and insecurity, turn it into a real enemy and blame everything on them.
This demonization was over the top at Madison Square Garden. Whether it was a comedian talking about Puerto Rico “as a floating island of garbage” or suggesting Jews were cheap and Palestinians were rock throwers, or Tucker Carlson deriding Harris – the daughter of an Indian mother and Jamaican father – with a made-up identity saying she was vying to become “the first Samoan-Malaysian, low-IQ former California prosecutor to ever be elected president”. Or for that matter almost every speaker mispronouncing Kamala’s name.
Then there was Trump rambling on and on for almost an hour, calling those seeking refuge and survival savages, animals, horrible people occupying America, invading it, as if he’d forgotten that except for the Indigenous people who were here and the African Americans who were dragged here in chains, every single other person is an immigrant who came in search of survival, safety and a new life.
I’ve always somehow understood the banal evil of Donald Trump. It goes back as far as 1989. That was around the time he was turning a 14-story apartment building in New York City into luxury condos for the rich, attempting to force tenants out of the building by turning off hot water and heat in the middle of winter. We organized an event called Brunch at the Plaza and invited Trump, who at the time owned the hotel. We bussed in hundreds of homeless people and served them brunch on the Plaza lawn. The demand was simple. Give 1.3% of your net income to specific organizations developing housing for the poor. Trump did not attend. Cut to 2015. Months before he declared he was running for office, with a few activists, we invited people to my apartment to see if we could launch Stop Hate Dump Trump. A campaign to stop him from getting traction running for president. Many told us we were crazy and extreme, they told us that no one would ever take that buffoon seriously.
Perhaps my own childhood with that same kind of narcissistic, abusive, seductive father was what gave me eyes to see Donald Trump, to understand that he was not necessarily dangerous in what he was (if you emptied that piggy bank nothing would be inside), he was dangerous for what he wasn’t – a shiny American hologram, an all too familiar dream or daddy just out of reach, totally disassociated except when he suddenly exploded with disappointment and rage. This daddy has come home indeed, home to roost, home to turn the house into chaos and terror, home to compare his children with one another so there’s always someone on top and someone stuck on the bottom, creating violent competition and hatred among his children so they never learn cooperation and solidarity, but fight instead with each other for his approval.
All night long Trump’s surrogates spun us into an opposite world. They spoke of Trump as a man of peace and love, you know, one of the flawed ordinary people like most of us, an endless victim who has survived lawsuits and impeachment, being thrown off Twitter with no mention of a reason why any of this might have happened. Truth that night was as dispensable as the lives of immigrants, pregnant women, trans kids, critical race theory and our nation’s history.
There’s plenty of blame to go around for how we got here. A racist colonialist history that has never been reckoned with, the Democrats settling for the most rudimentary approach to identity politics rather than seeing it as an entryway to an intersectional analysis of race and class. The list goes on.
We are a nation of the lonely and abandoned, desperate for belonging and worth. Many have been seduced by Trump. They can’t believe this rich mogul and TV celebrity would actually care about them. And they’re right because there is absolutely no indication that he would ever invite most of the people in the New York crowd to his mansion or golf club. Remember reports of him talking of his followers as “basement dwellers”. He told the packed house on Sunday night that he could be sunning himself on the beach or playing golf at Turnberry in Scotland, but he chose to be there with them as if the act of running for president was the highest form of altruism and not a total power grab. Oh dear generous daddy.
But there’s always the real story lurking on the edges, always the corruption and theft and dirty deals, always the sexual violence. A man told a woman I was with that she didn’t look like a typical Trump type. She was an older woman, he said, and most older women don’t like Trump. My friend asked him why he thought that was and he said something about it having to do with sexuality and my friend asked: “You mean because Trump’s a rapist?”
But in a land of mirages and heroin dreams, he’s the daddy projection screen. Terror and protector. Killer and fixer. Longed-for object and rapist. In the end thousands of us didn’t get into the Garden. In hindsight I realize I wouldn’t have lasted a minute before getting found out. I wouldn’t have been able to handle the metastasized energy of a nationalistic, racist, misogynist mob in service of its daddy lord.
As we walked away, Rudy Giuliani, a major felon and disgrace, barking madness on the jumbotron, a young woman doing an enthusiastic cheerleading act for “daddy Don” with red pompoms, I know more deeply than ever that it’s not enough to get rid of Trump, although that will be a very good thing. We have to devote ourselves to changing the conditions that gave birth to him.

Guardian,US elections 2024: seven key House races to watch,"Much attention has been paid to the rematch between Joe Biden and Donald Trump in November, but the results of down-ballot elections will determine whether the victor in the presidential race will actually be able to implement his legislative agenda next year.
With Republicans defending a narrow majority in the House of Representatives, Democrats only need to flip a handful of seats to wrest back control of the lower chamber, and both parties are going all out to secure a majority.
Here are seven House races to watch this year:
Arizona’s first congressional district
Republican incumbent David Schweikert is running for re-election in this toss-up district, which covers north-east Phoenix and Scottsdale. As one of 17 House Republicans representing districts that Biden won in 2020, Schweikert is vulnerable, and Democrats have identified the seat as one of its top targets this year.
Redistricting after the 2020 census moved this district to the left, and several Democrats have jumped into the 30 July primary in the hopes of unseating Schweikert. The race is expected to be closely contested, as Schweikert won his 2022 election by less than one point.
California’s 47th congressional district
Democratic congresswoman Katie Porter chose not to run for re-election in this battleground district, instead launching an ultimately unsuccessful Senate campaign. Her departure has created a key pickup opportunity for House Republicans, and Democrats will likely need to heavily invest in the district to defend this Orange county-based seat.
In the 5 March primary, former Republican state assemblyman Scott Baugh, who lost to Porter by just three points in 2022, advanced to the general election alongside Democratic state senator Dave Min.
Min emerged from a brutal primary fight against Democratic activist and attorney Joanna Weiss, who attacked her opponent over his arrest for drunk driving last year. Republicans will likely launch similar attacks against Min ahead of the general election, but Democrats are still favored to hold the left-leaning district.
Maine’s second congressional district
Democratic incumbent Jared Golden is running for a fourth term in this perpetual swing district that Republicans have repeatedly tried and failed to flip. Golden defeated former Republican congressman Bruce Poliquin by six points in 2022, even though Trump carried the district by six points two years earlier, according to data compiled by Daily Kos.
But this time around, Republicans believe they have a strong candidate in Austin Theriault, a state representative and former professional race car driver who will face off against fellow state representative Michael Soboleski in a primary on 11 June. Republicans also suspect that some independent voters may turn against Golden after he announced support for an assault weapons ban in response to the mass shooting in Lewiston, Maine, last year, which claimed 18 lives.
Golden has proven politically resilient in this right-leaning district, so a loss could point to broader electoral problems for Democrats in November.
Michigan’s seventh congressional district
Democratic congresswoman Elissa Slotkin’s decision to run for Senate has created an opening in this battleground district, which both parties have identified as a key target this year.
Former Republican state senator Tom Barrett has filed to run again after losing the 2022 election to Slotkin by six points, and he is expected to face former Democratic state senator Curtis Hertel.
The Cook Political Report has described the district as “the most competitive open seat in the country”, and the high stakes will likely make for a very expensive race.
North Carolina’s first congressional district
Freshman Democratic congressman Don Davis is running for re-election in this north-eastern North Carolina district, which shifted to the right after the latest round of redistricting.
Much to the relief of Republican strategists, Laurie Buckhout won the congressional nomination over Sandy Smith, who lost to Davis by five points in 2022. Smith’s electoral prospects had been hampered by her controversial record; she was previously accused of domestic abuse, and she was at the Capitol on 6 January 2021, when a group of Trump supporters stormed the building to disrupt the certification of Biden’s victory in the 2020 election.
Republicans are hopeful that Buckhout’s impressive résumé as an army veteran and founder of her own consulting firm, combined with the more favorable district lines, will be enough to unseat Davis.
New York’s 17th congressional district
Mike Lawler made headlines when he defeated incumbent Sean Patrick Maloney, then the chair of House Democrats’ campaign arm, by less than one point in 2022. This year, Maloney is expected to face off against former Democratic congressman Mondaire Jones in this Hudson valley district that went for Biden in 2020.
Lawler did not get dealt the worst hand from New York’s redistricting process; that distinction goes to fellow Republican freshman Brandon Williams, whose Syracuse-area seat went from Biden +7 to Biden +11, according to the Cook Political Report.
All the same, Lawler will face stiff competition in a race that will be closely watched for broader electoral trends in November. If he cannot hold on to the seat, it could spell trouble for Republicans up and down the ballot.
Pennsylvania’s eighth congressional district
Along with Golden, Cartwright is one of just five House Democrats who represent districts won by Trump in 2020, and Republicans are gunning for his Scranton-area seat.
But Cartwright has repeatedly defied political gravity in this right-leaning district, most recently winning re-election by roughly two points in 2022. This time around, Cartwright will face local businessman Rob Bresnahan, who could pose a serious threat to the six-term incumbent.
Cartwright has to hope he can pull off another upset to hold on to this toss-up seat.",2024-06-11
Guardian,"‘Biden has failed me’: at a Michigan soup kitchen, people are torn between Harris and Trump","People on the east side of Saginaw city are more used to seeing buildings come down than go up. Bulldozers have erased houses, schools, department stores and factories over recent years as jobs disappeared and the population plummeted.
But builders will soon be at work in one corner of the Michigan city constructing a sprawling extension to Saginaw’s largest soup kitchen after demand soared through the Covid-19 pandemic and then as rampant inflation hit a community where many people live on the edge financially.
The East Side Soup Kitchen now serves meals to more than 800 people a day, double the number provided during the pandemic, which itself was up on previous years. It also distributes food to children through local youth clubs and churches.
Few of those who use of the kitchen think that whoever is elected as president next week will slow the demand in a city with a 35% poverty rate, but that does not mean they don’t think it will make a difference. And their votes, too, are up for grabs in a bellwether county that Joe Biden won by just 303 votes in 2020.
On the day that Harris campaign canvassers visited the soup kitchen, Angelica Taybron was eating lunch with her three-month-old daughter, Tyonna, sleeping at her side. Taybron, who is unemployed, could not say enough good things about the kitchen.
“They really help me out here with my baby. They helped with formula and Pampers when I need it. They help me provide for my daughter,” she said.
Help, said Taybron, is what she’s looking for in a president and so she’s voting for Kamala Harris.
“She’s gonna help the people that’s lower. Trump is for people that’s higher. Kamala is for the people that’s struggling,” she said.
Taybron’s partner, Darshell Roberson, also relies on the food kitchen as she struggles to find work. She sees it differently.
“I voted for Biden but I really feel like Biden has failed me. I trust Donald Trump. In the last election I didn’t vote for him. I was kind of scared of him a little bit, but once I really got to watch him and look at him I liked him,” she said.
The soup kitchen’s director, Diane Keenan, said those who arrive for a hot meal each day, and cake for dessert, come from every walk of life. Sitting at the large round tables dotting the dining room are elderly people struggling to get by on small pensions and those driven into debt by medical bills alongside former prisoners rebuilding their lives, and the unhoused, some of them brought down by drug addiction.
“Many are working but they’re working poor,” said Keenan. “They work but they just don’t make enough money to make ends meet with the cost of food, the cost of gas, rent, mortgage payment, insurance, that type of thing. We have a lot of senior citizens and elderly come through. They’re on a limited income and sometimes they have to choose, do I get my medicine or can I get some food?”
The need is so great that earlier this month the state donated $1m to help fund an expansion to the soup kitchen with a larger dining hall and kitchen, freezers big enough for forklifts to drive into.
In a city with one of the highest crime rates in the US, Keenan is trailed by two security guards as she walks around the outside of the building to describe the closure of a neighboring road to provide a covered area for people to pick up meals by car.
The drive-through began when the dining hall closed during the pandemic. Keenan kept it going because she said there are people in need of food who are too embarrassed to come into the building or are not well enough to do so.
Keenan described the kitchen is “felon-friendly”, helping to provide a fresh start for those who have been in prison.
Stanley Henderson served 30 years for a non-violent robbery. After his release in 2015, he worked at a steel mill known for employing former prisoners and then volunteered at the soup kitchen. A couple of years later, he was taken on as a worker and is now in charge of providing coffee and soft drinks.
Henderson has watched demand for the soup kitchen rise as Saginaw’s factories closed and jobs were lost. He hasn’t seen a notable improvement in economic conditions under the US president.
“The minimum wage isn’t enough for people to sustain themselves through a whole month. We see people coming in when their money runs out for groceries,” he said.
The vice-president is promising to make the economy work better for ordinary Americans if she’s elected. Henderson is sceptical.
“I am hesitant to say that she will because I don’t know. I just don’t know whether there’s more jobs under a Republican or Democrats. I don’t know if the job environment is going to improve. It’s possible it will improve up under the Republicans. They may push employment harder than the Democrats,” he said.
For all that, Henderson said there was “no question” that he will vote and that it was going to be “straight Democrat” because he believes the party does more to look after people living in poverty. He said his friends and neighbours were paying attention to the election in an area of the city with traditionally low turnout, and that he thinks most of them will vote.
Henderson, who is Black, also thinks Harris’s race will bump up turnout in his part of the city, although not like for Barack Obama’s election.
“She might encourage people to vote who don’t normally want to. I’d say about 5% more,” he said.
But there are those who do not see the point in voting.
Auralie Warren is retired and struggling financially after working at KFC for much of her life. Inflation has hit her limited income hard as she helps raise her grandchildren after her eldest daughter died of a brain tumor in February and her youngest daughter was diagnosed with stomach cancer.
“It’s getting harder out there. Food prices are going up. [The soup kitchen] helps me because I’ve got a fixed income. So when I eat here it saves money on food that I can then spend looking after the grandkids,” she said.
“I also come to mingle with people and then I get clothing for my grandkids. If you ask for something, like my daughter needed earmuffs because she has cancer and her ears get cold, they make sure to add them.”
But Warren has never voted in her 76 years and has no plans to do so. Politics didn’t seem worth her time or effort.
“Whatever’s gonna happen is gonna happen. I figure, even if I go [and vote] it won’t make no difference. I mean, it’s shocking but I just never did. I got so busy, I just don’t bother myself, I guess,” she said.",2024-10-29

Guardian,‘Fits a cot perfectly’: tiny space for rent in Silicon Valley exposes dire rental market,"A California “home” for rent is shining a light on the US housing crisis – and evoking Harry Potter’s living situation.
For $250 a month, an online ad is offering the opportunity to reside in a 3ft by 10ft cubby located under the stairs of a one-bedroom apartment in downtown San Jose.
“Fits a cot perfectly,” says the Cragislist ad for the living space.
The room under the stairs resembles the one temporarily inhabited by the titular character of the fictional magical world depicted in the Harry Potter book series by JK Rowling.
Its appearance on the rental market illustrates the rising cost of living confronting Americans. A 2024 report by the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University found that – as of 2022 – a record half of US renters paid more than 30% of their income on rent and utilities. And half of those people paid more than 50% of their income on rent and utilities.
The average cost of rent for an apartment in San Jose is $3,132 – 53% higher than the national average, according to data on Zillow. So while far from ideal for most people, the room under the stairs is decidedly a bargain.
The pros for the listing include air conditioning and heat, cost of utilities, and gated parking. The cons as mentioned in the ad are chores, cleaning and being “kind of in the ghetto”.
“I want to rent it out to a nice nerdy gamer, don’t care if male or female,” the ad says.
The landlord requires the future tenant not to have pets, addictions or a criminal record, according to the ad.
Notably, California law prohibits landlords from having a policy denying rentals to people with a criminal record because of that record.",2024-10-29
Guardian,How can the candidate with most votes lose? The US electoral college explained,"Even though the United States touts its status as one of the world’s leading democracies, its citizens do not get to directly choose the president. That task is reserved for the electoral college – the convoluted way in which Americans have selected their president since the 18th century.
Contrary to its name, the electoral college is more a process than a body. Every four years, in the December following an election, its members – politicians and largely unknown party loyalists – meet in all 50 states on the same day and cast their votes for president. Then they essentially disappear.
In recent years there has been growing criticism of the electoral college, accelerated by the fact that two Republican presidents – George W Bush in 2000 and Donald Trump in 2016 – have been elected president while losing the popular vote. But there’s no sign that US elections will change any time soon.
Here’s everything you need to know
What exactly is the electoral college?
Article II of the US constitution lays out the process by which a president is elected.
Each state has a number of electors that’s equal to the total number of representatives and senators it has in Congress. Washington DC gets three electoral votes. In total, there are 538 electors. A candidate needs the votes of 270 of them, a simple majority, to win.
The constitution says that state legislatures can choose how they want to award their electors. All but two states have long chosen to use a winner-take-all system – the winner of the popular vote in their state gets all of the electoral votes.
To complicate matters further, two states, Maine and Nebraska, award their electors differently. In both states, two electoral college votes are allocated to the statewide winner. Each state then awards its remaining electors – two in Maine and three in Nebraska – to the winner in each of the state’s congressional districts.
Why does the US have an electoral college?
When the founding fathers gathered in Philadelphia to draft the US constitution in 1787, they had a lot of trouble figuring out a system for choosing a chief executive. Initially, they proposed a plan that would have Congress choose the president. But that led to concerns that the executive branch, designed to be independent from Congress, would be subject to it.
A contingent of the delegates also favored electing the president through a direct popular vote. But the idea never got broad support and was shut down repeatedly during the convention, the historian Alexander Keyssar wrote in his book Why do we still have the electoral college.
There were a number of reasons the idea was not widely popular. First, the convention had adopted the racist three-fifths compromise in which slaves were counted as three-fifths of a person for population purposes. This was a win for the southern states, in which slaves made up a sizable chunk of the population. A popular vote system would have disadvantaged the southern states because they had fewer people who could vote.
There were also concerns about giving too much power to larger states and that voters would be unable to learn about the candidates from different states, according to Keyssar. It was a debate driven more about pragmatics than about political rights, he writes.
Towards the end of the convention, a committee of 11 delegates was appointed to deal with unresolved matters and one of them was how to select the president. They proposed a version of what we have now come to understand as the electoral college.
“This brief nativity story makes clear that the presidential election system enshrined in the Constitution embodied a web of compromises, spawned by months of debate among men who disagreed with one another and were uncertain about the best way to proceed,” Keyssar wrote. “It was, in effect, a consensus second choice, made acceptable, in part, by the remarkably complex details of the electoral process, details that themselves constituted compromises among, or gestures toward, particular constituencies and convictions.”
What is a swing state?
States that either presidential candidate has a good shot at winning are often called “swing states”.
In the 2024 election, there are seven swing states: Pennsylvania (19 electoral votes), Wisconsin (10 electoral votes), Michigan (15 electoral votes), Georgia (16 electoral votes), North Carolina (16 electoral votes), Arizona (11 electoral votes), and Nevada (six electoral votes). Whichever candidate wins the election must carry some combination of those states, which is why the candidates will spend the majority of their time and resources there. Joe Biden carried all of those states bar North Carolina in the 2020 election.
The idea of a swing state can also change over time because of changing demographics. Until recently, for example, Ohio and Florida were considered swing states, but they are now considered pretty solidly Republican. Michigan was considered a pretty solid Democratic stronghold until Donald Trump won it in 2016.
Does the electoral college allow for minority rule?
There have been five elections in US history – in 1824, 1876, 1888, 2000 and 2016 – in which the candidate who became the president did not win the popular vote. This has led to wider recognition of imbalances in the system and a push from some to abolish the electoral college altogether.
The loudest criticism is that it’s a system that dilutes the influence of a presidential vote depending on where one lives. A single elector in California represents more than 726,000 people. In Wyoming, an elector represents a little more than 194,000 people.
Another critique is that the system allows a tiny number of Americans to determine the outcome of the presidential election. In 2020, about 44,000 votes between Wisconsin, Georgia and Arizona allowed Biden to win the electoral college. Such a slim margin is extraordinary in an election that 154.6 million people voted in.
In 2016, about 80,000 combined votes gave Trump his winning margins in key swing states.
Do electors have to vote for a specific candidate?
State political parties choose people to serve as electors who they believe are party stalwarts and will not go rogue and cast a vote for anyone other than the party’s nominee. Still, electors have occasionally cast their votes for someone else. In 2016, for example, there were seven electors who voted for candidates other than the ones they were pledged to. That was the first time there was a faithless elector since 1972, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.
Many states have laws that require electors to vote for the candidate they are pledged to. In 1952, the US supreme court said that states could compel electors to vote for the party’s nominee. And in 2020, the court said that states could penalize electors who don’t vote for the candidate they’re pledged to.
How has the electoral college remained in place for so long?
Since almost immediately after the electoral college was enacted, there have been efforts to change it. “There were constitutional amendments that were being promoted within a little more than a decade after the constitution was ratified,” Keyssar said. “There have been probably 1,000 or more constitutional amendments to change it or get rid of it filed since 1800. Some of them have some close.” (There were more than 700 efforts as recently as 2019, according to the Congressional Research Service.)
When the idea of a national popular vote was proposed in 1816, Keyssar said, southern states objected. Slaves continued to give them power in the electoral college, but could not vote. “They would lose that extra bonus they got on behalf of their slaves,” he said.
After the civil war, African Americans were legally entitled to vote, but southern states continued to suppress them from casting ballots. A national popular vote would have diminished their influence on the overall outcome, so they continued to support the electoral college system.
The country did get close to abolishing the electoral college once, in the late 1960s. In 1968, George Wallace, the southern segregationist governor, almost threw the system into chaos by nearly getting enough votes to deny any candidate a majority in the electoral college. The US House passed the proposed amendment 339 to 70. But the measure stalled in the Senate, where senators representing southern states filibustered.
That led to continued objections to a national popular vote so that southern white people could continue to wield power, according to the Washington Post. President Jimmy Carter eventually endorsed the proposal, but it failed to get enough votes in the Senate in 1979 (Joe Biden was one of the senators who voted against it).
“It’s not like we are suddenly discovering this system really doesn’t work,” Keyssar said.
Is there any chance of getting rid of the electoral college now?
The most prominent effort to get rid of the electoral college today is the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. The idea is to get states to agree to award their electors to the winner of the national popular vote, regardless of the outcome in their specific state. The compact would take effect when states having a total of 270 electoral votes – enough to determine the winner of the election – join.
So far 17 states and Washington DC – a total of 209 electoral votes – have joined the effort.
But the path ahead for the project is uncertain. Nearly all of the states that haven’t joined have either a Republican governor or legislature. And legal observers have questioned whether such an arrangement is constitutional – something that would probably be quickly put to the US supreme court.",2024-10-19
Guardian,The RBA will likely hold interest rates – but are its calculations at risk of being overtaken by US election chaos?,"When the Reserve Bank board meet next week to discuss interest rates, it will have an inescapable “best-laid schemes of mice and men” feel about it.
For sure, there will the usual meticulous assembly and assessment of data, including Wednesday’s relatively benign inflation figures.
The annual consumer price index landed at 2.8% for the September quarter from a year earlier, retreating for the seventh of the past eight quarters. It is now within the RBA’s 2%-3% target range for the first time since early 2021.
Most of the other trends were friends too. Underlying inflation, as measured by trimming off more volatile items, eased half a percentage point from the June quarter, to 3.5% – or about where the RBA had expected it to be by the end of 2024.
Shoppers may not yet appreciate it but the price of essentials, or non-discretionary items, were up 2.9%. Tradeable goods, including petrol, were barely up at all – rising just 0.6% – reflecting in part China’s faltering economy with more of their products exported.
Services were the most obvious holdout. It crept up for a second straight quarter to an annual pace of 4.6% – reflecting strong jobs growth in that sector – and will no doubt prompt the RBA governor, Michele Bullock, to repeat concerns about “sticky” inflation.
The RBA decision will almost certainly see it hold its cash rate at 4.35%, marking a year since its most recent rate hike. Attention will likely focus on whether the board at least considered a rate cut – something it hasn’t done in about four years.
As they do every quarter, the RBA’s monetary mavens will also update the central bank’s forecasts of where they think everything – from the oil price to government spending and household saving – will change over the next two years.
A routine event, as far as the schemes of the women and men of our central bank go. But how long might it take before Bullock’s nuanced comments or the finely calibrated forecasts are overtaken by events?
After all, the first polls will be opening in the US not long after the RBA’s board meeting wraps upon Tuesday.
Counting delays can be expected to elevate tensions – unless there is a decisive victory for Democrats or Republicans.
So far, markets seem to be adjusting to varying expectations of whether the US vice-president, Kamala Harris, will prevail for the Democrats or Donald Trump will make a return to the White House he reluctantly and ungraciously left four years ago.
“A Harris win is likely to see a great degree of policy continuity regarding trade (and, more broadly, industrial policy), immigration and Federal Reserve independence,” NAB’s senior economist, Tony Kelly, opined in a report released on Wednesday.
“A Trump presidency in contrast would pursue substantially different policy in these areas, although a divided Congress would impede some of his agenda.”
Trump’s promise of a 60% tariff on many imports is just one of the policy departures from the Democrat president, Joe Biden.
The RBA board will no doubt be mulling similar advice as it weighs up various scenarios – although don’t expect the wargaming to appear in its meeting minutes.
Perhaps everything will go smoothly in the world’s biggest economy. Everyone – in the US and elsewhere – can then return to dealing with more prosaic considerations, such as what December quarter inflation may look like and how soon might the RBA cut rates.
The alternative, though, of US political fights moving from the pulpit to the courts to the streets can’t be airily dismissed.",2024-10-30
Guardian,Trump’s mass deportation plan would be ‘economic disaster’ for US,"If elected, Donald Trump plans to carry out “the largest deportation operation in American history”. After pushback on Joe Biden’s border policies, Kamala Harris has embraced border restrictions and the need to maintain limits on asylum seekers. But neither candidate captures the realities of US immigration.
US consumers are accustomed to cheap goods and services, and the economic rationale for large-scale immigration has been largely avoided. In a country that relies on a mobile, low-cost workforce, the loss of migrant workers would trigger productivity losses and a new round of inflationary pricing pressure.
“It would be an economic disaster for America and Americans,” says Zeke Hernandez, an economics professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, of Trump’s deportations threat. “It’s not just the immigrants would be harmed, but we, the people of America, would be economically harmed.”
Baby boomers are retiring, and with fewer immigrants, the workforce will struggle to sustain economic output: US employers will need to hire 240,000 people a month for the next five years just to replace those who are stepping out, according to one recent study.
Hernandez, author of a recent book, The Truth About Immigration, argues that immigrants contribute talent, investment, innovation, consumption and tax revenue. “If you lose those things, there are fewer jobs, the economy contracts and becomes less diversified.”
Of the undocumented migrants, between 8 and 9 million are in the workforce doing essential jobs that Americans disproportionately don’t want to do or work in sectors where there aren’t enough workers.
Typically, that’s farm work (one third of the labor force), construction work (about one quarter) and about half of the labor force in skilled work like drywalling, plumbing and insulation.
“Undocumented immigrants make up a huge proportion of household services, manufacturing work, kitchen staff in restaurants. Americans simply do not do those jobs, or there are not enough to go around. But if you lose those key ‘bottleneck’ workers, the native workforce also can’t do their jobs,” says Hernandez.
A study by the Center for Migration Studies estimates undocumented workers contribute $97bn in federal, state and local taxes, their removal from the workforce would have a substantial impact on local economies, including pushing nearly 10 million US citizens into economic hardship.
Families would also be profoundly impacted. About 5.8m US households are home to at least one undocumented resident and mass deportations would break up nearly 5m US families. The cost of bringing up US-born children whose caregivers are removed has been put at $116bn.
Taxpayers would have to foot the bill. Apprehending and deporting just 1 million of an estimated 11 million-12 million undocumented migrants in the US could cost taxpayers about $20bn, or $19,599 per person, according to a CBS News analysis of federal data – and take far longer than the term of a four-year Trump administration.
Business leaders have been fairly quiet on Trump’s plans – possibly fearing retribution – but some lobby groups have begun to tally the costs of mass deportation. The construction sector employs an estimated 1.5 million undocumented workers, or 13% of its total workforce – a larger share than any other, according to data the Pew Research Center.
Construction firms, already facing labor shortages, are warning that the loss of immigrant workers would push new home prices higher. The National Association of Home Builders considers foreign-born workers, regardless of legal status, “a vital and flexible source of labor”.
The CEO of the NAHB, Jim Tobin, told NBC that their loss would be “detrimental to the construction industry and our labor supply and exacerbate our housing affordability problems”.
The Business Roundtable notes that “immigrants have always been a key part of America’s innovative spirit. A vast majority of economists and business leaders agree that immigration is a net positive for the US economy” but says “the system for welcoming these highly valuable workers is broken”.
A 2023 study of previous efforts at mass deportation, such as President Barack Obama’s Secure Communities program from 2008 to 2014 that resulted in the deportation of almost half a million people, found that any benefits from reduced job competition that US-born workers face were counteracted by a decline in labor demand due to an increase in labor costs.
“Police-based enforcement policies aimed at reducing the number of undocumented immigrants should consider the potential negative spillover effects on the labor market outcomes of immigrants who remain in the US and on US-born workers,” a University of Denver study concluded.
The same effect was seen during the Trump and Biden administrations when the Covid pandemic caused about a million fewer immigrants to enter the US leading to labor shortages and reduced output, and contributing to inflationary pressure.
The post-pandemic spike in immigration contributed to inflation coming down, according to Hernandez. “Immigration allowed business to hire again and raise output to what the market demands, so prices normalized,” he says.
Nevertheless opponents of immigration have been “very effective at flooding the zone with false or dubious claims”, said Hernandez.
Biden’s policies, which Harris is now walking back, have created complications for the Latino communities in the US, resulting in declining support for Democrats and a frantic late-campaign effort to shore up their votes. In 2012, Latino support for Obama was at 71%. Eight years later Biden won 62%. A recent Times/Siena poll found Harris with 56%.
According to Ana Valdez, president and CEO of the Latino Donor Collaborative, says the negative myths around Latino immigration are just “pure rhetoric … Trump knows that most of the workforce the US needs to continue growing comes from Latinos.”
Valdez cites labor department statistics that show Latino workers in the labor force have grown from 10.7 million in 1990 to 29 million in 2020, and are projected to reach 36 million in 2030. In 2030, the Bureau of Labor Statistics projects they will account for one out of every five workers in the labor force, at 21.2%, or or 78% of net new workers by 2030.
Without those immigrant workers, the change in the standard of living for the middle class would be much more dramatic, Valdez says. “The reason we have avocados or chicken to choose from every day is because of immigration.”
Valdez, who worked in the Clinton administration, cites figure that show US Latinos generate $3.6tn in GDP and says the political discourse around the issue by both parties has equated all Latinos to undocumented immigrants and does not reflect the economic, data-backed reality.
“If Trump and Harris want to win the Latino vote, and if the winner wants to keep our support once they’re in office, they need to change their perspective and messaging to Latinos and recognize the full scope of our economic contributions,” she says. “Not doing so is reckless for their campaigns and the US economy.”",2024-10-30
Guardian,Sun belt to October surprise: US election terms explained,"On Tuesday 5 November, Americans will vote after one of the most surprising and chilling election campaigns in history. President Joe Biden dropped out of the race to be replaced by his vice-president, Kamala Harris, while the Republican candidate, Donald Trump, survived an assassination attempt and was embroiled in multiple criminal cases.
The outcome in the world’s largest economy will have far-reaching consequences – both inside the US and globally – on the climate crisis, abortion and development.
Here are the terms you need to know.
Ballot measures
It isn’t just a choice between the Democratic ticket (Kamala Harris and Tim Walz) and the Republican one (Donald Trump and JD Vance) that voters will be asked to make in November. US ballots can also include ballot measures: statewide laws, issues or questions.
This year voters in 10 US states could be asked to vote on abortion law or measures. They are Missouri, Florida, Nebraska, Montana, Arizona, Nevada, Maryland, New York, South Dakota and Colorado.
Down-ballot voting
Measures on the ballot other than the vote for US presidential ticket are down-ballot measures, and a third or more of the roughly half of Americans who usually turn up to vote don’t fill out the entire ballot, according to the US Vote Foundation. Voters do not have to vote for any down-ballot measures for their ballots to count.
Electoral college
The electoral college is a group of 538 people, called electors, who officially cast their votes for the US president after citizens have voted. This is a requirement outlined in the US constitution. The electors are chosen by political parties in each of the US’s 50 states ahead of the election.
Different states have different numbers of electoral college votes, with the number decided based on the census. The number of votes is equal to its total congressional delegation: the number of senators plus the number of representatives. While not a state, the District of Columbia – as in Washington DC – is allocated three electoral college votes.
This is why the total is 538: 100 senators plus 435 representatives plus three for DC.
A candidate needs more than half – or at least 270 – of the electoral college votes to win. In most states, all of the electoral college votes from the state go to the same candidate. The exceptions are Maine and Nebraska, which allocate two electoral votes to the state popular vote winner, and then one electoral vote to the popular vote winner in each congressional district.
The party that wins a state has its electors formally vote for its candidate. This happens a few weeks after the November election – and after US states have certified their election results – on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December.
In 2020 Donald Trump tried to remove electors in some states before the electoral college vote but the US supreme court rejected that attempt the week before.
Popular vote
The popular vote is the overall number of qualified voters who voted for a given candidate: in other words, the number of ballots cast for one candidate or another. The main thing to know about the popular vote is that winning it does not mean you win the presidency. The presidency is won by the candidate who gains the majority of electoral college votes. In other words: the US election is decided by races in individual states. In the 2016 election, Donald Trump received fewer votes than Hillary Clinton but still won the presidency and in 2000, George W Bush received fewer votes than Al Gore but also won.
Canvassing and certification
Canvassing is the process of counting ballots and tabulating results. This includes checks to ensure the results are valid, including ensuring every ballot is accounted for, and repeatedly verifying the results.
Canvassing ends with certification, where the canvassing process is signed off on. In short, it is the official confirmation of the results.
County election officials certify the canvass by signing a declaration that results, reported by precincts, are a complete and accurate record of every vote cast.
Certification is mandatory and codified in law, meaning officials cannot refuse to certify a result, though some have refused to do so. Though the certification process has “long been regarded as an administrative afterthought”, according to the Associated Press, there are fears this could happen again in November.
Red state, blue state, swing state
A red state is a one that tends to vote Republican, a blue state one that tends to vote Democrat, and a swing state one that swings between the two major parties from one election to the next.
Swing states, or battleground states, are where campaigns tend to spend the most money trying to win over undecided voters, or voters who they hope might be convinced to switch from supporting the other team to theirs.
Voters in the seven swing states are likely to decide the election this year. The states, and the number of electoral college votes up for grabs, are Arizona (11), Georgia (16), Michigan (15), Nevada (6), North Carolina (16), Pennsylvania (19) and Wisconsin (10). Together they account for 93 electoral college votes, or more than a third of what a candidate needs to win.
Swing states are less commonly referred to as “toss-up” or “purple” states – the latter referring to a mix of blue and red.
Blue wall, red wall
The blue wall refers to 18 US states and the District of Columbia – home to Washington DC – that voted Democrat from 1992 to 2012.
In 2016 Trump won by clinching three blue wall states: Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
The red wall is less commonly used as a phrase but once referred to the states running from South Carolina to Idaho. In 2020 Time magazine referred to it as “more like a pink curtain or pink pond” because it had started to break down.
Rust belt
The rust belt is a collection of states in the US north-east and midwest where industries such as manufacturing and coalmining have declined – or “been left to rust”. It is an economic region rather than a geographical one. Michigan, home to Detroit, once the centre of the US automotive industry, is one of these.
It is generally seen as encompassing a large part of the midwest (Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio and Wisconsin) along with Pennsylvania, West Virginia and parts of New York, according to Encyclopeda Britannicato Encyclopedia Britannica.
There are three swing states in the midwestern rust belt – Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin – which is why it is important in any election, including this one.
Winning these states is one of Kamala Harris’s paths to victory – or gaining enough electoral college votes – according to analysts who modelled the pathways based on polling. The other path to victory for Harris and the Democrats is the sun belt (more on what that refers to below). According to the model, Trump would need to capture both groups of states to earn the 270 electoral college votes necessary to secure victory.
The sun belt
The sun belt includes 15 states extending across the southern US, from south-west to south-east, which have a sunnier or milder climate than the northern states.
It includes the four swing states of Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia. The remaining three swing states are in the rust belt.
Bible belt, flyover states
The Bible belt is the American south and tends to be Christian and conservative – and vote Republican. It includes the states of Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Arkansas, South Carolina, Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia and Oklahoma. The city of Tulsa in the state of Oklahoma is known as the “buckle” of the Bible belt.
Flyover states, or flyover country, also known as middle America, are the states at the centre of the country, between the US east and west coasts – the country’s most populous areas. A third of Americans live in just four states: California, Texas, Florida and New York.
Absentee ballots or mail-in voting
These are votes cast by mail, or in person, depending on a state’s rules, before election day. Trump has called for an end to mail-in voting. This is partly because in the 2020 election, many Americans voted by mail because of the Covid pandemic, and more Democrats than Republicans chose this option. Seven million more Democrats than Republicans voted early in the 20 states that compile party data.
Provisional ballots
When a voter’s name does not appear on the voter registration list at the polling place at their precinct on election day, they may be given a provisional ballot, which allows them to vote but means their vote is placed in a separate “secrecy envelope” rather than the ballot box. The registration status of these voters is then determined. If they are registered, their vote is counted.
In 2018 a voter named Crystal Mason was sentenced to five years in prison for casting a provisional ballot in the 2016 election without realising she was ineligible to vote. The case was seen as part of a broader Republican effort to intimidate people from voting. Mason was acquitted in 2024.
Voter suppression
Voter suppression tactics are laws, measures or misinformation designed to prevent people – for example people of colour, more of whom tend to vote Democrat, according to research from Pew – from voting or registering to vote.
Voting advocates in the south told the Guardian in 2023 that they felt they were playing Whac-A-Mole, trying to educate and register voters while also having to work to defeat suppressive legislation that would impose new rules on mail-in voting or limit drop boxes or require proof of citizenship to vote.
The various tactics are too complicated to go into here. But Georgia is a telling example. In 2021 Georgia Republicans enacted SB 202, a bill with sweeping voting restrictions, including a ban on giving out food or water within 150ft (45.7m) of a polling place or within 25ft (7.6m) of any voter standing in a line – which could extend well beyond the 150ft radius. Violating it is a misdemeanour punishable by up to a year in prison and a $1,000 fine.
Georgia had seen long lines to vote and many saw the measure as an obvious attempt to make it harder for Black voters to cast a ballot. The law was darkly ridiculed in an episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm.
Path to victory
The path to victory refers to how a candidate wins 270 electoral college votes – rather than, for example, the most votes overall – and therefore wins the election. It involves targeting certain states – swing states and their electoral college votes – with time, money and messaging. It often involves candidates’ chances in and focus on rust belt and sun belt states, which encompass the seven swing states and their all-important electoral college votes.
Surrogates
Campaign surrogates are individuals who speak publicly on behalf of a political candidate, typically to promote them. Think Oprah, Obama and Joe Biden for Harris, or Hulk Hogan and Nikki Haley for Trump.
October surprise
This is the term for a news event that happens just before the election, in other words October – because the election is always held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November – that influences the election’s outcome. For example the Access Hollywood tape, or the John Podesta emails in the 2016 election.",2024-10-10
Guardian,"I don’t expect stone-cold truths from a chatshow, but Saoirse Ronan delivered one | Marina Hyde","In a development that absolutely must not catch on, something interesting has happened on a TV chatshow. What a precedent: I’m desperately hoping the entertainment industry rallies around to prevent it ever happening again. We can probably count on it. The dance of all chatshows these days is almost entirely mechanised. You go on. You do your rehearsed anecdotes. The news that the late Michael Parkinson is being relaunched as an AI barely raises an eyebrow because it’s all so synthetic anyway.
Therefore the moments when it isn’t take on outsize significance. As you may have guessed, we are talking about last Friday’s episode of The Graham Norton Show, on which the Blitz star Saoirse Ronan appeared as a guest alongside Gladiator II actors Denzel Washington and Paul Mescal and Day of the Jackal leading man Eddie Redmayne. We join the sofa as Redmayne is doing an anecdote about how his Jackal preparation involved being trained in self-defence, in order to do what Team America would call “his acting”. (Not how Eddie put it, obviously. And yet, the reality.) Redmayne’s revelation that he was shown how to use a phone as a weapon if attacked proves quite the hoot, with Mescal riffing on the absurdity – “Who’s actually going to do that, though?” – Norton chiming in, and Denzel laughing along. Ronan is trying to say something but she gets honked over, before managing to cut through with a line for the ages: “That’s what girls have to think about all the time”.
Oooooof. The look on the other actors’ faces after Saoirse has detonated this chat-icide bomb is hilariously mesmerising, as is the sudden silence, which is split-second but also seems to last 27 years. Ronan obligingly diffuses it by provoking audience applause with a rallying, “amirite ladies?”. And then everyone moves on. Well, everyone except the internet, which has been picking over the entrails ever since.
The clip itself will be familiar to any woman who has ever wondered if they can be arsed interrupting some self-styled comedy gold happening around them to say something that matters to them. As mentioned, Saoirse herself has at least one failed attempt at interjection before waiting, as one must, and trying again – at which point the guys are having such a rip-roaring time doing their bit that they initially don’t appear to realise she has opted not to respond with the timeworn improv gambit “yes and … ”.
Possibly the best part of the entire thing is the moment after, surely a shoo-in for the Best Silence Oscar. Personally I’d have liked it to have been broken by Denzel thundering “WHERE IS YOUR IMPROV NOW?”, but for some reason such lines desert our leading men. Caught unawares, Redmayne offers a sort of wan yas-kween nod. But the applause for Ronan is seized on as a natural break, and the conversation moves on without anyone at all discussing by far and away the most fascinating thing said on the sofa thus far.
But look, I know what you might be thinking: is all this unfair? I mean, they’re only on a flipping chatshow, aren’t they? The trouble is that there are so few of these sort of moments in the obsessively controlled world of contemporary showbiz that we are left with the somewhat absurd situation of twats like me remorselessly analysing this tiny clip like we’re huddled in the White House situation room watching live footage of some Seal team raid on a stronghold, and holding our breath for the kill order. And yet, this one proves no less satisfying each time you see it. Ladies and gentlemen – she got ’em.
No one is suggesting that the male actors and presenter involved deserve some huge backlash for this. What people are saying is that the moment was telling. When clips like this go viral, it’s for a reason. For this many civilians to share them – this many female civilians, let’s face it – means they instantly saw something they recognised. Most, if not absolutely all, women have been in a version of that conversation in their time, and almost all of us have not found the precise words to say in the moment it was happening, instead either coming up with them while stewing on the way home, or two weeks later in the middle of the night (still stewing).
For the right words to be found in the moment, on primetime television, is a fantasy arguably more powerful than any of the ones the chaps are currently promoting in their movies and prestige TV projects. No offence to the Roman gladiator, former-Roman-gladiator-turned-arms-dealer, and public school assassin with whom Saoirse was sharing the sofa. But Mescal and Washington just got totally colosseumed, while Redmayne took an absolute burn bullet to the forehead.
Even now, their publicists will be frantically workshopping reflective answers for pending interviews in which they may be asked about Ronan’s point. What makes it somehow more darkly amusing is that these particular three male actors are always projected as being among the good guys of showbiz. And I’m sure they are. But what they can’t do, even with all their combined decades of Acting, is think their way into the part of literally any woman, in any place, walking home after dark or on an almost deserted route on just another day of a lifetime of knowing she could be prey. You get quite good at thinking about how boring little things like phones or keys could defend you in those moments, as any woman will wearily concede. We all dream of a future without this forever hum of fear, where we too could join in the absurdist joke.
And yes, of course it was all just a joke. But consider the real-life context in which this tiny little sofa vignette occurred. We are a week off a US presidential election in which the fact that the bookies’ favourite has been accused of multiple sexual assaults over multiple decades has not even been an election issue. Even with my expectations adjusted to meet the times, it will never not blow my mind that we are going to get to the end of this presidential campaign and the fact that at least 26 – TWENTY SIX – women have accused one candidate of sexual assault just has not even remotely dominated the news cycle. There has not been one week or even one day in which that message has caught fire and everyone has talked of absolutely nothing else. It is just – what? – accepted? Expected? Priced in? Boring? Either way, perhaps it helps explain why many women are not in their best “take a joke” mood right now.
