BBC,Would Donald Trump’s taxes on trade hurt US consumers?,"Would Donald Trump’s taxes on trade hurt US consumers?
Donald Trump has pledged to drastically increase tariffs on foreign goods entering the US if he is elected president again.
He has promised tariffs - a form of tax - of up to 20% on goods from other countries and 60% on all imports from China. He has even talked about a 200% tax on some imported cars.
Tariffs are a central part of Trump's economic vision - he sees them as a way of growing the US economy, protecting jobs and raising tax revenue.
He has claimed on the campaign trail that these taxes are ""not going to be a cost to you, it’s a cost to another country"".
This is almost universally regarded by economists as misleading.
How do tariffs work?
In practical terms, a tariff is a domestic tax levied on goods as they enter the country, proportional to the value of the import.
So a car imported to the US with a value of $50,000 (£38,000) subject to a 10% tariff, would face a $5,000 charge.
The charge is physically paid by the domestic company that imports the goods, not the foreign company that exports them.
So, in that sense, it is a straightforward tax paid by domestic US firms to the US government.
Over the course of 2023, the US imported around $3,100bn of goods, equivalent to around 11% of US GDP.
And tariffs imposed on those imports brought in $80bn in that year, around 2% of total US tax revenues.
The question of where the final “economic” burden of tariffs falls, as opposed to the upfront bill, is more complicated.
If the US importing firm passes on the cost of the tariff to the person buying the product in the US in the form of higher retail prices, it would be the US consumer that bears the economic burden.
If the US importing firm absorbs the cost of the tariff itself and doesn’t pass it on, then that firm is said to bear the economic burden in the form of lower profits than it would otherwise have enjoyed.
Alternatively, it is possible that foreign exporters might have to lower their wholesale prices by the value of the tariff in order to retain their US customers.
In that scenario, the exporting firm would bear the economic burden of the tariff in the form of lower profits.
All three scenarios are theoretically possible.
But economic studies of the impact of the new tariffs that Trump imposed in his first term of office between 2017 and 2020 suggest most of the economic burden was ultimately borne by US consumers.
A survey by the University of Chicago in September 2024 asked a group of respected economists whether they agreed with the statement that ""imposing tariffs results in a substantial portion of the tariffs being borne by consumers of the country that enacts the tariffs, through price increases"". Only 2% disagreed.
Raising prices
Let’s use a concrete example.
Trump imposed a 50% tariff on imports of washing machines in 2018.
Researchers estimate the value of washing machines jumped by around 12% as a direct consequence, equivalent to $86 per unit, and that US consumers paid around $1.5bn extra a year in total for these products.
There is no reason to believe the results of even higher import tariffs from a future Trump administration would be any different in terms of where the economic burden would fall.
The non-partisan Peterson Institute for International Economics has estimated Trump’s new proposed tariffs would lower the incomes of Americans, with the impact ranging from around 4% for the poorest fifth to around 2% for the wealthiest fifth.
A typical household in the middle of the US income distribution, the think tank estimates, would lose around $1,700 each year.
The left-of-centre think tank Centre for American Progress, using a different methodology, has an estimate of a $2,500 to $3,900 loss for a middle-income family.
Various researchers have also warned that another major round of tariffs from the US would risk another spike in domestic inflation.
Impact on jobs
Yet Trump has used another economic justification for his tariffs: that they protect and create US domestic jobs.
“Under my plan, American workers will no longer be worried about losing your jobs to foreign nations, instead, foreign nations will be worried about losing their jobs to America,"" he said on the campaign trail.
The political context for Trump’s tariffs was longstanding concern about the loss of US manufacturing jobs to countries with lower labour costs, particularly after the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) with Mexico in 1994 and the entry of China into the World Trade Organisation in 2001.
In January 1994, when Nafta came into effect, the US had just under 17 million manufacturing jobs. By 2016, this had declined to around 12 million.
Yet economists say it is misleading to attribute this decline to trade, arguing that growing levels of automation are also an important factor.
And researchers who studied the impact of Trump’s first-term tariffs found no substantial positive effects on overall employment in US industrial sectors that were protected.
Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imported steel in 2018 to protect US producers.
By 2020, total employment in the US steel sector was 80,000, still lower than the 84,000 it had been in 2018.
It is theoretically possible that employment might have dropped even further without the Trump steel tariffs but detailed economic studies of their impact on US steel still showed no positive employment impact.
And economists have also found evidence suggesting that, because the domestic price of steel rose after the tariffs were imposed, employment in some other US manufacturing sectors, which relied on steel as an input - including the agricultural machinery manufacturer Deere & Co - was lower than it otherwise would have been.
Impact on trade deficit
Trump has criticised America's trade deficit, which is the difference between the value of all the things the country imports and the value of its exports in a given year.
“Trade deficits hurt the economy very badly,” he has said.
In 2016, just before Trump took office, the total goods and services deficit was $480bn, around 2.5% of US GDP. By 2020, it had grown to $653bn, around 3% of GDP, despite his tariffs.
Part of the explanation, according to economists, is that Trump’s tariffs increased the international relative value of the US dollar (by automatically reducing demand for foreign currencies in international trade) and that this made the products of US exporters less competitive globally.
Another factor behind this failure to close the trade deficit is the fact that tariffs, in a globalised economy with multinational companies, can sometimes be bypassed.
For example, the Trump administration imposed 30% tariffs on Chinese imported solar panels in 2018.
The US Commerce Department presented evidence in 2023 that Chinese solar panel manufacturers had shifted their assembly operations to countries such as Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam and then sent the finished products to the US from those countries, effectively evading the tariffs.
There are some economists who support Trump’s tariff plans as a way to boost US industry, such as Jeff Ferry of the Coalition for A Prosperous America, a domestic lobby group, but they are a small minority of the profession.
Oren Cass, the director of the conservative think tank American Compass, has argued tariffs can incentivise firms to keep more of their manufacturing operations in America, which he argues has national defence and supply chain security benefits.
And the Biden/Harris administration, while sharply criticising Trump’s proposed extension of tariffs, has kept in place many of the ones he implemented after 2018.
It has also imposed new tariffs on imports of things like electric vehicles from China, justifying them on the grounds of national security, US industrial policy and unfair domestic subsidies from Beijing.",2024-10-14
BBC,Moscow and Putin cautious about a Donald Trump second term,"Moscow had high hopes for Trump in 2016. It's more cautious this time
Piece of advice for you - never buy a huge amount of champagne unless you’re absolutely certain it’s worth celebrating.
In November 2016, Russian ultranationalist politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky was so excited by Donald Trump’s victory, and so sure that it would transform US-Russian relations, he splashed out on 132 bottles of bubbly down at the Duma, Russia’s parliament, and partied away (in his party offices) in front of the TV cameras.
He wasn’t the only one celebrating.
The day after Trump's surprise White House win, Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of state channel RT, tweeted her intention to drive around Moscow with an American flag in her car window.
And I’ll never forget the moment a Russian official told me she had smoked a cigar and drunk a bottle of champagne (yes, MORE champagne) to toast Trump winning.
In Moscow, expectations were high that Trump would scrap sanctions against Russia; perhaps, even, recognise the Crimean Peninsula, annexed from Ukraine, as part of Russia.
“The value of Trump was that he never preached on human rights in Russia,” explains Konstantin Remchukov, the owner and editor-in-chief of newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta.
It didn’t take long for all that fizz to go flat.
“Trump introduced the heaviest sanctions against Russia at that time,” recalls Remchukov.
“By the end of his term, a lot of people were disappointed in his presidency.""
Which is why, eight years on - publicly at least - Russian officials are more cautious about the prospect of a second Trump term.
President Vladimir Putin has even come out and backed the Democratic Party candidate, although that ""endorsement"" was widely interpreted as a Kremlin joke (or Kremlin trolling).
Putin claimed he liked Kamala Harris’s “infectious” laugh.
But you don’t need to be a seasoned political pundit to understand that out on the campaign trail it’s what Trump has been saying, not Harris, that’s guaranteed to put a smile on Putin’s face.
For instance, Trump’s criticism of the scale of US military assistance for Ukraine, his apparent reluctance to blame Putin for Russia’s full-scale invasion and, during the presidential debate, his refusal to say whether he wants Ukraine to win the war.
By contrast, Kamala Harris has argued that support for Ukraine is in America’s “strategic interest” and she has referred to Putin as “a murderous dictator”.
Not that Russian state TV has been particularly complimentary about her either. A few weeks ago one of Russia’s most acerbic news anchors was completely dismissive of Harris’s political abilities. He suggested she would be better off hosting a TV cookery show.

- FACT-CHECK: What the numbers really say about crime
There’s another possible outcome that may well suit the Kremlin - a super tight election, followed by a contested result. An America consumed by post-election chaos, confusion and confrontation would have less time to focus on foreign affairs, including the war in Ukraine.
US-Russian relations soured under Barack Obama, grew worse under Donald Trump and, in the words of the recently departed Russian ambassador to Washington Anatoly Antonov, they are “falling apart” under Joe Biden.
Washington lays the blame fully on Moscow.
It was just eight months after Putin and Biden met for a summit in Geneva that the Kremlin leader ordered the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine.
Not only did the Biden administration send a tsunami of sanctions Russia’s way, but US military aid has been crucial in helping Kyiv survive more than two-and-a-half years of Russia’s war. Amongst the advanced weaponry America has supplied Ukraine are Abrams tanks and HIMARS rocket systems.
It’s hard to believe now that there was a time, not so long ago, when Russia and the US pledged to work as partners to strengthen global security.
In the late 1980s Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev formed a geo-political double-act to slash their countries’ respective nuclear arsenals.
If there was one thing Reagan seemed to enjoy as much as nuclear disarmament it was reciting Russian proverbs to Gorbachev in broken Russian (“Never buy 132 bottles of champagne unless you’re certain it’s worth celebrating” would have been a good one).
In 1991 the First Ladies of the USSR and America, Raisa Gorbacheva and Barbara Bush, unveiled an unusual monument in Moscow - a mother duck with eight ducklings.
It was a replica of a sculpture in Boston Public Gardens and was presented to Moscow as a symbol of friendship between Soviet and American children.
It’s still popular with Muscovites today. Russians flock to Novodevichy Park to pose for photos with the bronze birds, although few visitors know the back story of superpower “duck diplomacy”.
Like US-Russian relations themselves, the ducks have taken a few knocks. On one occasion some of them were stolen and had to be replaced.
It’s to the Moscow mallard and her ducklings I head to find out what Russians think of America and of the US election.
“I want America to disappear,” says angry angler Igor who’s fishing in a nearby pond. “It has started so many wars in the world. The US was our enemy in Soviet times and it still is. It doesn’t matter who’s president.”
America as Russia’s eternal enemy - that’s a worldview often reflected here in the state media. Is Igor so angry because he gets his news from Russian TV? Or perhaps it’s because he hasn’t caught many fish.
Most of the people I chat to here do not see America as an evil adversary.
“I’m all for peace and friendship,” says Svetlana. “But my friend in America is scared to call me now. Maybe there’s no free speech there. Or, perhaps, it’s here in Russia that there’s no freedom of speech. I don’t know.”

“Our countries and our two peoples should be friends,” says Nikita, “without wars and without competing to see who has more missiles. I prefer Trump. When he was president there weren’t any big wars.”
Despite the differences between Russia and America there is one thing the two countries have in common - they have always had male presidents.
Can Russians ever see that changing?
“I think it would be great if a woman became president,” says Marina.
“I would be happy to vote for a woman president here [in Russia]. I’m not saying it would be better or worse. But it would be different.”

BBC,Michigan swing state profile,"A quick guide to swing state Michigan
Michigan, famous for its Great Lakes, the Mustang and Madonna, is one of seven states that will decide the 2024 US presidential election.
Voting in swing states is hard to predict and can swing Republican or Democrat - that’s why you’re hearing so much about them as campaigning draws to a close.
Here’s all you need to know.
Population
10.03m, same as Greece
Electoral college votes
15 of 538
In a nutshell
Michigan helped propel Trump to victory in 2016, before Biden took the state back in 2020.
2020 margin
Biden by 150,000 votes
What's the deal now?
Neither Harris nor Trump is taking Michigan for granted in 2024. The candidates are focusing on Michigan’s large auto industry as well as national issues such as the economy and immigration.
What are voters saying?
Michigan is home to a diverse group of voters, from its major city and Democratic stronghold of Detroit to its many rural Republican small towns. Much like elsewhere in the country, voters here are concerned about the rising cost of living.
“I’ve never been able to even afford a house. I’ve been waiting for years,” said Darrell Sumpter, a 52-year-old who voted for Trump in 2020 and is leaning toward Harris this year.
Detroit is the heart of the automotive industry in the US, making the issue top of mind for voters in the surrounding areas. The war in the Middle East also hits close to home in Michigan, which has the largest Arab-American population in the US.
What's the expert view?
Political scientists say Democrats are focusing on building up support in the state’s largest left-leaning counties, Oakland, Washtenaw and Wayne, while the Trump campaign tries to chip away at votes in swing districts like Macomb County, relying on rural support. Democrats are also trying to win back voters who veered toward Trump when he won in 2016.
“White, non-college voters, manual workers, lots of people who are traditionally affiliated with unions… have been moving towards Republicans,” says Michigan State University professor of political science Matt Grossmann.
Both sides are focused on Michigan’s swing voters, a group that is frustrated by inflation and is typically made up of “lower middle-class or working-class voters who just don't really pay attention to politics on a daily basis,” says University of Michigan political scientist Jonathan Hanson.
What to watch out for on election night
- Harris needs a big margin of victory in Democratic counties like Oakland and Wayne, home to Detroit, while Trump will want to comfortably win Republican-leaning districts like Macomb and Kent County
- Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin and Republican Mike Rogers are locked in a tight race for Democratic incumbent Debbie Stabenow’s US Senate seat, as Democrats try to maintain slim control of the Senate

BBC,Badenoch admits she may need a softer approach,"Badenoch says she may need a softer approach
Conservative leadership contender Kemi Badenoch has said she will tone down her approach – after some of her colleagues suggested she can be rude.
Badenoch is widely seen as the favourite to replace Rishi Sunak as Tory leader when the results of the party membership vote are revealed on Saturday.
Quizzed on a perception that she can seen as abrasive, Badenoch agreed she may need to take a more softly-softly approach.
""I think this is one of the manifestations that I don't think I'm being rude,"" she told the BBC’s Newscast podcast, as she put her demeanour down to “having a higher threshold for stress"".
""I just think I'm saying something that I wouldn't mind hearing back, so I treat people how I treat myself and, you know, I've had even some of my advisors saying, why did you say that?
""I have to be mindful that I have a higher tolerance for things than others, and I think part of being a leader is being able to calibrate so that you can help manage other people.”
Asked if she would adopt a more softly-softly approach from now on, she said ""yes, but that's fine"", adding ""I'm not perfect, you know, I've never said that I was perfect"".
She continued: ""We keep wanting people who will give the perfect interview and have the perfect policies look perfect.
""There's nobody like that. Everybody's coming with pluses and minuses.""
Badenoch, who has done very few interviews with journalists compared to her rival Jenrick, also suggested there was a low turnout of Tory members voting for their new party leader.
""I'm doing more media this week specifically because people aren’t turning out to vote as much as we would have expected,"" she said.
Chatting to Conservative members at events, Badenoch said, she would ask whether people had voted and be told ""well, no, they haven't. We're going to wait till the last minute.""
But the former business secretary said she wasn’t worried Tory party members weren’t voting for her and claimed to be ""sanguine"" about the results.
""I don't know if I will win,"" she said.
""The bookies have me ahead, but I think it's actually neck and neck.
""Robert could win. Anyone could win. Either of us could win.""
Perhaps party members didn’t like the choice they were presented with, Badenoch was asked.
She responded: ""Well, there's nothing I can do about that. That's politics.""

BBC,US election polls tracker 2024: Who is ahead - Harris or Trump?,"US election polls: Who is ahead - Harris or Trump?
Voters in the US go to the polls on 5 November to elect their next president.
The election was initially a rematch of 2020 but it was upended in July when President Joe Biden ended his campaign and endorsed Vice-President Kamala Harris.
The big question now is - will America get its first woman president or a second Donald Trump term?
As election day approaches, we'll be keeping track of the polls and seeing what effect the campaign has on the race for the White House.
Who is leading national polls?
Harris has had a small lead over Trump in the national polling averages since she entered the race at the end of July and she remains ahead - as shown in the chart below with the latest figures rounded to the nearest whole number.
Harris saw a bounce in her polling numbers in the first few weeks of her campaign, building a lead of nearly four percentage points towards the end of August.
The polls were relatively stable in September and early October but they have tightened in the last couple of weeks, as shown in the chart below, with trend lines showing the averages and dots for individual poll results for each candidate.
While national polls are a useful guide as to how popular a candidate is across the whole country, they're not the best way to predict the election result.
That's because the US uses an electoral college system, in which each state is given a number of votes roughly in line with the size of its population. A total of 538 electoral college votes are up for grabs, so a candidate needs to hit 270 to win.
There are 50 states in the US but because most of them nearly always vote for the same party, in reality there are just a handful where both candidates stand a chance of winning. These are the places where the election will be won and lost and are known as battleground states or swing states.
Who is winning in swing state polls?
Right now the leads in the swing states are so small that it's impossible to know who is really ahead from looking at the polling averages.
Polls are designed to broadly explain how the public feels about a candidate or an issue, not predict the result of an election by less than a percentage point so it's important to keep that in mind when looking at the numbers below.
It's also important to remember that the individual polls used to create these averages have a margin of error of around three to four percentage points, so either candidate could be doing better or worse than the numbers currently suggest.
If you look at the trends since Harris joined the race, it does highlight some differences between the states.
In Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina, the lead has changed hands a few times since the start of August but Trump has a small lead in all of them at the moment. It’s a similar story in Nevada but with Harris the candidate who is slightly ahead.
In the three other states - Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - Harris had led since the start of August, sometimes by two or three points, but the polls have tightened significantly and Trump now has a very small lead in Pennsylvania.
All three of those states had been Democratic strongholds before Trump turned them red on his path to winning the presidency in 2016. Biden retook them in 2020 and if Harris can do the same then she will be on course to win the election.
In a sign of how the race has changed since Harris became the Democratic nominee, on the day that Biden quit the race he was trailing Trump by nearly five percentage points on average in the seven swing states.
In Pennsylvania, Biden was behind by nearly 4.5 percentage points when he dropped out, as the chart below shows. It is a key state for both campaigns as it has the highest number of electoral votes of the seven and therefore winning it makes it easier to reach the 270 votes needed.
How are these averages created?
The figures we have used in the graphics above are averages created by polling analysis website 538, which is part of American news network ABC News. To create them, 538 collects the data from individual polls carried out both nationally and in battleground states by lots of polling companies.
As part of its quality control, 538 only includes polls from companies that meet certain criteria, like being transparent about how many people they polled, when the poll was carried out and how the poll was conducted (telephone calls, text message, online, etc).
You can read more about the 538 methodology here.
Can we trust the polls?
The polls have underestimated support for Trump in the last two elections and the national polling error in 2020 was the highest in 40 years according to a post-mortem by polling experts - so there’s good reason to be cautious about them going into this year’s election.
The polling miss in 2016 was put down to voters changing their minds in the final days of the campaign and because college-educated voters - who were more likely to support Hillary Clinton - had been over-represented in polling samples.
In 2020, the experts pointed to problems with getting Trump supporters to take part in polls, but said it was “impossible” to know exactly what had caused the polling error, especially as the election was held during a pandemic and had a record turnout.
Pollsters have made lots of changes since then and the polling industry “had one of its most successful election cycles in US history” in the 2022 midterm elections, according to analysts at 538.
But Donald Trump wasn’t on the ballot in the midterms and we won’t know until after election day whether these changes can deal with the influx of irregular voters he tends to attract.

BBC,"Takeaways from the VP debate: a muted mic, abortion and civility","Muted mics and politeness - six takeaways from VP debate
On Tuesday night, JD Vance and Tim Walz launched attacks on their presidential opponents, sparring over international conflict, the US economy, immigration and abortion rights.
Despite those heated moments - and at least one muted microphone - it was perhaps the most civil debate of the 2024 election campaign. There were even points of common ground between the two men.
Here are some of the most memorable parts of the first and only scheduled TV showdown between the running mates of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump.
- WHO WON? Anthony Zurcher analyses the showdown
- VOTER PANEL: Midwest voters praise tone of VP debate
- BBC VERIFY: Immigration, Project 2025, taxes - the debate fact-checked
- POLL-TRACKER: Who's leading the US presidential race?
1) Vance vows to win back voters' 'trust' on abortion
Abortion rights, a top issue in the 2024 election, sparked one of the longest and most heated exchanges of the night.
It's an issue Democrats have used to galvanize voters, regularly framing Trump as a threat to women's autonomy because of his role in appointing a conservative majority to the Supreme Court. The court later overturned Roe v Wade, the ruling that had protected abortion rights in the US for decades.
Walz cited the stories of Amber Thurman and Candi Miller, two women from Georgia whose deaths were connected to abortion restrictions in their home state.
Vance, meanwhile, said his opinion on the issue had changed. He previously supported some type of national restrictions on abortion, but said his position shifted when he saw the majority of Ohio voters supported access to abortion.
He also said his party had to do ""so much better... at earning the American people's trust back on this issue, where they frankly just don't trust us"".
2) Vance has no answer to Trump 2020 defeat
Walz had his best moment of the night near the end when the focus shifted to the 6 January 2021 riot and election denialism.
In a tense exchange, Vance refused to say that Trump had lost the 2020 election, prompting some disbelief from Walz who called it a ""damning non-answer"".
The moderators also raised Vance's previous comments that he would not have certified the 2020 election results if he had been vice-president at the time.
Vance maintained his support for Trump, saying the former president had asked demonstrators on the day of the Capitol riot to protest peacefully.
He added that Walz would have his best wishes if the Democrats win the 5 November election, but said there were legitimate questions to raise about voting fraud and security.
Walz said he and his opponent were ""miles apart"" on the issue of 6 January and election integrity.
3) Middle East tensions loom large
Walz and Vance took the stage just hours after Iran launched a missile attack on Israel - whose prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, vowed retaliation.
The ongoing tensions in the Middle East formed the basis of the first question.
Appearing nervous, Walz stumbled as he repeated Harris's promise of iron-clad support for Israel.
Vance, meanwhile, reiterated one of Trump's main talking points: that no new world conflicts broke out during the former president's time in office.
Neither man would say if they approved of a pre-emptive strike by Israel on Iran.
4) Mics muted after a tussle over immigration
Immigration was a key topic throughout the 90-minute head-to-head. Vance, a Republican senator from Ohio, frequently returned to the issue of the US southern border and immigration - viewed by many voters as a weakness for his opponents.
Walz, the Democratic governor of Minnesota, countered that Trump helped torpedo bipartisan legislation that would have enacted some of the toughest immigration policy in US history.
The discussion ultimately turned tense when Vance was asked about false claims he made about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio. Vance and Trump previously shared conspiracy theories that illegal migrants were eating pets in the small city.
When a CBS News moderator tried to correct Vance, the Ohio senator spoke over the hosts - who went on to mute his microphone.
5) 'I'm a knucklehead at times,' Walz admits
Just before the debate, a claim of Walz's collapsed under scrutiny - that he had been in Hong Kong when the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre occurred in Beijing.
""I'm a knucklehead at times,"" Walz said when asked about it on Tuesday night.
The Minnesota governor clarified that he had misspoken, saying he was influenced by the events because he had arrived in China that summer.
Vance also was asked to answer for some past comments, including prior attacks on his running mate, Trump, who he once called ""America's Hitler"".
The Ohio senator said he, like many people, has made mistakes in the past. ""I was wrong about Donald Trump,"" he said.
6) Politeness takes centre-stage
The tone was in stark contrast to Kamala Harris and Donald Trump’s first encounter last month, when insults flew and interruptions were frequent.
Starting off the night with a handshake, both Vance and Walz proceeded to address each other politely and with civility. The two even exchanged smiles periodically, agreeing from time to time with what their rival had said.
They did direct some fire at the top of the ticket, however - Vance taking aim at Harris and Walz at Trump.

BBC,UK growth forecast to peak next year before slowing again,"Growth set to peak next year before slowing again
The UK's economy will grow slightly faster than expected this year and next, but the pace will ease towards the end of the parliament, according to the government's official forecaster.
Chancellor Rachel Reeves said the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) predicted the economy would grow by 1.1% this year and 2% in 2025.
But from 2026, growth is predicted to weaker than previously forecast, slowing to 1.5% by 2028.
The OBR said the policies in the Budget would ""temporarily boost"" the economy in the short term, but leave the size of the economy ""largely unchanged in five years"".
The chancellor said the Budget would mark ""an end to short-termism"" and that the OBR would from now on also provide a 10-year growth forecast when it publishes its analysis of the Budget.
""Every Budget I deliver will be focused on our mission to grow the economy,"" Reeves said.
However, the OBR is forecasting lower than expected growth for the end of the parliament. Growth in 2027 and 2028 would be 1.5%, down from the 1.8% and 1.7% forecast in March.
The OBR expects inflation to remain slightly above the Bank of England's 2% target until 2029.
It is hard it to make precise predictions several years ahead, and economic forecasts are regularly updated.
The combination of stronger growth early in the parliament, followed by weaker growth in later years, suggests the cumulative impact, or the size of the economy by the end of the parliament, will not be very different overall.
In total the economy is set to grow by nearly 8.2% in total by 2028. In March it was forecast to grow by nearly 8.5%.
However, Paul Johnson, head of the independent economics think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies, described the growth forecast as “pretty disappointing stuff"".
Measures in the Budget would increase demand this year and next year, which was likely to keep inflation and interest rates higher, resulting in slower growth in later years, he told the BBC.
How much the economy grows is a key factor limiting what the government will be able to do over the course of the parliament.
If growth is strong, tax revenues are likely to increase, meaning there is more to spend on public services, or on reducing taxes, and to pay the interest on government borrowing. If growth is weak, the government is likely to have to cut back on what it would like to do.
Reeves said while there would be no return to austerity, there would “still be hard decisions to come”.
But she said the OBR believed Labour's plans would have a positive impact on the ""supply capacity of the economy"" or its ability to grow.
The government bases its policy plans on the forecast of the OBR. However, economic forecasting is not precise.
Predictions can be affected by a huge range of factors including geopolitical risk, global energy prices, and events in the world's other large economies. Small changes in any of these factors can have an impact on the path of UK growth.
Reeves said she would “catalyse £70bn of investment” in the UK through a new National Wealth fund, transform planning rules to “get Britain building”.
She said she would work with devolved governments in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, as well as regional mayors, to boost local and regional growth plans.",2024-10-30
BBC,Bibby Stockholm: Asylum seekers moved off Dorset barge,"Bibby Stockholm: Asylum seekers moved off barge
Hundreds of asylum seekers onboard the Bibby Stockholm have been moved off the barge ahead of decisions on whether they can stay in the UK.
Around 300 residents have already been moved, with around a further 100 still on board, the BBC understands.
Once in temporary accommodation, they are then told if they have been granted leave to remain in the UK.
If successful, they have 30 days to find somewhere to live.
It was previously announced the contract for the Bibby Stockholm, which is moored off Portland in Dorset, would expire in January 2025.
The Home Office confirmed that when the asylum seekers - who are all men - left the barge, none of them would be moved to Portland, Weymouth, or the wider Dorset Council area.
They would instead be ""dispersed across the country"", it continued.
Campaigners helping the asylum seekers say they have seen them sent to places including Cardiff, Wolverhampton, Bristol and Worksop.
Giovanna Lewis from the Portland Global Friendship Group, which has been supporting the residents of the Bibby, said: ""The men are taken individually by taxi to their new accommodation around the country, where they stay for three or four weeks supported by the Home Office until the decision on their status is made.
""If they are given the right to remain they have 30 days to find alternative accommodation. If they are refused they have the right to appeal and are supported while that appeal takes place.""
In a statement, a Home Office spokesperson said: “This government inherited an asylum system under unprecedented strain, with thousands stuck in a backlog without their claims processed.
“We have taken immediate action to restart asylum processing which will save an estimated £7 billion for the tax payer over the next ten years, and are delivering a major uplift in returns to remove people with no right to be in the UK. Over the long term this will reduce our reliance on hotels and costs of accommodation.
“We remain absolutely committed to ending the use of hotels for asylum seekers.”",2024-10-29
BBC,Commons Speaker rebukes Rachel Reeves for Budget comments in US,"Speaker rebukes Reeves for Budget comments in US
Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has reprimanded Chancellor Rachel Reeves for giving interviews to reporters in the US about her upcoming Budget.
Parliamentary rules say major government announcements should be made to MPs in the Commons, ahead of journalists.
An exasperated Sir Lindsay said failing to do so was a ""supreme discourtesy to the House"" and he was ""very, very disappointed"" with Reeves.
Responding to the criticism, the prime minister's spokesman said it was ""entirely routine for government to make announcements in the run-up to Budgets and spending reviews"".
He added that Parliament would have ""all the requisite time to scrutinise measures clearly"".
Reeves will deliver her first Budget on Wednesday in the Commons.
Last Friday, she outlined her plan to ""change the way that we we measure debt"" during a meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in Washington.
She explained she planned a technical change to loosen self-imposed limits on borrowing, to free up billions of pounds extra for infrastructure spending on projects such as roads, railways and hospitals.
The government has promised to get debt falling as share of the economy during the course of this parliament, rather than over a rolling five-year period.
Speaking in the Commons on Monday, Sir Lindsay said the policy changes ""could hardly be described as a leak"" when she had given on-the-record interviews, including to the BBC.
He said: ""Ministers should expect to face proper, sustained scrutiny when these announcements are made to the elected members of this House and not the American news channels.""
This was because Reeves' comments were major new policy announcements with ""significant and wide-ranging implications for the government's fiscal policy and for the public finances"", he added.
The Speaker said this was ""totally unacceptable"" and asked why Reeves expected MPs to wait ""almost a week"" simply to hear her repeat her announcements in her Budget statement.
MPs might be wondering, he added, ""how they will get a seat on Wednesday. Well, to be honest the way it's going you won't need to - we'll have all heard it.""
With Treasury minister Darren Jones making a statement to the House on ""fiscal rules"" later on Monday, the Speaker remarked: ""Perhaps no coincidence.""
Alluding to previous breaches of parliamentary rules, Sir Lindsay noted that, when in opposition, Labour would complain about the previous Conservative government behaving in a similar manner, and demanded: ""Get your acts together, all sides, treat Members with respect.""
On Tuesday, Conservative shadow Treasury minister Laura Trott also criticised the government's pre-Budget announcements.
""The response from No 10 yesterday seemed to be that their whole argument is, 'Well, we did it because you guys did it',"" she said.
Acknowledging that, when in power, her own party also revealed Budget details to the media, she said: ""This government seems to be taking lessons from the worst bits of our record, and not just ours but the last Labour government too.
""It's like the greatest hits of government mistakes being replayed in just 100 days.""",2024-10-28
BBC,"Assisted dying could lead to coercion, warns Wes Streeting","Assisted dying could lead to coercion - Streeting
The health secretary has said he is worried that legalising assisted dying could risk ill people feeling ""guilt-tripped"" into ending their own lives.
It emerged last week that Wes Streeting had privately told colleagues he would vote against the proposal next month.
MPs are due to debate the Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill on 29 November, before voting on it.
Streeting told BBC Breakfast on Tuesday that he was ""concerned about the risk of people being coerced into taking their own lives sooner than they would have liked, or feeling... guilt-tripped, feeling like a burden"".
He also repeated his view that the palliative care system was not ""where it needs to be to give people a real choice"".
Proposals in the bill, which was put forward by Labour MP Kim Leadbeater, would give terminally ill people in England and Wales the right to end their life.
Scotland is also considering changes to the law.
MPs at Westminster will be given a free vote, meaning they can choose based on their own conscience rather than having to follow a party line.
Streeting said the government would ""respect and act upon"" the outcome of the vote on the ""incredibly difficult and complicated issue"".
Assisted dying generally refers to a person who is terminally ill seeking medical help to obtain lethal drugs, which they administer themselves.
Ms Leadbetter has previously said: ""The current situation isn't particularly safe and there isn't actually the choice that I believe people deserve and should have.""
Earlier this month, Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was ""very pleased"" MPs would get the chance to vote on the issue - and that he would look at the details of the bill to decide his own vote.
Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood has said she will not support the bill because of her ""unshakeable belief in the sanctity and the value of human life"".",2024-10-29
BBC,Donald Trump and JD Vance potential targets of China cyber attack,"Trump and Vance possible targets of China-backed cyber attack
US authorities say cybercriminals linked to China may have attempted to tap into the phones or networks used by former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Senator JD Vance, a number of sources familiar with the matter confirmed to the BBC's US news partner, CBS News.
The sources said the Trump-Vance campaign had been alerted to the fact that phones used by Trump and Vance may have been among the targets of a broader cyber attack.
People affiliated with the Harris-Walz campaign were also targeted, a person familiar told BBC News.
It is unclear how much information, if any, may have been compromised.
The Department of Justice and the FBI declined to comment on whether candidates were targeted.
A joint statement from the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said the US government was investigating the ""unauthorised access to commercial telecommunications infrastructure by actors affiliated with the People's Republic of China"".
They said after the ""malicious activity"" was identified, the agencies ""immediately notified affected companies, rendered technical assistance, and rapidly shared information to assist other potential victims"", adding that the investigation was ongoing.
""Agencies across the US government are collaborating to aggressively mitigate this threat and are coordinating with our industry partners to strengthen cyber defences across the commercial communications sector,"" they added.
Law enforcement is currently treating the hack as an act of espionage, not as an attempt at campaign influence, one source told CBS.
Earlier this month it emerged that US telecommunications companies had been targeted in a hack.
One of the companies affected is said to be Verizon, through which the hackers are thought to have potentially targeted Trump and Vance's data, according to the New York Times, who first reported the story.
In a statement, Verizon spokesman Rich Young said the company was “aware that a highly sophisticated nation-state actor has reportedly targeted several US telecommunications providers to gather intelligence.”
He said Verizon is assisting law enforcement agencies in the investigation and working to address any further problems.
The Trump campaign has already been the target of one hack earlier this year.
Three Iranians nationals linked to the country's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were charged in September with deliberately attempting to undermine a presidential campaign.
US government agencies and officials have long warned of the threat of foreign interference in the US, including US elections.
“Our adversaries do look at American elections as points to try to influence, to try to undermine confidence in our democracy, to try to put their thumb on the scale,” National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said in the summer. “We are clear eyed about that. And we are doing a lot to push back against it"".
In January, the issue was discussed in Congress, with FBI Director Christopher Wray warning that Chinese hackers were preparing to ""wreak havoc and cause real-world harm"" to the US.",2024-10-25
BBC,Who is Gwen Walz? Meet the teacher and wife of Harris's VP pick,"Who is Gwen Walz, wife of Harris's VP pick?
America was introduced to a fresh political family earlier this month when Vice-President Kamala Harris appointed Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate.
While Gwen Walz, the two-term governor's wife, may not officially be on the ticket, her background is getting plenty of attention too.
An educator for more than two decades and life-long Minnesotan, Ms Walz was an agenda setter during her husband's time in office.
She prioritized education and criminal justice reform, initiatives that could see traction in Washington with a Harris-Walz White House.
Ms Walz, 58, met the Minnesota governor when the two were teaching in Nebraska.
They married in 1994 and share two children Hope and Gus.
Mr Walz has spoken about the couple's infertility struggles, a chapter of their lives that he now brings up while campaigning about abortion access and IVF.
Ms Walz has clarified she underwent intrauterine inception, however, which is a fertility treatment that does not rely on frozen embryos and is not affected by abortion restrictions.
While Mr Walz created a social-media forward platform for himself during his time as governor, Ms Walz appears to have taken on a less-public role.
She only created an Instagram account in recent days. She also participated in few media interviews as Minnesota's First Lady.
When she does speak publicly, however, it is often about her commitment to education, criminal justice reform and how the two intersect.
""Education is transformational. And I believe that in every sense of the word,"" Ms Walz said during a 2019 interview with PBS. ""And if we're going to solve problems, we have to look at real ways to solve problems. And education is a real predictor of not going back to prison.""
Her first public event as first lady of Minnesota was a rally for restoring convicted felons' voting rights.
Ms Walz also chaired a task force on recidivism and toured state prisons.
“It’s a crucial conversation to have,” Ms Walz said in an interview with Minnesota Public Radio in 2019. “I’m convinced that people are looking for ways to address all kinds of different issues within corrections and within criminal justice.”
She is said to advise her husband and she is the first Minnesota governor's spouse to have an office in the state capitol.
Since her launch into national politics this week, she's also been on the receiving end of criticism from the right, especially for comments she made during Minneapolis' 2020 racial justice protests following the death of George Floyd.
In a now viral clip, Ms Walz described the smell of the burning tires and said she kept the window open for as long as she could ""because I felt that was such a touchstone of what was happening"".
Republicans are using the clip to cast Ms Walz, and her husband, as too far-left for voters.

BBC,Tariffs hurt his business. He's voting for Trump anyway,"Tariffs hurt his business. He's voting for Trump anyway
For almost 35 years, Wyoming entrepreneur Alan Chadwick has run his business importing clothing from China and selling the Western-style gear to stores serving ""working cowboys"" in the US.
Now, as former President Donald Trump campaigns on a pledge to hit all goods coming into the country with a 10%-20% tariff, or border tax, which would rise to 60% for goods from China, Chadwick is having to drastically rethink his strategy.
The 66-year-old has been exploring moving manufacturing of his products, like wool shirts with snaps and canvas jackets, to India or Pakistan - or perhaps closing his Wyoming Traders business, which employs 16 people, and retiring altogether.
Chadwick said tariffs were a ""tax on the American people"" and warned that the expense for a company like his of opening a factory in the US was unrealistic.
But as he prepares to cast his ballot, he expects to swallow his qualms about tariffs in favour of other priorities, such as illegal immigration and opposition to abortion.
""I will vote for Trump even though he's going to hurt our company if he does what he says he's going to do,"" he said.
Chadwick's readiness to look past Trump's views on tariffs is a sign of the contradictory impulses shaping American politics.
The Republican's platform has shifted America - once a global champion of free trade - towards an embrace of policies that are designed to protect US companies and jobs from foreign competition, despite the potential economic drawbacks.
During his first term, Trump hit thousands of items from China with tariffs - measures that President Joe Biden, despite criticising them before entering the White House, kept in place.
This year, the Republican has put plans for sweeping tariffs at the centre of his presidential campaign, calling such duties ""the most beautiful word in the dictionary"".
He argues his plans - which analysts say could return the average charge on imports to the highest level in at least 50 years - will spur job creation, reinvigorate US manufacturing, drive up wages and raise billions of dollars from other countries.
""We’re going to be a tariff nation. It’s not going to be a cost to you, it’s going to be a cost to another country,"" he has said on the trail.
His claims are rejected by most traditional economists, who say the policy would do little to expand employment in the US, while raising costs for everyday Americans and slowing growth around the world.
In the US, the Tax Foundation predicts the tariffs would reduce overall employment by 684,000 and shrink GDP by 0.8% - and that's without taking into account the almost certain retaliation from other countries.
For a typical US household, costs would rise by at least $1,700, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics, one of the lower estimates out there.
""It's absurd,"" economist Wendy Edelberg, director of the Hamilton Project and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said of Trump's promises. ""This is not the panacea that people are hoping for.""
Despite the warnings, some surveys indicate that Trump's ideas are resonating: a September poll by Reuters/Ipsos found that 56% of likely voters favoured the Republican's tariff plans.
Kyle Plesa, a 39-year-old Trump voter in Miami, Florida, said he did not think tariffs would have precisely the impact the candidate has promised, but the Republican's focus on the pitfalls of globalisation had touched a nerve.
""People are upset about it and I think Trump is at least addressing it,"" he said.
""I would probably prefer protecting business and paying a little bit more due to tariffs than I would dealing with the current state of inflation and raising taxes from the left,"" he added.
Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has attacked Trump’s tariff expansion plans as a ""national sales tax"", pledging a more targeted approach.
But Trump has said money brought in from tariffs could allow for big tax cuts - sometimes floating the idea of eliminating income tax altogether.
Meanwhile, President Joe Biden’s decision to maintain Trump's China tariffs – and expand them on items such as electric vehicles - has also allowed the Republican to claim a policy victory.
Biden has also signed off other protectionist policies, such as on historic government spending to boost manufacturing in sectors such as semiconductors and green energy.
He and Harris, like Trump, have opposed the takeover of US Steel by a Japanese company on national security grounds, raising chills in the business world about foreign investment.
Michael Froman, who served as the US trade representative under former President Barack Obama, said Washington's turn to tools like tariffs and restrictions on foreign investment was ""probably here to stay"".
""There certainly is less enthusiasm around pursuing what we might call an affirmative trade agenda in terms of liberalisation, openness, reduction of barriers,"" he said. ""We just have to recognise that none of these policies are actually free. They all impose some kind of trade-off.""
'Tariffs have not helped bring back jobs'
Jason Trice, the co-chief executive of Jasco, an Oklahoma-based lighting and electronics company that sells to major retailers such as Walmart, said the experience of his firm shows the damage tariffs can do.
Since 2019, it has paid hundreds of millions of dollars worth of tariffs while transforming its supply chain, moving the bulk of its manufacturing from China to places such as Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines.
He said the changes have made his firm less efficient and raised costs by about 10%-15%, which he has passed on to retailers, ultimately raising prices and contributing to inflation.
It has all taken a toll on his business, which has seen revenue fall 25% since 2020 and its staff numbers drop, via attrition, from 500 to 350.
“In 50 years in business, the Chinese government has… never done anything nearly as damaging to our business as what the Trump administration has done,"" Trice said. “Tariffs have not helped bring jobs back to America. Tariffs have hurt American businesses and reduced employment opportunities.""
Lucerne International, a car parts supplier based in Michigan that has manufactured in China for decades, has also spent the last few years adjusting to the new climate.
With help from government incentives, the company is now working to open its first factory in its home state in 2026, plans expected to create more than 300 jobs over four years.
But though the project might sound like the kind of successful “reshoring” politicians in both parties want to see, chief executive Mary Buchzeiger, a long-time Republican, said it was a mistake for the US to try to ""build walls"" against its rivals.
“I don’t think tariffs are a long-term solution,” she said.
“All we’re going to do is continue to make ourselves uncompetitive on a global scale.”

BBC,Harris pledges 'different path' at site of Trump 6 January speech,"Harris makes last big-stage pitch to undecided voters, vowing 'different path'
The night before Kamala Harris sets off on a final multi-day swing through the key battleground states that will decide the 2024 presidential election, she gave one last speech, practically in the shadow of the White House.
The venue choice was no accident. Donald Trump held his rally on 6 January 2021 in the same place, speaking to supporters just hours before thousands of them stormed the Capitol and disrupted certification of Joe Biden’s presidential victory.
On a mild October night, Harris stood before what her campaign estimated was 70,000 cheering supporters at an event they may hope is a counterpoint to that cold, violent January day.
And in the unlikely chance the symbolism was missed by anyone watching, Harris made it explicit early in her speech.
“We know who Donald Trump is,” she said on Tuesday. “He is the person who stood at this very spot nearly four years ago and sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol to overturn the will of the people in a free and fair election.”
Harris didn’t dwell on the 6 January riot, however. The venue did most of the heavy lifting, providing the subtext to the speech and the point from which Harris could pivot.
While she opened by darkly warning of an “unstable” and “unhinged” Trump “obsessed with revenge”, she turned to focus on what she called her “different path”.
Acknowledging that many undecided American voters “are still getting to know” her after her abbreviated presidential campaign, Harris touched on the highlights of her biography and upbringing.
She went on to hit some of her top policy proposals, including lowering the cost of housing, expanding the child tax credit and adding homecare coverage to government-provided health insurance for the elderly.
She spent even more time talking about abortion and the need to enact legislation that provides national abortion rights – a particularly strong area for Democrats over Republican opponents.
It was, in effect, a trimmed-down version of her Democratic National Convention address – a bookend to the late August speech that the campaign billed as an introduction to Americans.
Democrats were riding high back then, enthusiastic about their new nominee after weeks of despondency and infighting that led to Biden’s decision to abandon his re-election bid.

- FACT-CHECK: Would Harris inflation-busting plan work?
- POLLS: Who is winning the race for the White House?
Since then, Harris’s campaign has had ups and downs, and is now locked in what is shaping up to be a photo finish next week.
If the polls are accurate, Harris still has work to be done to win over undecided Americans – and this speech was her last, biggest effort to do so on a prominent stage, with the White House looming over her shoulder.
Setting aside her biographical highlights and policy details, the message her campaign seems to want voters to have in mind on election day is one of contrasts – of division versus unity; bitterness versus hope; partisanship versus co-operation; past versus future.
“I pledge to seek common ground and common sense solutions to make your lives better,” Harris said. “I am not looking to score political points. I am looking to make progress.”
As she was delivering her speech, however, the current resident of the building behind her made comments that illustrated how difficult her task might be.
Biden, speaking of a derisive joke about Puerto Rico that a comedian made at a Trump rally on Sunday, appeared to refer to Trump supporters as “garbage”.
The president later claimed he was referring only to the comments made by the rally speaker. But the video of his remarks are unclear – and the episode was already distracting from Harris’ event on Tuesday evening.
It’s just one more obstacle Harris will have to overcome, along with assuaging Americans' concerns about the economy and immigration - where polls indicate Trump has the advantage.
She tried to address those in her speech as well, even if they seemed to take a back seat to more lofty language and pointed attacks.
Her speech framed the election in a way that is to her advantage. Next Tuesday will reveal whether a majority of the American public – or at least a plurality in enough key battleground states - agrees.

BBC,‘People are scared’: US election workers brace for threats,"‘You stole the election’: Nervous volunteers on front line of conspiracies
Kris Burlingame got a surprise on testing day.
A long-time election volunteer and former clerk in the Wisconsin village of Alma Center, she is well-versed in election law, including the routine requirement to invite the public to watch tests of voting machines.
Usually, nothing happens. No member of the public had actually taken up such an invitation, she said – until one man showed up during the most recent test on 1 August.
“He had just moved into the area and he was belligerent, angry,” Ms Burlingame said.
The middle-aged man started taking pictures and asking questions – how did the machines work? Were the machines connected to the internet? (They weren’t, but he insisted on being shown the internet connections).
“These are the machines that changed everyone’s votes,” the man said, repeating a widely spread and debunked conspiracy theory about a particular brand of voting machine.
“I said, ‘There’s no way they can do that’,” Ms Burlingame recalls. “He was not happy with me.”
Eventually the man left, but the incident gave her pause.
“It made me nervous. I wasn't afraid… but it did make me stop and think, what is the election going to be like? Are we going to have more of this?”
Incidents like the one in Alma Center, a village of around 500 people in largely rural Jackson County in western Wisconsin, have become increasingly common throughout the country in recent years, experts say.
As a result, officials are preparing for another high-stakes election on 5 November by bolstering security to keep workers safe at polling places. They are also working to protect against possible intimidation of voters or tampering with the voting process.
Threats against election workers have increased since the 2020 presidential election which Donald Trump and his allies falsely claimed to have won.
Conspiracy theories about the voting process led to threats against election workers, and culminated in the 6 January 2021 riot at the US Capitol.
Now, suspicion about elections has become so pervasive that it has moved well beyond urban areas with large vote-counting operations and crept into places like Jackson County. Wisconsin is a battleground state which President Joe Biden won by fewer than 21,000 votes four years ago.
Election workers are on the front lines.
A survey earlier this year by the Brennan Center, a non-partisan but left-leaning think tank, found 38% of local election officials had experienced threats, harassment or abuse.
More than half were concerned about the safety of their colleagues or staff, a level of anxiety that has remained more or less constant since the 2022 midterm elections.
“People are scared,” says Melissa Kono, the elected town clerk in Burnside, Wisconsin.
Ms Kono travels around Wisconsin delivering state-mandated election training to volunteer poll workers.
She says the kinds of scenarios she’s being asked about have changed dramatically over the last five years, to the point where she’s increasingly included material in her sessions about dealing with threats.
“I’m concerned for the clerks and the election workers,” she said.

- POLLS: Who is winning the race for the White House?
Ms Kono told the BBC that she and other elections officials are considering scenarios that were unthinkable just a few years ago, such as planning for active shooters at voting places.
Her handouts to local workers now include a list of emergency numbers, useful in the case of extreme weather and natural disasters, but also threats of violence.
“When people perceive the stakes as being very high, they're willing to do extreme actions in order to win,” she said during a break in one of the sessions at the courthouse in Black River Falls which, with a population of 3,500, is the largest settlement in Jackson County.
“It's one thing to prepare workers for the things that are in the election day manual, such as, how do you process absentee ballots? What are the photo ID requirements?
“But it's all these things that I just can't even anticipate,” she said. “I worry that I didn't prepare them to be safe.”
Ms Kono and other election officials’ shared their concerns as the threat of further political violence looms over this year’s election.
Donald Trump himself narrowly escaped an assassination attempt on his life in Pennsylvania in July, and avoided a second attempt at his golf course in Florida in September.
Among other incidents, elections officials have been sent white powder in the post, and have been subjected to “swatting” – anonymous emergency calls about fictional crimes, designed to draw armed police into people’s homes.
At the same time, Trump and his allies have continued to sow doubts about the integrity of the US voting system, which is marked by a patchwork of rules, regulations and methods, making November’s vote less of a national ballot than an interlocking network of thousands of local elections.
In 2016, he said – with no real evidence - that millions of votes had been fraudulently cast, but the conspiracy theories reached a fever pitch in 2020, when the Covid pandemic prompted many states to change laws to make it easier to vote early and by mail or absentee ballot.
Although the 2022 midterms were mostly peaceful, experts say false information about elections has persisted and has the potential to instigate disruption or even violence.
“When I served as an election official, I didn't receive death threats,” says Elizabeth Howard, a director at the Brennan Center and a former deputy commissioner of elections in Virginia.
Ms Howard said the nearly two-fifths of election workers facing threats represent “very concerning numbers”.
“Not surprisingly, these threats are leading to election officials leaving the profession,” she said.
In 2021 the US justice department set up a task force to investigate threats against election workers, and has since examined more than 2,000 threats. But only a small number of cases – 20, at the last count – have resulted in criminal charges.
Ms Howard noted that recent threats are not a partisan issue, with the vast majority of election officials taking steps to increase security since 2020.
The most common measure being taken is collaborating with law enforcement, she said, but some polling places have installed panic buttons, bullet-resistant glass panels or electronic security measures.
“Election officials on both sides of the aisle have been threatened,” she said.
That includes Republican Bill Gates – no relation to the Microsoft founder – who as supervisor of Maricopa County, Arizona, found himself on the receiving end of threats in 2020 and 2022.
“It's something that people talk about all the time,” he said, noting that people have been spotted taking pictures of election workers and their licence plates outside the county tabulation centre in the state’s largest city, Phoenix.
“People are still questioning the 2020 election almost every day,” he told the BBC.
“If you take a look at my X account, it’s just constant.
“I’ll type something like ‘I had a sandwich today’ and (someone will respond) ‘You stole the election in 2020’.”
“It shouldn't be like this,” he said. “People who are in elections should not be subjected to this vitriol, to the insults… it's just crazy.”
Gates suffered from post-traumatic stress and for a variety of reasons is not running for re-election as Maricopa supervisor this year.
Back in Wisconsin, around 50 Jackson County election volunteers crowded into a courthouse room lightly adorned with paintings and prints of local rural scenes to attend one of Ms Kono’s training sessions in early October.
“No one is allowed to be disruptive,” she told them, explaining the regulations around partisan poll watchers, or “election observers” as they are called in Wisconsin. “Observers have some rules they have to follow” – they can’t wear buttons or hats in support of a candidate, and they have to stay in a designated area.
“You don’t have to make them comfortable, right?” one volunteer asked.
“I don’t think the election manual says,” Ms Kono responded, smiling as chuckles broke out around the room. “Well, I wouldn’t feed them.”
There are dozens of slides on election procedures and rules, and talk to threats and security. Ms Kono explained the difference between a “true threat” – threatening an election official is illegal in Wisconsin – and an angry, but legal, comment. She distributed the packets that she had prepared with local emergency contacts and other useful phone numbers.
“You should really be aware of a lot of things on election day,” she told the group.
Not everyone in Black River Falls is so worried about the safety of election workers.
In the local Republican County office, a short walk down Main Street, Republican county chairman Bill Laurent was more sanguine.
“This is the kind of place where you go to the polls and the workers will have a cookie or a piece of cake for you,” he said. “I haven’t heard of much trouble.”
But reflecting the views of national party leadership, Mr Laurent said he was not confident that voting would be fair beyond Jackson County – citing in particular his fears of dirty tricks in Democratic strongholds in Wisconsin’s two biggest cities, Madison and Milwaukee.
Meanwhile the potential for escalating threats to affect voting was playing on the minds of several of the volunteers here, including Ms Burlingame, who dealt with the aggressive voting machine sceptic in August.
Prior to 2020, she said, she would have put the chances of disruption on election day near zero.
“Now I think it's kind of four or five,” on a ten-point scale, she said.
“I don't think anything's going to happen, but I'm not going to have a blind eye,” she said. “There's just some people that I just don't feel I could trust, and that scares me.”

BBC,Paul Pelosi attacker sentenced to life in prison in California trial,"Paul Pelosi attacker gets life in prison without parole
The man who broke into the home of former Speaker Nancy Pelosi and attacked her husband with a hammer has been sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole on state charges in California.
David DePape was also convicted on federal charges in May leading to a 30-year prison sentence which will now be served concurrently.
In the state trial, a San Francisco jury found DePape guilty of kidnapping, first-degree burglary and false imprisonment of an elder. The attack left Paul Pelosi, now 84, in hospital for six days with a fractured skull and other injuries.
In a statement after the sentencing, the Pelosi family said that ""legal justice has been served"".
""Since the violent break-in and shouts of 'where’s Nancy?' two years ago, not a day goes by that we do not think of this devastating assault, its trauma — or the possibility of future attacks,"" the family said.
They added they hope the sentence sends a message ""that political violence against elected officials or their family members will not be tolerated"".
A lawyer for DePape said he plans to appeal against Tuesday's ruling.
""This was a really tragic end to a tragic story,"" attorney Adam Lipson told reporters after the hearing.
Mr Lipson had unsuccessfully lobbied the judge to hand down a more lenient sentence, arguing that DePape suffered from mental health issues and isolation, which he said made him vulnerable to propaganda.
Judge Harry Dorfman refused, saying that he did not feel sympathy for DePape.
""I feel sympathy for the victim in this case, who’s lucky to be alive,"" Judge Dorfman said as he handed down his sentence. “It’s my intention that Mr DePape will never get out of prison, he can never be paroled.”
Video of the incident that was played during the earlier trial showed DePape, a Canadian citizen who has lived in the US for two decades, breaking into the Pelosi home in California armed with a hammer on 28 October 2022.
DePape asked for Mrs Pelosi, who was not at home, when he confronted the lawmaker's husband inside the couple's house.
When police officers arrived after responding to a 911 call, they found Mr Pelosi and DePape both gripping the hammer.
Moments later - after being asked to drop the weapon - DePape abruptly struck Mr Pelosi before being wrestled to the ground by officers. The incident was caught on body cameras worn by the officers.
In addition to a fractured skull, Mr Pelosi suffered injuries to his arm and hand. He was struck three times during the attack.
The attacker had admitted during his federal trial that he planned to hold Mrs Pelosi hostage, interrogate her on camera and ""break her kneecaps"" if she did not admit to what he claimed were her lies.
Mrs Pelosi's daughter, Christine, read a letter written by her father, in which he said the attack left him with nerve damage and in fear of sleeping alone at home.
When given the chance to address the court at the state trial, DePape spoke at length about conspiracy theories surrounding the 11 September 2001 attack, according to the Associated Press, whose reporters were inside the court room.
DePape also said he believed his government-appointed lawyers were conspiring against him, the AP reported, forcing the judge to interrupt him several times.",2024-10-29
BBC,Adidas ends 'fight' with Kanye West over antisemitic comments,"Adidas ends 'fight' with Kanye West over antisemitism
Adidas has ended its ""fight"" with Kanye West over antisemitic comments he made in 2022, which scuppered the sports brand and US rapper's ""Yeezy"" collaboration.
Adidas discontinued the collection at the time and started selling off Yeezy stock at wholesale prices.
However, on Tuesday, the firm said it had reached a settlement with Mr West to end all legal proceedings between them.
""There [aren't] any more open issues and there is no... money going either way,"" Adidas chief executive Bjorn Gulden said on a conference call.
""There were tensions on many issues [but]... both parties said we don't need to fight any more,"" Gulden said on the call about the firm's latest financial results.
The drama with West ""belongs to the past"", he added.
""When you have conflicts like this, you take provisions and you have legal opinions and there are negotiations and there are settlements being done, and this is the end to it.
""No-one owes anything to anybody anymore. Whatever was is history"", he said.
Ending the partnership has left Adidas with Yeezy stock worth around €1.2bn (£840m), with the sports brand selling product in batches and donating the proceeds to NGOs, including its own recently launched anti-discrimination foundation.
The final Yeezy stocks will be sold by the end of 2024, the company said.
The decision to move on from the ""fight"" marks a stark contrast to 2022. At the time, Adidas said it does ""not tolerate antisemitism and any other sort of hate speech"".
It added: ""Ye's recent comments and actions have been unacceptable, hateful and dangerous, and they violate the company's values of diversity and inclusion, mutual respect and fairness.""
Adidas and Mr West began collaborating in 2014, which led to a hugely successful sportswear brand.
Demand for Yeezy products did not let up even after the furore, with many Yeezy trainers doing well in the resale market and selling for hundreds - and sometimes thousands - of pounds.
West had his accounts suspended on Instagram and X (then known as Twitter) when he made a series of antisemitic comments in October 2022.
He repeated the claims in a number of interviews and podcasts, not all of which were aired, over the next two months.
In December that year, Mr West appeared on conspiracy theorist Alex Jones' show InfoWars where he spoke of his admiration for Adolf Hitler.
The rapper, now separated from celebrity Kim Kardashian, was diagnosed with bipolar disorder years ago and has publicly spoken about his challenges with his mental health.",2024-10-29
BBC,VP debate: Vance refuses to answer whether Trump lost 2020 election,"Vance refuses to answer whether Trump lost 2020 election
JD Vance has refused to say whether he thinks Donald Trump lost the 2020 election, and whether he would contest the 2024 vote if Democrats win next month.
The Republican vice-presidential candidate - who has previously said he would have challenged the 2020 result if given the chance - avoided giving answers on both issues during Tuesday night's debate.
In a head-to-head that was largely civilised in tone, he was accused by his Democratic opponent Tim Walz of ""a damning non-answer"" after sidestepping a question about that result and the Capitol riot on 6 January 2021.
Trump was seeking a second term then and has spent years making false claims about voter fraud during that poll.

- TAKEAWAYS: Six things to remember from Vance v Walz
The exchange unfolded after the CBS News moderators asked Vance if he would try to challenge the results of November's election, even if every US state governor certified them - as was the case in 2020.
Vance did not directly answer, instead saying he was ""focused on the future"".
He sought to defend Trump over the riot during which President Trump's supporters attacked the US Capitol building in an effort to stop Joe Biden becoming president.
Vance said Trump had simply spoken of ""problems"" in 2020, and insisted that Trump had only said that ""protesters ought to protest peacefully"".
Turning to the outcome of the 2024 vote, he said: ""If Tim Walz is the next vice-president, he'll have my prayers, he'll have my best wishes, and he'll have my help whenever he wants it.""
But Walz persisted with the events of 2020 - challenging Vance to answer whether Trump had lost the poll. When Vance again sought to change the topic, Walz said: ""That is a damning non-answer.""
Walz added that they were ""miles apart"" on the issue, despite agreeing on other things during their 90-minute debate.
Other than one or two other tussles - including an exchange on immigration that led to the two men's microphones being muted - the debate was polite in tone.
Walz found himself under pressure from the moderators over past comments of his own - marking the latest occasion in which he has fallen foul of fact-checkers.
He admitted that he ""misspoke"" when he claimed he was in Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing. News reports from the time show that he was actually in the US when the events took place in China.
Tuesday's event in New York marked the first and only scheduled head-to-head between the pair.
Polling by CBS News immediately afterwards suggested that 42% of viewers felt Vance won the debate, compared to 41% who thought Walz came out on top. Some 17% called the debate a tie.

BBC,Ex-Tory MP Aaron Bell reprimanded for 'drunken' sexual misconduct,"Former Tory MP reprimanded for sexual misconduct
Former Conservative MP Aaron Bell has been reprimanded by Parliament's standards watchdog for ""brazen and drunken"" sexual misconduct.
Bell was found to have touched a woman ""on her left thigh, waist and bottom inappropriately and without her consent"" in one of Parliament's bars in December 2023.
The Independent Expert Panel (IEP) concluded that if Bell had still been an MP it would have considered suspending him from Parliament ""for a significant period"".
Bell announced his decision to step down as the MP for Newcastle-under-Lyme earlier this year citing personal and family reasons.
Responding to the report, he said he was ""disappointed at the outcome"" but would not appeal the findings.
""I apologise for any upset caused to the complainant and wish to make it clear that I did not intend to cause any distress.
""This investigation was one of the reasons I chose not to seek re-election at the general election - I have let down the loyal members of my association and thank them for the support they gave me as a Member of Parliament. I would also like to apologise to the people of Newcastle-under-Lyme, whom it was an honour to serve.
""This has been a difficult time for my family and I would ask that their privacy is respected at this time.""
The complaint against the MP was lodged in February 2024 and subsequently upheld.
The IEP concluded that Bell had ""abused his position of power over the complainant"".
The panel added: ""Not only was he considerably older, but he was also a Member of Parliament therefore holding a particularly powerful role.
""In addition, he was an assistant government whip which is not only a… role with considerable authority, but also… involves upholding the highest standards of conduct.
""It does not reduce the seriousness of the conduct that it took place in a bar.
""Any Member of Parliament in that setting remains a person with particular power and authority.
""Indeed, sexual misconduct such as this, which is both brazen and drunken, makes the conduct more serious as the level of threat is increased.""
The investigation conducted interviews with the complainant, eye witnesses and Bell. It also reviewed WhatsApp messages between those involved.
Bell told the investigator “I was clearly drunk” and that he could not “recall everything about the evening”.
The report states: “He said he remembered touching the complainant’s thigh, “probably her waist”, but he denied touching her bottom.
""His account was that there was mutual flirting, which led to his touching the complainant.
""But in relation to his suggestion of flirting, he added that: ‘Probably, to be fair, more from me to her than the other way round’.
""The complainant denied any mutual flirting or encouragement in any way.""
The complainant told the investigator she felt “really uncomfortable” and called his conduct “incredibly brazen”.
Reviewing the investigation, the parliamentary commissioner for standards said the MP's claim of mutual flirting was ""contradicted by the complainant’s evidence and by that of the two eyewitnesses"".
""Further, the commissioner stated that the respondent’s description of the alleged mutual flirting was ‘too general to be persuasive and, in any event, would not justify touching without specific consent’,"" the report said.
Bell was first elected to Parliament in 2019, winning the former Labour stronghold of Newcastle-Under-Lyme in Staffordshire.
He was highly critical of Boris Johnson over his handling of the Partygate scandal and in February 2022 called on the then-prime minister to step down.
He served in the whip's office - the team responsible for managing party discipline - from November 2023 until July 2024.",2024-10-29
BBC,US election: African asylum seekers in limbo,"African asylum seekers afraid ahead of US election
For the growing number of African asylum seekers and economic migrants in the US, the upcoming presidential election could reshape their entire future.
“We deserve safety,” says Dr Yves Kaduli, a 38-year-old asylum seeker from the Democratic Republic of Congo who lives in the US.
""I have a dream that I will defend those that are persecuted,"" he adds in a BBC interview.
Dr Kaduli says that in 2014, he fled eastern DR Congo - which has been wracked by conflict for almost three decades - after being kidnapped and tortured.
He had been working as a doctor at Cifunzi Hospital in Kalonge town and saw the effects of the conflict up-close.
“Women were raped. I saw it. I felt it in my body,"" he tells the BBC.
Dr Kaduli says that horrified at the civilian casualties, he and many of his colleagues, including Nobel Peace Prize winner Dr Denis Mukwege, participated in protests against the killings and rapes by armed groups, criticising then-President Joseph Kabila's government for its failure to guarantee the safety of people.
The medic says this led to him being targeted by unknown men.
“They came, they took me and another colleague by force during our night shift,” Dr Kaduli recalls, adding that they were then taken to a makeshift camp in a nearby forest where they were beaten, tortured and threatened with death.
Dr Kaduli says that after being held for a day he managed to escape and decided he had to get out.
Leaving his mother and young son behind, Dr Kaduli says he began what would be a five-year journey, passing first through neighbouring Rwanda, then flying to Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua and finally arriving at the US-Mexico border in 2019.
“I remained on the border for at least a month, we were living in small tents in inhumane conditions.”
Dr Kaduli says he then succeeded in crossing into the US and was detained for 15 months, before being released.
He now lives in Virginia working as a medical technician, awaiting a decision on his asylum case.
Dr Kaduli is one of thousands of African migrants who against all odds complete the long journey to reach the US-Mexico border each year. It is a number that is rising.
But with many Americans saying immigration is a top concern in this election, and both candidates promising to crack down at the border, African asylum seekers are worried the public may turn against them.
“We see our politicians criminalise our status, demonise our community and being a president, they can decide our future,” Dr Kaduli tells the BBC.
In 2022, around 13,000 African migrants were recorded at the US-Mexico border, according to US Customs and Border protection data. By 2023, this figure had quadrupled to 58,000.
The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reports a sharp increase in asylum applications from West African countries such as Senegal, Mauritania and Guinea since 2022 at the same border.
New asylum applications from Senegalese nationals alone jumped from 773 in 2022, to 13,224 in 2024.
Although relatively stable, more than one third of the population in Senegal live in poverty, according to the World Bank.
A growing number of young Senegalese choose to migrate to the US rather than face the more dangerous route to Europe via the Mediterranean Sea.
They are opting for an increasingly popular route - which is being shared through social media, including TikTok - through visa-friendly Nicaragua.
In September 2023, more than 140 Senegalese people were deported back home after crossing the Mexico-US border.
People are coming to the US for mixed reasons, says Kathleen Bush-Joseph from the Migration Policy Institute, a non-partisan think-tank funded by research grants and foundations.
""People can be fleeing persecution and fleeing economic circumstances that make it difficult to feed their children. There are incentives to apply for asylum because they can get a work permit while they wait and that can really create a draw for people seeking to improve their lives,"" she says.
Successfully claiming asylum in the US is particularly challenging for African migrants.
Language barriers, a lack of community upon arrival and a lack of awareness of African conflicts make the stringent process even harder for Africans, says Ms Bush-Joseph.
“Judges and attorneys are often not familiar with the situations in some of the African countries that people are fleeing,” she tells the BBC.
There are also risks for those who are deported.
In 2022, Human Rights Watch (HRW) released a report alleging that dozens of asylum seekers from Cameroon were imprisoned, tortured and raped after being sent back from the US border.
“People were deported directly back to harm and persecution and in contexts where there are ongoing conflicts and wide-spread human rights violations,” HRW researcher Lauren Seigbert tells the BBC.
“It’s just a huge risk to send people back,” she adds.
Nils Kinuani, a federal policy manager at African Communities Together, an organisation that supports African asylum seekers and refugees in the US, says rhetoric around immigration in the election campaign has caused “great fear” among his community.
“People are fearful. There are concerns that refugee programmes could come under attack,” Mr Kinuani says.
His organisation and others are calling for more legal routes to help African migrants who are terrified of deportation.
One option is humanitarian parole status, a legal protection for foreign nationals from countries facing crises such as conflicts or natural disasters.
It can be issued by the US government to allow people at risk to live and work in the US temporarily - current programmes include Ukraine, Cuba, Nicaragua, Haiti, Venezuela and Afghanistan.
There are no official humanitarian parole programmes in place between the US and any African country.
Mr Kinuani adds that there is some resentment over the way that refugees from Ukraine have been treated, compared to other nationalities.
Just a few weeks after the war broke out in Ukraine, nationals fleeing the conflict were eligible to apply for humanitarian parole, he says.
“Ukrainian communities didn’t even need to ask or advocate for humanitarian parole. For a country like Sudan, we have to push.”
Since April 2023, the ongoing war in Sudan has forced nine million people from their homes.
Both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party have put controlling immigration and solving the US-Mexico border crisis high up on their list of campaign promises.
If elected, Republican candidate and former President Donald Trump would carry out “the largest deportation operation in American history” and reinstate border policies reminiscent of his first term in office, according to the official Republican National Committee’s 2024 Platform.
Meanwhile, the Democratic candidate and Vice-President Kamala Harris has promised to revive a bipartisan border security bill that failed in Congress earlier this year.
The bill would “increase asylum staffing” and ensure a “faster and fairer” asylum process, according to the White House.
But it has received criticism from human rights groups and the UN.
The outgoing administration of President Joe Biden - of which Harris is a part - has already moved to crack down on migrants at the border.
Under an executive order issued in June, officials can quickly remove migrants entering the US illegally without processing their asylum requests once a daily threshold is met and the border is ""overwhelmed"".
This has led to a sharp decline in the number of people trying to enter the US through the border, according to US officials.
For the first time in almost two decades more than half of Americans want immigration levels to the US cut, rather than kept at their present level or increased, recent polling from global analytics and advisory firm Gallup suggests.
“In the US there is an increasing awareness that the asylum system is so overwhelmed and people are making claims because there aren’t other ways to come to the United States,” says Ms Bush-Joseph.
“Frustration that people have about the dysfunction of the US immigration system does mean that there is concern about the number of people claiming asylum.""
For now, Dr Kaduli is stuck in limbo and could be left waiting four to 10 years for a decision on his asylum application.
He says that a couple of years ago, his father passed away, but his current status does not allow him to leave the country to see his family.
“I feel uncomfortable when my case is still pending and I see on the television the speech of politicians, but I know if I’m here it’s for a reason,” he says.
His ultimate hope is that one day his son and mother will join him in the US.
“I believe that America will give me the same values, to work for myself, to help my family, to participate in the economy of this country, so I’m between doubt and hope.”

BBC,Would Kamala Harris's price gouging plan really help US consumers?,"Would Harris's price gouging plan really help US consumers?
When Kamala Harris was asked on Wednesday what she would do to help an undecided voter worried about the price of groceries, she said she would introduce a national ban on price gouging.
Her plan, she told an audience in Pennsylvania, would “stop companies taking advantage of the desperation and need of the American consumer and jacking up prices without any consequences”.
The proposed ban - one of her key economic policies - would apply during ""times of crisis"".
But would it really bring down prices for consumers? And could it even prove potentially counterproductive?
The backdrop of rising prices
Rising prices have been a key concern for Americans in recent years and polls suggest a majority of Americans feel worse off than they did four years ago.
In April 2024, the share of Americans naming the high cost of living as the most important financial problem facing their family reached 41%, the highest since 2005.
Overall inflation peaked at 9.1% in the year to June 2022, rates not seen in four decades.
And food inflation peaked even higher, reaching 11.4% in the year to August 2022.
Both are now back below 3%, though average US food prices are still around 27% higher than at the end of 2019.
Inflation has been a global problem, but some economists argue that the economic stimulus policies of the Biden-Harris administration contributed to this spike in US prices, making inflation an issue on which she is keen to reassure voters.
There have also been claims that some corporate retailers took the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 - when supply chains were disrupted and people's lives and shopping habits severely impacted by lockdowns - as an opportunity to increase their prices and profit margins.
This phenomenon has been dubbed by some as “greedflation” and forms the economic justification for Harris’s price gouging ban.
Donald Trump has compared her plan to “communist price control” and “like something straight out of Venezuela or the Soviet Union.”
What is Harris's price gouging plan?
The Harris team has said the federal ban would apply to ""essential goods during emergencies or times of crisis"".
Thirty-seven US states already have laws which prohibit price gouging in the wake of local states of emergency, which can follow extreme weather events such as hurricanes or disasters such as wildfires.
They were also triggered in dozens of US states during the coronavirus pandemic.
We do not know how Harris’s nationwide controls would work, but when she was a senator in 2020, she co-sponsored legislation that would have defined price gouging in an emergency as charging more than 10% above the previous average price for an item.
It is assumed that Harris’s federal ban on price gouging would be like a nationwide version of the various state-level regimes.
On CNN, she was asked how her plan would help bring down grocery prices in general, given it would only apply during emergencies.
She did not respond directly, instead talking about companies ""taking advantage of people"" during the recent hurricanes and in the pandemic.
What is the economic evidence?
The argument over how much the overall spike in US prices in recent years can be attributed to price gouging is contested among economists.
Isabella Weber, an associate professor of economics at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, has argued that there is compelling evidence of what she calls “seller’s inflation” in the US since 2020.
She cites the fact that total US corporate profits measured as a share of the overall US economy jumped between 2020 and 2022 - and, as an example, points to the case of the giant US meat processor, Tyson, which doubled its profit margins in the second half of 2021.
Tyson attributed the higher margins to increases in its productivity.
Weber wrote in August that “Harris is right about going after price gouging”.
However, many other economists argue that although there might be individual examples of such corporate behaviour, by far the largest driver of rising inflation since 2020 has been a simple shortage of goods relative to demand.
“Price gouging played little role in the US inflation issues over the past several years,” argues the consultancy Oxford Economics.
Moreover, economists are generally wary of government interference in prices set by businesses, even in times of crisis.
A common example used by critics is the case of a severe snowstorm in which local demand for new shovels shoots up and a local retailer increases prices in response.
The logic is that while such price hikes might seem unfair - and polling shows they are extremely unpopular - the higher prices induce other retailers to order more snow shovels from suppliers. This increases the supply and brings the price down again naturally, while ensuring as many people as possible get access to the shovels they need.
A study from 2007 suggested that if a federal price gouging law had been in place on gasoline sales after hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, the economic damage would have been greater because of the discouragement for producers to increase their supply. The authors estimated that the overall economic damage would have increased by $1.5-3bn.
Economists generally prefer governments to focus their efforts to tackle price gouging, to the extent that it exists, through breaking up corporate monopolies and oligopolies (small groups of dominant sellers in a given market) and creating more free market competition, rather than directly controlling prices.
“Price gouging’s not the right way to think about it but price competition is and anything the government can do to facilitate that competition [I’m] all for it”, says Mark Zandi, the chief economist of Moody’s Analytics.
In 2012 a panel of eminent economists were asked whether they agreed that the US state of Connecticut was right to try to ban price gouging during severe weather events. Only 8% agreed.
And there are numerous examples from history where attempts by governments to control prices have backfired, resulting in shortages or inflation over the longer term.
The Soviet Union used price controls and the result was long queues in shops. The former president of Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, imposed price controls for food in 2003, contributing to chronic shortages and a huge rise in the undernourishment of the Venezuelan people.
However, it is a stretch to interpret Harris’ proposals, as laid out by her team, as a general lurch into a regime of price controls given the price gouging law would likely be limited to times of crisis and limited to food and groceries.
Capping drug prices
Another proposal from the Harris team is to lower prescription drug costs including by extending a “cap” on insulin drug prices to all Americans.
Insulin was capped at $35 (£27) a month for patients on Medicare - a federal insurance programme primarily designed to serve people aged 65 and over.
This is not a typical state price control, where the economic cost is borne by the retailer. Rather, the federal government, which runs the Medicare system, is responsible for reimbursing drug manufacturers for the difference between the $35 maximum price and the retail cost of the insulin.
However, applying the cap to all Americans would mean imposing the price restriction on private US health insurers, not just the public Medicare system. Unless pharmaceutical companies reduced their prices, this would mean those private insurance companies would need to cover the difference.
And some economists warn they might have to raise their premiums for everyone in the scheme as a result - so while certain drug prices would be lower, overall healthcare costs would be unchanged.
The same logic applies for Kamala Harris’ proposal to extend a $2,000 total annual cap on out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs on Medicare to all Americans, including those in private health insurance schemes.",2024-10-24

BBC,Tony Hinchcliffe: Backlash after comedian at Trump rally calls Puerto Rico 'island of garbage',"Backlash after comedian at Trump rally calls Puerto Rico 'island of garbage'
A comedian at a Donald Trump rally called Puerto Rico a ""floating island of garbage"", sparking fury from Republicans and Democrats and accusations of racism.
The comic, Tony Hinchcliffe, was among the speakers at the Madison Square Garden in New York on Sunday. He also made a series of jokes that leant on racist stereotypes.
A Trump adviser distanced the former president from the Puerto Rico joke, which was also denounced by Trump's Democratic rival, Kamala Harris. Harris herself was the target of another Trump warm-up speaker who also sparked controversy.
The furore came as one of the world's top Latin celebrities, Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny, endorsed Harris for president.
In his joke, Hinchcliffe, known for his comedy podcast Kill Tony, said: ""There’s a lot going on. I don’t know if you know this but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it’s called Puerto Rico.""
The line appeared to meet a mixed reception. Two Republicans in the state of Florida, which has a prominent Puerto Rican population, were among those who called out the joke.
US congresswoman Maria Elvira Salazar said she was ""disgusted"" by the ""racist comment"". She said on X that it did not ""reflect the GOP values"", referring to the Republican Party, and noted thousands of Puerto Ricans served in the military.
US Senator Rick Scott said: ""The joke bombed for a reason. It's not funny and it's not true."" He added that ""Puerto Ricans are amazing people and amazing Americans"".
Puerto Rico is a US island territory in the Caribbean. Its residents are unable to vote in US presidential elections, but there is a large diaspora across the US who can.
Hinchcliffe also suggested Latinos ""loved making babies"".
He drew on racist tropes about black people and watermelons, which prompted groans from the audience - and he called Palestinians rock-throwers while in the same sentence suggested Jews would not spend money - invoking an antisemitic trope.
According to the BBC's US partner CBS, a source familiar with the event confirmed that the Trump campaign vetted Hinchcliffe's list of jokes - but the comments about Puerto Rico, Latinos and black people were ad-libbed. The campaign also said it cut two profane jokes.
Trump himself has remained silent on the row. He has faced calls to apologise from the archbishop of Puerto Rico and the head of the island's Republican Party, among others.
Mr Hinchcliffe defended his material after the backlash. ""These people have no sense of humour,"" he wrote on X in response to criticism from Democratic lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz.
The comedian added: ""I love Puerto Rico and vacation there. I made fun of everyone… watch the whole set.""
Ocasio-Cortez responded: ""You don't 'love Puerto Rico'. You like drinking piña coladas. There's a difference."" She had earlier said Hinchcliffe's comments were ""super upsetting"", noting that her family was from Puerto Rico.
The night's other speakers courted controversy with their own remarks. David Rem, a childhood friend of Trump, called Harris ""the devil"" and ""the antichrist"".
And Trump's former lawyer Rudy Giuliani falsely claimed the Democratic candidate was ""on the side of the terrorists"" in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Although much of the focus was on the comments by his guest speakers, Trump used the occasion to announce a plan for tax credits for those who take care of a parent or a loved one. ""It's about time that they were recognised,"" he said.
He also reiterated plans for a mass deportation for illegal migrants, speaking of his wish to ""rescue"" places that had been ""invaded and conquered"" by ""vicious and bloodthirsty criminals"".
Earlier on Sunday, Harris unveiled policies aimed at helping those in Puerto Rico - garnering support from Jennifer Lopez, who has Puerto Rican parents, as well as Bad Bunny. Numerous other big-name celebrities have already backed her.
Bad Bunny posted multiple videos of Harris talking about the island, her ideas to help residents, and her attacks on how Trump handled Hurricane Maria as president when the deadly storm killed nearly 3,000 people there in 2017.
A source close to Bad Bunny confirmed to CBS that this represented an endorsement of Harris, breaking his longstanding tradition of not weighing in on national politics.
In the last seven years, there has been an exodus from Puerto Rico, whose inhabitants have moved to the mainland US including Florida and swing states such as North Carolina, Georgia and Pennsylvania. Puerto Ricans are now reportedly the second largest Latino subgroup in those states.
Bad Bunny's comments appeared to be pre-planned, and he did not address the remarks by Hinchcliffe. But fellow Puerto Rican singer Ricky Martin did, telling his fans ""this is what they think of us"" and urging them to vote for Harris.
There are around 36 million Hispanic voters eligible to vote this year, according to the Pew Research centre. They have generally formed a key plank of the Democratic coalition but Republicans have been eating into that support.
Madison Square Garden, near the heart of the city, is one of the most famous venues in the world and capable of seating about 20,000.
It is also in Trump's hometown, and the city in which he landed a historic criminal conviction earlier this year.
New York - viewed by some as a curious choice for the final week of campaigning - is a solid blue state and will not be decisive in the race for the White House.
Who is Tony Hinchcliffe?
Tony Hinchcliffe is a stand-up comedian based in Austin, Texas, known for his podcast Kill Tony, which offers stand up comedians the opportunity to audition for 60 seconds before Hinchcliffe and his co-host, Brian Redban.
The podcast has 1.89 million subscribers on YouTube.
The comedian grew up in Youngstown, Ohio, and described himself as ""the class clown"". He got his start in the comedy world working for Joe Rogan and writing jokes for celebrities on Comedy Central Roast.
This is not the first time some of his comments have made headlines for their offensive nature.
In 2021, he used a racial slur when referring to American-Chinese comedian Peng Deng during a comedy set and refused to apologise.
""I knew that what I had done was not wrong,” Hinchcliffe said when asked by Variety about that controversy. ""It was so dumbfounding to me because it was a joke, and my stance is that comedians should never apologise for a joke.""
Hinchcliffe was one of the comedians who appeared on former NFL star Tom Brady's Netflix comedy roast earlier this year.

BBC,Democrats bet big on Texas in hope of flipping Ted Cruz's Senate seat,"Democrats bet big on Texas in hope of flipping Cruz's Senate seat
As the 2024 election season approaches its final week, Democrats are in an uphill fight to retain control of the US Senate. The party is defending seats in close races across the country – and they have little if any margin for error.
Their slim hopes in the upper congressional chamber - gatekeeper for substantive legislation and responsible for confirming Supreme Court justices and senior presidential administration appointees - may hinge on their hopes of unseating Senator Ted Cruz in Texas.
Texas is certainly an unlikely place for Democrats to be placing their faith. A Democrat hasn’t won a contest there in three decades. The Lone Star State seems perennially just out of reach for Democrats, raising their hopes only to resoundingly dash them on election day.
The Texas government churns out a steady stream of right-wing policies on immigration, abortion, education and other hot-button cultural issues. The last Democratic presidential candidate to win there was Jimmy Carter in 1976.
Cruz is a two-term incumbent with a national network of support dating to his 2016 bid for the Republican presidential nomination. He won the Iowa caucuses that year with the backing of evangelical voters and went on to finish second behind Donald Trump.
The former corporate lawyer and Supreme Court clerk has built a reputation as a conservative firebrand in the Senate, pushing for government shutdowns to advance his political priorities and often engaging in heated exchanges in committee hearings and media appearances.
Despite all this, Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris is in Houston on Friday, holding a rally with the party’s Senate candidate, congressman Colin Allred.
And for the first time this campaign, she will appear alongside pop star Beyoncé, who will perform at the city’s Major League Soccer stadium.
It’s a notable investment in precious time and resources just over a week from election day. Public opinion polls, however, show a tight race between Allred and Cruz – within the margin of error in some surveys and markedly closer than the contest between Harris and Donald Trump in the state.
Allred, a three-term congressman from the Dallas area, is a former NFL player and college football standout at Baylor University in Waco, Texas. He worked in the Obama administration before running for public office and is running as a political moderate.
Meanwhile Cruz, for all his political strengths, is not universally well liked even in conservative Texas. He defeated Democrat Beto O’Rourke by less than 3% when he ran for re-election in 2018.
And in 2021 he was criticised for travelling to Cancun, Mexico, while swathes of Texas had power outages due to a record-setting winter storm.
The matchup is enough to get Democratic hopes up – again.
At the Cactus Jack Cagle Community Center in Spring, Texas, on Thursday afternoon, a steady stream of Texans turned out to vote early in the 5 November election. Many said they were supporting Trump and Cruz, primarily because of the economy and their views on limiting undocumented migration. Those backing Harris in this northern Houston suburb were cautiously optimistic, however.
“Cruz is wishy-washy,” said Leona Fuller. “He called Trump all kinds of names [in the 2016 presidential race], and now all of a sudden, he's pro-Trump. You can't do that and expect to lead people and be effective in your leadership.”
Floyd Guidry III, voting in his first election since turning 18, said he wrote a high school report on Allred’s policy proposals and was particularly drawn to his calls for criminal justice reform.
“It’s time for change,” Floyd’s father, who came with him to vote, said. “It doesn’t matter if you’re a Republican or a Democrat.""
Many political experts, however, have their doubts.
Miles Coleman, associate editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, has the race rated at “likely Republican”.
“Texas is going to be a toss-up state one day,” he said, citing demographic shifts as the state becomes younger and more diverse. “But I don’t see it happening for Democrats this year.”
If the Democrats want to hold control of the Senate, however, the opportunities to do so are few and far between.
They currently hold 51 seats in the 100-person chamber. If they win the presidency (a big if) they can only afford to lose one seat. If Trump wins, any net loss for the party will deliver the chamber to Republicans, with Vice-President JD Vance providing a tie-breaking vote.
The map for Democrats this year is bleak.
Thirty-four of the chamber’s 100 senators, who serve six-year terms, are up for election this year. Democrats are defending 23 seats – in part the result of the party’s overperformance in 2018 and 2012.
In three of those states – Ohio, Montana and West Virginia – Trump comfortably won in 2016 and 2020.
The West Virginia seat being vacated by centrist former Democrat Joe Manchin is a virtual lock to flip to the Republicans. In Montana, three-term incumbent Jon Tester has been trailing in the polls for months.
Five other Democratic-controlled seats are in states that are considered toss-ups in this year’s presidential race – Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona and Nevada. In three of those states, Democratic incumbents are seeking re-election. In the other two, a new candidate is trying to replace an outgoing senator.
Meanwhile, most of the Republican-held seats on the ballot are in deeply conservative states like Mississippi, North Dakota and Wyoming. Only in Florida and Cruz’s Texas are Democrats anywhere near striking distance.
In another state, reliably conservative Nebraska, an independent candidate – Dan Osborne – is in a tight race with incumbent Republican Deb Fischer. It’s not certain, however, whether Osborne would vote to give the Democrats a functioning majority if he wins.
“Sometimes in safe states you get incumbents who get lazy,” Mr Coleman said. “Deb Fischer hasn’t had a tough race since she was first elected.”
Of greater concern for Democrats is the fact that only once in the past two presidential election years – in Maine in 2020 - has a state voted for a president from one party and a senator from the other.
If that trend away from ticket-splitting continues, said Mr Coleman, Democrats have little hope. It could explain why the party is dedicating more resources to incumbents in battleground states, rather than supporting challengers in Republican-friendly Texas and Florida.
This week alone, the Democratic Senate majority leader’s political action committee spent more than $15m (£11.5m) in advertising for the Ohio and Pennsylvania races. In Texas, it spent $60,000.
“If you look at how Democratic groups are spending their money,” said Mr Coleman, “they’re more interested in maximising the number of seats that they could hold after the election, rather than maximising their potential targets.”
The money the party has moved into Texas so far, he noted, is just a “drop in the bucket” in such a large state.
So then what are Harris – and Beyoncé – doing in Texas? According to Mr Coleman, it gives the Democrats a chance to place the national focus on to the state’s strict anti-abortion laws – an issue where polls show the party has a decided advantage over the Republicans.
And even if Allred doesn’t win, a strong showing against Cruz could help the state’s Democratic party build infrastructure that would allow them to be more competitive in the future.
That may not be what Texas Democrats longing for a win this year or party faithful looking to hold on to the Senate want to hear.
But it may be the cold, hard reality facing the party as election day approaches.

BBC,Swing state voters who could determine the 2024 election,"US swing state voters: 'You have a big say on what happens in the entire world'
In US elections, it's not only who you vote for that matters - just as important can be where you live.
The 2024 presidential race will likely come down to seven key battleground states: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada.
With tight margins expected, the people that live in these states are the most sought after by political campaigns.
As Vice-President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump vie for their attention, here's what swing state voters had to say about the at-times stressful role they play.
This small business owner from western Pennsylvania is a registered Democrat who plans to vote for Harris.
I’m out in the rural parts of the state and there's a lot of Trump support out here. But there's also a lot of people that at a certain point... there's certain things that just aren't acceptable. Just the way a lot of us are raised out here, there's things that he's done that it's just not right.
[The political advertising] is annoying more than anything else because everybody knows at the end of the day, the advertisements are packed full of lies.
We're potentially playing kingmaker here. It is kind of nerve-wracking knowing that we're going to play such a big role because there's a lot of people that are just so burnt out about everything...
It's very strange knowing that your neighbours are probably going to have a really big say in what happens in the entire world for the next four years.
Andy lives in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The retired Marine plans to vote for Trump, who he backed in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections.
One neighbour across the street might have two Trump signs and then the neighbour next door might have four Harris signs. It's like a battle of who can out-sign the other person.
To be at the forefront of the voting every year is cool in a sense that it puts us on the map, but not necessarily always for the best things.
I recently moved back [to Pennsylvania] in 2018. When I was coming up to visit my now-wife, I saw Trump signs everywhere in 2016 and I thought: He's going to win.
In 2020, I saw less Trump signs and I just got a vibe that there's no way he's going to win. Now, it's 50-50. I have no idea what's going to happen.
This independent voter has lived most of her life in Wisconsin. The 74 year old is retired and plans to vote for Harris.
We are constantly bombarded with political ads on TV... I did see a big, lighted Trump sign when I went shopping. I was sort of shocked by it. It’s a huge sign.
I'm just very suspicious about what's going on with a lot of the people in the ads. It's gotten just much worse. The ads have gotten horrendous... distortion is so over the top.
I'm definitely voting for Harris and I'm worried because it seems that MAGA [Trump's Make America Great Again movement] can really distort things and confuse people so easily.
This engineer from the swing state of Michigan is a Democrat who is planning to vote for Harris in November.
I've never voted Republican once in my life and I'm still getting mailers in my mailbox addressed to me on practically a daily basis from the Republican Party. It is non-stop, incessant up here and it's exhausting.
I want to say that it's really disheartening [to carry the weight of a swing state] because I personally believe in more of a ranked-choice voting style and not necessarily the electoral college.
Being part of a state where it is a little bit more neck and neck and more decisive, it's one of those places where I can understand people really need to go out to make their voices heard. But it shouldn't just be focused on this state. Every state should have a similar amount of people wanting to get out, vote and make their voices heard.
Jonathan is a teacher who became a US citizen this year. He plans to cast his first vote for Trump.
I generally don’t understand - very little changes when a Republican or a Democrat becomes president. I don’t quite understand the hysteria.
I don’t think there’s many people my age who I hang around with who are desperate for either candidate. Trump talks about the treatment of migrants versus the abortion issue and the treatment of the unborn. I land on Trump being a lesser evil than Kamala Harris in regards to that.
I barely watch any typical American television. We probably get more mail in the house, but that’s because now I’m registered to vote so I’m seeing more. I wouldn’t say it’s particularly more prevalent.
This independent voter backed Biden in the last presidential election and plans to vote for Harris this year. Biden only narrowly won Arizona in 2020.
It seems to me that the Trump voters are more on public display. They have their flags. They have their signs. They have their bumper stickers. I don't know if they're proud or they're trying to convince everybody else to do something, but it seems more prevalent that you see that.
I've seen a few Harris signs and I like them. But I think that the people who support Harris are not as in your face.
I sometimes get nervous because I want Harris to win, but I say to myself: ""I can do one thing. I can only do one thing and that's put my vote in and that's all I can do.""
This independent voter is a greenskeeper at a Michigan golf course who plans on reluctantly backing Trump in the election.
I live in a rural area, so it's very, very Trumpy up here. It’s almost embarrassing because we get a lot of tourists up here and it's like: You guys are going to put so much Trump stuff on your walls?
I have mentioned to my wife that I'm the one the campaigns are aiming at. I'm an independent voter in a swing state. I just view myself as a drop in a bucket when it comes down to it.
I understand the way it's working out with the electoral college and I'm in a swing state, so my vote is a little more unusually valuable than it normally would be. But I try not to think about it that way. I'm just a regular guy casting my vote like everybody else.
This 34-year-old teacher in the swing state of Georgia is an independent voter who plans to vote for Harris.
I'm definitely anxious. I know this is a really tight knit race between our two candidates.
Political ads are everywhere. Every streaming service, every YouTube video, everything has ads. I've noticed that the Harris-Walz campaign is definitely putting out more advertising than I've noticed from the Trump-Vance campaign here in Georgia.
I think it's exciting. I'm excited to see Georgia being a battleground state. For so long, it was staunchly red and staunchly Republican.
To have this kind of conversation and be able to know that my vote matters a little bit more and that it's more important than it may have been traditionally is exciting. It's firing me up to get involved in the political process.
This legal assistant from Beaver, Pennsylvania - the swing state with the highest number of electoral votes - is a Democrat who will be voting for Harris.
I'm trying to remain optimistic, but I'm still pretty anxious, because it is Pennsylvania and you're surrounded by the division everywhere.
I guess that's what continues to make me anxious living in Pennsylvania and knowing how important Pennsylvania is for these federal elections. I hate to see how purple it is right now.
It feels like a responsibility to be from a state like this. The conversation about being in Pennsylvania and the burden of how many delegates we have and all of this - it's really wild.

BBC,Indian-American voters excited by Harris but see appeal of Trump,"With Harris on the ballot, Indian-American voters see political clout grow
On a recent October evening on New York City’s Upper East Side, hundreds of influential Indian Americans ranging from Bollywood actors to tech CEOs, dressed in bedazzled outfits and heavy jewellery, mingled over cocktails to celebrate the Hindu festival of lights at the posh hotel The Pierre.
But while the invitation called for a Diwali celebration, the party was buzzing with excitement over the Indian-American community’s latest political milestone: Kamala Harris becoming the first US presidential candidate of South Asian heritage to lead a major party ticket.
“This time around is so unique because we actually have someone we can relate to that hopefully has our best interests at heart,” Jessel Taank, the first Indian cast member in Bravo’s reality show, The Real Housewives of New York City, told the BBC at the All That Glitters Diwali Ball.
“You cannot be what you cannot see,” added Reshma Saujani, CEO of Girls Who Code and the first Indian-American woman to run for US Congress in 2010, pointing out that so many South Asian girls see themselves in Harris.
The challenge for Harris is to channel that enthusiasm among a booming immigrant population that’s moved beyond the traditional South Asian strongholds of California and New York to battleground states like Georgia, Michigan and Pennsylvania.
Both Harris and her Republican challenger Donald Trump have stepped up efforts to court Indian Americans, the largest and most politically active group among Asian American voters, in a tight election where any demographic advantage could tip the outcome in their favour.
Harris became the first person of Indian descent, as well as the first woman and black person elected as vice-president in 2020. But the 2024 election - and her surprise candidacy - culminates in the transition of the Indian-American community into a political force over the last decade.
Along with Harris, this presidential cycle has featured the rise of other Indian Americans including Usha Vance, the wife of Donald Trump’s running mate JD Vance. During the Republican primary, voters came to know Vivek Ramaswamy and Nikki Haley, who both challenged Trump for the nomination.
Alongside the prominence of national Indian-American figures, the community’s political engagement has deepened, too. Indian Americans saw the highest voter turnout among Asian Americans in the last two presidential elections, compared with white voters, according to research firm AAPI Data, an organisation that collects data about Asian American communities. In 2020, 71% of Indian Americans that were eligible to vote did, a 9% increase from 2016.
That trend looks set to continue in November, according to Karthick Ramakrishnan, co-founder of AAPI Data, who said he believes Harris's candidacy could boost South Asian voter turnout to 75% among eligible voters.
“While having the first ever person of South Asian origin as vice-president of the United States was important to many South Asian voters, it’s a much bigger deal to have someone from one’s background in the highest office in the land,” he said.
Over half of Indian-American voters identify as Democrat (55%) compared with 26% who identify as Republican, according to a 2024 AAPI Data voter survey. While still a majority, the number of Indian Americans leaning Democrat has been declining since 2020.
A survey released Sunday by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and YouGov found that 61% of registered Indian-American voters planned to vote for Harris while 32% intended to cast a ballot for Trump. Though the community continues to favour the Democratic party, the latest poll showed a “modest drift” toward Trump and Republicans, which researchers say is driven by Indian-American men, particularly younger men born in the US.
The same survey found more than 60% of Indian-American women intended to vote for Harris compared with about 50% of Indian-American men who said they planned to vote for Trump.
For Anju Sawni, a doctor based in Flint, Michigan, Harris’s gender and commitment to reproductive rights is pushing her to vote more than the vice-president's heritage.
“I am so worried for my patients. We’ve already gone backwards in our health care in this country, particularly for choices, by taking away women’s rights when it comes to terminating pregnancies,” Ms Sawni said.
Kirtan Patel, a Democrat and attorney in Atlanta, Georgia, said Harris had added “fuel to the fire” but the Indian-American community in the pivotal swing state is a growing force. He said he knows several Indian Americans who typically vote Republican instead planning to cast their ballot for Democrats over their dislike of Trump.
“Character matters. I feel like deep down character is where the turning is happening,” he said.
Yet even within the Indian-American community - which spans different religions, language, caste and economic backgrounds - there are questions over Harris’s racial identity and how rooted her connection to India is, with both Indian and Jamaican-born parents.
Trump, who travelled to India as president in 2020, struck a close relationship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, a dynamic that resonated with Modi’s Hindu nationalist supporters. Some worry Harris won’t prioritise a strong US-India relationship.
“Some people talked about the relationships between India and the US, and that Trump really made a lot of effort with the relationship,” said Priti Pandya-Patel, a New Jersey-based healthcare professional and chairwoman of the South Asian Coalition, a group designed for Republicans to connect with the South Asian community. “Kamala Harris - I don't even think that she's ever even visited India in her years as vice-president.”
President Joe Biden has tried to maintain close relations with India as part of his administration’s effort to counter China, hosting the prime minister for a rare State Dinner in June 2023. Harris, too, hosted a luncheon for Modi with Secretary of State Antony Blinken during the visit. She has tried to court Indian-American voters by holding cultural events, meeting with Indian-American business executives and phone-banking and canvassing Indian Americans using their native languages. Harris has also opened her official residence to scores of Indian Americans at an annual Diwali party.
The Trump campaign has tried to reach Indian-American voters through door-to-door campaigning and earned media in Indian outlets, according to Shalabh Shalli Kumar, chairman of the Hindu Coalition of the Republican National Committee.
Republicans have also sought to appeal to the South Asian community in recent years by leaning into concerns about crime, education and the economy, issues that weigh heavily among some Asian Americans.
Ms Pandya-Patel said illegal immigration is one of her top concerns, and said she believes the vice-president should have found a way to address the issue over the last four years. Trump and his allies have repeatedly hammered Harris and the Biden administration on the issue of immigration.
“I came here in the 1970s. My dad came legally and worked really hard to get to where he is. I just feel that all these people who came legally in the 60s and 70s and worked their way up, are being punished or not rewarded,” she said.
But the South Asian vote is not a given for either candidate. Mr Kumar, of the Hindu Coalition of the Republican National Committee, said the Trump campaign has not capitalised enough on the Indian vote in battleground states as it did four years ago. He said Democrats have done a better job of reaching the community this cycle.
Mr Ramakrishnan contends that Harris’s favourability among South Asians, and Indian Americans in particular, especially among their burgeoning populations in critical swing states like Georgia and North Carolina, could prove pivotal in November.
“The fact that the South Asian population is tilting fairly heavily towards Harris and has a higher voter turnout, will very likely be enough to tip the scales, of how close the vote will be,” he told the BBC.

BBC,Arizona swing state profile,"A quick guide to swing state Arizona
Arizona, famous for the Grand Canyon, Emma Stone and tall cacti, is one of seven states that will decide the 2024 US presidential election.
Voting in swing states is hard to predict and can swing Republican or Democrat - that’s why you’re hearing so much about them as campaigning draws to a close.
Here’s all you need to know.
Population
7.39m, same as Hong Kong.
Electoral college votes
11 of 538
In a nutshell
Arizona is the only swing state along the US-Mexico border, where about one in four voters are Latino. Arizona was also at the heart of 2020 election misinformation claims and pro-Trump protests.
2020 margin
Biden by 10,000 votes.
What's the deal now?
Border politics are one of the top issues here along with abortion. Democrats are hoping a ballot measure enshrining the right to an abortion might help turnout in this historically Republican state.
What are voters saying?
Polls show the top issues among voters are the economy, immigration and abortion. Inflation has caused alarm from some voters who blame Democratic President Joe Biden.
""The mortgage rates, they're outrageous,"" one Trump voter told BBC. ""The price of food is outrageous. Pretty much everything has doubled since Trump was president.""
For others, like Matt Pocock, a 35-year-old engineer who lives in Tuscon, price rises were less of an issue.
“I think the president has a lot less to do with the economy than people tend to think,” he says.
He says he has already cast an early-voting ballot for Harris, favouring her policies on abortion rights and international affairs.
What's the expert view?
Latinos, younger voters and newcomers who have recently moved to the state will play an important role in determining who wins, says Lisa Sanchez, a professor in the school of government and public policy at the University of Arizona.
“Voters are trying to gauge which candidate will secure their own economic future while balancing candidate stances on key issues related to abortion and immigration policy,” she explains.
Professor Sanchez also says divisions have widened here since the 2020 election, when Trump lost in the state, and election misinformation has increased.
What to watch out for on election night
- The winner of the Senate race between Democrat Ruben Gallego and Trump-backed Republican Kari Lake could help determine control of the chamber
- The winner of Maricopa County, home to 59% of the state’s registered voters, usually wins the state
- High turnout could be partly driven by a ballot measure that would enshrine the right to abortion in the state

BBC,DUP MP Sammy Wilson admits secret meetings with Sinn Féin,"Sammy Wilson admits meetings with Sinn Féin
A Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) MP has said he attended secret meetings with Sinn Féin at a time when negotiations with the party were against DUP policy.
Sammy Wilson said he was ""never ever asked whether I took part in those meetings or not so I never involved myself in any denial"".
He said that while his party's position was that the negotiations should not be attended with Sinn Féin at the time, that the meetings did not constitute negotiations.
The Rev Harold Good, an ex-Methodist Church president, recently revealed in a book that the talks took place in his home.
Rev Good said that the meetings were attended by Martin McGuinness and Jeffrey Donaldson.
'What are people prepared to accept?'
Speaking on the BBC's Talkback programme, Wilson said: ""I think that anybody who has observed negotiations, not just in Northern Ireland over the years, but it's always clear that before you come to final part in negotiations both sides try to find out what are the limits, what are the things that people are prepared to accept, what are they prepared to do.""
He said that the purpose of these meetings was ""to assess whether there was any real intent on the other side to come to an agreement"".
Wilson also insisted his party did not need to apologise about the meetings with Sinn Féin.
""We made it clear to Sinn Féin we were not prepared to sit in government with them while they were still engaged in paramilitary activity.""
Officially, the DUP has always maintained it never sat down with Sinn Féin until Ian Paisley and Gerry Adams met at Stormont in March 2007, shortly before the parties entered power-sharing.
When asked about the revelations in the book the party said some individual members of the party did accept invites to meetings, facilitated by third parties, to see whether there was sufficient common ground to reach an agreement.
Treatment of David Trimble
When Rev Good's book was published, the former Ulster Unionist Party leader Sir Reg Empey said it showed that at the time the DUP was ""telling lies"".
""We did speak to Sinn Féin, but we spoke to them publicly, in a talks process,"" he explained.
""And we were denounced right, left and centre, and some of the denunciations became physical in certain cases, and you've seen the treatment David Trimble and Daphne Trimble got in Upper Bann - pushed around and abused.""
'Meetings weren't negotiations'
Wilson denied the party had been dishonest.
""We weren’t lying to the public, the party had an official position, individuals within the party, and I was one of them, took opportunities where they were to try and get intelligence which you could feed back so that people were in a position to know whether or not there was business to be done.""
He said that these meetings were not negotiations, only information gathering exercises.",2024-10-29
BBC,"Where Kamala Harris stands on 10 key policy issues, from immigration to guns","Where Kamala Harris stands on 10 key issues, from immigration to guns
Vice-President Kamala Harris became the Democratic Party's nominee for president relatively late in the 2024 contest - having replaced Joe Biden - and she then selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate.
She released a detailed policy guide in early September offering voters a sense of what a Harris-Walz administration might look like.
This focuses on her economic and foreign policy agenda, and highlights her most urgent priority to tackle the cost of living.
Here are her key policy pledges.
Economy
As vice-president, Ms Harris worked with President Biden to pass major economic legislation - regularly labelled ""Bidenomics"" - which included major investments in infrastructure and green energy.
Growth and jobs creation have been strong but inflation and high interest rates continue to hit American wallets.
In her convention acceptance speech, the vice-president promised mortgage assistance for first-time homebuyers, a tax credit for parents of newborns and bans on price gouging at the grocery store to help target inflation.
She added that her plans would create ""an opportunity economy where everyone has a chance to compete and a chance to succeed"".
In her first interview as the Democratic nominee with CNN, Ms Harris said that one of her highest priorities was ""to support and strengthen the middle class"", a theme she has repeated on the campaign trail.
Taxes
In 2017, while a senator, Ms Harris supported a number of progressive tax programmes. She co-sponsored a bill with former presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders to expand social security for the elderly by increasing the tax rate on investments.
As a presidential candidate in 2019, she supported a corporate tax rate of 35%, up from 21%.
This was more aggressive than President Biden's proposal, which she also backed, to increase the rate to 28%.
During her acceptance speech after being confirmed as the Democratic candidate, she said she would ""pass a middle class tax cut that will benefit more than 100 million Americans"".
This refers to the restoration of the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit. Restoring the expanded Child Tax Credit would give families with newborn children a $6,000 (£4,630) tax cut.
A campaign official also told the BBC that the vice-president would continue to back President Biden's proposal to not raise taxes on Americans earning less than $400,000 (£310,000).
Abortion
Ms Harris has long supported abortion rights.
She was the first vice-president to visit an abortion clinic, and toured the country after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade in 2022 to address state abortion bans - often framing the issue as a matter of personal freedom.
She has made abortion central to her campaign, and continues to advocate for legislation that would safeguard reproductive rights nationwide.
“When Congress passes a law to restore reproductive freedoms, as president of the United States, I will sign it into law,” she said at a campaign rally in Atlanta, Georgia.
She has reiterated that commitment several times, including during the ABC News debate with Donald Trump.
Immigration
Ms Harris's position on the border has become more moderate over time.
On the campaign trail, she has reiterated her continued support for the cross-party border security bill that would have included hundreds of millions of dollars for border wall construction.
It was torpedoed by congressional Republicans in February 2024 at Trump's urging.
It would have fast-tracked decisions on asylum cases, limited humanitarian parole, and expanded the authority to deport migrants.
The vice-president says she would revive the bill and sign it into law.
She has also said there ""should be consequences"" for people who cross the US border unlawfully, though she previously supported a more lenient approach.
As vice-president, she was tasked with tackling the root causes of the record numbers of Central American migrants crossing the southern border. Those numbers spiked during the Biden administration, but have declined in recent months.
She helped raise $3bn - largely from private companies - to fund regional investments designed to encourage residents to remain in their home countries.
Nato and Ukraine aid
Ms Harris's early career focused largely on domestic issues and those affecting the state of California, but she has become more involved in foreign policy since being elected to the US Senate.
As vice-president, she has met 150 world leaders and visited 21 countries.
She attended the Munich Security Conference in February 2024, where she spoke in support of western security alliance Nato and denounced Russia's invasion of Ukraine.
Ms Harris has vowed to support Ukraine “for as long as it takes”, and represented the US at Kyiv's “peace conference” in Switzerland in June 2024.
In her speech at the Democratic convention, she said she warned Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky about Russian aggression five days before the invasion, and had ""helped mobilise a global response"" after the war began.
The vice-president has also pledged, if elected, to reject isolationism and ensure that ""America - not China - wins the competition for the 21st Century"".
Israel-Gaza War
Ms Harris has been a long-time advocate for a two-state solution in the region, and has called for an end to the war in Gaza.
In her convention acceptance speech, she pledged as president to ensure ""that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination"".
As vice-president, she was one of the first people in the Biden administration to call for an ""immediate ceasefire"", raise concerns over the ""humanitarian catastrophe for Palestinians"" and charge Israel with ending the conflict.
She raised these issues in what she called ""frank and constructive"" talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he visited Washington in July.
However, she has not supported the arms embargo on Israel which some on the US left want.
At the party convention, she said she would ""always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself"".
She reiterated her support for the country during the debate with Trump, saying ""I have my entire career and life supported Israel and the Israeli people"".
In her CNN interview, Ms Harris indicated that she would focus on securing a ceasefire deal, which was President Biden's approach.
Healthcare
Earlier in her career, Ms Harris supported expanding publicly-funded healthcare programmes that cover the elderly, youth with disabilities and poor.
This included backing Medicare-for-All, a progressive policy that would make all healthcare publicly funded. She later softened her support for this.
Her campaign told the BBC that she would not push for a single-payer system if elected to the White House.
During her vice-presidency, the White House has had health care successes. It reduced prescription drug costs, capped insulin prices at $35, allowed Medicare to negotiate drug prices and capped out-of-pocket expenses for Medicare drug coverage.
On the campaign trail, she has said that she wants to erase billions of dollars in medical debt for Americans and would work with states on the issue.
Details remain thin, but when she was the California attorney general, Ms Harris regularly used anti-trust laws to put pressure on insurers, hospitals and drug companies to address costs.
Crime
Ms Harris started her legal career prosecuting child abusers and sex traffickers before being elected district attorney of San Francisco, and then serving as California's attorney general.
She was criticised by the progressive left for increasing conviction rates - particularly of violent criminals - and was at times labelled ""a cop"" - though the right has also accused her of being soft on crime.
Ms Harris has also used her past as a prosecutor to serve as a major contrast with her opponent, who was convicted on 34 charges in a hush-money scheme to illegally influence the 2016 election.
She mentioned Mr Trump's conviction - and that he had been found liable for committing sexual abuse - in her Democratic party conference acceptance speech.
Gun laws
Ms Harris has a history of backing gun safety regulations throughout her political career. While California's attorney general, she successfully defended the state's gun laws when they faced legal challenges.
As vice-president, she has overseen the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention. Earlier this year, she announced resources to support the implementation of red-flag laws, which are designed to deny firearms to those who may harm themselves and others.
She also encouraged states to tap into $750m in federal funds that the Biden-Harris administration made available for crisis intervention programmes.
Her policy platform includes a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines as well as a requirement for universal background checks.
During the debate she noted that both she and her vice-presidential nominee Tim Walz are gun owners.
Climate and fracking
As a prosecutor, Ms Harris defended California's climate laws and sued oil companies for environmental damage. She also called for climate change policies via a ""Green New Deal"" during her 2020 presidential campaign - some of which came to fruition under the current administration.
During a CNN town hall in 2019, she said that ""there is no question I'm in favour of banning fracking"", which is a technique for recovering gas and oil from shale rock that can be damaging to the environment.
But she has since changed her stance. During the presidential debate, she said she cast the tie-breaking vote to pass the Inflation Reduction Act - which opened up new leases for fracking companies - in addition to funnelling hundreds of billions of dollars to renewable energy and electric vehicle tax credit and rebate programs.
""My position is that we have got to invest in diverse sources of energy so we reduce our reliance on foreign oil,"" she said.
Ms Harris said she will protect public lands and public health, lower household energy costs and hold polluters accountable to secure clear air and water if elected in November, according to her policy document.",2024-08-17
BBC,The Apprentice film star says Trump criticism 'inspiring violence',"The Apprentice film star says Trump criticism 'inspiring violence'
The stars of a newly-released film about Donald Trump, actors Jeremy Strong and Sebastian Stan, have told the BBC they are concerned about violence being incited by the US presidential candidate's criticism of the film.
The ex-president tried to block the recent release of The Apprentice - which came less than a month before the US presidential election.
Trump called people involved in making the film ""HUMAN SCUM"" in a post on social media on Sunday.
Stan said he believed the comments were ""inspiring violence"", while Strong said he was starting to feel the situation was ""slightly dangerous"" after Trump's post.
Trump also claimed the film was ""fake"" and a ""hatchet job"" released right before the 5 November vote ""to try and hurt"" his campaign.
The film's leads defended the film's historical accuracy in an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
Strong, when asked during the interview whether he felt fear or concern about being in the film, replied: ""It wasn't really until yesterday that I felt a sense of this feels slightly precarious and slightly dangerous and being in the crosshairs of the moment.""
He said Trump targeting the film's writer Gabe Sherman - calling him a ""lowlife"" and questioning his credentials - had sparked an influx of hate.
""Yesterday [Sherman] was barraged with threats, death threats, anti-semitic hate,"" Strong said.
Strong noted Trump's use of the words ""human scum"", which the actor said ""is a term used by Hitler and Stalin"" and other dictators.
Stan, meanwhile, said the comments were ""divisive. It's inspiring violence, a threat.""
""Many people now, thanks to him, feel they have this permission to behave like animals, and all we've certainly tried to do is inspire some conversation...towards a person that calls himself the leader of the free world and is going to run for president.""
The Apprentice is set in the 1970s and 80s, when Trump, played by Stan, was beginning to make his name as a businessman in New York.
The film focuses on Trump's relationship with lawyer and mentor Roy Cohn (played by Succession's Strong), who instilled certain values in Trump such as never admitting defeat.
Both actors noted the film's extensive research was ""based in historical record"".
""It is a film, but I think it's a responsible film,"" Strong said. ""I think we all aimed for veracity. We weren't trying to vilify Trump, which I think a lot of people think that's the only reason we would make this film.""
The actor added he believed ""art is meant to speak truth to power"".
The film's writer, Sherman, earlier this week at the London premiere had said he was ""happy that he's (Trump) is paying attention to the film. It means it's touching a nerve.""",2024-10-17
BBC,Can illegal immigrants really vote in the US election?,"Can illegal immigrants really vote in the US election?
Donald Trump and his Republican allies have repeatedly claimed that the Democrats are planning to get illegal immigrants to vote in the US election.
“Our elections are bad, and a lot of these illegal immigrants coming in, they're trying to get them to vote,” Trump said during the presidential debate with Kamala Harris.
BBC Verify has identified more than 100 paid-for ads on Facebook and Instagram posted by Republicans since the start of September focusing on the issue.
It is illegal for a non-US citizen to vote in a national election, but studies suggest cases of this actually happening are very rare.
What laws are in place to stop illegal immigrants voting?
The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 prohibits non-citizens - which includes illegal immigrants - from voting in federal elections.
The punishment includes a year in prison, a fine, and possibly deportation.
Every state is required to use a common registration form which requires people to confirm they are US citizens, under penalty of perjury for false claims, but does not require documentary proof.
“That first step of having to tick a box saying you’re a citizen to register to vote is a huge deterrent for illegal immigrants, as it’s hugely risky to lie,” says Jasleen Singh, a voting expert at the liberal policy think tank Brennan Center for Justice.
In many states, voter rolls are cross-referenced with citizenship and immigration services, death certificates, and postal records to make sure that people who are non-citizens, dead, or live out of state are not registered to vote.
“At the polls, there’s a list of eligible voters, and if a non-citizen turns up, they’ll be turned away or told to cast a provisional ballot which will only be accepted if they can provide proof of citizenship,” says Prof Ronald Hayduk, a voting rights expert at San Francisco State University.
Non-citizens are not allowed to vote in state-wide elections either.
However, some municipalities in California, Maryland, Vermont and Washington DC do allow them to vote in certain local elections, such as for school boards.
What evidence is there that illegal immigrants vote?
A number of studies, both from conservative and left-leaning organisations, suggest instances of illegal immigrants voting in US federal elections are very rare.
One by the Brennan Center for Justice interviewed 44 election officials who worked across 12 states during the 2016 election.
It found that out of 23.5 million votes counted in these states, an estimated 30 suspected incidents of non-citizens voting were referred for further investigation.
That’s about 0.0001% of all votes cast.
An analysis of a database which collected election fraud cases between 1999 and 2023 by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group, found 77 instances of non-citizens voting.
A number of other reports, including by the Cato Institute, a conservative think tank, entitled ‘Non-citizens Don’t Illegally Vote in Detectable Numbers’, come to similar conclusions.
""According to many sources of evidence, the number of non-citizens who vote in elections is very small,"" says Walter Olson, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute who's written a number of reports on voter fraud.
""It's not zero, some people slip through the cracks for various reasons, but it's nowhere near at the level to impact the outcome of an election.""
What evidence do Republicans cite?
The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, a Republican proposal which would require people to prove their citizenship when registering to vote, has been rejected in the House of Representatives.
Republican lawmakers continue to push for more citizenship requirements.
“We have a number of states who have done audits of their voter rolls and found thousands of non-citizens,” the lead Republican in the House, Mike Johnson, told CNN.
He highlighted Ohio, Pennsylvania and Georgia - three states where polls show a tight race between Trump and Kamala Harris.
In Ohio, a review called for by Republican officials in the state, found that out of about eight million registered voters, there were 597 cases which have been referred for “further review and potential prosecution” for non-citizens registering to vote.
In Pennsylvania, a glitch with electronic touchscreens in state drivers' licence centres wrongly showed non-citizens the option to register to vote while getting new or updated licences.
This glitch was in the system between 2006 and 2017, and has since been resolved.
In 2017, Pennsylvania state election officials said non-citizen immigrants might have cast 544 ballots illegally out of more than 93 million ballots in elections dating back to 2000.
In Georgia, a review of voter rolls in 2022 found 1,634 people “had attempted to register to vote” but “were not able to be verified”, out of about seven million registered voters.
“Voter fraud and illegal immigrants voting is so rare that this myth is to sow doubt in election integrity and lay the groundwork to cast doubt on the election outcome,” argues Ms Singh.
Republican ads sow further doubt
BBC Verify has identified 118 paid-for ads posted on Facebook and Instagram since 1 September by Republican candidates or by Republican political groups which claim widespread voter registration of non-citizens, or which raise the question of whether non-citizens should be allowed to vote in elections.
The ads we identified were shown between 7.8 and nine million times on the platforms.
One - which had more than 2.4 million views - invites users to participate in a poll with the question: ""Should illegal immigrants be allowed to vote?""
Another ad posted by Congresswoman Ann Wagner, with more than 900,000 views, invites users to answer the same question.

BBC,Who is Kamala Harris? The many identities of the first woman VP,"The many identities of the first woman vice-president
It took less than an hour after Joe Biden's decision to step aside for Democrats to begin to rally around Kamala Harris as their party's new 2024 presidential nominee.
As the US vice-president aspires to be the first woman to hold the country's top job, her campaign is re-energising liberal voters and has raised a record $671m (£514m) in donations over the past two months - nearly triple what her Republican rival Donald Trump has managed.
But her journey to the top of the ticket has been unique, fraught, and full of difficult questions. Here is a look at Ms Harris' career, the events that have shaped her life, and how she became the first black female presidential nominee.
How Kamala rose to become VP
Ms Harris first threw her hat into the ring for president five years ago.
She began her career as the district attorney - or top prosecutor - for Alameda County and, from 2004 to 2011, for the city of San Francisco.
Her next promotion was as California's attorney general, becoming the first woman and first black person elected to serve as the top lawyer in America's most populous state.
She used that momentum to propel her successful 2016 run as California's next US senator, a perch from which she drew buzz with her prosecutorial style in committee hearings.
But a 2020 presidential bid that began with big crowds and major debate moments fizzled out as Ms Harris struggled to articulate her ideology and policy platform.
Her campaign died in less than a year and it was Mr Biden who brought the now 59-year-old back under a national spotlight by adding her to his ticket.
Gil Duran, a former communications director for Ms Harris, called it ""a big reversal of fortune"".
""Many people didn't think she had the discipline and focus to ascend to a position in the White House so quickly... although people knew she had ambition and star potential. It was always clear that she had the raw talent,"" Duran said.
Ms Harris focused on several key initiatives while in the White House, and she was instrumental in many of the Biden administration's most touted accomplishments.
She set a new record for the most tie-breaking votes cast by a vice-president in the history of the Senate, helping pass the Inflation Reduction Act and the American Rescue Plan, which provided Covid-era stimulus payments and other relief.
Mr Biden also called upon Ms Harris to lead efforts addressing the root causes of migration amid a record influx of undocumented migrants at the US-Mexico border.
It is an issue opponents point to as one where she hasn't made enough progress, and she was criticised by Republicans and some Democrats for taking six months to plan a trip to the border after entering office.
More recently, Ms Harris has been the administration's point person to highlight the harms caused by abortion bans after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, the half-century precedent guaranteeing the right to an abortion, in 2022.
The battle over reproductive rights took centre stage throughout the Democratic convention in August, aligning neatly with a broader animating message: freedom.
In her keynote DNC address, the biggest speech of her career, Ms Harris criticised Trump and Republicans as the architects of unpopular efforts to restrict abortion access around the country.
""Simply put, they are out of their minds,"" she said, promising to restore the protections afforded by Roe.
Ms Harris is also seeking to re-introduce herself to voters, with some polls showing many view Trump as closer to the centre of the political spectrum.
On the 2020 campaign trail, she touted left-wing leanings on immigration, LGBT rights and other issues but faced repeated attacks over her prosecutorial past.
Four years later, Ms Harris is presenting herself as the cop who will crack down on a convicted felon in Trump.
But she is also promising to deliver on a progressive agenda that lifts up middle-class families like her own.
""My entire career, I’ve only had one client: the people,"" she said.
The roots of Kamala Harris
Ms Harris was born in Oakland, California to two immigrant parents: an Indian-born mother and Jamaican-born father.
Her parents divorced when she was five and she was raised primarily by her Hindu single mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, a cancer researcher and civil rights activist.
Ms Harris speaks often about the lessons she bestowed upon her daughters.
""She was tough, courageous, a trailblazer in the fight for women’s health,"" Ms Harris told the DNC. ""She taught us to never complain about injustice, but do something about it.""
Ms Harris grew up engaged with her Indian heritage, joining her mother on visits to India, but she has said that her mother immersed both her younger sister Maya and her in Oakland's black culture.
""My mother understood very well that she was raising two black daughters,"" she wrote in her autobiography The Truths We Hold.
""She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as black girls and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud black women.""
Her biracial roots and upbringing could make it easier to engage with and appeal to many Americans. Parts of the country with rapid demographic change - enough change to alter a region's politics - see her as an aspirational symbol.
But it was her time at Howard University, one of the nation's preeminent historically black colleges and universities, which she has described as among the most formative experiences of her life.
Lita Rosario-Richardson met Kamala Harris while at Howard in the 1980s when students would gather on campus to hang out and discuss politics, fashion and gossip.
""I noticed she had a keen sense of argumentation,"" she said.
They bonded over an aptitude for energetic debate with campus Republicans, their experience growing up with single mothers, even the fact that they're both Libras. It was a formative era politically too.
""Reagan was president at the time and it was the apartheid era and there was a lot of talk about divestiture with 'trans Africa' and the Martin Luther King holiday issue,"" Ms Rosario-Richardson said.
""We know that, being descendants of enslaved people and people of colour coming out of colonisation, that we have a special role and having an education gives us a special position in society to help effect change,"" she explained - it was a philosophy and a call to action that was part of the university experience Ms Harris lived.
But Ms Harris also operates with ease in predominantly white communities. Her early years included a period in Canada. When Ms Gopalan Harris took a job teaching at McGill University, Kamala and Maya went with her, attending school in Montreal for five years.
Ms Harris says she's always been comfortable with her identity and simply describes herself as an ""American"".
She told the Washington Post in 2019 that politicians should not have to fit into compartments because of their colour or background.
""My point was: I am who I am. I'm good with it. You might need to figure it out, but I'm fine with it,"" she said.
The making of witty 'debate club' Kamala
From the very earliest, as her friend Ms Rosario-Richardson attests, she showed the skills that allowed her to be one of few women to break through barriers.
""That is what attracted me to get her to join debate team [at Howard University], a fearlessness,"" she said.
Wit and humour are parts of that. In a video posted to her social media in 2020 after winning the election, she shares the news of the win - with a very hearty laugh - with Mr Biden: ""We did it, we did it Joe. You're going to be the next president of the United States!""
The laugh she shared with the then-president-elect, when making that first momentous phone call, was one her friend recognised immediately and intimately.
""She has always had that laugh, she has always had a sense of humour too, she had a sense of wit - even in the context of a university debate - to get those points across.""
Kamala, 'Momala', history-maker
In 2014, then-Senator Harris married lawyer Doug Emhoff and became stepmother to his two children, Cole and Ella.
She wrote an article for Elle magazine in 2019 about the experience of becoming a stepmother and unveiled the name that came to dominate many headlines that followed.
""When Doug and I got married, Cole, Ella, and I agreed that we didn't like the term 'stepmom'. Instead they came up with the name 'Momala'.""
Along with their dad, Cole and Ella were fixtures at the 2024 DNC, taking to the stage to celebrate Ms Harris and what they call their ""big, beautiful blended family"".
Her sister, Maya, niece Meena and - perhaps most memorably - her two grand-nieces also made appearances in Chicago.
Many argue she should also be seen and recognised as the descendant of another kind of family and that is the inheritor of generations of black female activists.
Nadia Brown, associate professor of political science and African American studies at Purdue University, told the BBC that Ms Harris follows in the footsteps of Fannie Lou Hamer, Ella Baker and Septima Clark, among others.
""She is heir to a legacy of grassroots organisers, elected officials, and unsuccessful candidates who paved this path to the White House,"" she said.

BBC,Biden clarifies 'garbage' comment after fresh US election row,"Biden tries to clarify 'garbage' comment after fresh US election row
President Joe Biden has tried to clarify comments that triggered a fresh row, after he was accused of calling supporters of Donald Trump ""garbage"".
He was responding to comic Tony Hinchcliffe who sparked controversy by calling Puerto Rico, a US territory, an ""island of garbage"" during a Trump rally on Sunday.
“The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters,” Biden was initially quoted as saying on Tuesday, prompting an angry Republican backlash.
The White House later released a transcript which included an apostrophe, and said the president was talking about the words of Hinchcliffe, and not all Trump supporters.
""The only garbage I see floating out there is (Trump's) supporter’s… his demonisation of Latinos is unconscionable, and it's un-American,"" the transcript reads.
Biden himself later addressed his video call with non-profit organisation Voto Latino, writing on X: ""Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump's supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage - which is the only word I can think of to describe it.
""His demonisation of Latinos is unconscionable. That's all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don't reflect who we are as a nation.""
But Trump's backers have seized upon the comments, making comparisons with a controversial remark by Hillary Clinton in 2016 during Trump's first run for office, when she said half of Trump's supporters were from a ""basket of deplorables"".
As the war of words escalated, Trump himself suggested Kamala Harris - his rival for the White House - was running a ""campaign of hate"".
During his campaign, Trump has repeatedly referred to his opponents as ""the enemy from within"" - rhetoric that Harris described as divisive.
Referring to the Biden comments, Trump said: ""You can’t lead America if you don’t love the American people.""
The Madison Square Garden rally referenced by Biden - during which Hinchcliffe and others sparked offence with a range of comments - has now been defended by Trump as a ""love fest"".
He acknowledged that ""somebody said some bad things"" but said he did not think it was ""a big deal"".
He stopped short of issuing an apology demanded by prominent figures from the island itself, which is a US territory. A number of Republicans - including from neighbourhoods with strong Latino populations - were outraged.
In Philadelphia, in the key swing state of Pennsylvania, members of the 90,000-strong Puerto Rican population told the BBC they would not forget the joke.
Residents of Puerto Rico - a US island territory in the Caribbean - are unable to vote in presidential elections, but the large diaspora in the US can.
Hinchcliffe himself has defended his material, saying his critics ""have no sense of humour"".
Biden's comments on the furore threatened to overshadow a rally on Tuesday evening by Kamala Harris, who is running for the White House as the Democratic nominee after Biden pulled out earlier in the contest.
Harris delivered what her campaign has called her ""closing argument"" in Washington DC - at the spot from which Trump spoke shortly before a riot by his supporters at the US Capitol building on 6 January 2021.
She urged voters to ""turn the page on the drama and the conflict"" in American politics.

All 435 seats in the US House of Representatives and 33 seats in the Senate are up for election on 5 November.
The two major parties currently split control of Congress, with Republicans in charge of the House of Representatives and Democrats holding the Senate, both by narrow margins.
Regardless of whether voters send Donald Trump or Kamala Harris to the White House, the party which wins a majority on either side of Capitol Hill will have greater leverage to enact its own agenda.
So who are some of the most interesting individuals seeking a job in Congress and how the outcome of their races could affect the balance of power in US politics?
The union mechanic
Polls suggest that Republicans may regain control of the Senate with likely victories in Montana and West Virginia - but an upset may be brewing in their traditional stronghold of Nebraska.
Independent candidate Dan Osborn is turning heads with his challenge to two-term Republican Senator Deb Fischer. A recent internal poll shows him leading Fischer by two points.
Osborn, 49, has served in the US Navy and National Guard.
He worked as an industrial machinery mechanic at the Omaha factory of cereal maker Kellogg's where, as head of his local union, he led a walkout in 2021. The 77-day strike forced the company to withdraw a proposal to slash benefits - thus keeping the plant open until 2026.
Now working as a specialised pipefitter, Osborn is offering Nebraskans a path outside the two-party system by running as an independent candidate. Democrats are implicitly backing his bid by not putting up a candidate of their own.
The tougher-than-expected challenge for Fischer has also drawn the attention of national Republicans who are now pouring money into the race.
The car dealer
Senator Sherrod Brown is the last Democratic state-wide elected official left standing in Ohio, but the state's rightwards drift is endangering his re-election bid.
Republicans - who only need to flip two seats to win back the Senate - are feeling confident their nominee, Bernie Moreno, is the man to finally unseat Brown.
Born in Bogota, Colombia, Moreno came to the US at the age of five. Over nearly two decades, he built one of the largest car dealership groups in America, the award-winning Collection Auto Group. In more recent years, Moreno has also invested in blockchain technology.
Now running as an America-First nominee endorsed by Donald Trump, Moreno says he will bring commonsense business principles to Congress if he wins - a motto other Republican candidates have sought to replicate in the Trump era.
Moreno, 57, is also one in a rising wave of minority candidates running under the Republican Party banner and, if elected, he would be Ohio's first Latino senator.
The news anchor
Unseating an incumbent House lawmaker in a district with a strong partisan tilt is an increasingly difficult feat in a polarised US. Democrat Janelle Stelson appears poised to do just that.
Stelson has reported on local television in central Pennsylvania since 1986, making her a familiar face and yet a fresh one to voters.
Two other long-time news presenters - Arizona's Kari Lake and New York's John Avlon - are also running for Congress this year, but neither is polling quite as strongly as Stelson, who is seeking to topple six-term Republican Scott Perry in the right-leaning congressional district.
Perry is a former chairman of the right-wing House Freedom Caucus and was a leading figure in the Trump campaign's efforts to overturn the 2020 election.
Stelson, who was a registered Republican until last year, has branded him an election denier but that has not been the key focus of her campaign.
The Democrat's approach reflects a consensus that election denialism has faded as a concern among voters.
INstead, the 64-year-old is hammering Perry on his voting record and obstructionist style, while also harnessing liberal outrage over efforts to restrict abortion.
The war hero
Not many candidates running in this election cycle have a life story quite as compelling as Sam Brown, the Republican Party's Senate nominee in Nevada.
By his own admission, the former US army captain should not even be alive today.
In 2008, four months into a deployment in Kandahar, Afghanistan, a roadside bomb detonated under his vehicle, and set him ablaze. By the time the fire was extinguished, nearly a third of his body, including his face, was severely burnt.
The West Point military academy graduate was forced into medical retirement and spent the next three years undergoing intensive physical rehabilitation.
He went on to marry his burns unit dietitian, with whom he now has three children, completed an MBA programme and launched a small business that provided critical medical care to other veterans.
With this record, many expected that Brown, 41, would pose a stiff challenge to Nevada's Democratic Senator Jacky Rosen in her bid for re-election. But Brown is lagging far behind and polls suggest Rosen may coast to victory.
Abortion access has factored heavily into the race, as Rosen and her allies have hit the airwaves to warn that Brown will be one more vote in favour of potential abortion restrictions.
More importantly, while Brown has the backing of mainstream Republicans such as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, his support from the party's ever-ascendant Trump wing is much softer. Trump himself long delayed endorsing Brown and many of his staunchest supporters campaigned for other candidates in the Republican primary.
The waitress
Democrats have struggled to win in small-town America as rural residents have increasingly turned to the Republican Party, but liberal candidates around the country are still betting they can prevail in close races against controversial figures.
In Wisconsin, Rebecca Cooke, 36, is looking to flip the congressional seat held by Republican Derrick Van Orden back into her party's column.
Van Orden, a first-term lawmaker and former US Navy Seal, has often made headlines with his public outbursts, from dressing down teenage Senate pages inside the Capitol building to heckling President Joe Biden during this year's State of the Union address.
Cooke - who is campaigning on lowering costs, expanding access to healthcare, passing commonsense gun laws - was born and raised on a dairy farm in the central part of a state known as ""America's Dairyland"".
A former small business owner who runs a non-profit organisation and works as a waitress, she argues that Van Orden is more interested in ""picking fights and climbing the ladder"" than fulfilling legislative duties.
Cooke's profile matches that of Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, a small business owner who narrowly eked out a win in rural Washington state two years ago against a far-right election denier.
A Perez re-election and a Cooke victory this November may go a long way in delivering the House majority to their party.
The Nascar driver
Representing a swing district in Maine, Democrat Jared Golden has built a career in Washington by frequently bucking his own party on issues like energy and the environment.
But as Golden seeks a fifth term, he is facing a challenge from state lawmaker and former stock car driver Austin Theriault.
Theriault, 30, hails from a logging and farming family with deep roots in the northern tip of Maine, just south of Canada.
Trained to race from the age of 13, the Republican broke records in 2017 and drove alongside Nascar legend Kenny Schrader en route to being crowned the Automobile Racing Club of America Menards Series champion in 2017.
From driving the ""Maine car"" on America's most famous speedways to mentoring, managing and training several younger drivers, Theriault translated his love for his home state into a term in the state House of Representatives. He is now hoping he can be a voice for Mainers in the nation's capital.
Another former professional athlete is making his own run for office this year. Colin Allred, once a line-backer for the National Football League's Tennessee Titans, is hoping to be the one to break the Democrats' losing streak in Texas and thus ending firebrand Republican Senator Ted Cruz's political career.
The ER doctor
The fight for abortion access has galvanised Democrats at the national, state and local level since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade two years ago.
In swing state Arizona, Amish Shah is telling voters that the abortion restrictions supported by Republicans force doctors like him to “choose between fulfilling my oath to the patient” and “going to jail”.
The Indian American has served three terms in the state's House of Representatives with a bipartisan record of achievement and a professed love of public service.
Now that he is running for the US Congress, it is his experience as an emergency service physician that is coming to the fore in his bid to unseat seven-term Republican lawmaker David Schweikert.
Schweikert, who recently skipped out on a candidate forum planned for him and his challenger, says he is anti-abortion and he has declined to directly state how he would vote on a federal abortion ban.
Concerns over limits on abortion have been particularly pronounced in the Grand Canyon State. The repeal of Roe in 2022 triggered the enforcement of a long-dormant Civil War-era law that criminalised all abortions except when a woman's life is in jeopardy. State lawmakers ultimately voted to repeal the law.
Arizona is also one of several states in which voters will be asked whether they want to enshrine the right to abortion in the state's constitution.

BBC,North Carolina swing state profile,"A quick guide to swing state North Carolina
North Carolina, famous for Michael Jordan, Krispy Kreme and the world’s first flight in a powered aircraft, is one of seven states that will decide the 2024 US presidential election.
Voting in swing states is hard to predict and can swing Republican or Democrat - that’s why you’re hearing so much about them as campaigning draws to a close.
Here’s all you need to know.
Population
10.7m, same as Honduras
Electoral college votes
16 of 538
In a nutshell
It’s the only battleground state that Donald Trump won in 2020 so if Democrats were to flip it, his task becomes a lot harder.
2020 margin
Trump by 74,000 votes.
What's the deal now?
North Carolina is faithfully Republica, but Democrats almost won it in 2020 partly because of the state’s black voters, a group they have heavily targeted again this year.
What do voters say?
Democrats in North Carolina are excited to have Harris as their presidential nominee, the first black and south-east Asian woman in the role. “Everybody is energised and feels like we have a good chance,” says Michael Sutton, 70. William Overton, 85, is frustrated that abortion laws today “are worse than the 1950s”.
Republicans say their top issues are the economy and inflation, followed by immigration. “What we’ve seen the past four years is terrible,” says Zena Rose, a small business owner in Johnston County.
Expert view
For Democrats to win North Carolina, they will need high turnout from the state’s black voters, says Michael Bitzer, chair of the Catawba University Department of Politics, especially in the state’s more populous metros like Raleigh and Charlotte, and in the eastern rural parts of the state. Another key group Democrats need to see in high numbers are voters under the age of 43 - which Mr Bitzer says compose 42% of all registered North Carolina voters.
For Republicans to win, they need their party’s voters to continue registering at higher rates and voting in larger numbers than Democrats. Two things might challenge that, Mr Bitzer says. One factor is whether the 250,000 moderate Republicans who voted for Nikki Haley in the primary support Harris or choose not to vote. The second factor is Hurricane Helene, which destroyed much of the western part of the state in predominantly Republican areas.",2024-10-25
BBC,Undecided Americans impressed by Harris - did debate shift their votes?,"Undecided Americans impressed by Harris - but did debate shift their votes?
With only weeks left until the US presidential election, Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are in a battle to win the support of those who are yet to commit to either candidate.
The BBC has spoken to eight undecided voters who saw Tuesday night's 90-minute debate as being crucial in working out who to pick in November's ballot.
Vanessa was leaning towards voting for Trump before the debate started and is still leaning that way, but was impressed with Harris's performance.
I don't think the debate changed my opinion on voting for Trump, but I definitely am less fearful if [Harris] wins because I think she can handle herself and debate well.
I'm overall unchanged, but I like her better now.
I lost a lot of faith in the Democratic Party when they told us Joe Biden was fine, and then it turns out he's not, and so it's hard to trust that same administration going forward.
I do not want to vote for Trump, but I do not like this current administration. I won't change my mind before November, I'd just be less worried if she were to win.
Jeremy doesn't like Trump and didn't vote Democrat in 2016 or 2020, but after tonight's debate says he will be voting for Harris.
Tonight was the first night where genuinely, I would say I felt, like, scared at the prospect of a second Trump presidency.
His answers where he would fearmonger about immigrants killing dogs, fearmonger about World War III multiple times. Every time he spoke, it was frightening to a level that I have not felt from him before.
And while I don't love Harris, and I think she's very wishy-washy, she does not pose an existential threat to America like he does.
Tracy watched the debate but remains undecided over who she will vote for.
I thought both candidates spoke fairly well, but I thought Kamala answered more of the questions than Trump did.
I had never really seen anything about [Harris] so I was looking for basically an opinion on her. So I was rather pleased with some of what she had to say and actually what ex-President Trump had to say, but I get a very shifty vibe from him.
I don't trust [Trump]. I don't think he wants to run the country, I think he wants to own the country.
Mat was considering skipping the election all together, but after the debate he says he has made up his mind.
The debate was something.
Kamala Harris definitely did very well. I think Trump kind of did not. He lost his focus and kept rambling on where it was kind of incoherent.
After last night, I think I'll vote for Kamala Harris. I don't know if I'll be very enthusiastic about it but I will probably be voting for her.
There's still a little bit of time until November, but she very likely has my vote.
Kimberly hasn't been attracted to either of the major party candidates, but after the debate she is leaning towards supporting Harris.
If I could vote for no one, I probably would do that. I want to get the full facts before I do anything.
[I was] not impressed with Trump, I won't be voting for him.
William thought the debate conveyed a clear picture of both candidates, but says he is leaning towards Harris after watching.
Trump was all over the place. He was lured into a lot of questions that he should have answered perfectly like immigration and abortion, but he was caught off guard with statements about crowd size, which was really revealing.
I felt like Kamala was far more prepared for this than Donald Trump.
I personally want to see her in more one-on-one interviews after this, this is the first time I'm seeing her without Tim Walz and she did fine, in my opinion.
If she went out there more, spoke to the nation one-on-one more, she'd receive my vote at that point.
Rohan remains undecided, but says after the debate he's 51% for Harris and 49% for Trump. Still, he says, there's still time for that to change.
The debate did very little to change my perspective of Trump. This was more an audition for Kamala Harris to just kind of see who she is, where she stands on policies and her command of the stage.
She came across pretty rehearsed to me, but she dropped a lot of, sort of, baited statements that I think Trump bit on really hard - rattled him a bit, made him pretty angry.
All of this seemed pretty calculated to me, and that's not exactly what I was looking for out of her. I was looking for her to be a little more personable, a little more natural.
Chance wasn't very impressed with the debate performances and still remains undecided.
I didn't feel like the topics were discussed in depth, it was mostly the candidates talking at each other.
I was disappointed, really.
I personally wished they would go in depth about their policy, instead of attacking the other person for something about their policy.
I'm personally not a fan of either of them, but if I was going to choose one or the other, I would probably choose Harris.

BBC,Fact-checked claims from the Vance-Walz vice-presidential debate,"Immigration, Project 2025, taxes - VP debate claims fact-checked
Vice-presidential candidates Tim Walz and JD Vance sparred on stage during their one and only debate of the 2024 US election campaign.
Walz, the Democratic governor of Minnesota, and Vance, a Republican senator representing Ohio, traded claims on key election issues including immigration, foreign policy and reproductive rights.
Here are some claims from each candidate which the BBC Verify team fact-checked.
Are there up to 25 million illegal aliens in the US?
CLAIM: Vance: “We’ve got 20-25 million illegal aliens who are here in the country.”
VERDICT: These numbers are much higher than estimates for the number of illegal immigrants in the US.
Vance made this claim while criticising the border policies of President Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
It is impossible to know exactly how many illegal immigrants have come to the US, as many will have evaded law enforcement agencies, but several estimates put the number at around half what Vance claims.
A report published by the Office of Homeland Security earlier this year estimated the number of illegal immigrants living in the US, as of January 2022, at 11 million.
Pew Research Center and the Migration Policy Institute came up with similar estimates for 2022 and 2021.
And the Center for Immigration Studies estimated there were approximately 12 million illegal immigrants in May 2023.
Is Trump planning to register pregnancies?
CLAIM: Walz: “Their Project 2025 is going to have a registry of pregnancies.”
VERDICT: This is false - Project 2025 does not mention a registry of pregnancies. There is no evidence that Donald Trump is planning to introduce one.
Here, Walz was trying to link Vance and Trump to Project 2025 - a wish list of ultra-conservative policy proposals by the Heritage Foundation think tank.
Walz might be referring to a section in the document which states that a future Trump administration “should use every available tool, including the cutting of funds, to ensure that every state reports exactly how many abortions take place within its borders”.
Project 2025 suggests that US health authorities and states should collect such data, but it does not refer to any new federal agency to register pregnancies.
Trump has repeatedly distanced himself from Project 2025 - though dozens of former Trump administration officials have contributed to the think tank's proposals.

- TAKEAWAYS: Six things to remember from Vance v Walz
Did the Biden-Harris administration give Iran $100bn in unfrozen assets?
CLAIM: Vance: “Iran has received over $100bn in unfrozen assets by the Harris administration.""
VERDICT: This is false. There is no evidence that the Biden-Harris administration has unfrozen over $100bn (£75bn).
Speaking just hours after Iran launched a ballistic missile attack against Israel, Vance criticised the government over Iran.
Iran has had billions of dollars frozen in foreign banks as a result of international sanctions. Around $50bn of ""useable assets"" were unfrozen as part of the Iran nuclear deal negotiated under President Barack Obama in July 2015.
But Kamala Harris was not part of his administration.
There have been two agreements between the US and Iran under the Biden administration which released around $16bn in Iranian assets.
One was an extension of a deal introduced by Trump in 2018 which allowed Iran to access $10bn of frozen assets.
The other was a deal between the US and Iran made in September 2023, in which prisoners were exchanged and $6bn of Iranian assets released.
The deal stated that the unfrozen funds could only be used by Iran for humanitarian purposes.
BBC Verify has asked the Trump-Vance campaign what the basis for their $100bn claim is.
Has Trump paid any federal tax in the last 15 years?
CLAIM: Walz said: “Donald Trump hasn’t paid any federal tax in the last 15 years"". He then added “in the last year as president"".
VERDICT: The first part of this claim - which was also posted on Walz's X account during the debate - is false. The second part is true.
Trump has paid tax in the last 15 years but he did not pay any in the last year of his presidency.
A 2022 report, by the House Ways and Means Committee, released Trump's federal income tax returns for the years 2015 to 2020.
They show he paid:
- In 2015, $641,931
- In 2016, $750
- In 2017, $750
- In 2018, $999,466
- In 2019, $133,445
However, in 2020, his last year as president, Trump did not pay any federal income tax - so Walz was right on this one year.
Is the US the 'cleanest economy in the entire world'?
CLAIM: Vance: ""We're the cleanest economy in the entire world.""
VERDICT: This is false, according to two global rankings for overall environmental performance.
In 2024, the US was ranked 34th in the world overall by the Environmental Performance Index (EPI). It was 27th in the world for air quality, and 9th for water sanitation.
On one measure, minimising the threats of agriculture to the environment, the US came first.
Another monitoring body, the Climate Change Performance Index (CCPI) ranked the US 57th out of 63 countries and the European Union, in 2024.
Did Trump only build 2% of the border wall?
CLAIM: Walz: “He promised... ‘I’ll build you a big, beautiful wall'... less than 2% of that wall got built.”
VERDICT: Even by the most conservative estimate of how much border wall was built under Trump, this figure is exaggerated.
We asked the Walz campaign about his claim and they pointed us to a report that 52 miles of “new primary wall” were built under the former president.
The US-Mexico border is almost 2,000 miles - 52 miles of wall would cover roughly 2.7% of it.
However, the length of border wall built during Trump’s presidency depends on what you are measuring.
A ‘Border Wall Status’ report in January 2021 found that - under Trump - 52 miles of “new primary wall” were built along with 33 miles of “new secondary wall”.
It said that if sections in which existing barriers were replaced or reinforced were included, he built 458 miles.
President Biden suspended construction of the wall when he came into office, but last year he approved the building of 20 miles of barriers along the border in southern Texas.

BBC,US election: Women share how abortion shaped their vote,"'I'm not a one-issue voter, but this is huge': Women on how abortion shaped their vote
The 2024 presidential election is the first since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade, which protected the national right to an abortion.
The gender divide has been prominent in this election, with polls suggesting Kamala Harris has an advantage among women and former President Donald Trump is enjoying a similar lead among men.
The BBC has been speaking to women voters about how they are considering gender and abortion as they cast their ballots in the final days of the campaign.
Michelle works as a quality engineer in Arizona. The 38-year-old is a registered Republican, but plans on voting for Kamala Harris.
I'm concerned about women's rights and women's health care. I'm not a one-issue voter, but that is a huge one. I work in the medical sector and I was very personally affected by the overturn of Roe v Wade because I wasn't able to get access to a lot of the drugs I needed. Nobody was sure of what the legality was... even though they're used for other things.
The whole Republican stance is smaller government and don't let government make my personal decisions, so why are they trying to legislate what a woman can do with her body?
[A Harris presidency] would mean that all the things that my parents told me when I was younger were true - that just because you're a girl doesn't mean that you are limited.
This nurse practitioner from Texas voted for Trump during the last presidential election and plans to back him again.
[Trump] has definitely said things that he probably should have unsaid. I would have to shake my finger at that, especially as a woman, but I have yet to hear anything that would make me change my mind about my vote.
I'm not voting personality. I'm voting policy. I don't have to marry the man. I don't have to deal with him. I have to deal with his policies.
On abortion, [Harris] is not giving a gestational parameter of how late somebody can get an abortion. That cannot be-open ended. I was a NICU [neonatal intensive care unit] nurse for 17 years... I care about women's rights. I care about women. The mother is the first patient. However, that is the turn-off to me that she won't give an answer to that.
This Democrat from Illinois plans to vote for Harris on election day. She previously backed the Democratic ticket in 2020, voting for Joe Biden.
I am definitely concerned about the direction that reproductive rights are going in parts of the country. I feel that Trump's attempts to communicate that he understands why [reproductive rights] is an important issue to women has fallen woefully short.
I think Harris has an innate understanding of its importance, just being a woman and a woman of colour. Would I like her to lay out her plans a little bit more to potentially expand reproductive rights? Absolutely. But Trump has set the bar so low that she could really continue to not even mention it and she would still be doing a better job.
[A Harris presidency] brings tears to my eyes just to think about. I have a nine-year-old daughter and she's old enough to start having aspirations and to start paying attention to the world around her.
This library assistant voted for Trump in 2020, but now remains undecided and is considering ""writing in"" a candidate - casting a vote for someone who is not officially running.
This ain't my first rodeo and I've gotten to the point in my life where I can look past the advertising they're doing for two specific groups.
It's wonderful that we have Harris as a female seriously running for the presidency and that she has been a vice-president and has some experience. But Trump, when he was in office, I wasn't too upset with what he was doing.
I wouldn't mind having a female president but some of Harris's political doctrine and what I think is right don't line up.
Angela is a graduate student in Iowa. A Democrat, she backed Biden in the last presidential election and plans to vote for Harris.
I really would love this to be a moment of celebration as we elect a woman of colour to our highest office, but unfortunately with how tight the election is against Trump and how disappointing [Harris's] campaign has been on some of the issues that matter to me, it's been hard to be as celebratory as I'd like.
Obviously abortion is a huge issue that needs to be addressed, but I'm not necessarily happy, I should say, with either candidate's approaches in addressing the issue.
I understand Harris has a policy where she wants to codify Roe v Wade, but I think women's rights and issues extend outside of just abortion access. Trump is very wishy-washy on the issue of women's rights, so it's hard to pin him down on any stance.
This retired Republican who plans on voting for Trump. She also backed the former president in 2020.
I think [Trump] is really the only possibility because I think Harris is just clueless and incompetent. I think she would be a disaster for this country, just listening to her mumble and evade. I just get a horrible feeling about her.
I am pro-choice, actually, within reason. Not a late-term abortion. I don't agree with that. But I think Trump by really relegating [legislation] to the states themselves, he's being sensible.
Harris doesn't have much to run on so that's her big selling point with women. She doesn't have much substance to her, in other words, so she just hammers on and on about the abortion issue.
This independent voted for Biden in the 2020 presidential election and voted by mail this year supporting Harris.
Reproductive rights for women are huge for me as a woman, especially living in the state of Florida where there is an amendment on the ballot that will guarantee the protection for abortion rights.
I really want to support a party that's going to support reproductive rights for women and not just women, but for everybody, because what's to say it's not going to spread elsewhere? It starts with women, usually, but it goes on and on.
Our government is at least 50 years behind the times for a lot of things - especially other countries throughout the world having better representation. I have a niece that I love dearly. The fact that she could see [a female president], and just for that to be a normal thing for her, will be huge.
This independent voter from Georgia describes herself as a left-leaning moderate. Because of her faith and anti-abortion views, she's not supporting Harris or Trump this year.
I was actually going to vote for Harris, but then she started doubling down on how abortion is reproductive health... I'm a Catholic. I am pro-life.
The problem that I ran into is that I don't know how any Catholic can vote for somebody who spews the stuff like what we saw [from Trump] at Madison Square Garden recently. I take the injunction to welcome the stranger and to feed and clothe very seriously.
So under those circumstances, I've got nobody I can vote for.
This retired Texas resident voted for Biden in the last presidential election and has voted early in support of Harris.
I get so scared. We actually can't go back. It's very frightening to me. I had more rights than my granddaughter is going to have in her future and that's not right.
It is so disturbing that it is so close. [Trump] is a felon out on bail. I don't understand the Republicans. They used to be the law and order [party], supposedly, and it's now this.
I think a lot [of women] are coming out and saying, 'Why are you telling us what to do with our bodies?' Abortion is a personal thing and it's up to the doctor and the woman. It is none of my business.

BBC,Government aware of new Southport charges in past few weeks,"Government became aware of new Southport charges in last few weeks
The most senior figures in government first became aware of the possibility of new charges against the suspect in the Southport murders in the past few weeks, the BBC has been told.
Axel Rudakubana, 18 - who is accused of murdering three young girls in Southport - is facing two further charges, including one under the terrorism act.
The two candidates for the Conservative leadership said the government had questions to answer about the new charges, with Robert Jenrick suggesting that information was being ""concealed"" from the public.
A spokesperson for the prime minister said it was ""not correct"" to say the government had been involved in withholding facts from the public.
The police said it is ""certainly not the case"" that they have been keeping things from the public. It would be highly unusual for them to release details of a live police investigation.
The CPS said it has taken time to bring the charges because this was a ""lengthy and complex investigation"".
On Tuesday, Rudakubana was charged with production of a biological toxin contrary to Section 1 of the Biological Weapons Act 1974.
He has also been charged with possessing a PDF document of a kind likely to be useful to a person committing to or preparing an act of terrorism, contrary to Section 58 of the Terrorism Act 2000.
Counter Terrorism Police are not currently treating the Southport attack itself as a terrorist incident.
The teenager had already been charged with the murders of Bebe King, six, Elsie Dot Stancombe, seven, and nine-year-old Alice Dasilva Aguiar who died at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class on 29 July.
To charge someone under the Biological Weapons Act, the Crown Prosecution Service has to obtain consent from the government's law officers - the attorney general or solicitor general.
The BBC has been told that in this case, consent was requested in recent weeks, and granted ""within days"".
The teenager appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court via video link on Wednesday morning.
He did not respond to questions, such as to confirm his name, and sat holding his sweater over the bottom half of his face.
He had been due in court in Liverpool for a pre-trial preparation hearing last Friday, 25 October, but that was postponed in order for all the charges to be dealt with together.
The charging decision and its timing were a matter for the CPS, a government spokesperson added.
It comes after the two candidates for the Conservative leadership raised questions about the new charges.
During Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) in the Commons, Reform MP Richard Tice called for the police to be more open about its investigations.
In response, Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: ""All of us have a choice to make, including those running to be Conservative leader, they can either support the police in their difficult task or they can undermine the police in their difficult task.""
Ahead of PMQs, Speaker of the House Sir Lindsay Hoyle reminded MPs that the court case was ongoing and warned against speculation that could prejudice the outcome.
Earlier, Robert Jenrick had suggested that information was being ""concealed"" from the public.
“We were told for months that this was not a terror-related incident, and yet we have learnt that this individual, the suspect, was allegedly reading al-Qaeda manuals and had access to dangerous substances like ricin,"" he said.
""Given the scale of public interest, I think it is an important question to be asked, why was this information not put into the public domain sooner? So I’m asking the public authorities and the prime minister, what did they know, when did they learn it, and why was the decision taken not to be more honest and transparent with the public.""
Meanwhile Kemi Badenoch has suggested there are ""serious questions to be asked of the police, the CPS and also of Keir Starmer’s response"".
She has not elaborated on what those questions are, suggesting they should be asked in Parliament, but did not speak during Wednesday's session.
Jonathan Hall KC, who independently reviews terrorism legislation, told the BBC that investigations can be drawn out due to the sheer amount of information to be sorted through on a suspect's device.
""[Police] will sweep up devices, which are often a golden source of evidence, to find out whether or not there's a terror cause... and that takes some time to analyse because phones are very large these days, they're often encrypted,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The Southport attacks are not being treated as a terrorist incident.
Possessing a document that could be useful in preparing an act of terrorism is an entirely separate offence.
To be labelled as terrorism, the attack would have to be an attempt to advance a political, religious, racial or ideological cause. But it is not clear what possible motivation there might have been.
Authorities are urging people not to speculate, as it could jeopardise the entire court case.
Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said: ""These additional charges will undoubtedly be distressing for people in Southport.
""The most important thing is to get justice for Bebe, Alice and Elsie and their heartbroken families, and all those affected by the attack, and nobody should put that at risk.
""The police and prosecutors have an important job to do in their investigation, pursuing every avenue and taking the action they need to ahead of the trial.
""We must support them and ensure that everything possible is done to deliver justice.""",2024-10-30
BBC,Tiananmen Square: Tim Walz says he 'misspoke' in personal story,"Walz says he 'misspoke' in personal story about Tiananmen Square
US Democratic vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz has admitted during a live television debate that he ""misspoke"" when he claimed he was in Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.
Kamala Harris' running mate was asked by a debate moderator why he had repeatedly said over the years he was in Hong Kong as China’s communist rulers crushed pro-democracy protests, when he was in fact back in his home state of Nebraska.
Walz, who is governor of Minnesota, said: “I’ve not been perfect and I’m a knucklehead at times.”
It was not the first time Walz has fallen afoul of fact-checkers this campaign cycle.
His opponent on the debate stage, Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance, has also courted controversy with unfounded claims in this campaign, most notably about Haitian immigrants eating pets.
In Tuesday night's CBS debate in New York City, the moderator asked Walz to explain why he had claimed he was in Hong Kong when Chinese forces killed hundreds, possibly thousands, of anti-government protesters in Tiananmen Square, Beijing, on 4 June 1989, shocking the world.
Walz touted his work as a teacher, congressman and governor, before saying he sometimes gets ""caught up in the rhetoric"".
When pressed by the moderator about the timing discrepancy, Walz replied: ""All I said on this was, I got there that summer and misspoke on this, so I will just - that's what I've said.""
He has previously said he was in Hong Kong a month before Tiananmen Square, then forged ahead with a yearlong teaching stint in the country in mainland China after the massacre.
But news reports from the time show Walz was in Nebraska until that August, when he left for China.
Republicans have branded him ""Tiananmen Tim"".
Walz has also recently revised the amount of times he has been to China. In a 2016 interview he said he had visited the country ""about 30 times"".
But the Harris-Walz campaign told US media this week the number of trips Walz took to China is ""likely closer to 15"".
This is not the first time that the Harris-Walz campaign has acknowledged the running mate ""misspoke"".
Aides for the Democratic ticket issued a clarification in August as it emerged Walz had talked in 2018 about ""weapons of war that I carried in war"" as a member of the National Guard. But Walz never served in combat.
This summer he said he and his wife started their family thorough IVF - a fertility treatment that became politically charged this election cycle.
His wife later clarified they used a different treatment, intrauterine insemination.

BBC,Puerto Ricans in must-win state say Trump rally joke won’t be forgotten,"Puerto Ricans in must-win Pennsylvania say Trump rally joke won’t be forgotten
In the North Philadelphia neighbourhood of Fairhill, signs of Puerto Rico are never far off.
The US island territory's red, white and blue flag adorns homes and businesses, and the sounds of salsa and reggaetón boom from passing cars and restaurants selling fried plantains and spit-roasted pork.
The area is the beating heart of Philadelphia's more than 90,000-strong Puerto Rican population and forms a key part of Pennsylvania's Latino community, which both the Democrats and Republicans have sought to woo ahead of the 5 November election.
But on Monday morning, many locals were left seething at a joke made at Donald Trump's rally the night before in New York, in which comic Tony Hinchcliffe described Puerto Rico as an ""island of garbage"".
The joke, some said, could come back to haunt the Republicans in a key swing state that Democrats won by a narrow margin of 1.17% - about 82,000 votes - in 2020.
""The campaign just hurt itself, so much. It's crazy to me,"" said Ivonne Torres Miranda, a local resident who said she remains disillusioned by both candidates - Republican Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris - with just eight days to go in the campaign.
""Even if he [Mr Hinchcliffe ] was joking - you don't joke like that.
""We're Puerto Ricans. We have dignity, and we have pride,"" she told the BBC, speaking in rapid-fire Spanish with a strong Puerto Rican accent.
""You've got to think before saying things.""
- US election polls: Who is ahead - Harris or Trump?
- Listen: Americast on final week of election campaign
In the aftermath, the Trump campaign was quick to distance itself from Mr Hinchcliffe's joke, with a spokesman saying the remark ""does not reflect the views"" of Trump or his campaign.
The Harris campaign pounced on the joke, with the vice-president pointing to the comment as a sign that Trump is ""fanning the fuel of trying to divide"" Americans.
Her views were echoed by Puerto Rican celebrities Bad Bunny and Jennifer Lopez, who both endorsed Harris on Sunday.
A campaign official told CBS, the BBC's US partner, that the controversy was a political gift to the Democrats.
Some Puerto Rican residents agree with that assessment.
""[The joke] just put it in the bag for us. He literally just gave us the win,"" said Jessie Ramos, a Harris supporter. ""He has no idea how hard the Latino community is going to come out and support Kamala Harris.""
Residents of Puerto Rico - a US island territory in the Caribbean - are unable to vote in presidential elections, but the large diaspora in the US can.
Across Pennsylvania, about 600,000 eligible voters are Latino.
More than 470,000 of them are Puerto Ricans - one of the largest concentrations in the country and a potential deciding factor in a state where polls show Harris and Trump in an extremely tight race.
North Philadelphia in particular has been a target for Harris, who on Sunday made a campaign stop at Freddy & Tony's, a Puerto Rican restaurant and community hub in Fairhill.
The same day, Harris unveiled a new policy platform for Puerto Rico, promising economic development and improved disaster relief and accusing Trump of having ""abandoned and insulted"" the island during Hurricane Maria in 2017.
Whether or not this will sway Puerto Rican voters remains to be seen.
Freddy & Tony's owner, Dalma Santiago, told the BBC that she is not sure whether the joke will make a difference but that she believed that it was heard ""loud and clear"" in Fairhill and other Puerto Rican communities.
""Everybody has their own opinion,"" she told the BBC. ""But nobody will be forgetting that one.""
Similarly, Moses Santana, a 13-year US Army veteran who works at a harm reduction facility in Fairhill, said he is unsure of the joke's impact.
In an interview with the BBC on a Fairhill street corner, Mr Santana said the area is traditionally weary of politicians of all kinds, with many believing that both parties have failed to address socio-economic issues, crime and drug abuse there.
""Folks around here tend not to get what they ask for,"" he added. ""Even when they vote.""
On Tuesday, Trump will campaign in Allentown, a town of about 125,000 in Pennsylvania where about 33,000 people identify as Puerto Rican.
But even among Trump supporters in Pennsylvania's wider Latino community, the joke was poorly received.
That included Republican voter Jessenia Anderson, a Puerto Rican resident from the town of Johnstown about 240 miles (386 km) west of Philadelphia.
Ms Anderson, a military veteran who was born in New York's heavily Puerto Rican Lower East Side, is a frequent attendee of Trump rallies in Pennsylvania.
She described the joke as ""deeply offensive"" and said the routine felt ""wildly out of place"" - and implored her fellow Republicans to engage in ""thoughtful and respectful conversations"".
But Ms Anderson has no plan to switch her vote.
""My belief in the party's potential to make a positive impact remains strong,"" she said.
""I hope they will approach Latino voters with the respect they deserve.""

BBC,"Who is Trump’s vice president pick, JD Vance?","What we know about JD Vance, running to be Trump's second-in-command
“I’m a 'never Trump' guy. I never liked him.”
“My god what an idiot.”
“I find him reprehensible.”
That was from JD Vance in interviews and on Twitter in 2016, when the publication of his memoir Hillbilly Elegy catapulted him to fame.
In the same year, he wrote privately on Facebook to Josh McLaurin, his former law school roommate, now a state Senator in Georgia: ""I go back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical asshole... or that he's America's Hitler.""
'To go from those texts... to being Trump's biggest cheerleader, it's just kind of unbelievable,"" McLaurin, who is a member of the Democratic Party, told BBC Newshour.
In just a few years later, Vance has transformed himself from ""never Trump"" into one of the former president's most steadfast allies.
The 40-year-old first-term senator from Ohio is now by Trump’s side as vice-presidential running mate – and, by extension, an early frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2028 – with a reliably conservative voting record, relative youth and Midwestern roots that Republicans hope will boost support at the ballot box.
On the campaign trail he has established himself as an ""attack dog"" relentlessly criticising the opposition - a role traditionally filled by a running mate, albeit one that seems less crucial given Trump's own rhetoric.
Vance regularly ventures onto cable TV shows and takes questions from reporters at rallies, often drawing a contrast with the more cautious media strategy of the Harris campaign.
But his hardline views immigrants have attracted controversy.
Since being picked by Trump, he's doubled down on false rumours about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio. Remarks from past interviews and speeches have resurfaced, including Vance supporting a nationwide ban on abortion and calling the UK an ""Islamist country"".
He has been forced to defend a remark he made on Fox News three years ago about ""a bunch of childless cat ladies"", including Vice-President Harris.
Polls indicate that the controversies have helped make Vance one of the least-popular vice-presidential nominees of recent times. They've also distracted from his populist message on the economy, an issue that the Trump campaign sees as a strength.
McLaurin said that his former roommate previously felt like the Republican Party needed to give working people hope as well as economic opportunities. If unsuccessful in doing so, Vance believed a ""demagogue"" would fill that vacancy, he said.
According to McLaurin, Vance saw Trump as the demagogue - but clearly changed his mind.
A best-selling memoir
Vance was born James Donald Bowman in Middletown, Ohio, to a mother who struggled with addiction and a father who left the family when JD was a toddler.
He was raised by his grandparents, “Mamaw” and “Papaw”, whom he sympathetically portrayed in his 2016 memoir Hillbilly Elegy.
A revolving cast of father figures - he changed his surname several times - and his mother's substance abuse issues resulted in a chaotic childhood, and he regularly found refuge in Mamaw's house.
When he married, both JD and his wife Usha took the last name of Vance to honour his maternal grandparents' family name - leading to his current name: James David Vance.
Middletown is located in rust-belt Ohio, but Vance identified closely with his extended family’s roots to the south in Appalachia, the vast mountainous inland region that stretches from the Deep South to the fringes of the industrial Midwest and north-east. Largely but not exclusively white, it includes some of the country’s poorest areas.
In Hillbilly Elegy, Vance painted a personal portrait of the trials, travails and bad decisions of family members, neighbours and friends. While criticising outsiders for looking down on Appalachia's hillbillies, he took a decidedly conservative view, describing his people as chronic spendthrifts, dependent on government welfare payments and mostly failing to work hard and pull themselves up by their bootstraps.
He wrote that he saw Appalachians “reacting to bad circumstances in the worst way possible” and that they were products of “a culture that encourages social decay instead of counteracting it”.
“The truth is hard,” he wrote, “and the hardest truths for hill people are the ones they must tell about themselves.”
By the time the book came out, Vance’s own bootstrap-tugging had slung him far away from Middletown: first to the US Marines and a tour of duty in Iraq, and later to Ohio State University, Yale Law School and a job as a venture capitalist in California.
Hillbilly Elegy not only made him into a bestselling author, but a sought-after commentator who was frequently called upon to explain Donald Trump’s appeal to white, working-class voters.
He rarely missed an opportunity to criticise the then-Republican nominee.
“I think this election is really having a negative effect especially on the white working class,"" he told an interviewer in October 2016.
""What it’s doing is giving people an excuse to point the finger at someone else, point the finger at Mexican immigrants, or Chinese trade or the Democratic elites or whatever else.”
But ironically, those are some of the finger-pointing themes that he has regularly raised as part of the Trump campaign.
From venture capital to politics
In 2017 Vance returned to Ohio and continued to work in venture capital. He and his wife Usha, whom he met at Yale, have three children - Ewan, Vivek and Mirabel.
As the child of Indian immigrants who grew up in San Diego, Usha Vance has a different background to her husband. The daughter of academics, she also attended Yale as an undergraduate and received a master's degree from University of Cambridge.
She served as a clerk to Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and most recently worked for Munger, Tolles & Olson, a firm that a leading legal journal described as ""progressive"" and ""woke"". Mrs Vance resigned shortly after her husband was selected by Trump.
Meanwhile, Vance had long been whispered about as a political candidate, and he saw an opportunity when Ohio’s Republican Senator Rob Portman decided not to run for re-election in 2022.
North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of the race for the White House in his weekly US Election Unspun newsletter. Readers in the UK can sign up here. Those outside the UK can sign up here.
Although his campaign was initially slow to get going, he got a kick-start via a $10m (£7.7m) donation from his former boss, Silicon Valley powerbroker Peter Thiel.
His rhetoric shifted, and he spent less time talking about the failures of hillbillies and more about elites and Democrats. He began appearing on Fox News but also on fringier political outlets. Many of the controversial clips resurfacing now date from around the time his Senate campaign was starting to gain traction.
But the real hurdle stopping him from getting elected in increasingly Republican Ohio was his past criticism of Trump.
Vance remained a Trump sceptic as late as 2020, according to text messages obtained by the Washington Post. He wrote four years ago that the president had ""so thoroughly failed to deliver on his economic populism (excepting a disjointed China policy)"" and predicted that Trump would lose the presidency.
But during the Senate campaign, Vance apologised for his previous public remarks and earned Trump’s endorsement, pushing him to the top of the Republican field and eventually into the Senate.
In the process, Vance became an important player in the world of Make America Great Again politics – and signed up almost completely to Trump’s agenda.
Where does he stand on the issues?
In the Senate he has been a reliable conservative vote, backing populist economic policies and emerging as one of the biggest congressional sceptics of aid to Ukraine.
Given his short tenure in the Democratic-led chamber, the bills he has sponsored have rarely moved forward, and have more often been about sending messages than changing policy.
In recent months, Vance introduced bills to withhold federal funds for colleges where there are encampments or protests against Israel's war in Gaza, and to colleges that employ undocumented immigrants.
Vance also sponsored legislation in March that would cut the Chinese government off from US capital markets if it did not follow international trade law.
He hit all of these themes at a speech in July at the National Conservatism Conference, saying: ""The real threat to American democracy is that American voters keep on voting for less immigration and our politicians keep on rewarding us with more.""
He said the idea of the American Dream – ""This very basic idea that you should be able to build a good life for yourself and your family in the country you call home"" - was ""under siege by the left"".
And he said that American involvement in Ukraine had ""no obvious conclusion or even objective that we’re close to getting accomplished"".
At the same conference, he said the UK was ""not doing so good"" because of immigration and claimed that under a Labour government, the country would become the “first truly Islamist country” with a nuclear bomb.
He received a rapturous welcome when he entered the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in July, shortly after his selection was announced.
But since then, the headlines have more often focused on his controversies than his folksy appeal.
What did he say on the campaign trail?
His comments about Haitian immigrants eating pets, based on unsubstantiated internet rumours, were repeated by Trump during the presidential debate earlier this month and caused huge upheaval in Springfield, a city not far from Vance's hometown in Ohio.
During a CNN interview Vance said he felt the need to ""create stories so that the... media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people”.
But he also insisted that constituents have told him stories of pet-eating by immigrants, even though his Senate office has not responded to requests for further details.
He has moderated his views on the issue of abortion.
Vance, who was baptised as a Catholic in 2019, has expressed support in the past for a nationwide abortion ban after 15 weeks of pregnancy.
But he recently backed Trump's view that the matter was for states to decide.
Yet when he went further and said that Trump would veto a nationwide abortion ban if Congress were to pass one, he earned a rebuke from his boss.
“I didn’t discuss it with JD, in all fairness,” Trump said during the presidential debate. “And I don’t mind if he has a certain view, but I don't think he was speaking for me.”

BBC,Wisconsin swing state profile,"A quick guide to swing state Wisconsin
Wisconsin, famous for cheese, Harley Davidson motorcycles and the Green Bay Packers American football team is one of seven states that will decide the 2024 US presidential election.
Voting in swing states is hard to predict and can lean Republican or Democrat - that’s why you’re hearing so much about them as campaigning draws to a close.
Here’s all you need to know.
Population
5.9 million (same as Denmark)
Electoral college votes
10 of 538
In a nutshell
It’s one of the Big Three in the Midwest, along with Michigan and Pennsylvania, which gave Joe Biden victory in 2020.
2020 margin
Biden by 21,000 votes.
What's the deal now?
Wisconsin’s mix of cities, small towns and large rural areas has made it one of the most-contested states in 2024.
Republicans held their national convention in Milwaukee, which saw a triumphant Trump receive a hero’s welcome after surviving being shot at just days before. Kamala Harris held her first rally there in July. Both have returned to the state several times since.
What are voters saying?
The Harris campaign is hoping to draw in voters like Sarah Weber, a 24-year-old engineer based in Madison.
“Women’s rights is at the top of my list,” she says.
When Harris appears in the state she tends to accuse Trump of being a threat to democracy and focus on his false election claims. But at Trump rallies, immigration is the big issue and supporters talk about how their candidate - and by extension, his backers - have been treated unfairly. Fans seem unfazed by Trump’s legal difficulties, with some suggesting criminal prosecutions will backfire.
“It’s definitely going to increase his popularity,” says Nancy Ridge who attended a rally in Milwaukee wearing a jacket with Trump’s mugshot on the back.
“Especially among lower-class people who have been convicted of crimes or even falsely accused. They understand the justice system and how corrupt it can be.”
What's the expert view
Maximising turnout in Dane county - which includes the capital Madison, and Milwaukee County - could be key to a Harris victory, says Michael Wagner, director of the Center for Communication and Civic Renewal at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. Harris also needs to ensure she doesn’t lose votes in rural parts of the state, he adds.
He says Trump needs to do better in the suburban counties where support for Republicans has been waning. The key places to look at are the counties around Milwaukee known as the “Wow” counties - Waukesha, Ozaukee, and Washington, he explains.
What to watch out for on election night
- Senator Tammy Baldwin must hold on to her seat for Democrats to keep the Senate
- Will Trump get bigger numbers in the “WOW” counties of Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington in suburban Milwaukee than Harris will get in Milwaukee and Dane counties?
- First vote results will largely be ballots cast early - the large populations in Democratic strongholds may take longer to count

Here’s all you need to know.
Population

Electoral college votes
16 of 538
In a nutshell
Donald Trump almost certainly needs to win here to take the White House.
Kamala Harris does not necessarily need to win here to become the next US president, but if she fails in other swing states, Georgia will become key to her path to the presidency.
2020 margin
Biden by 13,000 votes.
What's the deal now?
All eyes have been on Georgia ever since Democrats unexpectedly triumphed there in 2020.
The big question this year is - will that trend continue and will Georgia truly crown itself a swing state? Or will Donald Trump reinstate the status quo and win it back?
What do voters say?
Polling is excruciatingly close in Georgia. An Emerson College poll from early October found that Harris and Trump are effectively tied there; 48.3% of likely voters back Harris and 49.2 % preferred Trump.
The economy is a major issue for voters in Georgia, as is the case with other states.
Mitchell Nemeth, 30, will likely vote for Donald Trump because he is concerned about the economy and crime.
Trump was not his first choice and he wishes he had a younger Republican nominee to vote for, whose rhetoric was less incendiary.
""Sometimes he says things that are hyperbolic,"" he explains. ""But when it comes to policy there's plenty I can agree on.""
Charmika Playcide, 37, says she voted early for Kamala Harris because “she’s the most qualified person for the job.”
""I think she's more focused on our generation more so than Trump.""
What's the expert view?
For Trump to win Georgia, he needs to keep the state's sizeable Republican base together. Voters who are already conservative will likely support him again, but Trump must also keep the Republicans who were sceptical of him during the 2024 Republican primary onside. Trump is also trying to chip away at Democrats' support among black voters, the party's most critical voting block in Georgia.
For Harris to win, she must appeal to black voters in large numbers, especially around Atlanta and Savannah, and maintain her base of support with younger voters and minority communities. She also needs high turnout to overcome Trump's advantage in rural areas.

BBC,Why the next Tory leader needs to go Cornish,"Why the next Tory leader needs to go Cornish
Next Saturday we will finally find out who the Conservatives have chosen as their next party leader - and the leader of the UK government's official opposition.
The two contenders, Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick, are both seen as being on the right of the party, and their core messages, on immigration and cultural issues, seem designed to win back support from Nigel Farage's Reform UK.
But the new leader will also need to do something about the votes the Tories lost to the Liberal Democrats and Labour in July's general election, if they are going to restore their party's battered fortunes.
Few parts of the country illustrate the challenge the new leader will face better than Cornwall.
The county used to be a sea of Conservative blue. Until recently, the party held all six Parliamentary seats.
But the tide turned in July's election, and they were all washed away.
The Tories lost four seats to Labour and two to the Lib Dems, while Reform UK took votes across the board.
In the market town of Liskeard, which sits in a constituency the Tories lost to Labour, Richard Dorling chairs the South East Cornwall Conservative Association and spent time during the election knocking on doors and hearing voters’ concerns.
“They’re looking for people to take charge and reduce immigration and stop the boats, and Reform have a very strong story for that,” he said.
“Whoever gets into the leadership position is going to have to come up with a new plan to tackle that, and get the voters back.”
While some Tories argue addressing the concerns of voters attracted to Nigel Farage’s party is crucial, others have warned against tacking to the right to counter the threat posed by Reform UK, for fear it will permanently alienate more centrist former Conservative supporters who turned to Labour or the Lib Dems.
When Kemi Badenoch and Robert Jenrick became the final two candidates, it was widely seen as a signal the party would shift to the political right.
Connor Donnithorne, who stood for the Conservatives in Camborne & Redruth but lost to Labour, said focusing on the party’s position on the political spectrum was the wrong approach.
“You need to be in the common ground of British politics if you want to win,” he said. ""That doesn’t mean you have to be in the centre, or the left or right.
“If we go down that path over the next five years, we’re not going to win again because you’re too focused on the internal politics of parties that the overwhelming majority of people in this country don’t actually care about.""
He argues that the party needs to focus on ""common ground"" issues such as ""controlled immigration, lower taxes for working people, and supporting small businesses to create jobs"".
""It’s about having credibility, it’s about being in touch with what people want and it’s about delivering what you say you’re going to deliver,” he adds.
It’s not just their fractured voting base the new Conservative leader will have to win round.
Kemi Badenoch or Robert Jenrick will have to unite a parliamentary party that’s been publicly arguing over its differences for years - and has been pretty adept at ousting leaders.
In reaching the final two, neither candidate won support from a majority of MPs, so whoever wins will do so knowing only around a third of the parliamentary party backed them.
Nick Craker, a Conservative councillor in Cornwall, said the leadership candidates need to focus on policies that unite the Conservatives rather than those that have the potential to divide them, including Robert Jenrick’s plan to leave the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and “culture wars” confronted by Kemi Badenoch.
“The idea of leaving the ECHR, for example, makes me very nervous,” said Mr Craker.
“I just see that as a really divisive issue that’s going to cause infighting. I just think if you bring something like that forward, there’s going to be at least 50 MPs who are going to be very concerned about it.
“Similarly with some of Kemi’s ideas around gender and race and the culture wars, that makes me a bit nervous, because again she may have some really sound arguments to make on that, but there another 50 MPs at least that have probably got very different views to her and that’s going to just sow a bit more division and infighting.
""And what have we learnt from the last election? Divided parties don’t win.”
Badenoch and Jenrick are currently pitching to the party membership who are casting their ballots in this contest, but it will not be long before one of them will have to start pitching to the country.
In Cornwall, one message reflected by activists is the need for the party leadership to talk to grassroots members of the party who, they say, understand the issues in their communities.
Alison Hernandez, the Conservative Police and Crime Commissioner for Devon and Cornwall, said: “I think they’ve lost their way with being able to connect with members and activists in the party, and I think that needs to change – that connection.”
Of course, whoever leads the Conservative Party after 2 November will do so as a party of opposition – something neither Robert Jenrick or Kemi Badenoch have experienced as MPs.
That makes fighting for relevance harder when airtime and attention doesn’t come as easily.
Ms Hernandez added: “It feels like we’re invisible at the moment on the national stage, and it’s really important we’ve got someone who can embody the values of Conservatism and communicate that to the wider public.”
The Conservative Party is wrestling right now with what those values are, but the bigger question will ultimately be what the public makes of them.",2024-10-25
BBC,Katty Kay: What’s really behind America’s men v women election,"What’s really behind America’s men v women election
Donald Trump enjoys a huge lead among men, while women tell pollsters they prefer Kamala Harris by a similarly large margin. The political gender gap reflects a decade of social upheaval and could help decide the US election.
For the first woman of colour to secure a presidential nomination, and only the second woman to ever get this close, Kamala Harris goes to great lengths not to talk about her identity.
“Listen, I am running because I believe that I am the best person to do this job at this moment for all Americans, regardless of race and gender,” the vice-president said in a CNN interview last month.
And yet, despite all her efforts to neutralise the subject, gender is shaping up to be the defining issue of this campaign.
“Madame President” would be a new thing for America and it’s reasonable to assume that while many voters love the idea, some find the novelty a little unnerving.
The Harris campaign won’t say it publicly, but one official acknowledged to me recently that they do believe there is “hidden sexism” here that will deter some people from voting for any woman for president.
It’s 2024 and few people want to be the jerk who’ll tell a pollster outright that they don’t think a woman is fit for the Oval Office (though plenty are prepared to share misogynistic memes on social media). A Democratic strategist suggested there’s a code, when voters tell pollsters that Harris is not “ready” or doesn't have the right “personality” or “what it takes,” what they really mean is that the problem is she’s a woman.
The Trump campaign says gender has nothing to do with it. “Kamala is weak, dishonest, and dangerously liberal, and that’s why the American people will reject her on November 5th,” it said this week. Although Bryan Lanza, a senior adviser to the campaign, texted me to say he’s confident Trump will win because “the male gender gap gives us the edge”.
Last time a woman ran for president, negative attitudes to her gender were clearly a factor. Eight years ago Hillary Clinton touted her being the first female nominee of a major party. The campaign’s slogan “I’m with Her” was a not very subtle reminder of her trailblazing role.
Pennsylvania Congresswoman Madeleine Dean remembers discussing Clinton’s candidacy with voters. I spent an afternoon with Dean as she campaigned in her district this week and she told me that back in 2016 people would tell her, ‘There’s just something about her.’
She says she soon realised that “It was about the ‘her.’ That was a thing. It was that [Hillary] was a woman.”
While Dean thinks that sentiment is less prevalent today, she acknowledges that even now, “there are certain people who just think ‘A powerful woman? No, a bridge too far.’”
A lot has changed for women since 2016. The #MeToo movement in 2017 increased awareness of the subtle - and the not so subtle - discriminations women face at work. It changed the way we talk about women as professionals. MeToo may have made it easier for a candidate like Harris to secure the nomination.
But those big steps forward on the issues of diversity, equity, and inclusion were interpreted by some as a step back, especially for young men who felt they’d been left behind. Or the changes were simply a step too far for conservative Americans who prefer more traditional gender roles.
A gender gap has opened in the race, CBS News poll results released Sunday indicate, reflecting broader attitudes in the US about societal roles.
CBS, the BBC's US news partner, reported that men are more likely to say efforts to promote gender equality in the US have gone too far; they are more likely to be Trump supporters.
Women are more likely to say those efforts haven't been enough - and they tend to support Harris.
Men also are less likely than women to think Harris will be a strong leader, CBS reported, and a majority of men say they think Trump will be a strong leader.
So for some voters, this November’s election has turned into a referendum on gender norms, and the social upheavals of recent years. This seems particularly true for the voters Kamala Harris has a tough time reaching: the young men who live in a world that is rapidly changing for, well, young men.
“Young men often feel like if they ask questions they are labeled as misogynist, homophobic or racist,” says John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard Institute of Politics.
“Frustrated at not feeling understood, many then get sucked into a bro-culture of Donald Trump or Elon Musk. They look at who the Democrats prioritise - women, abortion rights, LGTBQ culture - and they ask ‘what about us?’”
Della Volpe specialises in polling younger voters. He says the young men he is referring to are not part of some radical alt right, incel cabal. They are your sons, or they’re your neighbour’s sons. Indeed, he says, many support equality for women, but they also feel their own concerns go unheard.
Della Volpe ticks through a list of statistics showing ways young men today are worse off than their female counterparts: they are less likely to be in relationships, they are less likely to enrol in college than they used to, they have higher rates of suicide than their female peers.
Young American women meanwhile are steaming ahead. They are better educated than men, they work in service industries that are growing and increasingly they are earning more than men. In the period since Donald Trump was elected president, young women have also become significantly more liberal than young men, according to the Gallup polling group.
Which is all creating a stark gender split. Over the last seven years, the share of young men who say the US has gone “too far” promoting gender equality has more than doubled, according to the American Enterprise Institute.
With his almost intuitive grasp of people’s dissatisfactions, Trump has tapped into that male frustration, and in the final weeks of his campaign he has doubled down on masculinity. He reposted a warning on Truth Social claiming “Manhood is Under Attack.” Recently he joked about a famous golfer’s genitalia.
“This is a guy that was all man,” said Trump, referring to golfer Arnold Palmer. “When he took showers with the other pros, they came out of there – they said, ‘Oh my God. That’s unbelievable.’”
Trump took the locker room talk out of the locker room - and his audience loved it. Riffing about penis size at a political rally, it was the ultimate pushback against stifling political correctness.
In their rallies, and on the airwaves, the Democrats’ response to disaffected men seems to be a dose of tough love. Barack Obama scolded that some men “aren’t feeling the idea of having a woman as president and you’re coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.” In a new TV ad, Actor Ed O’Neill was a little snappier but more direct: “Be a man: Vote for a woman.”
In the final days of this campaign, gender is everywhere - and nowhere.
Donald Trump wants manhood front and centre of this race. Kamala Harris barely acknowledges she is a woman running for office. In a New York Times poll, Trump leads with male voters by 14%. Harris leads women by 12%.
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls - they may well decide this election.",2024-10-27
BBC,Undecided voters unconvinced by Kamala Harris interview on CNN,"‘I want to see her challenged’ - swing voters unconvinced by Harris interview
Kamala Harris’s first interview since becoming the Democratic presidential candidate was an opportunity to introduce herself - and her campaign’s message - to Americans who say they do not yet know her or for what she stands.
The vice-president defended her record in the White House and addressed questions about a series of policy shifts since she first ran for the top job in 2019 during the CNN interview on Thursday.
Ms Harris and her running mate - Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who joined her for the interview - have enjoyed a surge of enthusiasm from Democrats in recent weeks, but the campaign knows they must win over undecided voters to win November’s election.
Young men are a significant proportion of those persuadable voters, and a group that Republican Donald Trump has been aggressively targeting with a slew of recent media appearances on podcasts that boast audiences that are largely young and male.
Given the battle for their vote, what did three of them make of Ms Harris’s first sit-down interview?
This software engineer backed Democrats in the last two elections but remains undecided in 2024.
Harris can speak coherently, which I think is just an upgrade from the prior two candidates, both Trump and Biden. I think she's relatively eloquent in the way that she talks. But in terms of policy, this was the first time I think I’ve actually heard some elements of substantive policy from her.
The interview didn't do a whole lot to assuage my concerns - what she’d actually want to do and whether she'd be able to effectively implement it. You’ve been VP for a few years, why haven't you attempted these things before?
The interview didn’t change my mind on how to vote. To be honest, I want to see her challenged in a press conference or obviously the debate that's coming up. I think I need to see her in that kind of a setting, without a teleprompter or rehearsed answers. I think the interview was a little too coddled. I want to see her put under some pressure. I don't think she's done too well in the past as the VP in those situations.
Walz came across as very personable. I think he helps kind of instill a sense of this good old American, kind of down-to-earth feeling that I think was missing from her in particular. I do like his addition to the ticket.
A teacher who voted for the Green Party in 2020, Jeremy felt Harris’s message lacked conviction.
I feel they've been very vague. I understand why, to a degree, from their perspective that it's more ‘Let's make this about Donald Trump,’ rather than about policy. But that only gets you so far.
I was frustrated with her for saying the phrase ‘My values have not changed, but my policies have.’ If you were consistent on your values, if you want clean energy, then you would still be in favour of the ban on fracking.
When they talked about the Israel and Gaza she said we're going to maintain the Biden administration policy. It's a policy that, at least to me, has failed both Jews and Palestinians. People on both sides seem to be no closer to a deal and people on both sides continue to suffer. So saying we're going to maintain a policy that has gotten nowhere in almost a year feels almost like she's rather just trying to not lose voters rather than say I'm going to work towards a solution.
I didn’t hear enough to persuade me yet. Because it feels like, on one hand, she's saying, we'll be different to Biden, but on the other hand, it's also like it's just going to be the same with a new face.
A student who did not vote last time, he feels lost since his favourite candidate, Robert Kennedy Jr, endorsed Trump.
I wasn't particularly impressed, to be honest. I don't think the interview revealed much. I also understand that’s sort of politics, and that's going to be true of any given campaign, that the more specific they get, the easier it is to campaign against them.
I appreciated when Harris specifically was talking about her planned measures for economic reform and this opportunity economy she was talking about. But I don’t think it was particularly compelling or the questions were particularly challenging.
I'm not sure if anything in it would convince me to vote for the Harris-Walz campaign. One of the big reasons people were excited for Harris taking over the ticket - after Biden was so bad in live, unscripted environments - was that she was young and she might infuse more energy into the Democratic campaign. But because of the lack of live interviews and answering questions so far I still have concerns about their competency.

BBC,Investigating Trump campaign's biggest illegal voter claim,"Investigating Trump campaign’s biggest illegal voter claim
The message was addressed to “REAL AMERICAN PATRIOTS” to ensure a victory “TOO BIG TO RIG!”
Sent out to a mailing list by the Republican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump, it combined two of the biggest themes of Donald Trump’s campaign: immigration and alleged election fraud.
“Experts are saying that as many as 2.7 million illegals could vote in November,” read the email from Ms Trump - the former president’s daughter-in-law.
But the number cited is derived from a decade-old survey that has been heavily disputed.
And while there is some clear evidence that some immigrants are registered to vote, it’s equally clear that the 2.7 million figure is a major exaggeration.
The origin story
The roots of the statistic are found in an article, “Do non-citizens vote in U.S. elections?”, published in the journal Electoral Studies in 2014.
Written by three academics led by Jesse Richman, an associate professor at Old Dominion University in Virginia, the paper says the ""number of non-citizen voters… could range from just over 38,000 at the very minimum to nearly 2.8 million at the maximum”.
Mr Richman and his colleagues did not comb through voter rolls or personally survey immigrants to come to that conclusion, but instead relied on a data set from a long-running Harvard-backed survey called the Cooperative Election Study (CES).
The CES is conducted every year, and Mr Richman examined a number of respondents who self-identified as non-citizens and indicated that they had voted in the 2008 and 2010 elections.
But the people behind CES have repeatedly rejected the conclusions of Mr Richman's paper, which attracted controversy and attention before and after the 2016 presidential election.
Brian Schaffner, a Tufts University professor who is one of the CES co-principal investigators, told the BBC that it’s not possible to draw statistical conclusions from a relatively small number of survey participants.
The CES is intended to be a survey of legal voters, and few respondents say they are non-citizens. For example, in 2008, 339 out of the nearly 34,000 survey participants said they were not US citizens. The proportion was similar in 2010.
That does not constitute a representative sample of the population, Schaffner said, and it's a commonly known issue in large surveys - a small proportion of people click wrong or untrue answers.
The 1% claim
In recent years, the CES has included more detailed questions about citizenship and registration with the aim of increasing accuracy.
Mr Richman, the author of the Electoral Studies article, drew on that more recent CES data to conclude in 2023 that 1% of non-citizens were registered to vote. That would be approximately 117,000 people based on official estimates of how many undocumented immigrants are in the US.
In an interview with the BBC, he said he stood by his findings - but noted that a substantial uncertainty about non-citizen voting registration and voting remained.
""Predictably, according to what tends to happen in American politics, each side focuses on the edge of that uncertainty that is most convenient,"" Mr Richman said.
""Democrats would like there to be absolutely none. Republicans would like it to be a monster that is about to eat democracy. Both of those interpretations are not likely.""
But Mr Schaffner, the CES official, is equally adamant about his argument, that the study he administers is simply not suitable for extrapolation to the population at large to create an estimate of non-citizen voting.
The 2.7 million number
The non-citizen voter claims were given new life in May 2024, when a conservative fact-checking organisation, Just Facts, which describes itself as non-partisan, published an article headlined: “Study: 10% to 27% of Non-Citizens Are Illegally Registered to Vote”.
The post asserted that “roughly 1.0 million to 2.7 million [immigrants] will illegally vote” in November’s election.
The claim went viral in right-wing spaces online, and were spread by news sites and conservative influencers. Elon Musk, who has repeatedly posted misleading messages about immigrants and voting to millions of his followers, shared this post as well.
Lara Trump mentioned the figure in two emails sent out to supporters in early October.
When contacted by the BBC, Just Facts founder James Agresti said he stood by his conclusions, although he characterised the Trump campaign claim as a “half truth, because the study has sizable margins of uncertainty” - and that the email from Lara Trump had used the highest possible number.
Mr Agresti said his calculations - which are based on CES data but with a modified methodology to Mr Richman's and additional studies and data sets - had found the minimum number of non-citizens registered to vote was around 10 times higher at roughly a million.
Lack of real-world evidence
Beyond the dispute over methodology, there is another problem with the argument that large numbers of immigrants are voting illegally: there are very few confirmed cases of it.
The right-wing Heritage Foundation think tank compiled a database that includes decades of voting fraud cases. But only about 100 include a reference to non-citizens voting.
Criminal prosecution of illegal voters - not just non-citizens, but felons and other ineligible voters - is also extremely rare.
Despite nearly a decade of attention on illegal voting driven by Trump and Republicans, those numbers have not dramatically risen. Investigations into voter rolls show very few non-citizens registered to vote and even fewer voting.
Conservatives, and some scholars such as Mr Richman, allege that there are so few prosecutions because illegal voting is considered to be a minor crime by many. They say that authorities have spent few resources investigating it in the past.
Still, recent searches of active voter rolls - largely inspired by Trump and Republican Party officials - have turned up a relatively small number of illegal voters.
Mr Richman conducted a survey of Arizona's four million voter records and found between 1,934 and 6,480 non-citizens registered to vote.
Earlier this year, the office of Ohio’s Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose - a Trump supporter - examined around eight million registrations and found around 600 people on the state’s voter rolls who could not prove their US citizenship.
Meanwhile, the state also struck an additional 155,000 registrations from the rolls, largely because of address changes.
Other states, including New Jersey and Virginia, have also removed hundreds of voters from their rolls in recent years - but the totals have not come close to the 10-to-27% figure cited in the Just Facts blog post.
Databases of criminal cases and official investigations of voter rolls have failed to find evidence of large proportions of immigrant non-citizens who are registered to vote.
The proportion of those who actually vote are, by definition, smaller still. Generally about half to two-thirds of registered American voters turn out to vote in presidential elections.
And the subset of those immigrants who do not have legal permission to be in the US - the ""illegals"" in Lara Trump's email - is by definition even smaller.
While it's clear that there are some non-citizens who are registered to vote, there's a lack of real-world evidence that those numbers are very large when compared to the overall voting population.

BBC,Shawn Mendes says he's 'just figuring out' sexuality,"Shawn Mendes says he's 'just figuring out' sexuality
Singer Shawn Mendes opened up about his sexuality during a performance in Colorado on Monday, saying he's ""just figuring it out like everyone"".
""I don't really know sometimes and I know other times. It feels really scary because we live in a society that has a lot to say about that,"" he told concert-goers.
According to fan footage of the concert posted on social media, Mendes made the comments before performing an unreleased song which seems to be inspired by how speculation about his sexuality made him feel.
The Canadian singer has previously criticised such speculation, calling out its intrusiveness.
Speaking during the performance Morrison’s Red Rocks Amphitheatre, Mendes said he had ""thought about this for a minute today if I was gonna say something tonight”.
Cheered on by the crowd, he continued: “The truth is that I didn’t get to do a lot of 15-year-old things and discover parts of myself that you do at 15.""
He continued: “There’s this thing about my sexuality, and people have been talking about it so long”, adding that it's “kind of silly, because I think sexuality is such a beautifully complex thing, and it’s so hard to just put into boxes.”
“It always felt like such an intrusion on something very personal to me. Something that I was figuring out in myself, something that I had yet to discover and still have yet to discover it.""
""The real truth about my life and my sexuality is that, man, I'm just figuring it out like everyone.""
He went onto speak about his unreleased song The Mountain, which includes the lyrics: ""You can say I'm too young, you can say I'm too old, you can say I like girls or boys, whatever fits your mold"".
Mendes told the crowd it was important to write that new song because ""it felt like a moment where I could address it in a way that felt close to my heart"".
""And I guess I'm just speaking freely now, because I just want to be able to be closer to everyone and just kind of be in my truth,"" he added.
In a 2018 interview with Rolling Stone, Mendes spoke about ""this massive, massive thing for the last five years about me being gay"".
The next year, he told the Guardian speculation had been ""hurtful… I get mad when people assume things about me because I imagine the people who don’t have the support system I have and how that must affect them"".
Mendes has had a number of chart-topping hits in the UK, US and Canada, including the single Señorita, which he released with Camilla Cabello - whom he also previously dated.",2024-10-29
BBC,"In Las Vegas, a fight rages for working class Nevada voters","'It's rough out here': Why Trump and Harris should listen to this mum of seven
When the sun sets over Las Vegas, Nicole Williams gets to work, serving drinks from behind the bar of an opulent hotel on the city's infamous strip.
But life for Ms Williams, 45, and other service-industry workers who form the quiet backbone of Vegas's booming economy, is far from luxurious.
""When you're shopping for a big family like mine, it's rough out here,"" she told the BBC while shopping for groceries and taking children to appointments across town.
The mother of seven children, aged 10 months to 16, said she often fears buckling under the weight of the economy.
From sky-high prices on groceries to petrol, Ms Williams said she has had to cut back on vacations as well as on football and gymnastics lessons for her kids that would force her to stretch an already strained household budget.
""We haven't been able to do the things we want to do,"" she said. ""I want a future for my kids.""
She is not alone. In dozens of interviews with Las Vegans who work in vital local industries from construction and casinos to restaurants and bars, low-wage workers from across the political spectrum told the BBC that kitchen-table issues - especially unaffordable housing and costly childcare - are what will determine how they vote on 5 November.
It's these voters that Donald Trump and Vice-President Kamala Harris hope to win over in Nevada, a hotly contested battleground state in which the two remain neck-and-neck in the polls.
To court low-wage workers, Harris and Trump have laid out starkly different economic visions, including competing anti-poverty policies that could help shape the financial security of millions of families.
But victory in unpredictable Nevada - one of the key states which will determine who becomes the next president - will be won by just a tiny fraction of undecided voters there, political insiders say.
Data shows that about a third of the state's voters consider themselves independent, with an August New York Times/Siena poll of likely voters showing that a slight majority of independents lean Republican (43%) compared to those who lean Democrat (39%).
""Nevada is not a blue state,"" said Ted Pappageorge, the Secretary-Treasurer of Culinary Union Local 226, referring to the traditional colour of the Democratic Party (the Republicans are red).
The politically powerful group has endorsed Harris.
""We're barely purple. If the election happened right now, Trump wins, we think,"" he added.
'Everything was cheaper'
Despite booming business, Nevada's unemployment rate was the highest in the nation at 5.6% in September. In Las Vegas, home to three quarters of the population, the figure stood even higher at 5.9%.
The state was also hit particularly hard by the pandemic, when unemployment rose to around 30% - which State Democratic Chair Danielle Monroe-Moreno described as a sign that ""when the country gets a cold, Nevada gets the flu"".
As the US economy has rebounded, however, Trump and Harris have pursued contrasting economic policies to alleviate some of the burdens on low-income workers. Harris vowed to expand many of the Covid-era policies President Joe Biden pursued when he took office in 2021, including healthcare and housing subsidies and reviving the enhanced $6,000 child care tax credit.
Trump has pushed the idea of renewing his 2017 tax cuts - which are set to expire next year - while imposing sweeping tariffs on foreign imports which he says will reduce poverty and boost economic growth.
""Five dollars isn't $5 anymore, and $100 barely gets you any groceries,"" said Fermin Gonzalez, an unemployed, Mexico-born former restaurant worker living in Las Vegas.
At 60 he fears he will have difficulty finding work again. ""We used to be able to make money here. People are dissatisfied.""
To try to persuade voters who feel the same, both parties are relying on door-to-door campaigning efforts by allied get-out-the-vote groups.
The Culinary Union - the state's largest union which represents a variety of occupations in hotels and the food service industry - has dozens of teams knocking on doors to drum up support for Harris and other Democratic candidates.
On a September afternoon, two members walked for hours in 40C (104F) heat in a modest North Las Vegas neighbourhood near the edge of town, where the city gives way to desert and craggy hills.
""Things are very hard. We feel it a lot,"" said Olga Mexia, a Mexican immigrant and mother of five who works as a housekeeper at the Signature hotel on the strip.
""We're paid so much less for everything. [Four years ago,] rent was less, groceries were less.""
""I had to have two jobs at one point to make it work. I'm campaigning for my family. Harris at least has a real plan,"" Ms Mexia added, taking shelter from the sun under a tree while her teammate knocked on a door. ""That's the sort of thing people want to talk about.""
The battle over 'tax on tips'
One economic proposal where both candidates overlap is ending taxes on tips - a concept that has found a receptive audience among Nevada's service workers, more than half of whom are Latino.
More broadly, Latinos represent about 30% of the state's population, along with 19% of its business owners. Given how close the election is likely to be in the state - and nationally - both parties increasingly see the mobilisation of Latino voters as key to their victory.
Ms Williams, the bartender - who says she's ""100% voting Trump"" - makes $20 per hour but said tips make up her main income, bringing in as much as $250 on a good night. But even as she uses coupons, bargain hunts and budgets a weekly menu plan, it's not enough.
Trump was the first to propose the idea at a Las Vegas rally in June. In August, he again highlighted the plan during a stop at a Mexican-Italian fusion restaurant located on the city's west side.
The restaurant is owned by Javier Barajas, a Mexican immigrant who first crossed into the US illegally in 1978 and found himself in Las Vegas, almost by chance, after being separated from his travel companions.
Once a dishwasher, Mr Barajas is now a fixture of the community and owns a string of popular Mexican restaurants that employ an overwhelmingly Latino workforce of more than 500.
""My waiters make $12 - the minimum wage. I'm not saying that like it's a lot. It's hard. Every time they go to the gas station they end up spending $100,"" he told the BBC, switching back and forth between English and Spanish in a corner of his restaurant.
Mr Barajas, an outspoken Trump supporter, says he believes an end to tax on tips would vastly help his workers with day-to-day expenses, while at the same time having minimal impact on him as an owner.
""That idea is interesting to people like them,"" he said of his workers. ""I completely understand why.""
Harris endorsed the no-tax-on-tips policy at her own Las Vegas rally in August, although in her case it's paired with raising the federal minimum wage to $15.
Experts have cautioned that cutting taxes on tips may have minimal benefit on the US economy as a whole, and the Tax Foundation has estimated that any change could cost at least $107bn. Any change would also have to be passed by Congress.
'I'm drowning'
For many working-class Las Vegans, inflation and rent pressure are compounded by childcare concerns.
Childcare in Nevada is more expensive than anywhere else in the US, with the average family spending nearly $26,000 on it a year - more than a third of their annual average income, according to a July report from the state's Office of Workforce Innovation.
Harris has campaigned on a promise that child care costs would be capped at 7% of family income, along with a $6,000 child tax credit. Trump has so far offered no specific plans, although his running-mate Senator JD Vance has proposed raising the child tax credit to $5,000 from its current $2,000. Vance skipped a vote in August on a failed Senate bill that would have expanded the child tax credit for low-income families.
Among those feeling the pinch is Dominic Richmond, a 50-year-old single grandmother who cares for four young children with special needs - aged one, four, six and nine - as well as a mother with dementia who lives nearby.
Ms Richmond lives in a small two-bedroom apartment that costs her $1,600 per month. While she works part-time as a realtor - a job she said ""leaves no money"" - and 16-hours-a-week at an airline, she said that the combined costs of taking care of the children, rent and high prices have left her in dire straits.
""When you put it all together, it's like a hurricane coming at you,"" she said, wiping away tears at the offices of Children's Cabinet, a local non-profit. ""It's just me doing all this. You can't function in society on 'just me'.""
Once a week, Ms Richmond heads to a crowded food bank, which she says are now mostly distributing self-heating military-style ration packs - which usually include a small main course, crackers or cheese, dessert and a powdered drink - to help feed her family. She grudgingly asks acquaintances for help - most often with no success.
Ms Richmond says she's ""not a political person"" - she just wants a candidate who would help families like hers.
""I'm just hoping that when November gets here, that we will see somebody start to help where the help is needed,"" she said. ""By the end of this year, I'm probably going to be homeless. I've exhausted everything that I can.""

BBC,"Where Donald Trump stands on 10 key policy issues, from tax to Israel","Where Donald Trump stands on 10 key issues, from tax to Israel
Donald Trump is the Republican nominee for president for the third consecutive election.
When he was defeated by Joe Biden after his first term in office, the country was in the midst of Covid, lockdowns and social unrest.
It followed a campaign in which restoring both economic health and law and order were his central messages.
Here are his policy pledges this time.
Economy
This is the biggest issue for voters and it’s the pinch of high food and housing costs that seems to be shaping their sentiment rather than the robust growth and low unemployment.
Inflation has fallen steeply from a 40-year high in 2022, but the former New York businessman has retained a persistent polling advantage on the economy over his Democratic opponents.
One of the 20 core promises on his campaign website is to “end inflation and make America affordable again”.
A president’s power to lower prices directly is very limited. Trump has pledged to expand US energy production, opening areas such as the Arctic wilderness to oil drilling, which he argues would lower energy costs, though analysts are sceptical.
He says he can reduce housing costs by preventing some undocumented immigrants from getting mortgages and deporting others, and by launching a home building programme on federal land.
Taxes
Trump has a raft of tax cuts planned.
Firstly, he wants to extend the cuts he enacted in 2017, which are due to expire next year. That was the biggest tax overhaul in decades, aimed at simplifying the tax code and promoting growth and investment.
The largest cuts went to businesses and the wealthy, which Democrats have called to reverse.
The Republican also wants to shave a further percentage point off corporation tax - and has floated an even bigger cut to 15%.
He has proposed making tipped income tax free, a proposal that his opponent Kamala Harris subsequently backed, too.
Trump has also called on abolishing the tax on Social Security payments, a move that would be welcomed by retired Americans but would at the same time punch a big hole in the fund.
Trade
The former president brought the era of US free trade to a juddering halt when he became president, but his tariffs on Chinese imports were largely retained and even expanded by Joe Biden.
This time around he has proposed new 10-20% tariffs on most foreign goods with imports from China bearing the brunt at 60%.
It is part of his attempt to promote homegrown manufacturers and stop outsourcing, but some economists have warned this could push up prices for consumers.
During the presidential debate with Harris, Trump pointed out he imposed tariffs on Chinese goods, and that the Biden administration has not removed them.
Immigration
This tops his list of priorities as it did in 2016 when “Build the wall” was his signature slogan.
The number of border crossings hit record levels at the end of 2023, but has fallen this election year.
Trump has vowed to seal the border by completing the wall and increasing enforcement.
He has also promised the biggest mass deportations of undocumented migrants in US history.
His vice-president pick, JD Vance, said they would start by removing a million people, but experts told the BBC that deportations on that scale would face huge legal and logistical challenges. There are also claims it could slow economic growth.
Children of undocumented residents would no longer be eligible for citizenship under another Trump policy, although this would face significant legal obstacles.
Abortion
This is the first presidential election since the Supreme Court overturned the constitutional right to abortion in 2022, and Trump has struggled to find a consistent message.
The three judges he appointed while president were pivotal in the landmark decision, which Democrats have used to rally supporters as abortion restrictions have been introduced in numerous states.
Trump himself has regularly said states should be free to decide their own laws on abortion.
But in recent weeks he has tried to walk a tightrope, taking a more moderate stance while trying not to alienate his conservative base.
He criticised Florida’s six-week ban, provoking an angry backlash, but also said he would oppose a ballot measure in the state establishing the right to an abortion.
During the presidential debate he said he would not sign a national abortion ban into law.
Ukraine and Nato
The Republican has an isolationist foreign policy and wants the US to disentangle itself from conflicts elsewhere in the world.
He has pledged to end the war in Ukraine “within 24 hours” through a negotiated settlement with Russia, a move that Democrats say would embolden Vladimir Putin.
""I know Zelensky very well, and I know Putin very well,"" he said during the presidential debate. ""I think it's the US best interest to get this war finished and just get it done, negotiate a deal.""
Trump gave no details on what he thinks each side should give up in such a deal, and the Kremlin has said nothing can be done in 24 hours.
Trump has also said he would stop the cash flowing to Ukraine. Mr Biden signed off $61bn in military aid for Ukraine in April.
On Nato, he thinks countries that fall short of the advisory 2% of GDP spent on defence should forego the protection that comes with membership.
Israel-Gaza war
Trump has positioned himself as a staunch supporter of Israel and condemned pro-Palestinian supporters on US college campuses.
But he has also at times been critical of the way Israel has conducted the war.
He has said the war would not have happened if he had been president but offered no details on how he would end it.
As president he angered Palestinians by moving the embassy to Jerusalem and his administration stopped calling Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which contravene international law, illegal.
Healthcare
In his top 20 priorities, Trump promises not to cut Medicare, which is federally provided health insurance for older people.
While president he tried unsuccessfully to dismantle the signature legislation of President Barack Obama, the Affordable Care Act, which extended insurance to millions more people.
He still criticises the law, which remains popular, but in March he said on Truth Social he would not undermine it.
Recently he called for taxpayer-funded fertility treatment, but it's unclear if such a large expense has the support of Republicans in Congress.
Crime
He has pledged to demolish drugs cartels, crush gang violence and rebuild Democratic-run cities that he says are overrun with crime.
His Republican policy platform vows to restore safety in neighbourhoods by replenishing police departments and protecting officers from “frivolous lawsuits”.
Democrats point to his promise to pardon hundreds of convicted January 6 rioters as contradictory to his law-and-order stance.
They also point to the fact violent crime was down 6% in 2023 and murders down by 13%, according to FBI data.
Climate
As president, Trump rolled back hundreds of environmental protections, including limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and vehicles, and protections for federal waterways.
This time, he is again vowing to cut regulations, particularly as a way to help the American car industry.
He has constantly attacked electric vehicles, promising to overturn Biden targets encouraging the switch to cleaner cars.
And he has long railed against offshore wind farms, promising to halt this source of renewable energy as soon as he is elected.

BBC,Harris or Trump: How UK is preparing for new US president,"Harris or Trump: How UK is preparing for new US president
“To everyone’s astonishment, the vulgar insurgent has won!”
So wrote a British foreign minister in his diaries on 9 November 2016 after Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton to the White House.
“This looked remarkably like an abuse of power.”
So wrote the then-prime minister in her memoirs after waking up to realise that a Trump-led Washington had said US troops would be pulled out of the fight against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria “without any reference to the UK and other nations whose troops were operating alongside them”.
Sir Alan Duncan and Theresa May are the authors of these remarks, which the present prime minister, Sir Keir Starmer, would do well to note as he ponders what difference a Trump or Kamala Harris presidency could make to the so-called special relationship between the UK and the US.
“Dealing with Donald Trump and his administration was like dealing with no other world leader,"" writes the now Lady May in a book reflecting on her career.
""He was an American president like no other.""
There will be challenges, too, if the Democratic vice-president wins. She has yet to meet Sir Keir and has shown limited affinity for Europe - but she will be a vastly more conventional president than her rival.
On the off-chance that Sir Keir thought things might be different this time if Trump wins next week, the last few days showed him otherwise.
The accusation of election interference made by the Trump campaign - courtesy of an, at best, foolishly written LinkedIn post - blew up into a transatlantic spat.
“This needs to be seen for what it is. It’s happened every election, every political party does it,” Sir Keir told me, in reference to people volunteering to work for one side or the other in American elections.
But the difference was obvious. On previous occasions it hasn’t caused an almighty row.
It was a reminder that Team Trump can be brash, unpredictable and have a long memory for perceived slights - and don’t appear to really give a stuff about its relationship with the British government.
What on earth might happen to the UK’s most cherished overseas partnership if Trump wins?
Until the row in the past week, things had, on the face of it, been going well for the new prime minister and US relations.
A few weeks ago, Sir Keir and Foreign Secretary David Lammy were in New York to meet the former president, with me accompanying them.
Teetering on a pavement on Fifth Avenue with the 58-storey Trump Tower behind me, we were trying to perfect the angle for broadcast so the garish gold lettering spelling out “TRUMP TOWER” was visible to viewers, even if a giant lorry barrelled down the road as I started talking.
I think we managed it. But a similar balancing act faced the two men. They were in New York for the United Nations General Assembly - but much of the chat on the trip was not about them meeting one of the world leaders present, but whether they could get time with a candidate hoping to become one: Donald Trump.
And they did get that meeting - which tells you rather a lot about the work British diplomats in America and London have been putting in, and the determination of Sir Keir and Mr Lammy to build bridges with the man who may be president again before long.
The prime minister later told me on BBC’s Newscast that “we both wanted to ensure we have a good relationship”. He added: “It's up to me as prime minister to make sure I have a good relationship with whoever the president is.""
“I believe strongly in personal relations. Have the ability to, as necessary, pick up the phone to them to sort out issues or talk about issues. So it was a good dinner and I'm really glad that we managed to do it.”
Glad, no doubt, in part because of the buckets full of disobliging quotes there are about Trump, not least from David Lammy, who once described his host as a “woman-hating, neo-Nazi-sympathising sociopath” and a “tyrant in a toupee”.
There are no shortage of verbal skeletons in Labour’s cupboard about the man who could soon be back in the Oval Office.
In policy terms, a Trump presidency would likely bring rapid change - on climate change, on international trade (whacking up import taxes, tariffs) and on Ukraine.
Unlike a Harris administration, they would likely offer the UK a free trade deal, but it seems unlikely the terms of it would tempt London to sign up.
So what of Trump’s Democratic rival, the vice-president Kamala Harris?
Diplomatic niceties suggest if you meet one candidate in a foreign election contest, you meet the other one too.
But that isn’t likely to happen with Harris, despite Sir Keir visiting America three times since July.
No 10 blames the pressures on the vice-president’s diary in an election campaign.
It is worth stating the obvious too – while Sir Keir and Harris have never met, she is a vastly more known quantity and far more likely to be conventional in her approach to high office than her rival.
And Sir Keir has gone out of his way to spend a lot of time with President Biden in the last four months, including two trips to the White House and a recent meeting in Berlin.
An imperfect way of getting a sense of how his vice-president might govern – and with no opportunity to build a personal relationship – but not entirely useless at getting something of a handle on it.
Oh and it is worth making a very big picture point too – whoever wins. Increasingly, America’s focus is on the rise of the east and in particular China. Europe matters less to Washington than it did and that holds true whatever the result.
And so Westminster and the world awaits.
Whatever happens, expect the conversation to quickly turn to if and when the prime minister gets an early invite to Washington in the new year.
There will be a queue of leaders heading to the White House.
And what about a state visit to the UK – as Donald Trump revelled in, in 2019 - for a returning president like no other or for America’s first woman president?
Let’s see.
Between now and the US election on 5 November, BBC correspondents around the world are exploring the impact its outcome could have where they are, and what people around the globe make of this White House race.",2024-10-28
BBC,Factchecking claims about Hurricane Helene response efforts,"Biden condemns misinformation about hurricane
President Joe Biden has said the ""irresponsible and relentless promotion of disinformation and outright lies"" about the government's hurricane response is ""undermining confidence"" in rescue and recovery efforts, even as Hurricane Milton heads towards Florida.
Since Hurricane Helene caused widespread damage in several states, misleading and false claims have been spreading and have intensified as Florida prepares for a new hurricane.
Against the backdrop of the election campaign, Donald Trump has been highly critical of the Biden-Harris administration's response.
Biden has responded by condemning a number of claims by Trump and other Republicans - BBC Verify has been examining them.
Has government money for hurricane victims been spent on migrants?
At multiple campaign events since the hurricane struck, Trump and his allies have claimed that government money earmarked for disaster victims has been spent on migrants who crossed illegally into the US.
“Kamala spent all her Fema money - billions of dollars - on housing for illegal migrants,"" Trump said in Michigan last week.
This claim is false.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema), a government agency, has a Disaster Relief Fund - worth more than $20bn (£15bn) for the last financial year - which is ring-fenced to spend on responding to hurricanes and other natural disasters.
Fema also has a dedicated budget from Congress to be spent on food, shelter, transportation, and other support services for immigrants released from Department of Homeland Security (DHS) custody.
This budget amounts to around $1bn over the last two financial years - not the “billions” Trump claims.
So, these are two separate pots of money - administered by the agency - which Trump appears to be conflating.
Fema, which has now set up a fact-checking page on its website, called Trump's claim ""false"" saying, ""no money is being diverted from disaster response needs"".
In 2019, while Trump was president, money was diverted from Fema's Disaster Relief Fund - around $38m - to give to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
The focus on Fema's current funding comes after the Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas - who oversees the agency - warned that it was running low on funds for the rest of the hurricane season.
But Fema says it has “enough money right now for immediate response and recovery needs”.
Are hurricane victims only getting $750?
Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance have repeatedly highlighted a $750 payment from Fema to hurricane victims, often contrasting it with the money the US government spends on Ukraine or on illegal migrants.
“They promised $750 to American citizens who have lost everything,” Vance said at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on Saturday.
It is true that the victims are getting $750 but some context is needed.
This is just one type of assistance provided by Fema.
The $750 is what people can get as an upfront payment to help cover the costs of food, water, medication, and other emergency supplies.
Following this initial payment, disaster victims may receive additional funds following a Fema assessment.
This can go towards repairing damage to homes and personal property, and to help find a temporary place to stay.
So far, Fema has said that more than $210m has been given to communities affected by Hurricane Helene - this includes upfront payments and money to support housing needs.
Did Biden call the Governor of Georgia?
When the hurricane first hit, Trump claimed that the governor of Georgia hadn’t spoken to President Biden following the state being badly affected.
“He has been calling the president, hasn't been able to get him,” Trump said at a news conference in Georgia on the afternoon of 30 September.
But earlier that day, Georgia’s Governor Brian Kemp - a Republican - said in an interview: “The president just called me yesterday afternoon, I missed him and called him right back, and he just said ‘hey what do you need?’ and I told him we’ve got what we need, we’re working through the federal process.”
“He offered if there’s other things we need to call him directly, which I appreciate,” he added.
Were any helicopters sent to help victims?
Trump said at the Butler rally that “Kamala wined and dined in San Francisco, and all of the people in North Carolina - no helicopters, no rescue - it’s just - what’s happened there is very bad.”
This is false. By the time Trump made this remark on 5 October, the North Carolina National Guard, which is under the dual command of federal and state governments, had already posted on X that its “air assets have completed 146 flight missions, resulting in the rescue of 538 people and 150 pets”.
The post, published on 3 October, featured a video of a National Guard helicopter.
The North Carolina Department of Public Safety's website says that President Biden approved the state governor’s request for military personnel and equipment to support rescue operations in North Carolina.
The National Guard and military personnel “are operating 50 helicopters” as part of search and rescue missions, and are also helping to deliver critical supplies in the state, the department said.",2024-10-07

BBC,'It was respectable' Midwest voters praise VP debate's fresh tone,"'It was respectable': Midwest voters praise tone of VP debate
For Americans, Tuesday night's debate between vice-presidential contenders Ohio Senator JD Vance and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz was a fresh opportunity to compare the two tickets.
But it was an especially important night for voters from the Midwest. Vice-President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump both chose running mates from the region, hoping to court votes in key states.
The BBC spoke to seven Midwestern residents from across the political spectrum who saw Tuesday night's 90-minute debate as a welcome dose of civility, even if it didn't change their vote.
Latim was elated to see civility return to the debate stage last night, though he is still throwing his support behind Harris-Walz.
There were some grownups in the room last night. There was a little bit of respect for each other even though they were throwing punches.
That's different from what we witnessed in the presidential ones in June or last month.
I didn't think Tim Walz did as good as I was expecting him to, but JD Vance was a great debater.
The moment that really stuck out for me was when Walz talked about his son witnessing gun violence and how JD Vance responded I think that was quite impressive.
Jim, a life-long Republican, voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020, but he says Vance could be a strong candidate in the future.
Without hesitation, I 100% think that JD Vance won this debate. He did what he needed to do. He got the style points, but he also got the substantive points.
Tim Walz on the other hand seemed flustered, he seemed taken aback at times.
Vice-presidential debates don't usually add up to be that much of a big deal, but this one may be an exception.
This was the most substantive, policy-driven, most normal debate that we've seen in a long time in this country.
Shana's perspective on the election did not change, but she is more hopeful about the future of American politics.
I did like the comradery that they seemed to show, they at least played nice.
It looked like bipartisan politics is supposed to look.
Yes, there were times where it felt like they got a little heated and they may have talked over each other a little bit, but at the same time it didn't really dissolve into bickering.
There were times where they were able to admit they agreed with each other on issues.
It actually meant something at the end to see them shaking hands and chatting. It was striking to me.
Christina is leaning towards supporting the Harris-Walz ticket, but has voted for Trump in the past.
I enjoyed hearing from them both and the fact that they actually had a discussion and didn't just fight or call each other names.
I was happy they agreed when it came to gun violence and they both agreed to have a conversation about the issue.
When I was listening to these two, I was thinking we might actually be able to make progress.
This long-time Republican was impressed by Vance and the senator's performance reinforced his support for the Trump-Vance ticket.
I thought the two of them were civil in how they treated each other, which was a good thing to see.
JD Vance was accurate, factual and was very respectful and really unflappable.
This is a brilliant guy who has come from an extraordinarily modest upbringing.
Meanwhile, Walz was caught in multiple lies by the moderators.
The style of the two men was completely different and I thought Vance's far more favourable.
Kristin generally supports Democrats and plans to vote for the Harris-Walz ticket because she trusts them on abortion, which is a top issue for her.
Vance kept saying the names of the female moderators - Margaret, Norah - and it’s something I find men do in a condescending way. I found him smug, a bit condescending, and evasive.
Walz did fine enough, it doesn’t really affect my support of him and Kamala Harris.
It was respectable that they agreed on some issues as problems and didn’t lean heavily into personal attacks. They did talk more about policy than I expected.
Sainaga is voting in his second presidential election this cycle and thought last night's debate was close.
Vance is a smooth talker, but I knew that with his Yale background.
Overall, from a politeness perspective and a decent debate perspective, I give high marks.
Walz was struggling in the beginning. He has said before he is not a good debater, that is not his strength.
But by the end of it, I thought Walz had found his footing. He definitely took Vance to task when it came to January 6.
I would say overall Walz won, but only by a whisker.

BBC,Who won the Vance-Walz vice-presidential debate?,"Vance and Walz stick to policy in polite VP debate - but who won?
Tuesday night’s vice-presidential debate between Republican JD Vance and Democrat Tim Walz felt like a civil and relatively restrained conversation about the issues at the top of American voters' minds going into the 5 November election.
In that, it was unlike the two presidential debates earlier this year.
The two men spent much more time attacking the other's running mate than each other during 90-plus minutes on the CBS News stage in New York.
Walz had a shaky start but hit his stride when talking about abortion and the Capitol riot.
But the even-tempered, policy-focused debate, with few political body blows, probably served Vance - a polished public speaker - best in the end.
If Vance was picked because he puts ideological meat on the bones of Trump’s conservative populism, on Tuesday night he put a polite, humble face on them, as well.
“Something these guys do is they make a lot of claims about if Donald Trump becomes president, all of these terrible consequences are going to ensue,” he said. “But in reality, Donald Trump was president. Inflation was low. Take-home pay was higher.""
There were moments when the Republican candidate bristled at what he thought was unfair fact-checking from the two CBS moderators, and at one point microphones of both candidates were temporarily muted.
But for the most part, the exchanges on stage were even-tempered.
And there were several moments when the two men agreed on issues – and said so.
“There’s a lot of commonality here,” Walz said toward the end of the evening.
When Walz spoke of his 17-year-old son witnessing a shooting at a community center, Vance seemed genuinely concerned.
“I'm sorry about that and I hope he's doing OK,” he said. “Christ have mercy, it is awful.""
Cordial - but with a few clashes
The most vigorous disagreements came toward the end of the debate, on the topic of Trump’s repeated and false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him.
Vance, when asked if Trump lost the last presidential election, dodged the question and criticised what he said was Kamala Harris’s censorship.
Walz quickly noted that it was a “damning non-answer”.
“To deny what happened on January 6, the first time an American president or anyone tried to overturn an election, this has got to stop,"" he said. “It’s tearing our country apart.”
Walz went on to say that the only reason Mike Pence, Trump’s previous vice-president, was not on stage was because he certified President Joe Biden’s victory.
Vance had no answer to that, highlighting that beyond his friendly demeanour and agreeability, he would not break from Trump’s position.
Two different styles
Vance and Walz entered this debate with different skill sets. Vance has sparred with journalists on television in heated exchanges. Walz is at home on the campaign stump, using his folksy style in contrast to more polished politicians.
In the early part of this debate, with both candidates standing behind podiums in a New York City television studio, Vance seemed much more comfortable. His answers were smooth, and relentlessly on-message, constantly reminding the audience that for all of Vice-President Harris’s promises, Democrats have held the White House for the past three and a half years.
“If Kamala Harris has such great plans for how to address middle class problems, then she ought to do them now,” he said.
Walz, for his part, seemed halting and unsure on the opening topic, dealing with Tuesday’s Iranian missile attack on Israel and if the candidates would support an Israeli pre-emptive strike on Iran. The Minnesota governor rarely talks about foreign policy, and his discomfort on the subject was apparent.
The Democrat settled in as the debate moved along, and during his exchanges with Vance on the topic of immigration - an area of strength for the Republicans - both delivered well-honed messages.
Vance deflected accusations that he amplified false claims about Haitian immigrants stealing and eating pets in Ohio.
“The people I'm most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, are the American citizens who have had their lives ruined by Kamala Harris's border policies,” he said.
Vance said undocumented migration burdens city resources, drives up prices and pushes down wages.
Walz pointed to Trump’s opposition to proposed bipartisan immigration legislation earlier this year.
“I believe Senator Vance wants to solve this, but by standing with Donald Trump and not working together to find a solution, it becomes a talking point, and when it becomes a talking point like this, we dehumanise and villainise other human beings.”
When the topic turned to abortion rights – an area of strength for Democrats, according to polls – it was Vance who played defence, acknowledging that Republicans had to do more to earn the trust of American voters.
""I want us as a Republican Party to be pro-family in the fullest sense of the word,” he said. “I want us to make it easier for moms to afford to have babies. There’s so much we can do on the public policy front just to give women more options.”
Walz countered by saying that the Democratic view on abortion was simple: “We are pro-women. We are pro-freedom to make your own choice.”
If Walz was more pointed on abortion, he declined to push his attacks when the subject turned to gun control.
After Vance said that it was important to increase security in schools, making doors and windows “stronger”, Walz talked up background checks rather than endorsing Democratic calls for bans on assault weapons and other limitations on firearms.
As a congressman, Walz regularly voted in favour of gun rights and against many gun control measures, winning the praise of the pro-gun National Rifle Association. During the debate, he said his views on gun control changed after the 2012 Sandy Hook school shooting, but some Democrats may be disappointed he did not press Vance more on Tuesday night.
Will this impact the race?
American political history suggests that vice-presidential debates don’t really matter.
In 1988, Democrat Lloyd Bentsen dismantled Republican Dan Quayle. A few months later, Quayle was sworn in as vice-president after his ticket won in a landslide.
It may turn out that this debate is similarly irrelevant to November’s results. Unless there is a last-minute debate announced, however, it will be the last word both parties have on a debate stage before election day.
Walz did no harm to the Democratic ticket and showed some of the Midwestern charm that made him Harris’s choice.
But Vance’s strong performance is likely to buoy Republicans in the days ahead.
And the debate’s lasting impact may be to convince members of his party that the Ohio senator – who is only 40 - has a future in national conservative politics, given his ability to clearly advance their ideological priorities on the brightest of stages.

BBC,"Trump says New York rally was 'lovefest', brushing aside controversy","Trump says NY rally was 'lovefest', brushing aside controversy
Donald Trump has said his rally in New York City on Sunday was an ""absolute lovefest"", ignoring bipartisan calls that he personally apologise after a comedian’s joke at the event caused widespread offence.
The Republican White House nominee said it was “an honour to be involved” in the Madison Square Garden rally, though he distanced himself from the stand-up comic who described Puerto Rico during a routine as ""an island of garbage”.
Opinion polls suggest Trump and his Democratic rival, US Vice-President Kamala Harris, are neck-and-neck with just one week to go until the 5 November election.
Both are scrambling to woo Latino voters in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania, home to more than 470,000 Puerto Ricans.
On Tuesday night, Trump is campaigning in the heavily Latino town of Allentown, Pennsylvania.
Some members of the Puerto Rican diaspora in the US have expressed outrage at Tony Hinchliffe’s routine. A number of prominent Puerto Ricans - including Trump allies - have urged the Republican candidate to publicly disavow the joke.
Among them was Angel Cintron, president of Puerto Rico's Republican Party, who was quoted by the Associated Press news agency as saying it was ""disgraceful, ignorant and totally reprehensible"".
In an interview with ABC News on Tuesday, Trump distanced himself from Hinchcliffe.
""I don't know him, someone put him up there. I don't know who he is,"" he said.
Speaking at his resort in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, Trump insisted the rally was an ""absolute lovefest"".
""The love in that room. It was breathtaking,"" he added.
Trump’s allies have hit back at Democrats, accusing actor George Lopez of making an insensitive joke about Mexicans as he spoke at a Kamala Harris rally in Arizona over the weekend.
Also over the weekend, Harris unveiled a new policy platform for Puerto Rico, promising economic development and improved disaster relief.
She accused Trump of having ""abandoned and insulted"" the island during Hurricane Maria in 2017.
The Trump campaign retorted that his administration rebuilt the US territory’s infrastructure after the storm, awarding billions of dollars in grant funding to the island.
At another event in Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday, Trump told a Puerto Rican voter that his administration ""helped you through a lot of bad storms"".
""I think no president's done more for Puerto Rico than I have,"" he said.
Seeking to put the controversy behind him, the Republican assailed Harris on the border and inflation, arguing that “on issue after issue, she broke it” and “I’m going to fix it and fix it very fast”.

BBC,Chris Packham settles net zero legal action against government,"Chris Packham settles case over axing of green policy
Chris Packham has reached a settlement with the government over two legal challenges against its decision to remove or delay some environmental policies.
The TV presenter took legal action against the previous Conservative government in late 2023, arguing it acted unlawfully by delaying some policies aimed at helping the UK reaching net zero emissions by 2050.
Law firm Leigh Day said Packham had reached ""a legal settlement"" with the new Labour government that said the Tory administration ""had acted unlawfully"" by axing or watering down climate policies.
The government said it had settled both cases as it would reconsider the decisions as it updates its carbon budget delivery plan (CBDP).
The CBDP aims to outline how the UK will reach targets set out in the sixth carbon budget, which runs until 2037, as part of wider efforts to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.
In 2023, the previous Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced that several schemes in the CBDP would be dropped or rolled back - prompting Packham's legal challenge.
The revised measures included delaying the ban on the sale of new diesel and petrol cars from 2030 to 2035, reducing the phase-out of gas boilers from 100% to 80% by 2035, and scrapping the requirement for energy efficiency upgrades for homes.
At the time, Sunak said the UK's approach to meeting its net zero target was imposing ""unacceptable costs on hard-pressed British families"", amid a cost of living crisis exacerbated by higher energy prices.
In May, a High Court judge ruled that the government acted unlawfully by approving the scaled-back CBDP, finding the decision was ""simply not justified by the evidence"".
In a statement, Packham described the previous government's decisions as ""reckless and irresponsible short-termism"" and said he was ""very pleased"" that the new government had ""pledged to do better"".
The nature presenter and environmentalist will also meet with energy and net zero secretary Ed Miliband ""to discuss future progress addressing climate breakdown"", his lawyers said.
A hearing due to take place in November at the High Court will now not go ahead, Leigh Day confirmed.
A Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) spokesman said: ""We have carefully considered the two legal cases launched by Chris Packham against the government in November 2023 and May 2024.

About 240 million people are eligible to vote in this year’s US election, but only a relatively small number of them are likely to decide who becomes the next president.
Experts believe there are only a handful of so-called ""swing"" states that could plausibly be won by either Democrat Kamala Harris or Republican Donald Trump.
Seven of them - Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - hold the keys to the White House.
Both campaigns are therefore targeting undecided voters in these states.
Arizona
The Democrats gained the presidency in 2020 with the support of the Grand Canyon State, which narrowly voted to back the party's candidate for the first time since the 1990s.
This state borders Mexico for hundreds of miles, and has become a focal point of the nation’s immigration debate.
Border crossings have fallen in recent months from record highs, which have made the issue near the top of voters' concerns.
Trump has repeatedly attacked Ms Harris’s record on immigration, because she was given a role by President Joe Biden to try and ease the border crisis.
He has also vowed to carry out “the largest deportation operation” in US history if he regains the presidency.
Arizona has also hosted a bitter row over abortion access, after state Republicans tried unsuccessfully to reinstate a 160-year-old near-total ban on terminating pregnancies.
The issue has become even more polarising since 2022 when the US Supreme Court overturned a landmark ruling that gave women a constitutional right to abortion.
Georgia
Our list of swing states closely matches the list of places where Trump-backed Republican officials tried to thwart Mr Biden’s win in the 2020 election.
In Georgia's Fulton County, alleged election interference has landed Mr Trump in one of his four criminal prosecutions (Trump has been convicted in one case, while the remaining are ongoing).
He and 18 others are accused of conspiring to overturn his narrow defeat to Mr Biden in the state. Trump denies any wrongdoing, and the case looks increasingly unlikely to be heard in court before the election.
A third of Georgia's population is African-American, one of the country’s largest proportions of black residents, and it is believed that this demographic was instrumental in Mr Biden flipping the state in 2020.
Some disillusionment with Mr Biden had been reported among America’s black voters, but the Harris campaign hopes to animate this constituency.
Michigan
The Great Lakes state has picked the winning presidential candidate in the last two elections. Despite backing Mr Biden in 2020, it has become symbolic of a nationwide backlash over the president’s support for Israel during that country’s war in Gaza.
During Michigan’s Democratic primary contest in February, more than 100,000 voters chose the “uncommitted” option on their ballots, part of a campaign mounted by activists who want the US government to halt its military aid to Israel.
Notably, Michigan has the country’s largest proportion of Arab-Americans - a demographic whose support for Mr Biden was in jeopardy. But Ms Harris has taken a harder tone on Israel, and some Gaza protesters have told the BBC they hope she will be more sympathetic to their cause.
Trump has highlighted the state’s significance in his potential path to victory. Commenting on events in the Middle East, he has called on Israel to finish its campaign over Hamas in Gaza, but ""get it over with fast”.
Nevada
The Silver State has voted Democrat for the last several elections, but there are signs of a possible turnaround by the Republicans.
Recent averages published by poll-tracking firm 538 indicate that polls once showed Trump enjoying a wide lead over Mr Biden, but that advantage has shrunk since Ms Harris became the top of the ticket. Democrats had hoped a candidate with greater appeal to younger and more diverse voters would close the gap.
Both candidates are vying to win the state’s sizeable Latino population.
Despite the fact that the US economy has shown strong growth and jobs creation since Mr Biden took the presidency, the post-Covid recovery has been slower in Nevada than elsewhere.
At 5.1%, the state has the highest unemployment rate in the country, after California and the District of Columbia, according to the latest US government statistics.
If Trump comes to power again, he has vowed a return to an agenda of lower taxes across the board, and fewer regulations.
North Carolina
Polls appear to have tightened in the Tar Heel State after Ms Harris assumed her place at the top of the Democratic ticket, and some analysts now call it a ""toss-up"".
That has perhaps been reflected in Trump's choice to go there for his first outdoor rally since an attempt was made on his life in July.
“This state is a very, very big state to win,"" he told the crowd.
For their part, the Democrats decided to give a platform to the state's governor, Roy Cooper, on the final night of their party convention.
North Carolina borders Georgia, and shares some of its top electoral concerns, as well as those in Arizona, another Sun Belt state.
Trump carried North Carolina in 2020 but did so by just over 70,000 votes, which has further buoyed Democrats' hopes that this ""purple"" state (one that could vote red or blue) could be winnable in this election year.
Pennsylvania
Both sides have also been campaigning doggedly in the Keystone state, which is where Donald Trump survived the first assassination attempt.
The state proved pivotal in the 2020 election, backing Mr Biden. He has often spoken of his connection to the working-class city of Scranton, where he grew up.
The economy is a a top issue here, as well as many other places. Inflation spiked across the country under the Biden administration, before gradually reducing.
Pennsylvanians are far from unique among Americans for feeling cost-of-living pressures as a result of inflation. But the price of groceries has risen faster in their state than in any other, according to market intelligence provider Datasembly.
The BBC has previously reported on how people were struggling to cope in Erie - a bellwether county for the rest of Pennsylvania, where as many as one in eight people are considered “food insecure”.
High inflation could hurt Ms Harris across the US as polling suggests it is giving voters an unfavourable view of the economy.
Trump has sought to attack her by pinning her to the Biden economy.
Wisconsin
The Badger State also picked the winning presidential candidate in both 2016 and 2020, by a margin of little more than 20,000 votes each time.
Pundits have suggested it is in marginal states like this one where an impact could be made by third-party candidates who are campaigning against the policies of the big two candidates.
Polling had indicated that a sizeable show of support for independent candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr could have harmed the vote tallies for Ms Harris or Trump. Kennedy suspended his campaign in late August and endorsed Trump.
Democrats have been fighting to have Green Party candidate Jill Stein removed from the ballot here, saying the party did not comply with state election laws, and has also filed an elections complaint against Cornel West, a left-leaning academic.
Trump has described that state as “really important… if we win Wisconsin, we win the whole thing”. The summer Republican National Convention was held in Milwaukee.
Ms Harris was rallying in that same city when her party's own convention formally nominated her as the Democratic presidential candidate, appearing via a live feed.

BBC,"Who is Tim Walz, Kamala Harris' pick for vice president?","Tim Walz: The ex-football coach and teacher who became Harris's VP pick
With one viral line on cable TV - ""these guys are just weird"" - Tim Walz vaulted into contention for the job of Kamala Harris's running mate.
The 60-year-old brings with him a folksy, plain-spoken and sharp-tongued approach to taking on the Republican opposition.
He also comes with a compelling resume - a public school teacher, football coach and National Guardsman before he entered politics.
His political experience, representing a Republican-leaning district in Congress and then later passing left-wing policies as Minnesota's governor, could have broad appeal at a time when American politics is so polarised.
Teacher, football coach, Congressman
A native of rural Nebraska, Walz farmed and hunted in the summertime and enlisted in the Army National Guard at 17. He would serve in the volunteer force for 24 years.
His father, a public school administrator, encouraged him to join the military before he died from lung cancer when Walz was 19.
The Minnesota governor has spoken of how Social Security survivor benefits sustained his mother, and how the GI Bill paid for his college education.
Armed with teaching degrees, Walz took on a one-year teaching post in China around the time of the Tiananmen Square massacre.
He later honeymooned in the country with wife Gwen Whipple and also organised summer educational trips to China for US students.
After returning home to Nebraska, Walz became a teacher and American football coach until his wife - another teacher at the school - drew him back to her native Minnesota.

- 'He offers so much': Democrat voters on Walz
- Election polls - is Harris or Trump ahead?
As a coach at Mankato West High School, Walz helped build up an American football programme that led the school to its first state championship.
Former members of the team appeared on stage when Walz addressed the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. He leant heavily into American football metaphors during his address to party faithful, saying: ""We're driving down the field, and boy, do we have the right team.""
During his teaching career, Walz also earned plaudits for agreeing to be the faculty adviser for the school's gay-straight alliance at a time when homosexuality was largely frowned upon.
He first ran for office in a very agricultural district that spans across southern Minnesota, which is fairly rural and Republican-leaning.
But Walz campaigned as a moderate who cared about public service and veterans' advocacy, leading to an election upset.
Views and beliefs
Over his 12 years in Congress, it was hard to label his ideology.
He voted in favour of the Affordable Care Act, co-sponsored pro-labour measures, including a bill to raise the minimum wage, and backed an unsuccessful cap-and-trade effort for reducing carbon emissions.
But he also found common cause with Republicans.
He voted to continue funding the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, supported tighter vetting of refugees entering the US, and tried to block the Obama-era bailout of banks and car companies after the 2008 financial crash.

- Trump's life story, from real estate to politics
Once endorsed by the pro-gun National Rifle Association (NRA), which donated to his campaign, he spoke out in favour of an assault weapons ban after the Parkland school shooting and lost their backing.
Walz won the 2018 Minnesota governor's race by more than 11 points but his first term was overshadowed by the Covid pandemic and the killing of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis.
Republicans have heavily criticised Walz for being slow to deploy the National Guard even as some protests grew violent, as well as for allegedly failing to investigate a $250m (£186m) pandemic-era fraud scheme in his state.
The governor won re-election, albeit by a narrow margin, and his second term has overseen a busy period with Democrats controlling the state legislature by a single seat.
State Democrats have enshrined abortion rights, enacted paid family and sick leave, strengthened gun laws, funded universal free school meals and invested in affordable housing.
The frenetic activity caught the eye of former President Barack Obama who wrote: “If you need a reminder that elections have consequences, check out what’s happening in Minnesota.”
'These are weird people'
Largely unknown on the national scene, Walz quickly gathered buzz during the running-mate vetting period for his acerbic descriptions of Republicans.
""These are weird people on the other side,"" he told MSNBC, a label that has since been widely repeated. ""They want to ban books. They want to be in your [doctor's] exam room.""
But Republicans have been quick to characterise what he has done in Minnesota as too radical for ordinary Americans.
Tom Emmer, the third-highest ranking Republican in the US House of Representatives, accused Walz of trying ""to turn Minnesota into Kamala Harris’s home state of California"".
Since his selection, Walz has also drawn scrutiny over his military record after Republicans revived old allegations from other veterans. Walz said his record ""speaks for itself"" but admitted he occasionally ""misspoke"".
Allies, including labour leaders, believe Walz can broaden Harris's appeal to rural and working class voters.
Angie Craig, a House Democrat locked in a competitive race for re-election, praised Walz as ""a battle-tested leader"".
As ""a proven winner who has never lost an election across many tough races"", she told the BBC she believed he was the best possible addition to the Harris ticket.
Walz's family: 'My entire world'
Tim and Glen Walz have two children: Hope and Gus. Walz's family attended the DNC, where he called them his ""entire world"".
The remark got Gus on his feet, shouting through tears: ""That's my dad.""
Ahead of the convention, the Walzes spoke to People magazine about their ""brilliant"" 17-year-old son, saying he had a learning disorder, ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and an anxiety disorder - saying these conditions gave him a ""super power"".
During his speech in Chicago, Walz made a pitch to middle America by addressing fertility struggles experienced by him and his wife, among other topics.
IVF fertility treatment has become entangled in America's debate over abortion rights and Walz has repeatedly alluded to the process on the campaign trail.
His wife recently clarified that the couple went through a different procedure in order to have children, drawing Republican criticism that Walz had been misleading on the topic.
Walz and Harris had their first joint interview on CNN in August, where he said he was enthusiastic about “the idea of inspiring America to what can be”.

BBC,Inside Trump's effort to recruit an army of volunteers,"Inside Trump's push to recruit an army of volunteers
Every weekend, Dean Cottle knocks on his fellow Georgians’ doors to persuade them to vote for Donald Trump in the US election.
“What do you have to lose?” he tells them, echoing a favoured argument from his chosen candidate. “Our economy has suffered under the policies of this administration. The immigration is really causing problems.”
The longtime supporter of the former president is a “captain” in the Trump Force 47 programme, the Republican Party's effort to turn thousands of battleground state supporters into an army of ground troops for Trump.
But some Republicans in Georgia, a key swing state, have questioned the Trump campaign’s additional, heavy reliance on third-party groups. These groups are new to what is broadly called “the ground game” – the highly personal, door-by-door, call-by-call, flyer-by-flyer effort to win every single last potential voter in an election.
The strategy is a notable change from past elections, and even from the Trump campaign’s own playbook early in the primary calendar.
The novel coalition also focused on so-called “low-propensity voters” - those who are less politically engaged – rather than on the loyal Trump base.
It's a decision that some Republicans have considered risky for Trump. Then again, the normal rules of campaigning have never applied to the former president.
“President Trump is a unicorn,” said Jimmy Centers, an Iowa-based Republican strategist. “He has the ability to announce a rally 24 hours out and get tens of thousands of people… He brings people out who are otherwise very difficult to reach. I would caution everyone who’s looking at how he approaches his organization relative to past candidates.”
Trump Force out in force
Trump Force 47’s website provides a list of volunteer opportunities like phone banks, virtual training, and canvasses in each of the key battleground states.
Mr Cottle signed up for the programme through a Facebook advert, then took a one-hour training course to become a “captain” at the local campaign office. An app directs him where to go in Fayette County, his home, then he travels “house to house, getting commitments from people”.
Nearly three million have voted early in Georgia as of 28 October. Polls show essentially a dead heat between Trump and Harris in the state.
But it’s not clear if the campaign itself is recruiting a large number of volunteers in Georgia quickly enough, and motivating them to put in the long but necessary hours to win an election with such razor-thin margins.
The Trump campaign did not respond to the BBC’s request for comment about its ground game in Georgia.
Judith Hannon, who attended a Trump rally in Duluth, had no trouble finding opportunities to volunteer for Trump in 2016 or 2020 through Georgia’s Republican apparatus. But this year, she said, it was unclear how to get involved.
Gerald Cambor, 49, learned about Trump Force 47 when he attended an event for the former president in Cobb County on 15 October. Mr Cambor never engaged in politics until he became a Trump supporter due to his economic policies. Now, he is fired up to send him back to the White House.
But by the time he completed “captain” training and downloaded the campaign’s app, there were just 11 days to go until election day.
“It would have been better if I found it sooner,” Mr Cambor said.
An unwieldy coalition
Trump’s campaign has delegated a great deal of its ground game to two new, prominent groups: Turning Point Action, a political arm of the conservative youth organisation Turning Point USA, and Elon Musk’s America PAC.
But these groups do not have the years of experience that traditional, more established campaign groups do in turning out votes. And they have a different approach.
The US Department of Justice recently warned Musk that a pledge to give $1m (£770,000) per day to a registered voter in Pennsylvania who signs a petition with his PAC, might be illegal. Musk is also being sued by prosecutors in the Philadelphia. He denies any wrongdoing.
Turning Point Action and America PAC appear to have merged some operations in the battleground state of Wisconsin, Politico reported.
But Republicans in Georgia are sceptical that this unwieldy coalition has formed a strong enough ground game.
“There’s no central mission to their ground game” in Georgia, said one Republican operative who works with politicians in the state and asked for anonymity to speak frankly about Trump’s volunteer operation. “It just seems like they have places for people to go to feel like they’re a part of (something)... But there’s no real, organised, get-out-the-vote effort.”
Georgia’s own Republican governor, Brian Kemp, leads a powerful grassroots effort known as Georgians First, which has spent over $3m to turn out the Republican base for candidates up and down the ballot.
But they’re not working explicitly behalf of Trump, the governor said.
“I wouldn't really be able to speculate on exactly what all they're doing,” Kemp told the BBC.
“President Trump's campaign, they have just a different model.”

BBC,What are Harris and Trump's policies?,"What are Harris and Trump's policies?
American voters will face a clear choice for president on election day, between Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump.
Here's a look at what they stand for and how their policies compare on different issues.
Inflation
Harris has said her day-one priority would be trying to reduce food and housing costs for working families.
She promises to ban price-gouging on groceries, help first-time home buyers and provide incentives to increase housing supply.
Inflation soared under the Biden presidency, as it did in many western countries, partly due to post-Covid supply issues and the Ukraine war. It has fallen since.
Trump has promised to “end inflation and make America affordable again” and when asked he says more drilling for oil will lower energy costs.
He has promised to deliver lower interest rates, something the president does not control, and he says deporting undocumented immigrants will ease pressure on housing. Economists warn that his vow to impose higher tax on imports could push up prices.
Taxes
Harris wants to raise taxes on big businesses and Americans making $400,000 (£305,000) a year.
But she has also unveiled a number of measures that would ease the tax burden on families, including an expansion of child tax credits.
She has broken with Biden over capital gains tax, supporting a more moderate rise from 23.6% to 28% compared with his 44.6%.
Trump proposes a number of tax cuts worth trillions, including an extension of his 2017 cuts which mostly helped the wealthy.
He says he will pay for them through higher growth and tariffs on imports. Analysts say both tax plans will add to the ballooning deficit, but Trump’s by more.
Abortion
Harris has made abortion rights central to her campaign, and she continues to advocate for legislation that would enshrine reproductive rights nationwide.
Trump has struggled to find a consistent message on abortion.
The three judges he appointed to the Supreme Court while president were pivotal in overturning the constitutional right to an abortion, a 1973 ruling known as Roe v Wade.
Immigration
Harris was tasked with tackling the root causes of the southern border crisis and helped raise billions of dollars of private money to make regional investments aimed at stemming the flow north.
Record numbers of people crossed from Mexico at the end of 2023 but the numbers have fallen since to a four-year low. In this campaign, she has toughened her stance and emphasised her experience as a prosecutor in California taking on human traffickers.
Trump has vowed to seal the border by completing the construction of a wall and increasing enforcement. But he urged Republicans to ditch a hardline, cross-party immigration bill, backed by Harris. She says she would revive that deal if elected.
He has also promised the biggest mass deportation of undocumented migrants in US history. Experts told the BBC this would face legal challenges.
Foreign policy
Harris has vowed to support Ukraine “for as long as it takes”. She has pledged, if elected, to ensure the US and not China wins ""the competition for the 21st Century"".
She has been a longtime advocate for a two-state solution between the Israelis and Palestinians, and has called for an end to the war in Gaza.
Trump has an isolationist foreign policy and wants the US to disentangle itself from conflicts elsewhere in the world.
He has said he would end the war in Ukraine in 24 hours through a negotiated settlement with Russia, a move that Democrats say would embolden Vladimir Putin.
Trump has positioned himself as a staunch supporter of Israel but said little on how he would end the war in Gaza.
Trade
Harris has criticised Trump’s sweeping plan to impose tariffs on imports, calling it a national tax on working families which will cost each household $4,000 a year.
She is expected to have a more targeted approach to taxing imports, maintaining the tariffs the Biden-Harris administration introduced on some Chinese imports like electric vehicles.
Trump has made tariffs a central pledge in this campaign. He has proposed new 10-20% tariffs on most foreign goods, and much higher ones on those from China.
He has also promised to entice companies to stay in the US to manufacture goods, by giving them a lower rate of corporate tax.
Climate
Harris, as vice-president, helped pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which has funnelled hundreds of billions of dollars to renewable energy, and electric vehicle tax credit and rebate programmes.
But she has dropped her opposition to fracking, a technique for recovering gas and oil opposed by environmentalists.
Trump, while in the White House, rolled back hundreds of environmental protections, including limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and vehicles.
In this campaign he has vowed to expand Arctic drilling and attacked electric cars.
Healthcare
Harris has been part of a White House administration which has reduced prescription drug costs and capped insulin prices at $35.
Trump, who has often vowed to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, has said that if elected he would only improve it, without offering specifics. The Act has been instrumental in getting health insurance to millions more people.
He has called for taxpayer-funded fertility treatment, but that could be opposed by Republicans in Congress.
Law and order
Harris has tried to contrast her experience as a prosecutor with the fact Trump has been convicted of a crime.
Trump has vowed to demolish drugs cartels, crush gang violence and rebuild Democratic-run cities that he says are overrun with crime.
He has said he would use the military or the National Guard, a reserve force, to tackle opponents he calls ""the enemy within"" and ""radical left lunatics"" if they disrupt the election.
Guns
Harris has made preventing gun violence a key pledge, and she and Tim Walz - both gun owners - often advocate for tighter laws. But they will find that moves like expanding background checks or banning assault weapons will need the help of Congress.
Trump has positioned himself as a staunch defender of the Second Amendment, the constitutional right to bear arms. Addressing the National Rifle Association in May, he said he was their best friend.
Marijuana
Harris has called for the decriminalisation of marijuana for recreational use. She says too many people have been sent to prison for possession and points to disproportionate arrest numbers for black and Latino men.
Trump has softened his approach and said it's time to end ""needless arrests and incarcerations"" of adults for small amounts of marijuana for personal use.",2024-09-10
BBC,What could reparatory justice for slavery look like?,"What form could reparations for slavery take?
Calls for the UK to provide reparations for its historical role in the slave trade have reignited ahead of a meeting of Commonwealth countries on Friday.
While Sir Keir Starmer said reparatory justice would not be on the agenda, Commonwealth leaders have defied the prime minister and plan to move towards a ""meaningful conversation"" on the issue.
The UK has long faced calls to provide reparations for its role in the Atlantic slave trade which saw millions of Africans enslaved and forced to work, largely on plantations in the Caribbean and Americas.
The chancellor told the BBC the UK would not be ""paying out"" reparations - but might there be other forms of reparations to consider, and how likely is it that the UK would commit to them?
Reparations are measures to make amends for past actions deemed wrong or unfair.
From 1500, the British government and the monarchy were prominent participants in the centuries-long slave trade, alongside other European nations.
Britain also had a key role in ending the trade, through Parliament's passage of a law to abolish slavery in 1833.
As part of that law, British plantation owners were paid for the loss of their slaves, to the tune of some £20m.
The UK only finished paying off the debt it incurred to cover the payments in 2015.
Reparations for the benefit of those who suffered as result of slavery can take many forms, from financial to symbolic.
The United Nations says they must be “proportional to the gravity of the violations and the harm suffered”.
Here are some of the forms they can take.
Money
This is the most commonly understood form of reparatory justice – where a state gives money to a country whose communities it enslaved.
A 2023 report co-authored by a United Nations’ judge concluded that the UK owed more than £18tn to 14 countries in reparations.
The difficulty is that most European countries would struggle to find sums as astronomic as that.
The UK government, for example, spends a total of about £1.2tn every year.
Even if governments could find the money, it would be politically unpopular to spend so much on reparations and consequently less on schools and hospitals at home.
Some campaigners answer these points by saying reparations could be paid over time.
But many demands for straight cash payments are considered unfeasible by Western governments.
So for others, the debate about financial reparations often focuses instead on the question of debt relief.
Many developing countries which suffered from slavery owe large sums to Western countries.
The cancellation or reduction of that debt could lift a massive economic burden from a developing country at little political cost for a donor country.
Apology
On the face of it, this could appear relatively straightforward.
It does not cost anything, just a public act of atonement for past sins.
Some institutions – such as the Church of England – have apologised for links to slavery.
The difficulty, though, is that apologies can sometimes act as a declaration of legal responsibility for which there could be a financial cost.
Which is why states are often reluctant to take that step.
Earlier this week, former Prime Minister Tony Blair suggested it was wrong for states to apologise for historic wrongs – despite himself saying “sorry” in 2007.
""You can go back over history, and you end up in a completely absurd position"", he told Newsweek on Wednesday.
""The most important thing we can do for countries that have been marked by colonialism is to help them now.”
Few states that played a historic role in the slave trade have taken steps towards reparations.
Education
This includes educational institutions acknowledging their own connection to slavery and how they might have profited from the slave trade.
It can also involve teaching the history of slavery, as well as creating institutions for the study of slavery.
There are also calls for supporting schools to tackle low literacy levels and other issues that some argue date back to the slave trade.
Some campaigners say school exchanges and cultural tours would also be beneficial.
The countries pushing hardest for reparatory justice from the UK are in the Caribbean - and their collective organisation, known as Caricom, has its own reparations commission with 10 demands.
Three of these deal explicitly with education and culture, saying a ""restoration of historical memory"" was required.
Caricom said states involved in the slave trade had a responsibility to ""build educational capacity and provide scholarships"".
Health
Some argue that reparatory justice should also include health - where European countries fund clinics and hospitals.
Medical evidence shows a high rate of type 2 diabetes in the Caribbean which some suggest is associated with centuries of poor nutrition due to past enslavement.
Historian Sir Hilary Beckles told the United Nations's UN News earlier this year: ""If you look at countries with the greatest incidence of chronic diseases, black people have the highest proportions of diabetic adult patients in the world.""
He argued high rates of diabetes on his own island of Barbados ""cannot be a coincidence"" given it was ""the first island to have an African majority and an enslaved population"".
Barbados' government has moved toward exploring the historic impact of slavery on its population's health.
Caricom is calling for European countries to invest in science, technology and capital toward improving hospitals, healthcare, and mental health support for the descendants of enslaved people.
Is the UK likely to provide reparations?
The UK government has never formally apologised for slavery or offered to pay reparations – and Sir Keir Starmer has not shown any intention to break the mould.
It is not Labour Party policy to introduce reparations.
Ahead of the Commonwealth summit, the prime minister explicitly said he would not provide an apology or financial compensation for slavery.
He said he wanted to focus on present issues, like the climate, rather than the past.
Chancellor Rachel Reeves doubled down on Thursday afternoon, insisting the UK would not be paying reparations.
""I'd rather roll up my sleeves and work... on the current future-facing challenges than spend a lot of time on the past"", she said.
In 2023, then Prime Minister Rishi Sunak likewise refused to provide compensation or an apology for the slave trade.
“Trying to unpick our history is not the right way forward”, he said.",2024-10-24
BBC,US economy growing ahead of US election,"US economy growing ahead of US election
The US economy grew solidly in the three months to September, expanding at an annual rate of 2.8%.
Despite there being a slight slowdown from the prior quarter's 3% rate, the figures released by the Commerce Department showed the US is on track for one of the strongest economic performances of any major economy this year.
Consumer spending was the biggest driver, picking up from earlier in the year.
The report arrives days before polls close in America's hotly contested presidential election, in which surveys have consistently indicated the economy is Americans' top concern.
It is not clear the latest figures will do much to assuage people's worries.
Economic sentiment, which darkened abruptly during the pandemic, has remained downbeat, as a roughly 21% jump in prices over the past four years overshadows other economic news, no matter how positive.
This month, a solid 62% of Americans viewed the economy overall as ""bad"", according to a poll by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
In a country where the mantra ""it's the economy, stupid"" - coined by strategist James Carville in 1992 - is often deployed to explain elections, one might expect the worries to be bad news for Kamala Harris and the Democrats, as the party in the White House.
Donald Trump has tried to seize on the opportunity, making his economic record as president, which is remembered as a rosier time, a key part of his pitch to voters.
But as opinions have grown increasingly coloured by a person's political views over the last few decades, analysts said it is not clear how big a role the economy will actually play in shaping the election outcome this year.
""Even though the economy is based on numbers, a lot of people's views are partisan,"" said Marjorie Connelly, senior fellow at the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs. ""The economy will be a factor, but ... I think partisanship will be the biggest factor.""
The AP-NORC poll found that 61% of Democrats thought the economy was good, compared with just 13% of Republicans and 28% of independents.
The same poll found that voters were split, along party lines, as to whether they trusted Trump or Harris more on issues such as the cost of groceries and gas or jobs and unemployment.
Despite the economy ranking as a top election issue, other matters may prove more decisive, Ms Connelly added.
""I don't know how much people are going to vote on the economy,"" she said. ""There are other issues.""
What does the data show?
One reason the economy often emerges at the top of voter concerns in polls is simply because it's one of the few areas that large shares of both Democrats and Republicans agree is relatively important.
Meanwhile, much of the hard data has been solid or moving in the right direction.
Petrol prices are down, grocery prices are stabilising and wages, for at least the past year, have been rising faster than prices, which for many families is helping to offset the jump in living costs.
In September, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates for the first time in four years, saying it was increasingly confident that the inflation problem was easing.
A sharp rebound in jobs growth in September also quieted the worries of many economic forecasters, who have spent much of the last few years predicting a downturn that has not materialised.
On Tuesday, the Conference Board reported that its monthly index of consumer sentiment jumped in October, as confidence in job availability and optimism about future business prospects and income rose.
The share of people worried about an economic recession also fell to the lowest level since the organisation started asking the question in July 2022.
Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said he thought the improvement in sentiment was likely due to rising optimism among Republicans, as they grow more confident that Trump can win the election.
But Dana Peterson, chief economist for The Conference Board, said she thought it reflected growing realisation of the economic reality.
""The data are the data. What we're seeing is that third quarter GDP was strong, the job market is healthy and inflation is slowing,"" she said.
""After several years of volatility, consumers are saying we think inflation is not as intense, we're not where we were... and we're not as worried.""",2024-10-30
BBC,How this US election could change state of the world,"What the US election outcome means for Ukraine, Gaza and world conflict
When US President Joe Biden walked through Kyiv in February 2023 on a surprise visit to show solidarity with Volodymyr Zelensky, his Ukrainian counterpart, air sirens were wailing. “I felt something… more strongly than ever before,” he later recalled. “America is a beacon to the world.”
The world now waits to see who takes charge of this self-styled beacon after Americans make their choice in next week’s presidential election. Will Kamala Harris carry on in Biden’s footsteps with her conviction that in “these unsettled times, it is clear America cannot retreat”? Or will it be Donald Trump with his hope that “Americanism, not globalism” will lead the way?
We live in a world where the value of US global influence is under question. Regional powers are going their own way, autocratic regimes are making their own alliances, and the devastating wars in Gaza, Ukraine and elsewhere are raising uncomfortable questions about the value of Washington’s role. But America matters by dint of its economic and military strength, and its major role in many alliances. I turned to some informed observers for their reflections on the global consequences of this very consequential election.
Military might
“I cannot sugarcoat these warnings,” says Rose Gottemoeller, Nato’s former deputy secretary general. “Donald Trump is Europe’s nightmare, with echoes of his threat to withdraw from Nato in everyone’s ears.”
Washington’s defence spending amounts to two-thirds of the military budgets of Nato’s 31 other members. Beyond Nato, the US spends more on its military than the next 10 countries combined, including China and Russia.
Trump boasts he’s playing hardball to force other Nato countries to meet their spending targets, which is 2% of their GDP - only 23 of the member nations have hit this target in 2024. But his erratic statements still jar.
If Harris wins, Ms Gottemoeller believes “Nato will no doubt be in good Washington hands.” But she has a warning there too. “She will be ready to continue working with Nato and the European Union to achieve victory in Ukraine, but she will not back off on [spending] pressure on Europe.”
But Harris’s team in the White House will have to govern with the Senate or the House, which could both soon be in Republican hands, and will be less inclined to back foreign wars than their Democratic counterparts. There’s a growing sense that no matter who becomes president, pressure will mount on Kyiv to find ways out of this war as US lawmakers become increasingly reluctant to pass huge aid packages.
Whatever happens, Ms Gottemoeller says, “I do not believe that Nato must fall apart.” Europe will need to “step forward to lead.”
The peacemaker?
The next US president will have to work in a world confronting its greatest risk of major power confrontation since the Cold War.
“The US remains the most consequential international actor in matters of peace and security”, Comfort Ero, president and CEO of the International Crisis Group, tells me. She adds a caveat, “but its power to help resolve conflicts is diminished.”
Wars are becoming ever harder to end. “Deadly conflict is becoming more intractable, with big-power competition accelerating and middle powers on the rise,” is how Ms Ero describes the landscape. Wars like Ukraine pull in multiple powers, and conflagrations such as Sudan pit regional players with competing interests against each other, and some more invested in war than in peace.
America is losing the moral high ground, Ms Ero says. “Global actors notice that it applies one standard to Russia's actions in Ukraine, and another to Israel's in Gaza. The war in Sudan has seen terrible atrocities but gets treated as a second-tier issue.”
A win by Harris, she says, “represents continuity with the current administration.” If it’s Trump, he “might give Israel an even freer hand in Gaza and elsewhere, and has intimated he could try to cut a Ukraine deal with Moscow over Kyiv’s head.”
On the Middle East, the Democratic candidate has repeatedly echoed Mr Biden’s firm backing of Israel’s “right to defend itself.” But she’s also made a point of emphasising that “the killing of innocent Palestinians has to stop.”
Trump has also declared it’s time to “get back to peace and stop killing people.” But he’s reportedly told the Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu to “do what you have to do.”
The Republican contender prides himself on being a peacemaker. “I will have peace in the Middle East, and soon,” he vowed in an interview with Saudi Arabia’s Al Arabiya TV on Sunday night.
He’s promised to expand the 2020 Abraham Accords. These bilateral agreements normalised relations between Israel and a few Arab states, but were widely seen to have sidelined the Palestinians and ultimately contributed to the current unprecedented crisis.
On Ukraine, Trump never hides his admiration for strongmen like Russia’s Vladimir Putin. He’s made it clear he wants to end the war in Ukraine, and with it the US’s hefty military and financial support. “I’ll get out. We gotta get out,” he insisted in a recent rally.
In contrast, Harris has said: “I have been proud to stand with Ukraine. I will continue to stand with Ukraine. And I will work to ensure Ukraine prevails in this war.”
But Ms Ero worries that, no matter who’s elected, things could get worse in the world.
Business with Beijing
“The biggest shock to the global economy for decades.” That’s the view of leading China scholar Rana Mitter regarding Trump’s proposed 60 percent tariffs on all imported Chinese goods.
Imposing steep costs on China, and many other trading partners, has been one of Trump’s most persistent threats in his “America first” approach. But Trump also lauds what he sees as his own strong personal connection with President Xi Jinping. He told the Wall Street Journal’s editorial board he wouldn’t have to use military force if Beijing moved to blockade Taiwan because the Chinese leader “respects me and he knows I’m [expletive] crazy.”
But both leading Republicans and Democrats are hawkish. Both see Beijing as being bent on trying to eclipse America as the most consequential power.
But Mr Mitter, a British historian who holds the ST Lee Chair in US-Asia relations at Harvard’s Kennedy School, sees some differences. With Ms Harris he says, “relations would likely develop in a linear fashion from where they are now.” If Trump wins, it’s a more “fluid scenario.” For example, on Taiwan, Mr Mitter points to Trump’s ambivalence about whether he would come to the defence of an island far from America.
China’s leaders believe both Harris and Trump will be tough. Mr Mitter sees it as “a small group of establishment types favour Harris as ‘better the opponent you know.’ A significant minority see Trump as a businessman whose unpredictability might just mean a grand bargain with China, however unlikely that seems.”
America and... the Middle East
The latest episode of the Global Story looks at what a Trump or Harris presidency could mean for violence in Israel, Gaza and the surrounding region.
Listen now on BBC Sounds. If you are outside the UK, listen wherever you get your podcasts.
Climate crisis
“The US election is hugely consequential not just for its citizens but for the whole world because of the pressing imperative of the climate and nature crisis,” says Mary Robinson, chair of the Elders, a group of world leaders founded by Nelson Mandela, and former president of Ireland and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.
“Every fraction of a degree matters to avert the worst impacts of climate change and prevent a future where devastating hurricanes like Milton are the norm,” she added.
But as Hurricanes Milton and Helene raged, Trump derided environmental plans and policies to confront this climate emergency as “one of the greatest scams of all time.” Many expect him to pull out of the 2015 Paris climate agreement as he did in his first term.
However, Ms Robinson believes Trump cannot stop the momentum now gathering steam. “He cannot halt the US energy transition and roll back the billions of dollars in green subsidies... nor can he stop the indefatigable non-federal climate movement.”
She also urged Harris, who still hasn’t fleshed out her own stance, to step up “to show leadership, build on the momentum of recent years, and spur other major emitters to pick up the pace.”
Humanitarian leadership
“The outcome of the US election holds immense significance, given the unparalleled influence the United States wields, not just through its military and economic might, but through its potential to lead with moral authority on the global stage,” says Martin Griffiths, a veteran conflict mediator, who, until recently, was the UN Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator.
He sees greater light if Harris wins, and says that “a return to Trump’s presidency marked by isolationism and unilateralism, offers little but a deepening of global instability.”
But he has criticism, too, for the Biden-Harris administration, citing its “hesitancy” over the deteriorating situation in the Middle East.
Aid agency bosses have repeatedly condemned Hamas’s murderous October 7th assault on Israeli civilians. But they’ve also repeatedly called on the US to do much more to end the profound suffering of civilians in Gaza as well as in Lebanon.
Biden and his top officials continually called for more aid to flow into Gaza, and did make a difference at times. But critics say the aid, and the pressure, was never enough. A recent warning that some vital military assistance could be cut pushed the decision until after the US elections.
The US is the single largest donor when it comes to the UN system. In 2022, it provided a record $18.1bn (£13.9bn).
But in Trump’s first term, he axed funding for several UN agencies and pulled out of the World Health Organisation. Other donors scrambled to fill the gaps – which is what Trump wanted to happen.
But Griffths still believes America is an indispensable power.
“In a time of global conflict and uncertainty, the world longs for the US to rise to the challenge of responsible, principled leadership... We demand more. We deserve more. And we dare to hope for more.”

BBC,Teri Garr: Lisa Kudrow leads tributes to her 'genius' Friends mum,"Lisa Kudrow pays tribute to Friends mother Teri Garr
Lisa Kudrow has led the tributes to Oscar-nominated actress Teri Garr, who played her estranged birth mother in Friends.
Garr, who was also known for movies including Young Frankenstein, Tootsie and Close Encounters of the Third Kind, died at the age of 79 in Los Angeles on Tuesday.
In a statement, Kudrow said she was ""a comedic acting genius who was and is a huge influence on me and I know I'm not alone in that"".
She added that she felt ""so lucky and grateful"" she got to work with her.
Young Frankenstein director and writer Mel Brooks also paid tribute to the actress, saying she was ""so talented and so funny"".
""Her humour and lively spirit made the Young Frankenstein set a pleasure to work on. Her 'German' accent had us all in stitches!""
The 1974 horror comedy, in which she spoke with a German accent as Gene Wilder's lab assistant, was a career breakthrough for Garr.
Her other films included 1983 comedy Mr Mom opposite Michael Keaton, who praised her work and called her a ""wonderful woman, not just great to work with but great to be around"".
Garr was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis 20 years ago and first publicly talked about the chronic autoimmune disease in 2002 to raise awareness for others living with it.
The actress faced other health problems and had an operation to repair an aneurysm in 2007, the BBC's US news partner CBS reported.
Garr got her start as a background dancer in Elvis Presley movies.
Her mother, also a former dancer, put her in dance classes at the age of six.
Her first gig was joining the road company for West Side Story in Los Angeles.
She then began dancing in movies before starring in television shows like Batman and Dr Kildare.
Garr's big break came in 1974 when she played a supporting role in the thriller The Conversation.
Garr later established herself as a comedy actress, earning an Oscar nomination for 1982's Tootsie, and making frequent appearances on Late Night with David Letterman.
Garr also played dramatic roles in Close Encounters of the Third Kind and The Black Stallion, and appeared in television shows such as Star Trek and That Girl.",2024-10-29
BBC,Robert Jenrick: In a hurry to fix the Conservative Party brand,"Robert Jenrick: In a hurry to fix the Tory brand
Robert Jenrick has been on a political journey and looks to be a man in a hurry.
An MP at the age of 32, he arrived at Westminster as the first Conservative in 25 years to hold a seat for the party in a by-election while it was in power.
In the wake of the Tories' worst result in a general election, he now wants to rebrand the party, arguing it failed in office on the economy, the NHS and immigration.
He quit as Rishi Sunak's immigration minister in late 2023, but many believe he was contemplating a tilt at the leadership for some time before that.
Born in Wolverhampton in 1982, Jenrick grew up in Shropshire and Herefordshire, and went to a private school. His father was a gas fitter and his mother worked as a secretary.
He gained a first-class degree in history at Cambridge University and wrote for a student newspaper.
After working as a corporate lawyer in London and Moscow, he moved into business, becoming an international managing director at auction house Christie's.
But politics beckoned. In the 2010 general election, he stood unsuccessfully as the Conservative candidate for Newcastle-under-Lyme in Staffordshire.
He made it into Parliament in 2014, in a by-election in Newark, Nottinghamshire, prompted by a cash-for-questions scandal. He saw off a challenge from Nigel Farage's UK Independence Party, then riding high in the opinion polls.
Jenrick has held the seat ever since, and he likes to point out that since July he has been the last Tory MP standing in either Nottinghamshire or Derbyshire.
He is married to Michal Berkner, an Israeli-born and US-educated corporate lawyer. They have three daughters who they are bringing up as Jewish.
At the recent Conservative conference, Jenrick revealed he had given one of them the middle name Thatcher, in tribute to the late former PM.
He has been a strong supporter of Israel's war against Hamas and Hezbollah, and has called for the UK to move its embassy in Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
In 2022, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Jenrick household took in a Ukrainian refugee family, becoming the first MP's family to do so.
More recently, Jenrick admitted using weight loss jab Ozempic for around six weeks, but said he ""didn't particularly enjoy it"" and went on to lose weight ""in the normal way"" by eating healthier food and exercising more.
""To be honest, I was overweight,"" he told the Politico website, adding he had lost four stone in 12 months.
After arriving at Westminster, Jenrick was a parliamentary aide to a number of cabinet ministers including Michael Gove, Liz Truss and Amber Rudd, before spending 18 months as a junior Treasury minister under Chancellor Philip Hammond.
Like Truss - another figure now on the Tory right - he voted to remain in the European Union in 2016. But he has since described Brexit as the last government's greatest achievement.
In July 2019, Theresa May stood down as prime minister.
In the leadership election that followed, a crucial turning point was when three Conservative junior ministers - Jenrick, Rishi Sunak and Oliver Dowden - endorsed Boris Johnson in a joint article for The Times.
Sunak went on to be prime minister and Oliver Dowden his deputy, but in Johnson’s initial cabinet it was Jenrick whose star was brightest - he was the only one of the trio given full cabinet status. At 37, he became the first ever millennial cabinet minister.
Some Conservatives believe that Jenrick’s later rupture with Sunak was in part born of frustration that he had been ""lapped"" politically by his two old friends.
In 2019, his in-tray as housing, communities and local government secretary was a full one, containing some of Whitehall's most intractable tasks - from dealing with councils struggling with real-term budget cuts, to trying to get more homes built.
Little more than six months into the job came additional demands caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
But it was political fallout from his housing brief that would result in the first break in his upward trajectory at Westminster.
Desmond decision row
To help meet a 2019 manifesto pledge to build 300,000 new homes a year, Jenrick wanted to speed up housebuilding by replacing case-by-case planning judgements with new rules based on zones and targets.
Many Conservative MPs were unimpressed, even more so when the Liberal Democrats won the previously very safe Tory seat of Chesham and Amersham in a by-election in June 2021 having strongly opposed local development.
Jenrick's plans were later dropped.
He also faced questions about a decision to overrule the blocking of a £1bn building project in the Isle of Dogs, east London, proposed by publisher and Tory donor Richard Desmond - two weeks before Mr Desmond made a further donation.
It transpired the two men had sat together during a party fundraising dinner two months previously. Jenrick insisted he did not act improperly, but his decision was later overturned.
Separately, while a Covid lockdown was in place, it emerged he had driven 150 miles from London to his Herefordshire home, and then another 40 miles to deliver food and medicine, he said, to his isolating parents.
Downing Street publicly backed him and continued to use him as one of their most effective media firefighters when political difficulties mounted.
But in September 2021, he was sacked as part of a wider cabinet reshuffle.
He returned to government a year later as a health minister under Truss - one of the prime minister’s rare appointments of a Sunak backer. And when Sunak entered Number 10, he took on the immigration brief and attended cabinet.
Many believed that the Tory moderate had been sent to the Home Office to, in effect, ""man mark"" Suella Braverman, the much more hardline home secretary. The pair were widely expected to fall out.
In fact, Braverman and Jenrick were Cambridge University contemporaries who attended each other’s weddings.
In any case, their relationship was helped by a clear shift in Jenrick’s approach while he was in the role. This is something he acknowledges, saying his views were hardened by what he learnt about the immigration system in the Home Office.
Earlier as communities secretary when working closely with the Home Office on immigration and extremism, he is understood to have become frustrated that the Home Office was seen as the ""bad cop"" on these issues while his own department was seen as the ""good cop,"" and he resolved to tackle that.
In one of his most notable actions as immigration minister, in July 2023 Jenrick was criticised for ordering that murals of cartoon characters be painted over at a reception centre for child asylum seekers in Dover. He now says this was a mistake.
In December 2023, he resigned from Sunak's cabinet, saying the prime minister's emergency Rwanda legislation did not go far enough and would not work.
Ever since, he has been outspoken about what he sees as his party's failure to deliver on its promises to cut immigration, leading calls for the UK to withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights and for a legal cap on migration.
This helped him attract support from MPs previously loyal to his former boss, Suella Braverman, who ruled herself out of the leadership contest.
At the Tory conference, Jenrick provoked a backlash from two of his leadership rivals by claiming that British special forces were “killing rather than capturing terrorists” because of human rights law - but stood by it.
His pitch is that the party needs to ""get serious"" and confront hard truths - and that only he can make the changes needed to win the next election.
Jenrick says a ""clear plan"", not ""platitudes"" - a dig at rival Kemi Badenoch - is needed to settle key Tory policies so the party can win back the public's trust.",2024-10-17
BBC,Trump accuses UK's Labour Party of 'foreign interference',"Trump accuses UK's Labour Party of 'foreign interference'
Donald Trump's campaign has filed a Federal Election Commission (FEC) complaint against the UK's Labour Party, accusing it of ""blatant foreign interference"" in the US election in aid of the Harris-Walz campaign.
The complaint cites media reports about contact between Labour and the Harris campaign as well as apparent volunteering efforts, arguing that this amounts to illegal ""contributions"".
The BBC understands that Labour activists campaigning in the US presidential election are doing so in a personal capacity.
UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, the Labour leader, has sought to play down the row - pointing out that Labour has long sent volunteers to US elections.
It is considered normal for party officials from the UK to be in contact with counterparts in the US. This has also has taken place previously between Trump's Republican Party and the UK's Conservative Party.
Asked by BBC political editor Chris Mason whether the row risked jeopardising his relationship with any future Trump administration, the UK PM said ""no"".
Sir Keir pointed to a dinner the two men had together at Trump Tower in New York last month, saying they ""established a good relationship"".
The BBC has contacted the Harris-Walz campaign for comment.
The dispute appears to have begun with a LinkedIn post which asked for people to travel to the US and said nearly 100 were signed up to go.
The post, from Labour Party head of operations Sofia Patel, added that 10 ""spots"" are available and that ""we will sort your housing"".
It appears to have since been deleted.
The Trump campaign complaint cites this, as well as newspaper reporting that Labour-linked individuals have travelled to the US to campaign for Harris.
That reporting, the complaint alleges, creates a ""reasonable inference that the Labour Party has made, and the Harris campaign has accepted, illegal foreign national contributions"".
The complaint also refers to Washington Post reporting that communications were exchanged between the parties and that senior officials have met in private.
The Trump campaign has also made comparisons with an international programme in 2016 in which the Australian Labor Party, or ALP, sent delegates to help with Bernie Sanders' campaign.
In that instance, however, the ALP paid for flights and daily stipends. The party and the campaign were each handed down civil penalties of $14,500.
Activists' trips by the UK Labour Party have not been organised or funded by the party, it is understood from party officials.
Foreign nationals are permitted to serve as campaign volunteers as long as they are not compensated, according to FEC rules.
A former Labour activist who volunteered for Barack Obama's presidential campaign in 2008 called Trump's allegations ""nothing more than a political stunt"".
Matthew McGregor told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the most a foreign volunteer could receive was a bottle of water or some pretzels.
In reference to Patel's offer to ""sort"" the housing of those who went on the trip, Mr McGregor said it was common for Democratic activists to offer their spare rooms or sofas to volunteers.
Speaking to the Today programme himself, one Trump ally said the suggestion of interference was more of a ""perception problem than a legal one"".
Chris Ruddy, CEO of Newsmax Media, added that story was more important in the UK than in the US currently, but as the election got closer it ""could become a bigger issue"".

BBC,Kemi Badenoch: Political scrapper set on 'governing right',"Kemi Badenoch: Political scrapper set on 'governing right'
Like her political heroine Margaret Thatcher, Kemi Badenoch divides opinion even within her own party.
Her robust views, ""anti-woke"" values and no-nonsense style have made her a darling of the Conservative right and the party's grassroots, many of whom see her as a star in the making.
Others point to what they regard as her combative nature and a tendency to generate controversy.
The former business secretary's analysis of what went wrong for the Conservatives at the general election is that they ""talked right, but governed left"", and need to ""stop acting like Labour"" to win back power.
It is a pledge she has put at the heart of her Tory leadership campaign, which has focused on changing the underlying mindset of the British state.
Born in Wimbledon in 1980, Olukemi Adegoke was one of three children of Nigerian parents. Her father worked as a GP and her mother was a physiology professor.
Badenoch - she married banker Hamish Badenoch in 2012 and they have three children - grew up in Lagos, Nigeria, and in the United States where her mother lectured.
She returned to the UK at the age of 16 to live with a friend of her mother because of the worsening political and economic situation in Nigeria, and studied for her A-levels at a college in south London while working in a McDonald's restaurant and elsewhere.
After completing a degree in computer engineering at Sussex University, she worked in IT while also gaining a second degree in law.
She then moved into finance, becoming an associate director of private bank Coutts and later worked as the digital director of influential Conservative-supporting magazine The Spectator, a non-editorial role.
According to Blue Ambition, a biography written by Conservative peer Lord Ashcroft, it was at Sussex University that Badenoch got a taste for right-wing politics - becoming ""radicalised"" by the left-wing campus culture, in the opposite direction.
She later described student activists there as the ""spoiled, entitled, privileged metropolitan elite-in-training"".
Badenoch joined the Conservative Party in 2005 - aged 25 - and stood unsuccessfully for Parliament in 2010 and the London Assembly in 2012.
When two Tory Assembly members, including Suella Braverman, were elected MPs in 2015, she took a vacant Assembly seat.
She backed Brexit in the 2016 referendum before achieving her ambition of becoming an MP a year later, for the safe Conservative seat of Saffron Walden in Essex.
Badenoch had spent three years bouncing around junior government roles when in 2022 she joined the rapid ministerial exodus which brought down Boris Johnson.
To the surprise of many of her colleagues, Badenoch then joined the sprawling contest to succeed Johnson despite never having been in the cabinet.
What began as a longshot campaign with the support mostly of loyal friends who also entered Parliament in 2017 quickly gained momentum, and heavyweight support in the form of Michael Gove.
Badenoch ultimately came fourth with the backing of 59 MPs - more than the 42 MPs who were enough for her to finish top in the parliamentary stage of the current leadership election.
Her direct approach, instructing her colleagues to “tell the truth”, won Badenoch a bigger role in the Conservative Party and it was inevitable that Liz Truss chose to appoint her to the cabinet - making her international trade secretary.
Rishi Sunak retained her in post, adding the business and women and equalities briefs.
Her time in Parliament has been characterised by her straightforwardness and willingness to engage in controversial issues.
As a junior equalities minister under Johnson, she enraged many on the left when she challenged the notion there was widespread institutional racism in Britain.
In an LBC interview, she said she had experienced prejudice only from left-wingers.
""I came to this country aged 16 and now I am standing for prime minister - isn't that amazing? I was born in this country but I didn't grow up here.
""I don't understand why people want to ignore all of the good things and only focus on the bad things, and use the bad things to tell the story,"" she added.
She calls herself a gender-critical feminist, and has been an outspoken opponent of moves to allow self-certification of transgender identity.
As the cabinet minister in charge of women and equalities, she spearheaded the UK government's blocking of Scotland's Gender Recognition Reform Bill.
Responding to the Cass report on gender identity services in the NHS, she said they had been ""hijacked by ideologues"" while critics were ""gagged"", resulting in children being harmed.
She has also opposed gender-neutral toilets.
In 2021, members of the government's own LGBT+ advisory panel urged her to ""consider her position"" over the failure to deliver a manifesto pledge to ban so-called conversion therapy.
Badenoch is often labelled a ""culture warrior"" but she disputes the tag.
Sometimes accused of wanting to start a fight in an empty room, she says she does not like to fight - but is prepared to fight to defend Conservative principles.
That is simultaneously what endears her to Conservative MPs and what makes some of them anxious.
During the early stages of the leadership election several Conservative MPs told the BBC they were inclined to support Badenoch but were put off by fractious interactions while she was in government.
To her supporters, that’s the point: unlike other ministers she was willing to tell MPs what she believed and make the case for it forthrightly.
On the eve of this year's party conference in Birmingham, she made headlines with a claim that not all cultures were ""equally valid"", citing as an example ""cultures where women are told that they should not work"".
She also got attention in Birmingham for quipping that 5-10% of civil servants were so bad they should be in prison. She has previously strongly denied bullying officials.
But she backtracked after an interview in which she appeared to suggest the current level of maternity pay was ""excessive"". She claimed her words had been ""misrepresented"", saying she had been talking about excessive business regulation and maternity pay was ""a good thing"".
In 2018, Badenoch admitted that, a decade earlier, she had hacked into the website of then-Commons leader and deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman as a prank. Harman accepted her apology.
Among public spats, in February, she accused the Post Office chair she had sacked of seeking ""revenge"" by ""making up"" claims he been told to delay compensation payments for sub-postmasters affected by the Horizon IT scandal.
Henry Staunton said he had been told to stall pay-outs to allow the government to ""limp into the election"", apparently to ease the public finances.
Conservatism 'in crisis'
Nor has Badenoch shied away from public clashes with MPs on her own side - including when she rejected calls to make it illegal to discriminate against people going through the menopause.
Appearing before a Commons committee, she told chair Caroline Nokes ""loads of people"" wanted to use equalities law as ""a tool for different personal agendas and interests"".
During her leadership campaign, Badenoch has spoken of Conservatism being ""in crisis"" - under attack from a new ""progressive ideology"" involving ""identity politics"" (politics based on a particular identity such as race, religion or gender), constant state intervention, and ""the idea that bureaucrats make better decisions than individuals"" or elected politicians.
Despite the Tories being in office for 14 years, she argues that increases in government regulations and public spending have crippled economic growth and polarised the country.
She has rejected Robert Jenrick's call for key party policies to be settled now, saying the UK's ""system is broken"" and requires a reset.
The Conservative Party, she adds, needs to return to its core values and come up with new policies that recognise this reality.",2024-10-17
BBC,Harris or Trump? What Chinese people want from US election,"Harris or Trump? What Chinese people want from US election
In China, people are following the US election with keen interest and some anxiety. They fear what could happen next at home and abroad, whoever wins the White House.
“None of us wants to see a war,” says Mr Xiang, as the music in the park reaches a crescendo and a nearby dancer elegantly spins his partner.
He has come to Ritan Park to learn dance with other seniors.
They gather here regularly, just a few hundred metres from the Beijing home of the American ambassador in China.
In addition to new dance moves, the looming US election is also on their minds.
It comes at a pivotal time between the two superpowers, with tensions over Taiwan, trade and international affairs running high.
“I am worried that Sino-US relations are getting tense,” says Mr Xiang who’s in his 60s. ""Peace is what we want,"" he adds.
A crowd has gathered to listen to this conversation. Most are reluctant to give their full names in a country where it is permissible to talk about the US president, but being critical of their own leader could get them in trouble.
They say they are worried about war - not just about a conflict between Washington and Beijing but an escalation of current wars in the Middle East and Ukraine.
That is why Mr Meng, in his 70s, hopes Donald Trump will win the election.
“Although he imposes economic sanctions on China, he does not wish to start or fight a war. Mr Biden starts more wars so more ordinary people dislike him. It is Mr Biden who supports Ukraine’s war and both Russia and Ukraine suffer great loss from the war,” he said.
Some sisters recording a dance routine for their social media page chip in. “Donald Trump said in the debate that he will end the war in Ukraine 24 hours after he takes office,” says one.
“About Harris, I know little about her, we think she follows the same route as President Biden who supports war.”
Their opinions echo a key message being propagated on Chinese state media.
China has called on the international community to negotiate a ceasefire in Gaza while aligning itself with what it describes as its “Arab brothers” in the Middle East and has been quick to blame the US for its unwavering support of Israel.
On Ukraine, Foreign Minister Wang Yi told the United Nations that China was playing a “constructive role” as he accused Washington of “exploiting the situation for selfish gain”.
While most analysts believe Beijing does not have a favourite in this race for the White House, many would agree that Kamala Harris is an unknown quantity to Chinese people and the country’s leaders.

- Xi Jinping has economy worries. What do Chinese people think?
But some believe she will be more stable than Trump when it comes to one of the biggest flashpoints between the US and China - Taiwan.
“I don’t like Trump. I don’t think there is a good future between the US and China – there are too many problems, the global economy, and also the Taiwan problem,” says a father of a four-year-old boy in the park for a family day out.
He fears their differences over Taiwan could eventually lead to conflict.
“I don’t want it. I don’t want my son to go to the military,” he says as the young boy pleads to go back on the slide.
China claims the self-governing island of Taiwan as its own and President Xi Jinping has said “reunification is inevitable”, vowing to retake it by force if necessary.
The US maintains official ties with Beijing and recognises it as the only Chinese government under its ""One China policy"" but it also remains Taiwan's most significant international supporter.
Washington is bound by law to provide Taiwan with defensive weapons and Joe Biden has said that the US would defend Taiwan militarily, breaking with a stance known as strategic ambiguity.
Harris has not gone that far. Instead, when asked in a recent interview she stated a “commitment to security and prosperity for all nations”.
Donald Trump is instead focused on a deal - not diplomacy. He has called on Taiwan to pay for its protection.
“Taiwan took our chip business from us. I mean, how stupid are we? They’re immensely wealthy,” he said in a recent interview. “Taiwan should pay us for defence.”

One of their biggest worries when it comes to the former US president is that he has also made it clear he plans to impose 60% tariffs on Chinese goods.
This is the last thing many businesses in China want right now as the country is trying to manufacture enough goods to export itself out of an economic downturn.
Ministers in China bristle with contempt at US-led trade tariffs which were first imposed by Donald Trump.
President Biden has also levied tariffs, targeting Chinese electric vehicles and solar panels. Beijing believes these moves are an attempt to curb its rise as a global economic power.
“I don’t think it will do any good to the US to impose tariffs on China,” says Mr Xiang, echoing the sentiments of many we met. The tariffs will hit the US people, he adds, and increase costs for ordinary people.
Many of the younger generation, while patriotic, also look towards the US for trends and culture - and that, perhaps more than any diplomatic mission, has power, too.
In the park, Lily and Anna, aged 20 and 22, who get their news from TikTok, echo some of the national messages of pride spread by Chinese state media when it comes to this competitive relationship.
“Our country is a very prosperous and powerful country,” they say, dressed in their national costumes. They love China, they said, although they also adore the Avengers and particularly Captain America.
Taylor Swift is on their playlists, too.
Others like 17-year-old Lucy hope to study in America one day.
As she cycles on an exercise bike, newly installed in the park, she dreams about visiting Universal Studios one day - after her graduation.
Lucy says she is excited to see there is a female candidate. “Harris’s candidacy marks an important step forward for gender equality, and it’s encouraging to see her as a presidential candidate.”
The People’s Republic of China has never had a female leader and not a single woman currently sits on the 24-member team known as the Politburo that comprises most senior members of the Chinese Communist Party.
Lucy is also worried about the intense competition between the two countries and believes the best way for China and the United States to improve their relationship is to have more people-to-people exchanges.
Both sides have vowed to work towards this, and yet the number of US students studying in China has fallen from around 15,000 in 2011 to 800.
Xi hopes to open the door for 50,000 American students to come to China in the next five years. But in a recent interview with the BBC, the US ambassador to China, Nicholas Burns, accused parts of the Chinese government of not taking this pledge seriously.
He said that, on dozens of occasions, security forces or a government ministry had prevented Chinese citizens from participating in public diplomacy run by the US.
On the other side, Chinese students and academics have reported being unfairly targeted by US border officials.
Lucy, however, remains optimistic that she will be able to travel to America one day, to promote Chinese culture. And, as the music strikes up nearby, she urges Americans to visit and experience China.
“We may be a little bit reserved sometimes and not as outgoing or as extrovert as US people, but we are welcoming,” she says as she heads off to join her family.

Nevada, famous for Las Vegas and the Hoover Dam, is one of seven states that will decide the 2024 US presidential election.
Voting in swing states is hard to predict and can swing Republican or Democrat - that’s why you’re hearing so much about them as campaigning draws to a close.
Here’s all you need to know.
Population
3.178m (same as Kyiv, Ukraine)
Electoral college votes
6 of 538
In a nutshell
Nevada is notoriously ""purple"", rather than red for Republican or blue for Democrat. About a third of likely voters consider themselves independent.
2020 margin
Biden by 33,500 votes.
What's the deal now?
Both parties have tried to appeal to the state’s working-class voters by vowing to end taxes on tips, although in Kamala Harris’s case it’s paired with a promise to raise the federal minimum wage.
What are voters saying?
Inflation and housing prices are the big issues here, in a state that is still feeling the effects of the pandemic. ""Everything was much cheaper before,"" says Juan Rodriguez, a Las Vegas call centre worker. ""We're just hoping to see how they [the candidates] can lower the cost of living, and life in general.""
The state has the highest level of unemployment in the US, at around 5.5%.
""People want things to get better. They want unemployment to go down, as well as the price of goods,"" says Diego Arancivia, a Chilean-American small business owner. ""Lots of people will vote on economics alone.""
Both parties have promised to end taxes on tips - in Harris' case alongside raising the federal minimum wage.
That's an attractive argument here, with lots of people working in tourism and hospitality.
""When they take a cut of one's tips, it's difficult for many people to live,"" says Olga Mexia, a housekeeper at a Las Vegas hotel. ""That would really help a lot.""
What's the expert view?
""The promise of Las Vegas was that you can come here, work a blue-collar job and live a white-collar lifestyle in a three-bedroom house with a pool,"" Las Vegas political science professor David Damore says.
""That was attainable right up until the pandemic.”
Strong economic messaging focused on recovery will likely be the most important keys to victory, he adds. Both parties will also have to woo Latino voters - 20% of the state’s electorate.
Latinos have the lowest voter registration rates in Nevada so getting more of them to come out to vote is a key target of both campaigns.
What to watch out for on election night
- If you see the state’s two most populous counties, Clark and Washoe, go from Democrats to Republicans then Trump is in for a good night
- If Sam Brown, the Trump-backed Republican running for Senate, suffers a heavy defeat then it will be seen as a rebuke for Maga politics
- If Latino turnout is high then the Democrats may have the advantage, with recent polls showing that the party has an 18-point lead among the electorate

Pennsylvania, famous for the Liberty Bell, Will Smith and the 72 “Rocky Steps”, is one of seven states that will decide the 2024 US presidential election.
Voting in swing states is hard to predict and can lean Republican or Democrat - that’s why you’re hearing so much about them as campaigning draws to a close.
Here’s all you need to know.
Population
12.97m, same as Moscow
Electoral college votes
19 of 538
In a nutshell
It’s hard to win the White House without Pennsylvania, which carries the most electoral votes of all the swing states.
2020 margin
Biden by 82,000 votes.
What's the deal now?
Pennsylvania’s prized 19 electoral votes make it one of the most visited states by both candidates. It is also the place where a supporter of Trump was killed at a rally, in a hail of bullets targeting the former president.
What are voters saying?
In Morrisville, eastern Pennsylvania, Stephen Connolly says swing state voters like himself are ""exhausted"" from the political campaigning targeting them.
“The majority of voters, they already know who they’re going to vote for,” the registered Democrat explains.
South of Pittsburgh, Republican Andy Jones, 50, says it’s “kind of cool” to be at the forefront of voting every year.
“It puts us on the map,” he says. A retired Marine, he says he is concerned about the economy and border security and plans to support Trump.
Only about 3% of voters in the state identify as undecided, according to an August 2024 Emerson College Polling/The Hill swing state survey.
The same survey suggests Republicans and Democrats are split at 48%.
What's the expert view?
Pennsylvania’s mix of urban and rural populations make it a competitive state for both presidential candidates, says Christopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion. He says candidates must be attentive to every demographic to court voters and need to campaign on platforms that address key issues - the economy, inflation, immigration, reproductive rights and health care.
For Trump, this could mean targeting voters of colour – which polling suggests is an opportunity to win more voters than he received in 2020. Mr Borick says the question for the Harris campaign is whether she can win over Republican voters.
“Ultimately, the smallest of shifts can be incredibly impactful in a state in which the last two presidential races were decided by less than one percentage point,” he explains.

For millions of Americans, 5 November will be the first time they vote for president in a US election.
With polling numbers showing a tight race, first-time voters say they're feeling immense pressure and reckoning with a strong partisan divide as they choose between former President Donald Trump and Vice-President Kamala Harris.
The BBC spoke to seven of them across the political spectrum about participating in a US election for the first time.
We start with a voter who is scared by the level of partisanship that now colours US elections.
Denise participates in community outreach, urging young people to vote and to back the Harris-Walz ticket.
It's definitely disheartening to see how much hyper-partisanship has increased in the past couple of years. You can watch old presidential debate clips and you can see how cordial the candidates can be, and now you see a flip in politics.
When you see that candidates are enticing their voters to be ""it’s either our side or their side"" - it’s almost ignorant, it’s not professional in any way and it’s not reflective of who our commander-in-chief is supposed to be.
I'm feeling uneasy because you would think that this would be an easy election. You would think that I wouldn't be scared of the outcome of this election because the outcomes are so night and day, but I am.
Aleksei started paying attention to politics during the 2020 election and realised the power behind his planned vote for Trump.
I support Trump but I’m kind of dissatisfied with the way his campaign is running things. I feel like Kamala isn’t fit for the job and overall there’s been this feeling of both sides being very party-centric.
Trump was an independent voice in 2016, it felt like he was running against the establishment of both parties.
There’s no independent voice now and that’s demoralising to me. It makes me feel like it’s a return to this chaotic normalcy of two parties who both want to get us into wars and don’t care about the people of this country.
Melina is eager to vote for a candidate who will focus on abortion access and climate change. She feels Harris is her best bet.
Going into the election, it's been very overwhelming. There’s a lot of information coming at me on social media especially.
Prior to Harris being nominated, I was still adamant about voting for Joe Biden because a lot of the rights I feel are important, I felt would be prioritised under a Biden administration. But I'm more proud now to stand behind Harris.
We could get to have our first female president.
Lydia's number-one issue this election is abortion; she travels the country encouraging young people to vote for anti-abortion candidates and policies.
I can't trust a candidate who refuses to protect the unborn child. If they can't protect preborn children, then I can't trust them to protect any of us.
I'm voting for Trump as he is the most pro-life candidate and the most lives will be saved under him.
This election is very heated and I definitely feel that. Being part of Gen Z, I know we're a target for both candidates. I've been focused on shifting our generation to vote pro-life first.
Simon moved to the US from the UK in 2011 and says he previously supported Trump, but wasn't able to vote at the time.
Since the 2016 election, everything seems to be way more divisive.
The one thing I miss about the UK system is the viable third party; right now you have left and right, and there’s very little in the middle.
The divisiveness is pretty upsetting because I don't see the end of it.
At this stage I'm supporting Harris. There's very little about Trump I find appealing, certainly on a personal level and in terms of his policies there's nothing there that makes me think I would vote for him.
Devynn's interest in politics was sparked by seeing the 6 January riot at the Capitol. It's on her mind as she casts her first ballot.
My family has feelings opposite of mine when it comes to politics but I was always able to discuss things civilly.
Now it feels like we can’t have as many civil conversations and that’s not something I necessarily imagined.
Trump is fuelling this divisiveness and the nastiness is somewhat supported by his policies.
Once he’s no longer within the candidate selection it won’t be as bad.
Alli has found this election cycle to be tense, but she feels strongly about casting her first ballot for Trump.
Even bringing up something about the election creates an argument with a lot of people.
I'm voting for Trump in the fall because as much as I agree with his beliefs and policies, his capability of speaking and his charisma also draws me to him.
Both Trump and Vance have something that keeps me engaged with what they’re talking about.
I want my voice to be heard.

BBC,Rachel Reeves: Chess fanatic playing Labour's first big gambit,"Rachel Reeves: Playing Labour's first big gambit
""Serious"" and ""determined"" are words often used to describe Rachel Reeves, the UK's first female chancellor.
But colleagues and friends have suggested the Labour MP's public persona does not reflect her human side, with a loud laugh and deep love of Beyoncé tracks.
In her maiden speech in the House of Commons in 2010, she vowed to fight for ""jobs, growth and prosperity"" - likely centrepieces of Labour's first Budget in nearly 15 years, on 30 October.
So who is Reeves, and how is she addressing the economic and financial challenges the country faces?
Reeves was born in south-east London in 1979, just months before Margaret Thatcher became prime minister at a time of immense social and economic change.
She has previously told the BBC her mother would tick off items on a bank statement against receipts while sitting at the kitchen table: ""We weren't poor, but we didn't have money to waste.""
Her parents separated when she was at primary school, and she and younger sister Ellie, also a Labour MP, were shuttled between separate homes.
During the school holidays, the sisters would spend time with their grandparents in the Northamptonshire town of Kettering.
They would be taken to do the rounds of relatives' houses, who would give them a 20p or 50p piece each. At the end of their week, they were taken to the local toy shop to choose their goodies. While Ellie would spend all her cash, the young Rachel would allow herself a smaller treat and save most of the money.
Decades later, Chancellor Reeves would say that kind of restraint defines her, and she has very much modelled herself on Gordon Brown’s “prudence” in the lead-up to Labour’s 1997 election win.
Chess talent
Reeves played chess from an early age, with her father teaching her the key moves. She became a national under-14 champion, and would ""quietly thrash"" any boys who might think they were in for an easy game, according to Ellie.
She has credited chess with teaching her ""to think ahead, to plan a strategy"".
A keen flute player, she took her music GCSE a year early at Beckenham's Cator Park School for Girls, a comprehensive, and would go on to gain four A grades at A-level.
Seeing the extent of cuts at her school, where the library had been turned into a classroom and the sixth form consisted of ""two pre-fab huts in the playground"", she has said she was politicised by her own experience of public services. At the age of 16, she joined the Labour Party.
She went on to study Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Oxford University. As a student, she would host others before college discos, blasting out Destiny's Child songs and dressing up in her room.
Rachel Reeves: The basics
Age: 45
Place of birth: Lewisham, south-east London
Education: New College, Oxford and the London School of Economics
Family: Married to Nicholas Joicey, a senior civil servant and former speechwriter to Gordon Brown during his time as chancellor. They have two children. Her sister is Labour Party chair Ellie Reeves.
Parliamentary constituency: Leeds West and Pudsey
After graduating, Reeves took on a role as an economist at the Bank of England.
She worked on the central bank's Japan desk, looking at the country's attempts to come out of stagnation in the 1990s.
During a secondment to the UK embassy in Washington, she met her future husband Nicholas Joicey, who had spent time as a film critic for newspapers and as a speechwriter to then-Chancellor Gordon Brown.
The path to Parliament was not an easy one though. There were two failed campaigns for the former seat of Bromley and Chislehurst, typically safe for the Conservatives.
Before becoming MP for Leeds West in 2010, Reeves moved to the city and spent time working there for the retail arm of Halifax Bank of Scotland.
She once had an interview for a job at investment bank Goldman Sachs, but turned it down. She said: “I could have been a lot richer.”
Entering Parliament, an early mentor on economic policy was Alistair Darling - the last Labour chancellor, during the financial crisis.
At his funeral last December, Reeves spoke fondly of enjoying lasagne and red wine with him and his wife.
She quickly rose up the party's ranks, shadowing roles at the Treasury, Work and Pensions, and the Cabinet Office.
Brushes with controversy
While a friend has described her as politically ""as hard as nails"", Reeves' time in Westminster has not been without controversy.
She was accused of ""utter hypocrisy"" for paying students working in her offices only expenses, rather than a salary. She argued the students were on work placements and getting maintenance support.
Throughout Jeremy Corbyn's four and a half years as Labour leader, she remained on the backbenches because she felt she could not endorse his policies. Called a ""Red Tory"" by some in the party, she described this as a ""very unpleasant period"" in an interview with the BBC's Nick Robinson.
A former editor of the BBC's Newsnight programme was forced to issue a written apology to Reeves after calling her ""boring snoring"" on social media in a post that was meant to be a private message.
While she said the incident was ""deeply humiliating"", her key objective after Sir Keir Starmer appointed her shadow chancellor was to portray Labour as a steady, pro-business hand on the economy.
Last October, she admitted she ""should have done better"" after it emerged some passages in her book, The Women Who Made Modern Economics, had been lifted from other sources without acknowledgment.
She told the BBC some sentences ""were not properly referenced"" and this would be corrected in future reprints. The Conservatives mockingly called her a ""copy and paste shadow chancellor"".
Following Labour's landslide victory in July's general election, Reeves was confirmed as the first woman to hold the office of chancellor in its 800-year history.
That was ""beyond what a girl like me, from the ordinary background that I came from, could have ever dreamed of,"" she recently told BBC Radio 5 Live's Matt Chorley.
Among a number of early government announcements, she cancelled several infrastructure projects and approved a series of public sector pay rises.
But Reeves will not be delivering her first Budget until the end of October, nearly four months after arriving at the Treasury.
'Black hole'
Labour argued the time was needed to allow the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to properly assess the state of the UK economy. In 2022, Conservative Prime Minister Liz Truss and Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng had sidestepped OBR scrutiny of their disastrous mini-budget.
But critics said the Budget was the new government's main lever of change, and that therefore leaving it so long after taking office was a political error.
During the election campaign, Reeves had predicted Labour would inherit the worst economic situation since 1945. In July, she said a spending audit had uncovered a £22bn ""black hole"" in the public finances left by the previous government.
The Conservatives cried foul and accused Labour of not telling voters the truth about its intention to put up taxes.
During that campaign, independent analysts such as the Institute for Fiscal Studies observed that ruling out increases in income tax, National Insurance and VAT would severely limit Reeves' room for manoeuvre in the Treasury.
Government sources have told the BBC the chancellor is now looking for tax rises and spending cuts totalling £40bn in the Budget.
One change she announced early was the scrapping of winter fuel payments for millions of pensioners not receiving means-tested benefits. It has proved highly controversial.
Another move unveiled ahead of the Budget was to change the way government debt is measured, to free up billions of pounds of extra investment in infrastructure projects such as roads, railways and hospitals.
Reeves is determined to remedy the UK's long-term record of under-investment, setting up a £7bn national wealth fund to encourage private investment in green sectors and repeatedly emphasising the new government's pro-business credentials.
As she prepares to deliver Labour's first Budget since 2010, the chancellor has revealed she often chats to a number of senior figures.
""I speak to Gordon [Brown] regularly - I also speak to Tony Blair regularly,"" she told Matt Chorley.
Despite their political differences, she also maintains a ""good relationship"" with Conservative predecessor Jeremy Hunt, she said.
""I may not be particularly impressed with the state of the public finances that he left me, but I do recognise that after Kwasi Kwarteng, he had a tough job to do as well.""
Reeves is politically close to Sir Keir, and also revealed they speak at least once a day, wherever the prime minister is in the world.
But there is a warning from a Labour veteran of the Blair-Brown era, former cabinet minister Lord Blunkett, that she needs to offer the public more hope and less gloom.
He told the BBC Reeves had ""been left a terrible hand”, but that “post-Covid, we are a tired nation”, so “more miserableness won’t do”.
He also cautioned that this Budget would probably define the next five years, and that if Labour was going to win a second term, ""you have to keep a degree of popularity”. As the Conservatives had found out, he added, “once you’ve lost it, it takes a very very long time to pull it back”.",2024-07-05
BBC,Jeff Bezos op-ed defends the Washington Post over endorsement change,"Jeff Bezos defends Washington Post's end to election endorsements
Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos has defended his newspaper's decision to stop making presidential endorsements, saying the move could help improve credibility.
Mr Bezos, who is also the Amazon founder, argued in an article on the Post's website on Monday that presidential endorsements created the ""perception of bias"" and did not ""tip the scales"" of an election.
The comments follow public scrutiny, as well as the newspaper's reported loss of thousands of subscribers and the resignation of some editorial staff members.
The decision to stop endorsing a presidential candidate - which was announced just days before the election - broke with a custom the Post had generally followed for decades.
""No undecided voters in Pennsylvania are going to say, 'I’m going with Newspaper A’s endorsement'. None,"" Mr Bezos wrote in his defence of the move.
""What presidential endorsements actually do is create a perception of bias. A perception of non-independence. Ending them is a principled decision, and it’s the right one.""
The paper has endorsed a candidate in most presidential elections since the 1970s, though when it announced the move, CEO William Lewis described the decision as a return ""to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates"".
The Washington Post Guild's leadership - which represents workers at the paper - said it was ""deeply concerned"" by the decision.
""We are already seeing cancellations from once-loyal readers,"" the Guild said in its statement. ""This decision undercuts the work of our of members at a time when we should be building our readers' trust, not losing it.""
The paper has lost as many as 200,000 digital subscribers, and several editorial staff including board members have stepped down, according to a report by NPR. The Post itself declined to comment, and Mr Bezos has not addressed the report.
In its own news article on the decision, The Washington Post reported - citing two sources briefed on the sequence of events who were not authorised to speak publicly - that editorial staffers had planned to endorse Vice-President Kamala Harris, but the article was never published.
Mr Bezos denied the timing of the decision was a ""intentional strategy"" and chalked it up to ""inadequate planning"".
""I wish we had made the change earlier than we did, in a moment further from the election and the emotions around it,"" Mr Bezos wrote.
But he said the paper would need to ""exercise new muscles"" to stay competitive and current.
The Washington Post owner also denied the decision was a ""quid pro quo of any kind"" with Harris or her Republican rival for the presidency, Donald Trump.
In addition to The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times and USA Today have also announced they will not endorse a presidential candidate this time.
Meanwhile, the New York Times and New York Post have made endorsements for Harris and Trump respectively.

BBC,"Who is Usha Vance, lawyer and wife of Trump's VP pick JD Vance?","Who is Usha Vance, lawyer and wife of Trump's VP pick?
When Usha Vance took to the stage at the Republican National Convention, she introduced the crowd to the ""most determined person I know"" - her husband JD Vance, the newly selected vice-presidential candidate.
""That JD and I could meet at all, let alone fall in love and marry, is a testament to this great country,"" she told the crowd on Wednesday night.
Mrs Vance humanised the Ohio senator and running mate of Republican White House candidate Donald Trump by calling him a man who longed for a ""tight-knit family"".
She also said her husband was a ""meat and potatoes kind of guy"" - but one who had adapted to her vegetarian diet and even learned how to cook Indian food for her mother.
While she does not seek out the political spotlight, Mrs Vance, 38, wields considerable influence over her husband’s career, Mr Vance has said before.
Mrs Vance - née Chilukuri, the child of Indian immigrants - was born and raised in the suburbs of San Diego, California.
The two met as students at Yale Law School in 2013, when they joined a discussion group on “social decline in white America”, according to the New York Times.
The content influenced Mr Vance's best-selling 2016 memoir Hillbilly Elegy, about his childhood in the white working-class Rust Belt, which became a 2020 movie directed by Ron Howard.
Whilst her husband regularly rails about ""woke"" ideas he says are pushed by Democrats, Mrs Vance was formerly a registered Democrat and is now a corporate litigator at a San Francisco law firm which proudly touts its reputation for being “radically progressive”.
Mrs Vance previously graduated with a BA in history from Yale University and was also a Gates Scholar at Cambridge University, where she came away with an MPhil in early modern history, according to her LinkedIn profile.
She once clerked for Brett Kavanaugh, now a Supreme Court justice, on the District of Columbia court of appeals. Then she clerked for Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts. Both men are part of the highest court's conservative majority.
And it is this stellar CV that leaves Mr Vance feeling “humbled” he has said.
“Usha definitely brings me back to Earth a little bit,” Mr Vance told the Megyn Kelly Show podcast in 2020. “And if I maybe get a little bit too cocky or a little too proud I just remind myself that she is way more accomplished than I am.”
“People don’t realise just how brilliant she is,” he added, saying she is able to digest a 1,000-page book in only a few hours.
She is the ""powerful female voice on his left shoulder”, giving him guidance, he said.
The couple wed in 2014 and have three children: two sons, Ewan and Vivek, and a daughter, Mirabel.
As Mr Vance took the stage at the Republican convention, he echoed previous praise of his wife being an ""incredible lawyer and a better mom"".
In an interview on Fox News last month, she said: ""I believe in JD, and I really love him, and so we’ll just sort of see what happens with our life.""
""Neither JD nor I expected to find ourselves in this position,"" she said at the RNC.
And since then she has firmly defended her husband, particularly against recent attacks for controversial remarks he made in 2021 about Kamala Harris and other Democrats being ""childless cat ladies"".
Mr Vance argued that those without children should not lead the country and that women who do not have kids are ""miserable"".
His wife called the remarks a ""quip"" and said people were not looking at the large context of the comments.",2024-07-16
BBC,Former Trump aide Steve Bannon released from prison,"Former Trump aide Steve Bannon released from jail
Former Donald Trump advisor Steve Bannon has been released from prison after spending four months behind bars.
Bannon, 70, was released from a Danbury, Connecticut, correctional facility on Tuesday, Benjamin O'Cone, a Bureau of Prisons spokesman, told the BBC.
Bannon, a conservative podcast host who was key to Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, was convicted of two counts of contempt of Congress in 2022 for refusing to comply with a congressional subpoena related to a January 6 Capitol riot investigation.
“The four months in federal prison not only didn’t break me, it empowered me,” Bannon said on his podcast following his release.
“I am more energised and more focused than I’ve ever been in my entire life.”
At a news conference he held on Tuesday afternoon, Bannon said that with a week left until the 2024 presidential election, his focus would be to get voters out in support of Trump.
“We were on the cusp of having an incredible victory that could actually be a potential landslide,"" Bannon said.
He also spoke briefly of his time in prison, saying that at one point he was given the opportunity to teach a civics and government class to fellow inmates.
Before he was sent to jail, he had promised to continue to help Trump and his campaign from behind bars.
""I've served my country now for the last 10 or so years focusing on this,"" he told the BBC before going to prison, referring to politics and Trump's Make America Great Again slogan. ""If I have to do it in a prison, I do it in a prison - it makes no difference at all.""
Bannon has remained loyal to Trump and hostile towards Democratic figures, despite a falling out between the two during Trump's presidency.
""I’m a political prisoner of Nancy Pelosi, I’m a political prisoner of Merrick Garland; I’m a political prisoner of Joe Biden and the corrupt Biden establishment,"" he said before going to jail.
The Trump loyalist claimed on his podcast in May that Democrats were ""going to do everything to steal this election"".
He has repeatedly falsely claimed that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.
Bannon is still facing other legal troubles - having been indicted on charges of money laundering, fraud and conspiracy in a separate New York state case in 2022.
He has been accused of cheating donors to a fundraiser that promised to build a portion of a wall on the US-Mexico border. Bannon has pled not guilty to the charges.",2024-10-29
