NPR,Owners of ‘horrific’ funeral home plead guilty to federal fraud charges,"Owners of ‘horrific’ funeral home plead guilty to federal fraud charges
Carie and Jon Hallford have pleaded guilty to federal fraud charges, one year after the married couple fled Colorado, leaving 190 decaying corpses in their funeral home. They were accused of taking money from customers and a pandemic relief fund and spending it on themselves, paying for things like travel, plastic surgery and expensive cars.
The couple have been charged with numerous state and federal crimes. In April, they were indicted on 15 federal counts related to wire fraud and conspiracy charges.
The Hallfords had been set to begin a jury trial on the fraud charges last week, but as that date approached, they asked to change their pleas. They pleaded guilty on Thursday afternoon, at a hearing where victims’ families were able to listen via audioconference.
“The plea agreement, which stipulates that prosecutors will not request over 15 years imprisonment, still has to be approved by the judge,” The Associated Press reports. “It’s unclear when that will happen.”
Federal prosecutors said the pair operated two fraudulent schemes that, together, netted just under $1 million. On one hand, they funneled $882,300 from a COVID-19 relief fund for businesses; on the other, they victimized customers who paid for their loved ones’ remains to be treated legally and with respect.
The Hallfords’ Return to Nature Funeral Home had touted its service as being more natural, pledging to cremate or bury bodies without using embalming fluids or metal caskets.
But in reality, Assistant U.S. Attorney Tim Neff said at a court hearing earlier this year, the Hallford’s funeral home “turned into a macabre and ghoulish house of horrors, where bodies were stacked like cord wood, and left to decay and decompose.”
The duplicity unraveled a year ago, when law enforcement was alerted to a ""horrific"" odor coming from the Hallfords' facility in Penrose, Colo.
For several years, families had been given containers holding the purported cremains of their loved ones — but after discovering the scene at the funeral home last October, law enforcement concluded that the ashes could not have been from bodies sent to the funeral home.
In August, a judge overseeing a civil case ordered the Hallfords to pay $950 million to families whose loved ones’ remains were mishandled — a judgment seen as symbolic, given their lack of substantial assets.
As early as the summer of 2020, the Hallfords were discussing the mounting problem at their main facility, according to text messages quoted in court hearings. In them, Jon Hallford repeatedly cited the difficulty of finding a way to dispose of the bodies, and the threat of being exposed.
In October 2020, he sent a text telling his wife they had four possible options: build a new crematory machine; dig a hole and use lye on bodies; burn the bodies in a hole; or “(d) I go to prison, which is probably what's going to happen.""",2024-10-25
NPR,"The Secret Service admits failures in Butler, Pa., Trump shooting","The Secret Service admits failures in Butler, Pa., Trump shooting
The Secret Service acknowledged Friday failures that led to a gunman being able to wound former President Donald Trump at a rally in Butler, Pa., on July 13.
“It’s important that we hold ourselves to account for the failures of July 13 and that we use the lessons learned to make sure that we do not have another failure like this again,” Ronald Rowe, the acting director of the Secret Service, told reporters.
The agency released the initial findings for its internal review about the Butler incident on Friday, just days after it faced additional criticism over a second alleged gunman who was able to make it within several hundred yards of Trump at his West Palm Beach, Fla., golf course on Sept. 15.
Rowe said that one of the failures in Butler was that the Secret Service deferred too much to local law enforcement on securing buildings near the rally and didn’t provide clear guidance. This allowed the shooter to climb onto the roof of a nearby building and shoot at the former president, he said.
“We need to be clear with our state and local partners on what we’re asking of them,” Rowe said.
The agency's review details, for example, that the local tactical team was inside the building, instead of on the roof — from where the shooter ended up getting a clear shot at the president. That local team had no contact with the Secret Service before the day of the rally.
""Multiple law enforcement entities involved in securing the rally questioned the efficacy of that local sniper team’s positioning in the AGR building, yet there was no follow-up discussion about modifying their position,"" the review found. ""There was also no discussion with Secret Service advance personnel about positioning that team atop the AGR roof. Local sniper support were apparently not opposed to that location.""
Rowe cited “complacency” from other agents, flaws in advanced planning, as well as over-reliance on mobile devices.
The review found that communication broke down on multiple levels. Secret Service agents and local law enforcement officials missed communication in planning, in operations — and on the day of the rally itself, used different radio frequencies that ""were not conducive for quickly sharing real-time information.""
Rowe said employees would be held accountable, declined to give details, but reiterated that contrary to media reports, he did not ask for anyone to resign.
""Robust security"" for Trump
Rowe said since he left office, the former president has had “robust security” — more robust than any former president has ever received. That security was increased to a presidential level after the July 13 shooting.
The Secret Service has come under scrutiny since July, when a gunman fired multiple shots at Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, at the Butler rally, striking Trump’s ear, killing one attendee and wounding two others. The gunman was killed.
Then, two months later, a second alleged gunman came close to Trump — though he did not shoot, and did not have the former president in his sights. The suspect was apprehended.
Rowe said that based on information he had about the second incident, ""I’d say that situation was managed according to our training.” That included the young Secret Service agent taking swift action, reporting shots he fired at the gunman, and communicating via radio.
Still, the multiple attempts have prompted Lowe and other Secret Service personnel to ask Congress for more resources, arguing the agency is limited on personnel and equipment. President Biden has also urged Congress to provide more resources.
On Friday, the House unanimously approved a bill that would direct the Secret Service to give the same protection as the current president and vice president — something the agency said is already happening.
Lawmakers also increased the scope of a bipartisan task force that is investigating the first assassination attempt to also investigate the apparent second attempt. The group of bipartisan House members is expected to file its own report in December.",2024-09-20
NPR,What the Harris campaign is doing to try to win over more Black men,"What the Harris campaign is doing to try to win over more Black men
ROCKY MOUNT, N.C. — From behind her barber chair and in her community, Cherita Evans — who goes by “Storm the Barber” — has picked up on a troubling trend for Vice President Harris’ campaign.
“Most of my female family and friends — they're voting for Harris,” Evans said in an interview at the Head Changerz shop last week. But she said some of the men in her life aren’t so sure. “I think ... a lot of men aren't ready to vote for a woman.”
“In my community, you have a lot of men, who, you know, won’t even be under a female leadership in church,” said Evans.
This is a problem the Harris campaign is racing to address as early voting begins in key states where every vote will count. Polls show former President Donald Trump may be making some inroads with Black male voters — and other Black men may not vote.
That’s why on Tuesday Harris will be taking questions from callers in swing states in a town hall conversation moderated by Charlamagne tha God, an influential Black radio host who has pulled very few punches with Democratic politicians.
The challenge was underscored by former President Barack Obama this week. He spoke what he called “some truths” about how energy and turnout for Harris in Black communities was not what it was when he was running — and said that it “seems to be more pronounced with the brothers.”
“Part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that,” Obama said.
What Harris is doing to reach Black male voters
Harris’ campaign is working to engage Black male voters, including hosting tailgate events at homecomings at historically Black colleges. Harris also had a conversation on All the Smoke, a podcast hosted by two former NBA stars, where she talked about her identity — something she hasn’t often leaned into on the campaign trail.
This weekend, Harris is in North Carolina meeting local Black leaders. On Sunday, she plans to attend a church service in Greenville, and later hold a rally. The city is in Eastern North Carolina, a section of the state with a large Black population, but where turnout among those voters has lagged in recent years.
Her path to the presidency runs through communities like Rocky Mount, where NPR first met Evans back in May.
At that time, Evans was less than enthusiastic about the election, saying she didn’t like Trump or Biden. Evans was disappointed that Harris had disappeared from the spotlight.
“After she became vice president, it seemed like she just kind of got quiet,” said Evans.
Evans said she thinks Harris is a better candidate than Biden — but not perfect.
“I’m going to be honest with you: I don’t really like Trump, so I am going to vote for her,” said Evans. “But I don’t think she’s done a very great job of addressing the main issues that we are having.”
Like so many voters this year, Evans says gas prices are high and groceries are too expensive. She sees Harris talking about going after companies for price gouging in the ads that show up constantly on the TV in the barbershop — but Evans doesn’t buy that as a real solution.
There's a generational divide in voting
Back in May, Evans was cutting the hair of Christian Pounds, a 22-year-old college student. At the time he didn’t like either candidate and didn’t think his vote would change anything.
Reached on the phone this week, he said he’s definitely planning to vote. “When Biden dropped out, I was kind of happy,” Pounds said, explaining he thought Biden was too old for the job.
The other night, Pound says he got into a heated discussion with his uncle and his cousin about voting. His cousin isn’t planning to vote. “My uncle was like, ‘You better vote for Kamala Harris.’”
Pounds said he sees a real generational divide among his friends and family — “the young people vs. the old, when it comes to voting vs. not voting,”
In the neighboring community of Wilson, Mike Harris is a barber at Style Masters. He’s been voting for Democrats all his life, and said he hopes Harris will become the first female president.
But the same isn’t true for all of his clients and friends
“Some people — I don't know if they joking or not — say they are” voting for Trump, said Mike Harris.
“Some people don't believe in female leaders, but I tell them all the time ... my mom raised me and my brother in our house. So I think that, you know, women can do the job,” Mike Harris said.

NPR,Trump vows to 'steal' jobs from other countries in winding speech on economic plans,"Trump vows to 'steal' jobs from other countries in winding speech on economic plans
SAVANNAH, Ga. — Former President Donald Trump said economic policies he would enact in a second term would create an environment to ""steal"" manufacturing jobs that have moved overseas through tax cuts and tariffs.
In a winding speech in front of about 2,500 raucous supporters in the Johnny Mercer Theatre in Savannah on Tuesday, Trump shared his ideas for a ""manufacturing renaissance"" that he says would bring millions of jobs back to the U.S. from overseas.
""With the vision I'm outlining today, not only will we stop our businesses from leaving for foreign lands, but under my leadership, we're going to take other countries' jobs,"" he said. ""Did you ever hear that expression before? Have you ever heard that we're going to take other countries' jobs? It's never been stated before. We're going to take their factories — and we had it really rocking four years ago — we're going to bring thousands and thousands of businesses and trillions of dollars in wealth back to the good ole' USA.""
Trump called for lowering the corporate tax rate from 21% to 15% for ""those who make their product in the USA,"" continued a push for ""substantial tariffs"" on imported goods and proposed special manufacturing zones on federal land ""with ultra low taxes and regulations for American producers.""
""We're going to use our resources to our benefit,"" Trump said, also touting fewer environmental regulations around manufacturing. ""And it'll be clean and environmentally perfect so that American — and Americans can manufacture everything that we need, the resources we have right here, American soil. It's got everything: it's got the rare earth, it's got the oil, it's got the gas. We have everything — the only thing we don't have is smart people leading our country.""
Trump didn't offer specifics on many proposals. Some economists — and fellow Republicans — have warned that key Trump policies, like expanded tariffs, may hurt American consumers by making things more expensive and could harm American workers if countries enact retaliatory tariffs on exports.
""I’m not a fan of tariffs, they raise the prices for American consumers,"" Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters Tuesday. ""I’m more of a free-trade kind of Republican that remembers how many jobs are created by the exports that we engage in. So, I’m not a tariff fan.""
The main thrust of Trump's address was tax and manufacturing policy, but like most of his speeches it meandered through his typical campaign stump speech themes.
He attacked Vice President Harris as the ""tax queen"" whose proposals to tax unrealized investment gains for certain ultra-wealthy Americans would lead to a financial depression, but also riffed that she had ""bigger cognitive problems"" than President Biden.
He repeated his promise to enact mass deportations of migrants, expounded upon Russia's military history (noting that ""they beat Hitler, they beat Napoleon, that's what they do"") when discussing the war in Ukraine and recounted the two assassination attempts against him this summer, among other deviations from the topic of the economy.
Notably, Trump did not attack Georgia's Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, thanking him for being ""fantastic"" after excoriating Kemp at an Atlanta rally in early August that highlighted the rift between Trump and popular Republicans in the state who did not yield to his demands to overturn the 2020 election.
He did, however, continue to criticize parts of the electric vehicle industry and Biden administration rules around emissions that some Republicans call a ""mandate."" Georgia has quickly become the country's EV manufacturing capital, including a massive Hyundai compound about 25 miles outside of Savannah, the state's largest-ever economic development project that has seen a nearly $8 billion investment.
Trump's latest visit to Georgia comes as polls show the former president's likeliest path to victory runs through Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.

As Vice President Harris headed out to swing states to try after she delivered her closing argument for her campaign — a promised to turn the page on division in the country — she found herself instead having to respond to a divisive remark made by President Biden.
In a video call with a Latino voting group on Tuesday evening, Biden sounded like he was calling supporters of former President Donald Trump ""garbage."" Republicans took offense and drew a through line to Hillary Clinton's 2016 comment about the ""basket of deplorables"" supporting Trump.
Biden and the White House quickly moved to clarify his comment. But Harris — who has been trying to appeal to moderate Republican and independent voters — was peppered with questions about it as she departed for Wednesday stops in North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.
""Let me be clear: I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for,"" Harris told reporters on the tarmac. ""As I have said and will repeat over and over again, I am sincere in what I mean: when elected president of the United States, I will represent all Americans, including those who don't vote for me.""
Harris' running mate Gov. Tim Walz — who had been booked on two prominent television morning shows to talk about her closing argument speech — instead faced questions about Biden's remark.

Biden's comment has given Republicans an opening to move past the controversy unleashed by a disparaging and politically toxic joke about Puerto Rico made by a comedian on Sunday at a Madison Square Garden rally for Trump.
That joke has roiled the presidential campaign in its waning days as Puerto Ricans are a significant presence in places like Pennsylvania, which both the Trump and Harris campaigns see as a must-win state.
What Biden said
In a video call Tuesday with Voto Latino, Biden sounded like he was calling Trump supporters “garbage.”

How Republicans are responding
Biden, who has a life-long history of gaffes, has kept a low profile since he dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris.
Last week at a rare campaign event, he attracted attention when he said of Trump “we got to lock him up,” before quickly adding “politically.”
Conservatives have long complained that Democrats have used disparaging labels to describe their supporters. They point to then-candidate Barack Obama's remarks about ""bitter"" working-class voters who ""cling to guns or religion"" and former Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton who described Trump's supporters as ""deplorables.""
Biden's remark landed as Trump was onstage at a rally in Allentown, Pa., where Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla, went on stage to demand an apology from Biden.
“We are not garbage: we are patriots who love America,” Rubio said.
The Trump campaign said it was an example of name-calling by the Harris campaign.
""President Trump is backed by Latinos, Black voters, union workers, angel moms, law enforcement officers, border patrol agents, and Americans of all faiths — and Harris, Walz, and Biden have labeled these great Americans as fascists, Nazis, and now, garbage,"" Karoline Leavitt, Trump's campaign spokesperson said in a statement.",2024-10-30
NPR,Donald Trump's closing argument: leaning into the extreme rhetoric : Consider This from NPR,"Donald Trump's closing argument: leaning into the extreme rhetoric
On Sunday afternoon, to kick off the last full week of the 2024 presidential campaign, thousands of people lined up under a screen several stories high with the image of former President Donald Trump.
They were waiting outside New York's Madison Square Garden where Trump was holding a campaign rally.
It was a homecoming of sorts for the man who has portrayed himself as the quintessential New Yorker.
The headliner took the stage two hours after he was scheduled to, and before that...more than two dozen others spoke.
Many leaned into racist, misogynistic and vulgar rhetoric, like comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who now famously referred to Puerto Rico as a ""floating pile of garbage""
There was intense backlash, and a Trump campaign advisor later put out a statement distancing the former President from Hinchcliff's remarks.
But Hinchcliffe wasn't the only speaker who used incendiary language during the rally Sunday night.

More key voices at the event
Trump's childhood friend David Rem referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as the devil, calling her the ""antichrist.""
And Stephen Miller, a policy advisor in the Trump White House and current senior campaign advisor underscored the former President's anti-immigrant message, saying ""America is for Americans and Americans only.""
Other speakers included Elon Musk, Hulk Hogan, New York Congresswoman Elise Stefanik and Phil McGraw – better known as Dr. Phil.
Finally, more than four hours into the program, Trump took the stage and spoke for another 78 minutes – repeating many of the themes his warm up acts had touched on, promising some of the following:
- Launching the ""largest deportation program in American history to get these criminals
out"" - Getting critical race theory and ""transgender insanity the hell out of our schools""
Trump referred to his opponent as a ""train wreck,"" and promised the following: ""This election is a choice between whether we will have four more years of gross incompetence and failure or whether we will begin the four greatest years in the history of our country.""
Closing up his campaign.
The rhetoric from this rally has generated plenty of conversation online for the fate of Trump's campaign. How was it received?
NPR political correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben says the fallout following the Puerto Rico comment was immediate, starting before the rally was even over.
""You had New York Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and vice presidential nominee Tim Walz, who were doing an online event for the Harris campaign already. They played that clip and reacted with disgust as they heard it. Not only that, but pretty immediately, the Harris campaign itself quickly retweeted a clip""
Republican politicians, including Florida Sen. Rick Scott and Congressman Carlos Gimenez, also criticized that joke.
""And the Trump campaign got the message in a statement late last night. The campaign's senior adviser, Danielle Alvarez, said, 'This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign,'"" added Kurtlzeben.
So, does she expect the campaign to be affected by this?
""What's been remarkable in this absolutely wild election year is that almost nothing has shifted the polls, aside from the Democrats swapping candidates. Besides that, it's been remarkably stable: assassination attempts, Trump saying immigrants are vermin poisoning the blood of the nation...Nothing seems to budge.""
And while it is unusual for the Trump campaign to backtrack on just about anything, it might be too close to say if it could impact the final result of the election.

NPR,"In outreach to Black men, Harris to vow to legalize weed, protect crypto","In outreach to Black men, Harris to vow to legalize weed, protect crypto
Vice President Kamala Harris is pledging Monday to legalize recreational marijuana, protect cryptocurrency assets and give 1 million loans to Black entrepreneurs, as part of her efforts to court Black voters who may be pivotal in the presidential race.
Polls show that some Black men may be gravitating toward former President Trump, Harris’ Republican rival, or not vote at all. Harris and other prominent Democrats are trying to counter that.
Among the initiatives being announced by Harris Monday:
- Legalizing recreational marijuana and providing opportunities for Black Americans to succeed in the industry
- 1 million fully forgivable loans of up to $20,000 for Black entrepreneurs and others to start businesses
- a plan come up with rules for cryptocurrency and other digital assets; more than 20% of Black Americans own or have owned cryptocurrency assets, according to the campaign
- invest more in Black male teachers, promote registered apprenticeships and credentialing opportunities in Black communities and investing in leadership training and mentorship programs like My Brother’s Keeper
- a National Health Equity Initiative focused on Black Men that addresses sickle cell disease, diabetes, mental health, prostate cancer, and other health challenges that disproportionately affect them
Harris will talk about the plan on Monday in Erie, Pa.
Former Rep. Cedric Richmond, a co-chair of the Harris' campaign, said her new announcement is part of her ""Opportunity Economy"" pledge — “an economy where people don't just get by, but get ahead. Where Black men are equipped with the tools to thrive: to buy a home, provide for our families, start a business and build wealth,” he said in a statement.
On Monday, Harris will meet with a group of Black men in Erie, Pa., before holding a rally in the city. And on Tuesday, she plans to meet with Black entrepreneurs in Detroit after a town hall conversation moderated by Charlamagne tha God, the influential Black radio host who has pulled very few punches with Democratic politicians.
She spent the weekend campaigning in North Carolina, attending a Black church in Greenville, N.C., before holding a rally in the community in a part of the state where Democrats are hoping to boost turnout among Black voters.
Obama weighed in last week
Softening of support among Black men could hurt Harris in what is shaping up to be a tight election. Most polls show her and Trump in a dead heat. Last week, former President Barack Obama, the first Black president, said he wanted to ""speak some truths"" about why turnout and enthusiasm for Harris was far behind what he experienced in 2008.
“Part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that,” Obama said.
In response, the Black Men for Trump Advisory Board issued a statement, calling Obama’s remarks “deeply insulting.”
“Black Americans are not a monolith, and we don’t owe our votes to any candidate just because they ‘look like us,’” they said in a statement. “It’s demeaning to suggest that we can’t evaluate a candidate’s track record — especially when Kamala Harris has done more harm than good to Black communities.”
As part of its outreach, the Harris campaign will specifically target Black men in the closing days of the election, her campaign said, with events including partnerships with influential Black males, and talks with Black business owners.

NPR,Republican lawsuits over overseas and military voting hit setbacks in 3 swing states,"Republican lawsuits over overseas and military voting hit setbacks in 3 swing states
Three Republican legal challenges to the legitimacy of ballots cast by U.S. citizens living abroad, including U.S. military members, have hit setbacks this month.
On Tuesday, a federal judge tossed one of three lawsuits that GOP groups filed in swing states in recent weeks. That case was brought by six Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania.
A Michigan state judge dismissed a similar case last week, when a North Carolina judge also rejected the Republican National Committee’s request for the court to order that returned ballots of some overseas voters be set aside and not counted until the voters’ eligibility can be confirmed.
The North Carolina Court of Appeals on Tuesday denied the RNC’s request to block the lower state court’s ruling, and the Democratic National Committee has filed a request for the judge to dismiss the case. The RNC is also in the process of appealing the decision by the Michigan judge, spokesperson Claire Zunk said last week in a statement.
In the Michigan case, Judge Sima Patel of the state’s Court of Claims issued an opinion that underscored the fact that the RNC brought its case weeks before the last day of voting in this fall’s election. Patel called the lawsuit an “11th hour attempt to disenfranchise these electors in the November 5, 2024 general election.”
For years, Michigan has allowed eligible uniformed service members and other citizens living outside the U.S. to vote in federal elections, as required by a federal law known as the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act. Guidance issued by Michigan’s secretary of state says: “A United States citizen who has never resided in the United States but who has a parent, legal guardian, or spouse who was last domiciled in Michigan is eligible to vote in Michigan as long as the citizen has not registered or voted in another state.”
But in court, the Republican National Committee argued against the eligibility of that category of overseas voters, who, the RNC contended, do not meet requirements under Michigan’s constitution for voters to be state residents.
Patel, however, concluded that the guidance language in the secretary of state’s manual for election officials is “consistent with federal and state law, and the Michigan Constitution.”
In the North Carolina case, the RNC made a similar argument against state election rules that allow absentee voting by citizens who were born outside the U.S. and whose parent or legal guardian’s former residence is in the state.
But with “absolutely no evidence that any person has ever fraudulently claimed that exemption and actually voted in any North Carolina election,” Superior Court Judge John Smith wrote in a ruling released on Oct. 21, the court found there is no need for an emergency court order to block that category of overseas voters from casting ballots and to segregate and not process any of their returned ballots.
Smith noted that the election rule the RNC is challenging “has been on the books at least since 2011 as a bill adopted with bi-partisan support,” adding that both sides of this lawsuit “have been involved in elections under the existing statute since its passage without complaint.”
A ruling in a similar federal lawsuit brought by six Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives from Pennsylvania is expected soon.
Many legal experts say these cases are also not likely to go anywhere in part because they were filed after officials started sending out ballots to overseas voters.
But these experts are concerned the cases are laying groundwork for questioning election results.

NPR,"At the site of Trump’s Jan. 6 rally, Harris makes her closing pitch for the campaign","At the site of Trump’s Jan. 6 rally, Harris makes her closing pitch for the campaign
A week before Election Day, Vice President Harris used the spot where her opponent held his Jan. 6, 2021 rally to give a sweeping speech laying out her priorities and excoriating her opponent for his character and past actions.
Delivering the closing argument of her campaign, with the White House illuminated in the background, Harris said it’s time to move on from the divisive and chaotic era of her opponent, former President Donald Trump.
""America: this is not a candidate for president who is thinking about how to make your life better. This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance and out for unchecked power,"" Harris said.
The event was far from any swing state. But it was aimed at creating the kind of big moment that could break through to what campaign operatives call ""low propensity"" voters who aren't usually all that interested in politics — and to convince them to cast a ballot.
More than 40,000 people went through security for the event, Harris' campaign said, with many more outside the perimeter.
Harris highlighted Trump's 'enemies list'
On Jan. 6, 2021, Trump held a rally on the Ellipse, with the White House in the background, telling his supporters to “fight like hell” on the day Congress was meeting to certify that President Biden had won the election.
""Look, we know who Donald Trump is,"" Harris said. ""He is the person who stood at this very spot nearly four years ago and sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol to overturn the will of the people in a free and fair election — an election that he knew he lost.""
In contrast, Harris pledged she would ""seek common ground"" and listen ""to people who disagree with me.""
Responding to Harris' address, Trump's campaign said she was ""lying"" and ""name-calling"" and said she should have done more to address the cost of living and border security as vice president.
""As for President Trump, his closing argument to the American people is simple: Kamala broke it; he will fix it,"" his campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.
Some Democrats have worried Harris’ warnings about Trump are not enough to get across the finish line in a very tight race where voters rank economic concerns as their top priority.
Harris acknowledged voters are still getting to know her
Harris sought to use the speech to recap her promises and values, saying she recognized that ""this has not been a typical campaign"" — a nod to the fact that President Biden sitting in the White House behind her had stepped down this summer from his bid for a second term after a catastrophic debate against Trump.
""I know that many of you are still getting to know who I am,"" she said, describing her middle-class upbringing and career as a prosecutor.
""There's something about people being treated unfairly or overlooked that, frankly, just gets to me. I don't like it,"" she said.
Harris touched on two hot-button issues of the campaign in her remarks — abortion rights and border security.
She sought to separate her policies from those of Biden, saying she would bring her own ideas to the job, and would focus on lowering costs for groceries, prescription drugs, homes, child care and elder care.
""Donald Trump's answer to you is the same as it was the last time: another trillion dollars in tax cuts for billionaires and big corporations, and this time, he will pay for it with a 20% national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported,"" she said, describing Trump's pledge to hike tariffs.

NPR,"In parroting a lie about migrants in Springfield, Ohio, Trump excites extremists","In parroting a lie about migrants in Springfield, Ohio, Trump excites extremists
When former President Donald Trump made a false claim in this month’s debate with Vice President Harris that Haitian migrants were eating pets in Springfield, Ohio, it stunned many who heard it. But perhaps among the most stunned were neo-Nazis, who, for weeks, had been trying to launch that racist lie into the mainstream.
“Whether they're neo-Nazi or white nationalist, all of them [were] thrilled,” said Jeff Tischauser, senior research analyst at the Southern Poverty Law Center. “All of them [were] in almost disbelief that they had a presidential candidate recycle and reuse the rhetoric that has been popular in these movements for decades.”
One group, especially, was celebrating. The Blood Tribe, a neo-Nazi hate group that Tischauser estimates to have between 50 and 80 members nationally, posted to the group’s Telegram channel. The group claimed that it had “pushed Springfield into the public consciousness.”
“When Trump mentioned the pet-eating narrative, Blood Tribe was crowing about it,” said Cass Troy, an extremism researcher who runs an online publication called the Cassandra Report. NPR is using a pseudonym for Troy, because of Blood Tribe’s history of doxing its critics.
“They were delighted,” Troy said. “They take all responsibility for it, even though they don't deserve it.”
Reaching a more mainstream audience
The narrative about pet-eating has been decisively debunked. Even so, it has taken on momentum. Republican Vice Presidential candidate JD Vance has continued to repeat the lie, even after his campaign staff reportedly heard directly from Springfield officials that there was no evidence to support it. Since the debate, the city has fielded dozens of bomb threats against schools and other municipal facilities.
“This fear that's being created in Springfield is something that Blood Tribe is very proud of at this moment,” said Tischauser.
While the exact origin of the false claim is not clear, the Blood Tribe was early in featuring it on its alternative-tech Gab social media account. On August 11, a day after the group marched with swastika flags through Springfield, a commenter on the group’s page suggested that the city’s Haitian residents might eat pets. But on its alternative tech platform pages, the group’s reach has been limited. It wasn’t until EndWokeness, a right-wing account on X, posted about the topic on September 6 that the lie reached a significant audience.
“The concerning thing that's happening is we're seeing a convergence of far right mainstream people having the same talking points as out and proud neo-Nazis,” said Troy.
“I think that one of the things that people need to be cognizant of is anybody who perpetuates this narrative, do they want to be aligned with people like that?” she said. “You know, if you can't separate out your feelings about basic decency when it comes to immigration, maybe you can separate out basic decency when it comes to not being in league with a Nazi.”
Extremists are activated
After Trump amplified the falsehood during the nationally televised event, extremists have stepped up their in-person activities in Springfield. That Saturday, Proud Boys members from several chapters gathered in the city, KKK leaflets were distributed and a white power organization called the Aryan Freedom Network posted flyers on utility poles.
“They're just so much more energized now than I've seen them in a long time,” said Tischauser. “Leaders of the Blood Tribe [and] leaders of other white supremacist groups are excited about the possibility that this is a recruitment boon because of the size of the audience that got this message.”
Tischauser said in some ways that moment in the debate echoed a moment from four years earlier, when Trump told the Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by” during the 2020 election season. Then, leaders from that group responded jubilantly on social media, and the group was launched onto the public radar.
But Tischauser noted that it’s not an exact comparison. Trump’s statement did not directly point to an extremist group. And even though it has energized these groups, Troy said this energy is not about promoting Trump’s candidacy. Instead, she said it’s about capitalizing on a moment where many Americans may be ready to consider their agenda of racial hate.
“They're not playing at politics,” explained Troy. “They're playing at messaging and what's getting traction. They want the idea to move forward. They don't actually care who does it.”",2024-09-24
NPR,Trump rallied at Madison Square Garden in New York days before election,"Trump rallied at Madison Square Garden in New York days before election
Former President Donald Trump rallied in Madison Square Garden Sunday evening — leaving key battleground states and instead spending precious time in liberal New York City for an ""epic event,"" according to the Trump campaign.
The splashy rally itself — in a landmark arena that has played host to superstars, musicians, and political events in the past — threatened at times to be overshadowed by the vitriol coming from the speakers who preceded Trump at the event.
This isn't the first time Trump has rallied in and around New York City. Back in May, during his felony hush-money trial, the former president campaigned in the South Bronx, courting minority voters. Then in September, Trump held another rally in Long Island where he told the crowd, ""We are going to win New York.""
The former president lost his home state by around 23 percentage points during the 2016 and 2020 elections. Current polling averages of the Empire State show Trump is trailing Vice President Harris by around 15 points.
Despite this, the Trump campaign is pouring significant resources and star power into Sunday's rally at Madison Square Garden. Star surrogates like former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (Hawaii), tech billionaire Elon Musk and Trump running mate Sen. JD Vance (Ohio) are all set to speak. They will notably not be in key swing states — the ones that will determine who wins the White House.
Harris, meanwhile, spent her Sunday in a swing state — Pennsylvania — speaking after the sermon at the Church of Christian Compassion in West Philadelphia, and picking up some books at Hakim's Bookstore.
She met with a group of young Black men at PhillyCuts barbershop, and sat in a chair that the barbers called the ""lucky chair"" — they told her that all candidates running for office who sat in it won their elections.
House control via New York
A closer look at the guest list provides political reasons for the Madison Square Garden rally. The list features prominent Republicans House Speaker Mike Johnson and New York Rep. Elise Stefanik.
Back in 2022, Republicans narrowly won control of the U.S. House thanks to a handful of New York districts that elected Republicans — such as Rep. Nick LaLota, Rep. Anthony D'Esposito and Rep. Mike Lawler. These Republicans, who represent districts from Long Island to Syracuse, now face tough races against Democrats this November.
Trump likely won't win the Empire State for himself this year, but the campaign is certainly working hard to keep Republican control of the U.S. House.
Beyond political strategy, the event is gaining attention — a important commodity in the final days of the election. Madison Square Garden also has a storied political past.
In 1936, President Franklin D. Roosevelt gave one of his most important and combative speeches at the New York venue, railing against the establishment. Three years later, 20,000 gathered there for a ""Pro America Rally"" supporting Adolf Hitler in 1939.
And in 1962, Marilyn Monroe sang happy birthday to 45-year-old President John F. Kennedy. In 2004, the Garden hosted the Republican National Convention. Now it welcomes a Republican once again.

NPR,"Poop on Pelosi's desk, a neo-Nazi tiki torch: Mysterious statues are popping up in D.C.","Poop on Pelosi's desk, a neo-Nazi tiki torch: Mysterious statues are popping up in D.C.
It started with the poop desk.
An unusual bronze sculpture appeared on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., last week: a replica of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's desk, topped with her nameplate, a landline phone, Post-it Notes, file folders and a perfectly swirled pile of feces, a la poop emoji.
“This memorial honors the brave men and women who broke into the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021 to loot, urinate and defecate throughout those hallowed halls in order to overturn an election,” reads the plaque on the pedestal below.
The National Park Service granted a permit to a group called Civic Crafted LLC to display the statue until Wednesday evening. NPR has reached out to the woman named in the permit.
According to the permit shared with NPR, the statue is called The Resolute Desk and is meant to represent the heart of democracy.
""Here, the power of the people finds its expression through the diligent efforts of those who serve the public good,"" it says. ""When rioters broke in to destroy these ideals, this desk stands firm, so too must the principles of equality, justice and freedom that it represents.""
The installation stands in direct view of the building that supporters of former President Donald Trump stormed on Jan. 6, threatening the peaceful transition of power and forcing a panicked evacuation of the nation’s leaders.
Four people died at the Capitol that day. A Capitol Police officer who had fought back the rioters died the following day, and several other officers who had been on duty died by suicide in the ensuing months. The riot caused some $1.5 million in damage to the building, and members of Congress have said that some of the participants urinated and defecated inside.
One of them appears to have been Francis Connor, a Brooklyn resident who is among the more than 1,500 people charged so far in connection with Jan. 6.
“I was in the Capitol … And I pooped in pelosis [sic] desk,” Connor messaged a group chat in the days after the insurrection, according to court filings. “Come lock me up there’s nothing to live for if trump isn’t in office.”
He was sentenced in September 2022 to 12 months in prison. Another rioter, an Arkansas man who was photographed propping his feet on a desk in Pelosi’s office, was sentenced in 2023 to more than four years.
Trump was indicted by a federal grand jury in 2023 for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, and investigations by special counsel Jack Smith and the House Jan. 6 committee have concluded that his actions and rhetoric are to blame for the Capitol riot.
But Trump has downplayed the violent assault — and his role in it — during his time on the campaign trail, even calling Jan. 6 “a day of love” at a Univision town hall earlier this month. He has repeatedly spoken highly of the rioters and said he would pardon them if reelected.
“President Trump celebrates these heroes of January 6th as ‘unbelievable patriots’ and ‘warriors,’” the poop statue plaque adds. “This monument stands as a testament to their daring sacrifice and lasting legacy.”
Mike Litterst, the chief of communications for National Mall and Memorial Parks, told NPR via email that permits are required for organized activities in areas administered by the National Park Service to protect park resources and public safety.
""The National Park Service does not consider the content of the message to be presented,"" he added.
The statue drew mixed reactions — and much photographing — from passersby.
Jeff Parcells-Johnson, who biked to D.C. from Alexandria, Va., to check out the statue, told NPR he thinks it's ""a great juxtaposition to what Trump thinks this was"" and just flat-out funny. Kristen Hartke, a trained artist and former D.C. resident — who lived just blocks from the Capitol on Jan. 6 — agrees.
""I think I would interpret the message as being pretty facetious, and clearly that visual that they have with this piece of art is showcasing that,"" Hartke added.
The sculpture appears to have ruffled at least some feathers. Last weekend, just days after its arrival, people noticed Pelosi’s nameplate and some of the letters on the plaque had suddenly gone missing.
Then, on Monday, another statue appeared.
A tiki torch statue rises near the White House
The new statue — which the permit shows was granted to the same group behind the desk — made its debut this week in Freedom Plaza, an area along Pennsylvania Avenue just blocks from the White House.
The bronze-colored statue depicts a fist clutching a tiki torch, an object that took on additional symbolism after white nationalists carried them as they marched through Charlottesville, Va., at the “Unite the Right” rally in August 2017.
The plaque on the 97-inch-tall sculpture, titled The Donald J. Trump Enduring Flame, makes reference to that very event.
“This monument pays tribute to President Donald Trump and the ‘very fine people’ he boldly stood to defend when they marched in Charlottesville, Virginia,” it reads.
White supremacists marched through the University of Virginia’s campus at night, chanting, “Jews will not replace us.” The following day they rallied downtown around a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee, which the city had voted to remove. Clashes between the marchers and counter-protesters quickly turned violent, prompting the governor to eventually declare a state of emergency.
One demonstrator rammed his car into the crowd, injuring dozens of people and killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer. Two state police officers who had been monitoring the scene died in a helicopter crash.
Trump has defended and downplayed the actions of the white supremacists who marched that day, saying in the immediate aftermath that there were “very fine people on both sides.” President Biden repeatedly said on the 2020 campaign trail that it was that moment that had pushed him to return to politics.
Like the poop statue, the tiki torch refers to Trump’s role in an episode of recent history that many consider shameful and that Democrats have tried to use against him as he runs for reelection.
“While many have called them white supremacists and neo-nazis, President Trump’s voice rang out above the rest to remind all that they were ‘treated absolutely unfairly,’ ” the plaque adds. “This monument stands as an everlasting reminder of that bold proclamation.”
“Everlasting” may be a stretch. The permit that the Park Service granted to Civic Crafted LLC only allows the tiki torch to remain in place until Thursday — just days before Election Day.

NPR,Trump's former chief of staff called him a 'fascist.' Harris is campaigning on that,"Trump's former chief of staff called him a 'fascist.' Harris is campaigning on that
Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, who was former President Donald Trump‘s longest-serving chief of staff, called Trump’s leadership style “dictatorial,” “fascist” and lacking empathy in new interviews this week.
Now Vice President Harris — who is trying to peel off moderate Republican voters and independents in key swing states — is seizing on those warnings to bolster her argument that her opponent is a threat to democracy and too dangerous to hold the office.
""So the bottom line is this, we know what Donald Trump wants — he wants unchecked power. The question, in 13 days, will be what do the American people want?"" Harris said, referring to Election Day on Nov. 5.
Kelly, the highest-profile Trump-era official to publicly criticize the former president, said in an interview with The New York Times that Trump ""certainly falls into the general definition of fascist, for sure.""
“Certainly the former president is in the far-right area, he’s certainly an authoritarian, admires people who are dictators — he has said that,” Kelly said in the interview, published on Tuesday.
Kelly — who has not endorsed Harris — also said Trump had been being critical of those disabled, injured or killed while serving in the military.
Trump campaign says Kelly fabricated his stories
In response to Kelly’s comments, Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said Kelly has “beclowned himself with these debunked stories he has fabricated.""
“President Trump has always honored the service and sacrifice of all of our military men and women,” Cheung said.
Harris has sought to capitalize on the slew of former officials who now oppose Trump, holding events with them and urging moderate Republicans to vote for her, instead.
In a town hall with Univision, Trump said that only a “small number” of his former officials have publicly said they won’t support him.
Trump’s former Defense Secretary Mark Esper, Vice President Mike Pence and national security adviser John Bolton are among those who have been critical of Trump’s leadership since leaving office.
According to The New York Times, recent Trump comments about using the military against the “enemy from within” motivated Kelly to speak out against Trump.
The Atlantic also cited reporting that while his chief of staff, Kelly several times corrected Trump on his understanding of Hitler’s rule in Germany as a comparison for how to manage the U.S. military.",2024-10-23
NPR,Pennsylvania county halts hundreds of potentially fraudulent voter registration forms,"Pennsylvania county halts hundreds of potentially fraudulent voter registration forms
Officials in Lancaster County in the swing state of Pennsylvania say they identified hundreds of potentially fraudulent voter registration applications.
""Suspected fraudulent voter registration forms were dropped off at the Board of Elections Office in two batches at or near the deadline for submission,"" the board said in a statement on Friday. ""There are approximately 2,500 voter registration applications total in these two batches.""
It's unclear how many of the applications in the two batches are alleged to be fraudulent.
In its statement, the board stressed that county elections are secure and that flagging the potential fraud indicates the ""systems worked."" Republican-leaning Lancaster County has more than 360,000 registered voters.
The statement said concerns ""were raised during the staff's normal process to review and enter applications into [a state database] and law enforcement was alerted.""
In a news conference Friday with board members, Lancaster County District Attorney Heather Adams said numerous applications appeared to have the same handwriting and other details, like addresses, appeared incorrect on some applications.
Adams said the investigation is ongoing, and wouldn't comment on who may have dropped off the potentially fraudulent forms.
NPR has previously reported that paid canvassing operations have on occasion included fraudulent signatures that were caught.
Friday's announcement followed what officials in Pennsylvania's Bucks County said Thursday was a fake video circulating on social media of county election workers destroying ballots. And across the country, in Colorado's Mesa County, there was news Thursday of another isolated incident: an investigation into alleged voter fraud concerning about a dozen ballots.",2024-10-25
NPR,Why are some Evangelicals drawn to — and sticking by — Trump? This pastor weighs in,"Why are some Evangelicals drawn to — and sticking by — Trump? This pastor weighs in
On a late October evening in North Carolina's capital city, a massive stage in a dark auditorium is backlit by tall screens, and bass-thumping music and vocals are filling the space.
There's a table of judges in front of the stage. Think American Idol but with a clearly religious focus. It's worship team audition night at Cross Assembly Church inside the congregation's nearly 1,700-seat sanctuary on a sprawling, multi-wing campus that resembles a high school or community college.
This Pentecostal church is led by pastor Chad Harvey, whose sermons — often to weekly crowds of about 3,000 — usually feature on Cross Assembly's social media channels. Harvey says only a small part of his job intersects with politics, but there’s no way to completely avoid political discourse.
“If I thought the fate of history depended on the 2024 election, I'd be as anxious as you and popping as many pills you are. Fortunately, I don't believe that stuff,” he said in a sermon posted to social media over the summer. “My hope is in Jesus, not in the politics.”
These days, Evangelical and Pentecostal conservatives are a powerful force in Republican politics. And they have stuck by former President Donald Trump for three presidential elections in a row. In fact, in the closing weeks of a tight race in North Carolina, Trump has been appealing directly to religious conservatives.
In North Carolina, All Things Considered host Scott Detrow sat down with Harvey and talked about all of this — Trump, religion, politics in general — in a small side prayer room on Cross Assembly's campus.
This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.
Interview highlights
Scott Detrow: How much does politics come up in day-to-day conversation when you're talking to people here, when you're talking to people in the congregation, when you're doing your pastoral work?
Chad Harvey: You know, it's very interesting. I think an outsider looking into the Evangelical Pentecostal movement would assume that politics plays a huge role in the life of the church. It actually doesn't. I'd say 1-2% of my conversations are about politics. I think a lot of people are just trying to make ends meet. They're trying to live their lives.
Now, I've told our folks this, you know, our church is accused of being a little bit too political, and I said: “You know, the church is not getting more political, politics is getting more spiritual.” And so we're seeing this infiltration into the political realm of things that used to be the church's territory: family, human sexuality. Now politics is starting to tackle those spiritual issues.
Detrow: How do you think about which candidates you are going to support? Is it through the lens of the issues they support? Is it through how they come across as individuals?
Harvey: What I've told our congregation is we look at the platform, not the person. And so you can have some people with some pretty deep moral struggles who are upholding a platform that we support. And I tell our people, don't pay as much attention to the struggles — pay attention to the platform. Because here's what the Bible says: There's none righteous. No, not one. We're all messed-up people. So whether it be some of the accusations that have been lodged at (North Carolina Lieutenant Governor) Mark Robinson recently, whether it be Kamala Harris and Willie Brown, Donald Trump telling Howard Stern the sexual revolution of the 1970s was “my personal Vietnam” — they're all messed-up people. And so that's the one thing we have to keep in mind as a congregation.
Detrow: Let me just ask the direct question about this with Trump. Donald Trump has such a high support from so many Christians around the country, and yet is somebody who lives in a gold tower with his name on it, who crudely insults people and, among other things, is facing criminal charges. And some people just feel like this is not the message, as I understand it, of Christianity, but there's such a strong support. What's the best way you explain it to someone who says, I just don't understand that?
Harvey: So I would say, again, I keep going back to we're all messed up people. Trump is messed up. Kamala Harris is messed up. Joe Biden has had accusations thrown at him. We're all messed-up individuals. And so I think what I keep coming back to is a lot of people seem to think that we're having a continuous, 24/7 Trump rally in the Evangelical Pentecostal circle. We're actually not. We're well aware of his foibles. We're well aware of where he's messed up. I think the reason Trump is resonating with Evangelicals is this mess aside that we all know about, the platform he's supporting, like it or not, is closer aligned to our view of scripture than the other side.
Detrow: Does that create a world, though, where there's never any accountability for anybody personally?
Harvey: I do think that at some point, there will be a line that's crossed. And so at that point, what I said is, sure, that's fine. Let's just make sure we're using that standard across the board. So, “This candidate did this. I can't support him.” That's fine. Don't support him. The only thing I'm asking is to use that same standard.
Detrow: You mentioned the lieutenant governor, Mark Robinson. I want to ask about that because I think one of the first things that drew us was that he's spoken to Cross Assembly in the past, and you've gotten to know him a little bit.
Harvey: Yeah. Yeah.
Detrow: What do you make of him as a candidate and as a man?
Harvey: You know, as a man, very winsome. I think one thing that drew him to a lot of individuals in our congregation is we have somebody in high political office who's talking our language. I've said many times about Mark Robinson, for every strength is a corresponding weakness. His strength is he's not part of the political system. The weakness is sometimes he talks like a man who's not part of the political system, and maybe he phrases things that make people uncomfortable. But as an individual, I really feel like the values that he espoused from the pulpit really resonated with our biblical worldviews.
Detrow: What I'm hearing is that line hasn't been crossed yet.
Harvey: Yeah. ...He did speak at our church, and I think some people see that and say, well, do you view him as a spiritual leader? Well, no, I don't. He's still a political candidate.
Detrow: I think we've talked about this in pieces here and there, but I want to give you a chance just to directly talk about it in one swoop. What do you think more secular listeners, listeners of other religious persuasions, listeners who live in other parts of the country — what do you think it is they misunderstand the most about congregations like yours?
Harvey: Wow. That's a great question. I would say, again, kind of putting my ear to the ground and seeing what's being said about the Evangelical Pentecostal voting bloc, I think one of the biggest misperceptions is that this is what is dominating our mind. This is what's really driving us. I keep hearing this term, Christian nationalism. That's been the big buzzword in 2024. I've not heard of that until this year that we're just trying to impose our Christian beliefs on this nation and make us a Christian nation. That may be true for other congregations. I don't know that that's true for a large segment of Evangelical Pentecostal Christians.
You know, the Bible says, make it your goal to live a peaceful and quiet life. I think a lot of us just want to have a peaceful and quiet life, be able to share the good news of Jesus Christ. I don't think we're driven by this desire to make America a Christian nation, and I don't think politics really occupies as big a part of our brain as people think it does.",2024-10-29
NPR,BeyHive meets KHive: Beyoncé set to perform at Houston rally for Harris,"BeyHive meets KHive: Beyoncé set to perform at Houston rally for Harris
A key part of the soundtrack of Vice President Harris' race for the Oval Office has been Beyoncé's anthem ""Freedom.""
But on Friday, Queen Bey herself is set to make an appearance on the campaign trail, performing at a Harris rally in Houston, according to a source familiar with the plan, who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of the official announcement.
Trump is also set to be in Texas on Friday — in Austin, taping an interview with podcaster Joe Rogan.
Harris is veering off the swing-state circuit for the event in Houston. While Texas is a solid red state in the presidential race, Harris's campaign wants to highlight the state's abortion restrictions in the closing week of the campaign.
Texas is an unusual stop, but Harris wants to highlight abortion rights
Harris has sought to blame her Republican opponent for the abortion bans — made possible by the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade — because former President Donald Trump named a trio of conservative justices to the court.
During her campaign, she’s highlighted Texans including Kate Cox who have shared stories in ads and speeches about their lives being put at risk because they were denied access to reproductive care.
A new ad from the Harris campaign out this week features another woman, Ondrea, who nearly died from sepsis after being denied access to care from a miscarriage. Ondrea shows the scar from her surgery which goes all the way down her chest; she may not be able to have children. Off camera in the ad, Trump talks about how he sees himself as a “protector” of women.
Trump keeps the focus on immigration
As the Harris campaign focuses on Trump’s record on abortion, the former president has continued to zero in on immigration. In the first of two campaign stops Thursday, Trump spoke to rally goers in Tempe, Arizona, where he repeated his pledge to carry out the largest mass deportation in U.S. history.
“We’re like a garbage can for the world,” Trump said, as he blamed Harris for undocumented migrants coming into the country.
“Kamala’s migrant invasion, given to us through gross incompetence, disqualifies her from even thinking about being president,” Trump said.
Trump was set to hold a second rally later Thursday in Las Vegas.
There’s a tight Senate race in Texas, too
In Texas, Democratic Senate candidate Colin Allred has made the abortion restrictions a centerpiece of his bid to unseat GOP Sen. Ted Cruz.
Allred has hammered Cruz on the issue. Harris’ visit to Texas in the final weeks of the election shows that Democrats feel somewhat optimistic about flipping the seat, despite the fact that a Democrat hasn’t represented the state in the Senate in 30 years.
A bump in turnout from a Beyoncé performance could potentially be effective, according to Brandon Rottinghaus, a professor of politics at the University of Houston.
“The turnout for Democrats across the big urban areas where they need big turnout has been a little bit flat since 2020,” Rottinghaus said. “The Democrats need to have every piece of their voter base come out to vote if Allred has a chance to win.”
Harris walked out to Beyoncé's ""Freedom"" for her very first campaign appearance
Beyoncé gave Harris permission to use her song “Freedom” as her walkout song months ago, but her appearance in Houston — her hometown — is the first time she’s appearing in person with Harris on the trail.
She has backed Democratic candidates in the past, including 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Both Beyoncé and her husband Jay-Z rallied with Clinton in Ohio in the final weeks of her campaign.
Other artists who have recently campaigned with Harris include Lizzo, Stevie Wonder, Megan Thee Stallion and Usher. Bruce Springsteen appeared with Harris on Thursday in Atlanta, and will also campaign in Philadelphia with former President Barack Obama on Monday.",2024-10-24
NPR,"Americans bet $100 million on Trump v. Harris, but at what cost?","Americans bet $100 million on Trump v. Harris, but at what cost?
An election betting advertisement flashed on screen during coverage of former President Donald Trump's rally at Madison Square Garden this weekend on the Right Side Broadcasting Network, a conservative media company.
""Bet on the US election,"" the ad for Kalshi said as Trump spoke on stage. ""Bet $100 on Trump, Get $175.""
More than $100 million have been legally wagered on the presidential race on the platform, days out from Election Day. This explosion in legal betting comes after a federal appeals court earlier this month allowed KalshiEX LLC, an online-betting company, to open an election prediction market.
The company's CEO, Tarek Mansour, told NPR his election market — which shows a 63% chance of Trump winning as of Tuesday — is a ""mechanism for truth"" and help regular people hedge against unpredictable political risk. But critics like Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.) have called the legal decision a ""huge mistake"" that harms American democracy.
Kalshi is still battling federal regulators in court. But retail investing platform Robinhood also started offering bets on election contracts this week. That leaves Americans free to make tens of millions of legal election bets, with little known about how they will impact one of the closest and most contentious presidential elections in decades.
Betting on U.S. Elections
Wagering on the U.S. presidential election is nothing new. Bets on presidential candidates were common during the turn of the 20th century. Betting commissioners in New York City controlled these markets at a place called the New York Curb Exchange.
Not only did bets occur, the markets were fairly accurate during a time before scientific political polls, according to NPR's former gambling correspondent and current editor Keith Romer.
""Of the 15 presidential elections between 1884 and 1940, the betting market correctly calls the race in 11,"" Romer told NPR's Planet Money. ""It's too close to call in three. And they only get one wrong.""
Major papers, like The New York Times, would publish the betting odds as a source of information, Romer said. But in the latter half of the 20th century, during the advent of scientific polling and a number of prohibitive gambling laws, election betting fell out of favor.
In recent years, prediction markets have brought election betting back. On the social media platform X, the Trump campaign, tech billionaire Elon Musk and pollster Nate Silver often post the latest presidential betting odds on Polymarket, an offshore prediction market U.S. citizens can only use illegally.
To date, $2.5 billion has been bet on the presidential election on Polymarket, which also gives the former president a 66% chance of election victory.
Kalshi for the first time gives Americans a legal platform for their wagers, which CEO and co-founder Mansour argued offers voters accurate information, in contrast to political polling.
Rajiv Sethi, a professor of economics at Barnard College who has been studying these markets for years, said the ""jury is still out"" on whether prediction markets are better than traditional political polling — but it's close.
""They generate outputs that are actually quite competitive with the best models,"" Sethi said.
Affecting election outcomes?
Mansour, the CEO, said the goal is to broaden election betting to the general public, similar to the creative financial vehicles that are available to hedge risks for ""high-net-worth individuals"" at investment banks like Goldman Sachs, his former employer.
He gave the example of an environmental company protecting itself against the election of a candidate who proposes slashing climate change initiatives.
""People can now do something about it,"" Mansour said. ""They can reduce their exposure and volatility towards events that they don't really have control over.""
When asked about nefarious betting meant to falsely inflate the odds of a given candidate, Mansour said election markets are ""self-correcting"" because bettors will see an opportunity to make money on an inflated outcome.
""The only outcome is basically — the people who tried to manipulate in the first place lost a lot of money,” Mansour said during an interview conducted when the Kalshi odds mirrored those of public polls.
Mansour admitted election betting isn't a zero-risk proposition, but said Kalshi is federally regulated — meaning regulators would be able to intervene if someone tried to manipulate a market.
""Everything is super transparent and everyone can see anything you do and know your name and your address and what you're doing and the government is monitoring,"" Mansour said. ""It feels like a pretty bad place to try to do any of these things.""
Sethi, the Barnard professor, largely agreed, citing a 2012 case when an anonymous person bet $7 million to increase the odds of then-Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney winning the election, and failed when other gamblers caught on. But Sethi said there still is a potential for manipulation.
""Your belief about whether a candidate is viable, is doing well, is likely to prevail, can affect things like fundraising, support, the enthusiasm, volunteer effort and so on,"" Sethi said. ""These things can actually affect the actual outcome of the election.""
'A huge mistake'
One week from Election Day, the Kalshi market favors Trump by over 30 percentage points — while most political polls show Harris and Trump statistically tied. This misalignment has raised questions about the accuracy of these markets.
Merkley, the Oregon senator, has opposed Kalshi from the start and proposed a bill in Congress to ban all election betting.
""Allowing election betting is a huge mistake,"" Merkley told NPR. ""It turns elections from a place where you exercise your principles to where you exercise your pocketbook. It corrupts our American elections.""
Beyond the moral challenge, Merkley said the law prohibits it. He says it's against Regulation 40.11 from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which prohibits trades on ""terrorism, assassination, war, gaming, or an activity that is unlawful under any State or Federal law."" The CFTC is fighting Kalshi in court.
""Gaming is betting on the outcome of a contest,"" Merkley said. ""An election is a contest. These are not commodities. This is not oil. This is not silver.""
Kalshi's Mansour said he knows election betting comes with a stigma of corruption, but argued the critique doesn't hold water.
""We fought for these markets not because we think they threaten election integrity,"" Mansour said. ""On the contrary, we think they promote it.""",2024-10-29
NPR,Harris brings a bit of Trump into her rally to try to show him as ‘unhinged’,"Harris brings a bit of Trump into her rally to try to show him as ‘unhinged’
ERIE, Pa. — Vice President Harris brought a little bit of her Republican rival into her own campaign event on Monday in a bid to try to make more people pay attention to some of the most extreme threats he has made on the trail.
Saying “Please roll the clip” and pointing to a large video screen, Harris took the unusual step of showing a packed arena of supporters a highlight reel of former President Donald Trump that she said illustrates that he is “increasingly unstable and unhinged.”
The 30-second montage showed Trump repeatedly complaining about “the enemy from within” suggesting they should be jailed — or dealt with violently. Harris’ use of the clips is a sign she plans to ratchet up warnings about Trump in the homestretch.
“He is out for unchecked power. That's what he's looking for,” Harris said, urging people to vote.
The reel takes a page from Trump’s rally playbook
Similarly, Trump has shown reels of Harris at recent rallies — instances of Harris stumbling in interviews, as well as clips of her talking about policies he and his followers oppose. The videos also often fire up his crowds, drawing choruses of boos.
Trump has long used authoritarian language and praised authoritarians, but lately he has gone a step further, saying that police violence could curb crime, and that he would use the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to detain or deport people.
On Fox News on Sunday, Trump was asked whether he thought Election Day would be peaceful. In response, he talked about using the National Guard or the regular military to tamp down issues, specifically issues caused by his ideological opponents.
“I think the bigger problem are the people from within. We have some very bad people. Sick people. Radical left. Lunatics. And it should be very easily handled by — if necessary — National Guard or, if really necessary, by military,” Trump said. Harris used that clip in her montage.
It is unclear what he meant by this, especially since he is not currently president and has no power over the military.
Trump later specifically named Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., who is running for the Senate as one of those “enemies from within.” Trump’s campaign has not responded to NPR requests for details on his comments on using the National Guard or military against U.S. citizens.
It’s part of a strategy to appeal to moderate Republicans and independents
Harris has been making a push to appeal to moderate Republicans and independent voters in states like Pennsylvania where polls show the candidates are essentially tied.
She has said she would reach across the aisle if she wins to put a Republican in her cabinet and would name a bipartisan council to advise her. She has campaigned with former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, and other prominent Republicans have endorsed her as well.
Harris also this weekend released a medical report describing her as being in excellent health. She is using it to draw a contrast with Trump, who is almost two decades older than her – and as a way to raise questions about his rambling speeches.
She has said Trump’s decision to skip a second debate and a CBS 60 Minutes interview show his advisers want to hide him from undecided voters. Trump is slated to do two town halls this week — one with Latino voters on Univision, the second on Fox News on Wednesday with an audience of women.
Meanwhile, Harris will do her first-ever interview with Fox News on Wednesday, taking questions from anchor Bret Baier.",2024-10-14
NPR,What happens when Social Security runs out of money? : The Indicator from Planet Money,"What happens when Social Security runs out of money?
Social Security has thus far been self-sustaining—payroll taxes go into this big fund, which then pays out monthly checks. But the problem we have now is the money coming into that fund is not keeping up with the money going out.
The election hasn't been great for people concerned about the government's finances. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that Donald Trump's election proposals will speed up the rundown in the Social Security fund by a few years.
So, when Social Security runs out of money as it's projected to do ... could we just borrow more money? And if so, what would that mean for the already rising government's debt?
Today on the show, how worried should we be about Social Security and the federal debt? We explain a fresh indicator to assess whether or not America's getting too far in the red.

NPR,New polling finds Harris gaining with a group she has struggled with: Black men,"New polling finds Harris gaining with a group she has struggled with: Black men
Black voters have long been the loyal backbone of the Democratic Party, but polls this year have shown some younger Black men may not feel the same degree of party loyalty that their mothers, sisters or aunts do.
About one in five younger Black men say they support the Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, according to new polling of voters done for the NAACP between Oct. 11-17. The poll of 1,000 registered Black voters had a margin of error of 3.14 percentage poins.
Support for Trump has dropped since August, according to data from the group announced on Monday. But it’s still a warning sign for the Harris campaign, which needs strong turnout from Black men in tight races in swing states and has been working to address this vulnerability.
Harris downplays the concern even as she courts Black male voters
The issue was elevated by former President Barack Obama, who delivered a blunt message to young Black men on Oct. 10 about backing Harris.
Harris has said that she knows she has to “earn” the votes of Black men, just as with any other demographic. But in an interview with The Breakfast Club, a popular Black radio show, Harris dismissed the idea that she has a particular weakness with Black male voters.
“The brothers aren’t saying that,” she said in the interview, which aired Tuesday. She described the issue as a “media narrative.”
“The Black men, in particular, who are at the rallies have recently been saying, 'Don’t you listen to that. And they got to stop with all that noise. We support you,'” Harris said.
Joshua Doss with HIT strategies, the biggest Black-owned political consulting firm in the country, said he thinks the concerns have been overplayed.
“The truth is, Black men are the least Trumpy male voters in America — full stop,” Doss told reporters. HIT strategies conducted the surveys for the NAACP.
The latest survey of registered voters found Black men under 50 have decreased their likelihood to vote for Trump to 21%, down from 27% in August — and increased their likelihood to vote for Harris to 59%, up from 51% in August.
What Harris has been doing on the trail to reach Black voters
Since Obama’s warning, the Harris campaign has been working to get their message out to young Black men, including a town hall with Charlamagne tha God and the Club Shay Shay podcast.
Harris spent much of the day Sunday in Philadelphia courting Black voters — attending church and then later visiting a barbershop to meet Black men, before dropping by a historic Black-owned bookstore in the city.
“The path to victory runs right through all the leaders who are here,” she told a largely Black crowd at a rally in Philadelphia.
Derrick Johnson, the president of the NAACP, said “mis- and disinformation that is circulating on social media” was the biggest challenge in getting young Black voters to the polls.
Johnson noted the median age in the Black community is 32, so many people are getting their news online rather than from traditional news platforms. “Our goal is to try to penetrate that as much as possible,” he told reporters.
The NAACP poll showed that messaging on health care seems to be translating more effectively to Black men in recent weeks, increasing their likelihood to vote.
On Saturday, former first lady Michelle Obama made a direct plea to men — and framed this election as a fight to protect the reproductive rights and healthcare for the women in their lives.
“I’m asking y’all from the core of my being to take our lives seriously — please,” Obama said. “Do not put our lives in the hands of politicians — mostly men — who have no clue or do not care about what we, as women, are going through.”",2024-10-28
NPR,Donald Trump calls Jan. 6 a “day of love.” Here are the facts.,"Donald Trump calls Jan. 6 a “day of love.” Here are the facts.
The 2024 presidential contest may be known as the “Jan. 6 election.”
Former President Donald Trump opened the first rally of his campaign by playing a rendition of the “Star-Spangled Banner” sung by riot defendants in jail — including an accused “Nazi sympathizer” and other defendants charged with assaulting police.
On Tuesday night, Vice President Kamala Harris made what her campaign called a “closing argument” at the Ellipse in Washington, D.C. It’s the same location where Trump spoke on Jan. 6, 2021, and told his supporters to “fight like hell” just before the assault on the Capitol began.
“We know who Donald Trump is,” Harris said. “He’s the person who stood at this very spot nearly four years ago and sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol to overturn the will of the people in a free and fair election.”
The FBI has classified the 2021 attack as an act of domestic terrorism that injured approximately 140 police officers and endangered the country’s peaceful transfer of power. In the immediate aftermath, a bipartisan group of political leaders condemned the violence. “American citizens attacked their own government. They used terrorism to try to stop a specific piece of domestic business they did not like,” said Sen. Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate. McConnell voted to acquit Trump of his second impeachment, but said “There is no question — none — that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day.”
Trump has rejected those arguments, and instead attempted to rewrite the history of the insurrection. He refers to Jan. 6 as a “day of love” and calls the rioters “patriots.” He has repeatedly promised to pardon those charged and convicted in connection with the attack, including those convicted of assaulting police.
With both Trump and Harris focused on the events of Jan. 6, NPR fact-checked some of the campaigns’ statements about that day.
The statement
“There were no guns down there. We didn’t have guns. The others had guns, but we didn’t have guns.” — Trump at a Univision town hall, Oct. 16, 2024
The facts
Court records indicate that, at a minimum, around 20 participants in the attack were armed with firearms, though it’s impossible to know the exact number, because law enforcement made so few arrests that day.
Guy Reffitt, the first person to go to trial for his role in the assault, brought a handgun to Capitol grounds and had an AR-15-style rifle in his hotel room. He belonged to a far-right militia group in Texas and recorded himself telling other Trump supporters on Jan. 6, “every one of my guys are here and I can assure you they came in hot.” He added, “you’re probably standing around more than a million-and-a-half guns right now.”
Among the other rioters who brought guns to Capitol grounds were Mark Mazza, who pleaded guilty to carrying two loaded handguns; Jerod Thomas Bargar, who pleaded guilty to carrying a loaded handgun; Christopher Alberts, a former National Guardsman, who was convicted of assaulting police while dressed in body armor and carrying a loaded handgun; Jason Parsons, who pleaded guilty to carrying a Glock handgun; and Roger Preacher, who pleaded guilty to carrying a .22 caliber handgun.
Federal prosecutors allege that John Banuelos climbed scaffolding outside the Capitol building during the riot and fired his handgun into the air twice. He has pleaded not guilty.
The statement
“Why are they still being held? Nobody’s ever been treated like this. Nobody’s ever. Maybe the Japanese during the Second World War, frankly.” — Trump on the Dan Bongino Show, Oct. 18, 2024
The facts
Trump appears to be referring to the U.S. government’s internment of people of Japanese ancestry after Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor and the country’s entry into World War II.
During the war, the U.S. government forcibly relocated more than 100,000 people living in the country and detained them in “relocation centers” simply due to their Japanese ancestry. The majority of those incarcerated were U.S. citizens. “Living conditions in these makeshift camps were terrible,” according to the National WWII Museum. “One assembly center established at Santa Anita Park, a racetrack in southern California, housed entire families in horse stalls with dirt floors.”
In 1988, Congress formally apologized for internment, saying it was “motivated by racial prejudice, wartime hysteria, and a failure of political leadership.”
By contrast, all of the people locked up in connection with the Jan. 6 attack have been charged with crimes. Federal prosecutors have charged more than 1,500 defendants, and most of them have opted to plead guilty for their role in the riot. In the cases that have gone to trial, prosecutors have an almost perfect record of winning convictions.
NPR’s analysis of the Jan. 6 cases has found that the median sentence imposed by judges is less than a year in jail. In about a third of cases that have reached the sentencing phase, the defendants have received no jail time at all. Enrique Tarrio, the former leader of the far-right group known as the Proud Boys, received a sentence of 22 years in prison, the longest of any Jan. 6 defendant, after being convicted of seditious conspiracy against the United States.
Japanese American leaders have condemned Trump’s remarks about Japanese internment
Filmmaker Sharon Yamato, whose parents were incarcerated as part of the internment policy, told the Associated Press, “Japanese Americans are not and should not be compared to insurrectionists who committed major crimes.”
The statement
“This is a person, Donald Trump, who tried to undo a free and fair election, who still denies the will of the people, who incited a violent mob to attack the United States Capitol and 140 law enforcement officers were attacked, some were killed.” — Harris on NBC News, Oct. 22, 2024
The facts
According to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia, “Approximately 140 police officers were assaulted on Jan. 6 at the Capitol, including about 80 from the U.S. Capitol Police and about 60 from the Metropolitan Police Department.”
Among those injured was Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who was assaulted with pepper spray during the riot. Later that day, he collapsed and was taken to a hospital. He died on Jan. 7, 2021. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Washington, D.C. determined that Sicknick suffered two strokes and died of natural causes, while also noting “all that transpired played a role in his condition.”
Sicknick’s family has blamed his death on the rioters who participated in the insurrection.
“All of you are culpable in Brian's death,” Sicknick’s mother, Gladys, wrote in a victim impact statement as part of the case against one of the men who attacked her son. “All of you bear responsibility for the injuries sustained by Brian's fellow officers — the broken bones, head trauma, and the continuing mental anguish they suffer — and will endure — for the rest of their lives.”
She added, “Lawlessness, misplaced loyalty, and hate, killed my son.”
Gladys Sicknick appeared at the Democratic National Convention along with her son Craig Sicknick.
Two other police officers who defended the Capitol on Jan. 6, Jeffrey Smith and Howard Liebengood, died by suicide in the days immediately after the attack. The Department of Justice formally classified their deaths as “in the line of duty.”
Smith’s wife Erin told NBC News, “I knew from the beginning that Jeffrey died in the line of duty from the injuries he suffered on January 6th.”
Attorney General Merrick Garland spoke about Liebengood in January at an event for a foundation set up in his memory.
“Officer Liebengood defended the United States Capitol, the people inside, and our very democracy on January 6,” said Garland. “He lost his life in the line of duty.”",2024-10-29
NPR,"Rudy Giuliani ordered to turn over NYC apartment, 26 watches to Georgia election workers","Rudy Giuliani ordered to turn over NYC apartment, 26 watches to Georgia election workers
Rudy Giuliani must turn over sports memorabilia and other prized possessions to two Georgia election workers who won a $148 million defamation judgment against him, including his New York City apartment, more than two dozen luxury watches and a 1980 Mercedes once owned by movie star Lauren Bacall, a judge ruled Tuesday.
But U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman in Manhattan also said Giuliani does not have to give the election workers three New York Yankees World Series rings or his Florida condominium — for now — noting those assets are tied up in other litigation.
The property Giuliani must relinquish is expected to fetch several million dollars for Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea ""Shaye"" Moss. They won the $148 million judgment over Giuliani's false ballot fraud claims against them related to the 2020 presidential election. They said Giuliani pushed Donald Trump's lies about the election being stolen, which led to death threats that made them fear for their lives.
Under Tuesday's order, Giuliani must turn over within seven days his Manhattan apartment, estimated at more than $5 million, as well his interest in about $2 million that he says Trump's 2020 presidential campaign owes him for his services.
Also on the list of assets that must be given to Freeman and Moss are a 1980 Mercedes-Benz SL 500 previous owned by Bacall, a shirt and picture signed, respectively, by Yankees legends Joe DiMaggio and Reggie Jackson, a signed Yankee Stadium picture, a diamond ring, costume jewelry and 26 watches, including a Rolex, five Shinolas, two Bulovas and a Tiffany & Co.
In court documents filed earlier this year, Giuliani estimated the worth of the Mercedes at about $25,000, and the watches, World Series rings and costume jewelry at about $30,000. He said the value of his sports memorabilia was unknown.
One of those watches was given to Giuliani by his grandfather and he asked that he be allowed to keep it because of its sentimental value. But Liman rejected the request, saying Giuliani could have had it exempted if he had proven it was worth less than $1,000 — but he did not do so.
“The Court also does not doubt that certain of the items may have sentimental value to Defendant,” the judge added. “But that does not entitle Defendant to continued enjoyment of the assets to the detriment of the Plaintiffs to whom he owes approximately $150 million. It is, after all, the underlying policy of these New York statutes that ‘no man should be permitted to live at the same time in luxury and in debt.’”
Liman wrote that Freeman and Moss would be allowed to sell off the property and “ensure that the liquidation of the transferred assets is accomplished quickly.”
Giuliani had asked the judge to bar Freeman and Moss from selling any of his assets until after his appeal of the judgment is completed. Liman also rejected that request, saying Giuliani could have asked the federal court in Washington, D.C., where Freeman and Moss won their case, to stay any asset sales pending his appeal, but he did not.
Giuliani hasn't yet paid anything to the women who won the defamation suit against him
Giuliani's lawyers, Kenneth Caruso and David Labkowski, said in a statement Tuesday night, ""Stay tuned. When the judgment is reversed in the Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C., these Plaintiffs will be required to return all this property to Mr. Giuliani. We repeat, stay tuned.”
To date, Giuliani has not paid Freeman and Moss anything.
""We are proud that our clients will finally begin to receive some of the compensation to which they are entitled for Giuliani's actions,"" Aaron Nathan, a lawyer for Freeman and Moss, said in a statement. ""This outcome should send a powerful message that there is a price to pay for those who choose to intentionally spread disinformation.""
As for the World Series rings, Giuliani's son, Andrew, filed court documents earlier this month saying he actually is the rightful owner. He said his father gave him four rings — one for each of the Yankees' championships in 1996, 1998, 1999 and 2000 — as gifts in 2018. Rudy Giuliani received the rings during his tenure as mayor of New York City. The younger Giuliani's claim is pending in federal court in Manhattan.
Freeman and Moss also asked Liman to order Rudy Giuliani to turn over his condo in Palm Beach, Florida, estimated to be worth more than $3 million. But that property is tied up in other litigation, with Giuliani claiming it should be exempt because it is his primary residence. Freeman and Moss have a lien on the Florida property.
Liman said he would take up the Florida condo at a hearing set for Oct. 28, and he barred Rudy Giuliani from selling the property or taking any action that would diminish its value.
After the $148 million verdict, Giuliani filed for bankruptcy, which froze attempts by Freeman and Moss to collect the award. But a judge in July threw out the case citing repeated ""uncooperative conduct,"" including a failure to comply with court orders and disclose sources of income.",2024-10-22
NPR,Appeals court sides with GOP on Miss. law that provides grace period for mail ballots,"Appeals court sides with GOP on Miss. law that provides grace period for mail ballots
A conservative U.S. appeals court has sided with Republicans in ruling against a Mississippi law that allows election officials to count mail ballots that are postmarked by Election Day but arrive after it.
The ruling by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals — which covers Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas — is not in effect immediately, and the judges sent the issue back to a lower court for further consideration. The decision is likely to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
In its ruling Friday, a panel of all Trump-appointed 5th Circuit judges reversed a lower court ruling and wrote that the acceptance of ballots ends on the “election day” designated by Congress.
“Text, precedent, and historical practice confirm this ‘day for the election’ is the day by which ballots must be both cast by voters and received by state officials,” the court wrote. “Because Mississippi’s statute allows ballot receipt up to five days after the federal election day, it is preempted by federal law.”
The judges declined to grant Republicans’ initial request for an injunction, sending the issue back to the lower court for “further proceedings to fashion appropriate relief, giving due consideration to 'the value of preserving the status quo in a voting case on the eve of an election.' ”
The GOP argument against ballot grace periods
The Republican National Committee, along with the Trump campaign, has filed multiple lawsuits in various states ahead of this year’s general election aiming to disqualify ballots that arrive after Election Day.
Roughly 20 states plus Washington, D.C., accept and count mail-in ballots that are received after Election Day. (Many states require that those ballots be postmarked on or before Election Day.) States provide these grace periods in case voters forget to return their mail ballots in a timely manner, if there are issues with the postal service, or if there are other unforeseen issues like bad weather and natural disasters.
The GOP has argued, however, that states don't have the right to decide when to stop accepting ballots.
Conor Woodfin, who represented the Republican Party during oral arguments at the 5th Circuit, told the court that “the meaning of Election Day is not up to the subjective views” of individual states.
“For decades after Congress established the uniform national Election Day, those words meant the day that ballots are received by election officials,” he said.
Republicans also argued in their lawsuit that mail voting disproportionately hurts them because “voting by mail is starkly polarized by party.”
“For example, according to the MIT Election Lab, 46% of Democratic voters in the 2022 General Election mailed in their ballots, compared to only 27% of Republicans,” they wrote in their challenge. “That means the late-arriving mail-in ballots that are counted for five additional days disproportionately break for Democrats.”
This legal challenge in Mississippi is part of a larger effort from the GOP, including in the swing state of Nevada, aimed at invalidating certain mail ballots.
Democrats say the GOP cases don’t reflect “modern reality”
Democrats have called these particularly legal challenges “fringe lawsuits” that are aimed at sowing distrust in elections.
Joyce Vance, a professor at the University of Alabama School of Law, said the lawsuits are part of an effort by the GOP to “make it more difficult for some kinds of Americans” to cast a ballot.
“The RNC is really trying to set up a possible rule for the future where only ballots that are cast and counted on Election Day count,” she told NPR. “And that might have been great in the 1800s when farmers were going to market on a Tuesday and casting their ballots while they were in town, but it doesn't reflect the modern reality where we have early voting days and have mail-in voting days precisely to accommodate the fact that not everybody can get away during normal business hours on a Tuesday to vote.”
Vance said removing grace periods for mail ballots disproportionately affects members of the military and their families — particularly those who live overseas — as well as people with disabilities or an illness.
“So, all sorts of folks who are fully entitled to vote [would] get disenfranchised by a rule that would cut off ballot counting on Election Day itself,” she said. “I think the principle advancing is this effort to really make it more difficult for some kinds of Americans to vote.”
Caren Short, the director of legal and research for the League of Women Voters of the United States, said in a statement that states should be making “voting more accessible to voters—not less.”
“When a state makes voting available via absentee ballot, it must not disqualify voters who follow the rules and cast their ballot by having it postmarked by election day,” she said. “Our democracy is stronger when all votes are counted, regardless of how you decide to vote.”
Vance said this case is likely to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, where it is “anyone’s guess” whether the court will hear the challenge — and whether the case would be settled before this year’s election ends.",2024-10-25
NPR,"As war in Gaza fractures Democrats, Republicans see an opening with Jewish voters","As war in Gaza fractures Democrats, Republicans see an opening with Jewish voters
Jewish voters have been a reliable voting bloc for Democrats for decades, but the war between Israel and Hamas has complicated that relationship.
As Vice President Kamala Harris faces continued pressure from progressives in the Democratic Party to cut off military aid to Israel, some Republicans see an opportunity to win over Jewish voters in key states.
“Israel is in, literally, the fight for its existence,” former Minnesota Sen. Norm Coleman, now the national chairman of the Republican Jewish Coalition, told a room of supporters at a country club in suburban Detroit on Monday. “The existence of the Jewish state is at risk today — both in terms of war and battle … as well as what happens in the United States in terms of whether our support is there unequivocally or whether folks are gonna step back.”
Some in the audience wore red kippahs — a symbol of their Judaism — with the word “TRUMP” printed on one side.
Sheila Weissman, from nearby West Bloomfield, stood outside the event clutching several yard signs, including one that read “Kamala — Oy Vey.”
“It’s been a tepid response at best by this administration,” Weissman said about antisemitism in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas-led militants. The attack killed 1,200 people in Israel, according to the Israeli government. Israel's military response has killed at least 43,000 Palestinians in Gaza, according to the Gaza Ministry of Health.
As a swing state voter, Weissman said she’s concerned about war in the Middle East and antisemitism at home.
A report released by the Anti-Defamation League — using an expanded definition of antisemitism to include some anti-Zionist language — found a record number of those types of incidents in the year since the Hamas attacks, including thousands surrounding left-wing anti-Israel demonstrations.
Weissman said she thinks those realities could reshape voting patterns among Jewish Americans, who’ve historically sided overwhelmingly with Democrats.
“October 7th changed things,” Weissman said. “The things that happened in this country on college campuses, I mean, it's just really terrifying.”
Weissman has heard the claims that former President Donald Trump has condoned antisemitic rhetoric. But she thinks his words are sometimes taken out of context. And she likes his record on Israel, including his decision to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem.
The RJC is investing $15 million in the 2024 campaign, in an effort to win over Jewish voters in swing states through ads, canvassing and other outreach. The group is highlighting Trump’s record of support for Israel, including efforts to normalize relations between Israel and some of its Arab neighbors through the agreement known as the Abraham Accords.
RJC CEO Matt Brooks says it’s the organization’s largest investment in a campaign ever, in part because he sees this year as a likely “inflection point” for Jewish voters.
Many Jewish Democrats are still supporting Harris
Michigan State Sen. Jeremy Moss, a Jewish Democrat, says Jewish voters are concerned about antisemitism across the political spectrum, but he believes they ultimately will support the Democratic nominee as most have in the past.
“Kamala Harris has held the line against these extreme voices that spout off antisemitism when discussing this Israel conflict on the far left right now,” Moss said.
Moss — who has criticized Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a fellow Democrat, over her remarks about Israel — said Harris has struck the right tone when it comes to the conflict. Harris has repeatedly said she believes Israel has a right to defend itself from threats across the region, and has called for bringing Israeli hostages home and protecting Palestinian civilians.
“But then you look at the other side and Donald Trump platforms anti-Semitic extremism in the Republican Party on the far right,” Moss said.
Moss said most Jewish voters also align with Harris on other key issues, including abortion rights — which has become a major focus of the Democrats’ closing message to voters across the country.
Recent polls from the Jewish Democratic Council of America suggest those numbers are holding steady. But some others, including one from the conservative Manhattan Institute, suggest what the organization’s report characterized as “growing cracks in that support.”
Alan Cooperman, director of religion research at the Pew Research Center, says small religious groups are difficult to poll accurately.
“I think honestly, nobody knows,” he said. “Nobody knows whether the Jewish vote is different in this election from past presidential elections.”
Jews make up only around 2% of the United States population, but many live in swing states including Michigan, Arizona and Pennsylvania — and even small groups can make a difference in a close election.
At a Harris campaign event on Monday in the critical state of Pennsylvania, second gentleman Doug Emhoff reiterated the vice president's commitment to supporting Israel and fighting antisemitism. Emhoff, who himself is Jewish, reminded the crowd of the anniversary this week of the deadly mass shooting attack on a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018.
“When Kamala is President, she will continue to stand with Israel and with the Jewish community — our community,” Emhoff said. “She will reject anti-Semitic hate and the notion that Israel does not have the right to exist.”",2024-10-29
NPR,Texas attorney general's statement rejects supporters of death row inmate's appeal,"Texas attorney general's statement rejects supporters of death row inmate's appeal
The Texas attorney general is refuting claims by critics who say a death row inmate was unjustifiably convicted in the death of his toddler child.
In the Wednesday night statement posted online from his office, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said he released the original autopsy report and other records about the case of Robert Roberson to rebut the ""lies"" from state Reps. Jeff Leach and Joe Moody.
Paxton is a Republican, while Leach is also a Republican and Moody is a Democrat.
Roberson was convicted for the 2002 death of his 2-year-old daughter, Nikki Curtis. He has maintained his innocence since his trial. Prosecutors argued at the trial that the child's death was caused by head trauma from being violently shaken. Roberson's attorneys, however, maintain that the bruising on the girl's body was likely due to pneumonia, not child abuse.
It was eventually revealed that the child had pneumonia at the time of her death, and now state legislators and activists are claiming the accusation that she died from being shaken is “junk science.”
Roberson was scheduled for lethal injection last Thursday, but the procedure was postponed in the minutes leading up to the execution after the Texas House issued a subpoena for Roberson to testify in court.
Critics of Roberson's conviction say Texas Senate Bill 344, which states that convictions can be challenged if they were reached due to incomplete science, was not properly applied in Roberson’s case.
Paxton called the defense's “eleventh-hour, one-sided, extrajudicial stunts that attempt to obscure the facts and rewrite his past.”
In the statement that was also released on X, Paxton's office provided the original autopsy report and a 2016 letter from the medical examiner who conducted the autopsy. Both documents say the child died from blunt force head injuries.
Paxton said Roberson had a history of sexually and physically abusing Curtis and her mother. She was sent to the hospital in 2002 with a handprint on her face and bruises on her shoulder, face, ears and the back of her head, he said.
The Dallas Morning News, however, cited one of Roberson's attorneys in rejecting Paxton's claims. ""Tonight, a profoundly disturbing thing happened: The chief law enforcement office of the State of Texas, the OAG, issued a stunningly misleading statement designed to quash a bipartisan group of lawmakers in their truth-seeking mission, which has riveted the world,"" said Gretchen Sween in the Morning News' report.
Roberson’s legal team is fighting with Paxton about whether Roberson will be able to testify in person or virtually. House committee members argue that Roberson’s autism and the decades he spent in solitary confinement would make online communication difficult for Roberson. But Paxton says it is dangerous to let Roberson in the state capitol building.
“A few legislators have grossly interfered with the justice system by disregarding the separation of powers outlined in the State Constitution,” Paxton’s office said. “They have created a Constitutional crisis on behalf of a man who beat his two-year-old daughter to death.”",2024-10-24
NPR,Colleges are key to Democrats' strategy to lose by less in rural Pennsylvania,"Colleges are key to Democrats' strategy to lose by less in rural Pennsylvania
INDIANA, Pa. — The leaves on the trees were turning shades of red, orange and yellow as longtime resident Lynne Alvine sat on a bench in the heart of campus at Indiana University of Pennsylvania.
While watching student organizers set up for a Get Out The Vote rally, the county’s local Democratic party committee chair made a bold statement.
“The road to the White House goes through Indiana County, Pennsylvania,” she declared.
But this campus lives within a ruby-red county, one that went for former President Donald Trump by more than 37 points in 2020 and just under that in 2016.
Alvine understands that. Winning isn’t the goal. Instead, it’s to slightly narrow the margins – a state-wide strategy in rural areas that worked for Democratic Sen. John Fetterman during his campaign in 2022 and one that Vice President Harris and the Democratic party are trying to replicate.
“Our motto is: lose by less,” she said. “We don't imagine that we can win the vote for Harris in Indiana County, but we can bring out enough Democratic votes.”
Which includes driving up turnout on campus and getting young voters engaged.
“I think we bring the energy to counties like this,” said graduate student Andrew Muth, 24, who helps lead the school’s College Democrats.
“Together, we will knock on doors. We'll do joint phone banks. We will focus primarily on the campus because we know, and the county knows and the state knows, that a path to victory in Pennsylvania is campuses, driving up the numbers in addition to rural voters,” he added.
Four years ago, though President Biden won Pennsylvania by less than two percentage points, voters under 30 sided with him by a whopping 27-point margin. That’s support Muth hopes to repeat for Harris.
But being from a small town himself, less than an hour away from campus, Muth also understands the history Democrats have in getting their message out to the community here.
“In 2016, a lot of rural voters felt like the government wasn't working for them and that they were being left behind,” he recalled. “I want them to know that Democrats see you and we care about your future,"" Muth continued. ""We want you to be able to build a family … We want you to be able to afford your groceries. We want you to be able to afford housing.”
The Harris campaign is working to increase their vote shares in rural areas of the state, opening 50 offices coordinated with the Democratic party, 16 of those in counties that Trump won by double-digits four years ago.
Harris has also been dropping millions on targeted advertising in the state. Since August, the campaign and outside supporting groups have spent nearly $60 million in areas outside of the Pittsburgh and Philadelphia media markets, according to AdImpact.
That’s in addition to Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, making visits to a handful of small cities and towns across the state. Last month, Harris visited Johnstown., a small city east of Pittsburgh in Cambria County, where nearly seven in 10 voters supported Trump in 2020.
“There are a lot of people in Pennsylvania who deserve to be seen and heard,” Harris said. “That's why I'm here in Johnstown. And I will be continuing to travel around the state to make sure that I'm listening as much as we are talking.”
Trump has campaigned in many of the same spots, as well as in Indiana County, a place Harris has not visited.
During that appearance on IUP’s campus, Trump focused on the rural identity and, as is characteristic of his campaign, fear of immigrants.
“You live in a small town your whole life. You pay your taxes. You really are exemplary. You pay everything. You do everything. You love your town. You love your country. You know the town so well by name. You're just so proud of it,” Trump said.
“And suddenly, [Harris] flies in thousands and thousands of migrants from the most dangerous places on earth, and they deposit them right smack in the middle of your community,” he added, without evidence. In the case of Indiana County, Pa., in particular, just 1.8% of the population is foreign-born, according to U.S. Census data.
But the Democrat’s rural strategy is not a concern, argued Kush Desai, Trump’s Pennsylvania communications director.
“Reaching out to voters and canvassing them is important, but that only works when you have a candidate and a message that are a winning candidate and a winning message,” Desai said.
“When it comes to things like [the] economy and immigration, Harris is not the candidate of change,” he added. “The issues that we're running on, if anything, have a greater salience in rural Pennsylvania and rural America writ large.”
At a coffee shop on the edge of IUP’s campus, those are the topics shaping 22-year-old graduate student Keely McKlveen’s vote for Trump.
“It's kind of a philosophy of voting for the lesser of two evils amongst the parties,” said McKlveen, who commutes to school each day from the neighboring county, making common purchases like gas a concern.
When weighing Harris as an option, McKlveen said she was put off by the Democratic nominee’s inability to differentiate herself from the current administration and acknowledge missteps over the last four years.
“That's kind of pulled me away from her in a sense,” she said. “I will say Trump could be a better communicator just because he's very loud, which polarizes our people. However, he is very clear on what he stands for.”
Back at the rally, other students continue to side with Harris in large part over social issues, especially abortion rights, which the vice president has made a key issue in her campaign.
That’s the case for 20-year-old Samya Settles, who had moved a few feet away from the crowd with some of her friends as the last few speakers finished up.
“I'm always an advocate for someone having their own right to their body and who they love and what medical decisions they should make,” she said. “That's definitely a huge factor that's causing me to vote.”
While Harris has repeatedly emphasized her proposed economic platform, she’s kept issues like safeguarding abortion access central to her outreach. It’s a topic that has motivated young voters to turn out in recent elections, notably the 2022 midterms.
Compared to Biden, Harris has had increased support from younger voters since taking over the Democratic ticket. It’s something Settles resonated with, explaining she feels more connected to her.
“I would say I still feel that. And I think it really is because of … her age. She really does know how to connect with the young people,” she said. “She is us.”",2024-10-29
NPR,"Georgian president won't recognize parliamentary election result, calls for protest","Georgian president won't recognize parliamentary election result, calls for protest
TBILISI, Georgia — Georgia's president said Sunday she did not recognize the results of this weekend's parliamentary vote, which election officials say was won by the ruling party, adding that the country fell victim to a ""Russian special operation"" aimed at moving it off a path toward Europe.
Standing alongside opposition leaders, President Salome Zourabichvili urged Georgians to rally Monday night on Tbilisi's main street to protest what she called a ""total falsification, a total stealing of your votes,"" raising the prospect of further political turmoil in the South Caucasus nation.
She spoke the day after an election that could decide whether Georgia embraces Europe or falls under the sway of Russia.
""This election cannot be recognized, because it is the recognition of Russia's intrusion here, Georgia's subordination to Russia,"" Zourabichvili said.
The Central Election Commission said Sunday that the ruling party, Georgian Dream, got 54.8% of Saturday's vote with almost all ballots counted.
Georgian Dream has become increasingly authoritarian over the past year, adopting laws similar to those used by Russia to crack down on speech. Brussels suspended Georgia's EU membership process indefinitely because of a Russian-style ""foreign influence law,"" passed in June. Many Georgians viewed Saturday's vote as a referendum on the opportunity to join the European Union.
The election campaign in the South Caucasus nation of 3.7 million people, which borders Russia, was dominated by foreign policy and marked by a bitter fight for votes and allegations of a smear campaign.
Zourabichvili suggested ""Russian elections"" were held in the country, and said ""technology was used to whitewash counterfeiting. Such a thing has never happened before.""
European electoral observers said the election took place in a ""divisive"" environment marked by intimidation and instances of vote buying, double voting and physical violence.
During the campaign, Georgian Dream used ""anti-Western and hostile rhetoric ... promoted Russian misinformation, manipulations, and conspiracy theories,"" said Antonio López-Istúriz White, the head of the European Parliament monitoring delegation.
""Paradoxically, the government further claimed that it was continuing Georgia's European integration,"" he added.
The conduct of the polls, he said, is more evidence that points to the ruling party's ""democratic backsliding.""
President of the European Council Charles Michel said he called on Georgia's officials to ""swiftly, transparently and independently investigate"" the electoral irregularities and called on the ruling party to demonstrate its ""firm commitment"" to the EU.
Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze, who is a member of Georgian Dream, on Sunday described his party's victory as ""impressive and obvious,"" and said ""any attempts to talk about election manipulation ... are doomed to failure.""
Hungary's Victor Orbán was the first foreign leader to congratulate Georgian Dream and will be the first foreign leader to visit Georgia and meet the prime minister when he visits the capital for a visit Monday and Tuesday.
Georgian electoral observers, who were stationed across the country, also reported multiple violations and said the results do not reflect ""the will of the Georgian people.""
In the capital Tbilisi, Tiko Gelashvili, 32, said, ""The results that were published are just lies and rigged.""
Initial figures suggested turnout in the vote was the highest since Georgian Dream was first elected in 2012.
The United National Movement opposition party said its headquarters were attacked on Saturday while Georgian media reported two people were hospitalized after being attacked outside polling stations.
""The most important question is whether or not these elections will be recognized by the international community,"" said Natia Seskuria, executive director of the Regional Institute for Security Studies in Tbilisi. Georgia's ""economic and political prospects"" hinge on the election, she said.
Georgians have a complex relationship with Russia, which ruled it from Moscow until Georgia gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Russia and Georgia fought a short war in 2008, and Moscow still occupies 20% of Georgia's territory.
Despite that, Georgian Dream has adopted Russia-style laws and many Georgians fear the government is distancing the country from the West and into Moscow's orbit.
The election observers said instances of intimidation and electoral violations were particularly noticeable in rural areas.
Georgian Dream scored its highest share of the vote — polling almost 90% — in the Javakheti region of southern Georgia, 135 kilometers (83 miles) west of the capital. In Tbilisi, it got no more than than 44% of the vote in any district.
Javakheti is predominantly agricultural and many people are ethnic Armenians who speak Armenian, Russian and limited Georgian. Before the election, the AP traveled to the region where voters suggested they were instructed how to vote by local officials. Several questioned why Georgia needed a relationship with Europe and suggested it would be better off allied with Moscow.",2024-10-28
NPR,Voting officials face an 'uphill battle' to fight election lies,"Voting officials face an 'uphill battle' to fight election lies
Last week, a video began circulating on X, formerly Twitter, purporting to show a person in Pennsylvania ripping up ballots marked for former President Donald Trump and leaving alone those marked for Vice President Harris.
The person curses the former president multiple times and at one point says, “Vote Harris.”
The video is a fake. The envelopes and ballots shown don’t match what that county actually uses to vote. U.S. officials said it was created and spread by Russia to sow doubt in the election.
But the incident showed what has been clear for some time now: Online in 2024, the deck is stacked against voting officials, maybe even more so than in 2020. The phony video was viewed hundreds of thousands of times shortly after it was posted. A statement from Bucks County debunking it three hours later was shared on X fewer than 100 times.
“They're fighting an uphill battle,” said Darren Linvill, co-director of Clemson University’s Media Forensics Hub, which tracks election influence campaigns. “I'm sure that they often feel like they're trying to put their finger in the dike before it bursts.”
Linvill traced the video back to a Russian propaganda operation, first identified by Clemson, that has also spread faked videos targeting Harris and her running mate Tim Walz in recent weeks.
With less than a week left of voting, the election cycle has entered a fraught stage in which rumors, misleading claims and conspiracy theories are surging. And election administrators, intelligence officials and researchers don’t expect that to end when polls close. They are bracing for what is expected to be a contentious period of counting and certifying votes, in which discord fueled by foreign and domestic sources could be corrosive to democracy.
Perhaps the biggest factor is former President Donald Trump, who continues to falsely assert he won the 2020 election, despite courts and investigations finding no evidence of fraud. He has already set the stage to reject the results should he lose again this year.
“If I lose — I’ll tell you what, it’s possible. Because they cheat. That’s the only way we’re gonna lose, because they cheat,” Trump said at a September rally in Michigan.
Despite the lack of evidence, his claims have been embraced by many Republicans and eroded confidence in voting among a wide swath of Americans.
“We’ve already set the standard that you are allowed to doubt the results on Election Day,” said Linvill. “And that just doesn’t bode well.”
America’s geopolitical adversaries — particularly Russia, Iran and China — are expected to seize on election fraud claims, however unfounded, and generate their own material undermining the results, as part of their larger goals to sow chaos and discredit democracy.
Officials charged with safeguarding voting say they’ve learned and are applying many lessons from 2016 and 2020 — but are also confronting a new set of challenges this year, including advances in artificial intelligence that make it easier and cheaper to generate realistic but fake images, video, audio and text, and the emergence of X owner Elon Musk as a leading Trump surrogate, donor and amplifier of election fraud conspiracy theories.
“Going into the 2024 election cycle, we are arguably facing the most complex threat environment compared to a prior cycle,” said Cait Conley, who oversees election security efforts within the Department of Homeland Security’s cyber agency, in an interview with NPR.
Foreign powers seize on divisive issues
To meet that heightened risk, government officials are counting on transparency and warnings to help Americans gird themselves against manipulation.
Federal intelligence and law enforcement officials are taking a more aggressive approach this year in calling out foreign meddling. It’s a stark difference from 2016, when the Obama administration was reticent to make public information about the full scope of Russia’s efforts favoring Trump until after the election.
This year, Russia is angling to boost Trump, as it did in the previous two presidential elections, while Iran is trying to undermine the former president, the intelligence community and private sector researchers say. China is targeting down-ballot races but does not appear to have a preference in the presidential race. All three regularly seize on divisive issues, from immigration to abortion to Israel’s war in Gaza, to exacerbate discord among Americans. And they’ve all experimented with using AI to churn out more misleading content.
“Our adversaries know that misinformation and disinformation is cheap and effective,” said Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., who chairs the Senate intelligence committee, in an interview with NPR.
The federal government moved quickly to publicly attribute the fake Pennsylvania ballot video to Russia the day after the video first appeared on X — a notably rapid turnaround for intelligence and law enforcement officials. And they warned they expect more such fakes in the coming days and weeks.
In September, the Justice Department seized web domains it says Russian operatives used to spoof American news outlets and spread fake stories, indicted employees of Kremlin-backed broadcaster RT in a scheme to fund right-wing pro-Trump American influencers, and brought criminal charges against Iranian hackers accused of targeting the Trump campaign.
DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the FBI have issued joint public service announcements alerting Americans to tactics foreign actors might use to discredit the election, including ransomware attacks or falsely claiming to have hacked voter registration systems.
Officials say, so far, there’s no sign that foreign adversaries have breached any election or voting systems. But attackers don’t have to succeed in order to undermine confidence, Conley, the election security expert, said.
“While these things like a [distributed denial of service] attack or ransomware could be disruptive to the elections process, it's not going to undermine the security or integrity of the vote casting or counting process,” Conley said. “But our adversaries may try to convince the American people otherwise.”
At all levels of government, the message is consistent: Turn to the people running local elections for authoritative voting information.
“What we are really trying to encourage them to do is to know that it is your state and local election official that is the signal through that noise,” Conley said.
And local election officials are making more of an effort than ever before to seek out media attention and educate the public on their processes. State election officials in a number of swing states have started holding multiple press conferences per week leading up to Nov. 5.
“It's really important for us to get the message out there first and be as proactive as possible,” said Isaac Cramer, who runs elections in Charleston County, S.C.
Partisan and splintered realities
The very subject of election “disinformation” itself has been turned into a partisan fight. A coordinated Republican legal and political campaign to cast efforts to mitigate or track the spread of falsehoods online as “censorship” has undercut the work of government agencies, online platforms and researchers, and driven one institution out of the field.
Last month, Warner wrote an open letter urging CISA to do more to help state and local governments identify and respond to election misinformation and disinformation campaigns, and to coordinate communications between the government, tech companies and researchers.
“The government needs to get this information out as quickly as possible, because literally the stakes are nothing less than our democracy,” Warner told NPR.
Cramer, the election official in South Carolina, said one challenge for local governments dealing with false information online is how splintered the internet is. He’s recently started seeing a lot more wrong voting information on NextDoor, for instance.
“We can't possibly have eyes on every platform and see everything that is being posted,” Cramer said.
Increasingly election officials are thinking outside the box to reach voters, because trying to fight fire with fire on social media has felt like a losing battle for years now, says Carolina Lopez, a former election official from Miami-Dade County, Fla.
“Election officers around the country spend a whole lot of time producing content for social media, and it always kills me when I see, like, three likes and it's usually themselves, their [spokesperson] and their mom,” said Lopez, who now runs the Partnership for Large Election Jurisdictions. “Election officials are trying to figure out, ‘Well, what else can I do to be heard?’”
In Montgomery County, Pa., Neil Makhija fashioned a voting ice cream truck to travel his county and help people vote. Cramer, in Charleston County, co-wrote a children’s book. Derek Bowens, in Durham County, N.C., created an app that could deliver accurate election information directly to people there.
The world’s richest man’s megaphone
One of the loudest voices elevating unverified rumors and outright falsehoods about the 2024 election also controls a major communications platform. Musk, the world’s richest man, took control of Twitter two years ago and has remade the site, now called X, into a pro-Trump megaphone.
Musk has become a major vector for baseless claims that Democrats are bringing in immigrants to illegally vote for them — a conspiracy theory Trump and other Republicans have embraced and are using to lay the groundwork to claim the election was stolen should he lose.
When election officials try to correct Musk’s false claims, he has lashed out. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson told CBS News that she and her staff received threats and harassing messages after Musk called her a liar when she fact-checked his claim that the state has more registered voters than eligible citizens.
Musk has also shared AI-generated content on X without disclosure, including images and videos of Harris doing and saying things she didn’t.
Musk’s America PAC is inviting users to share “potential incidents of voter fraud or irregularities” on an “Election Integrity Community” on X that has 13,000 members. The feed is filled with allegations that voting machines are switching votes from Trump to Harris and posts casting doubt on the security of mail-in ballots — both frequently debunked narratives in 2020 — as well as copies of the fake Bucks County video.
Danielle Lee Tomson, research manager at the University of Washington’s Center for an Informed Public, said such “evidence generation infrastructure” is more robust this year. Even when these efforts identify real issues with voting, they tend to ignore the checks in the system that catch problems, she said.
“If you see something seemingly suspicious, and then you take a picture of it and post it online, that can be decontextualized so quickly and not take into account all of the various remedies or the fact that there's nothing suspicious there at all,” she said.
Local election officials are making their processes more transparent than ever this year, including livestreaming counting facilities, and welcoming record numbers of election monitors. But such openness is a double-edged sword: Video feeds provide more material for content creators who may use it to push their own narratives of malfeasance — such as the false claims against Georgia election workers amplified by Trump in 2020. That leaves officials operating with the knowledge that their every move will be scrutinized.
“We try to not commit unforced errors,” said Stephen Richer, the Republican recorder in Maricopa County, Ariz., who has been an outspoken debunker of election lies. “But at the end of the day, if somebody really wants to make something look weird, I think they can do it, unfortunately.”
Social media steps back
In 2020, major social media platforms proactively boosted election officials as authoritative sources of information, made misleading posts about voting less visible, and added warning labels to false claims. Now, Musk has cut most of X’s team policing the platform and removed many guardrails against false and misleading content.
X is the most glaring example, but other platforms have also backed away from the more aggressive stance they took in 2020, cut back on the number of people working on trust and safety, and are generally more quiet about the work they are doing. Meta now lets Facebook and Instagram users opt out of some features of its fact-checking program, while its text-based social network, Threads, has deemphasized news and politics.
Warner told NPR he’s concerned social media platforms have stepped back at a time when threats, including from AI-generated content, are more urgent.
“Think about the devastating effect it’d have if somebody uses an AI image of what looks like an election official somehow destroying ballots or, you know, breaking into a drop box,” he said. “That kind of imagery could literally spark violence in a close election after the fact and again undermine Americans’ confidence in our system.”
In the face of that landscape, election officials say they are controlling what they can control. They have spent countless hours reaching out to skeptical voters over the past four years, and they’re now clinging onto hope that work will make a difference in people's willingness to accept election results.
Michael Adams, the Republican secretary of state of Kentucky, is hoping the novelty of election denial will start wearing off as well.
“For a while there, every six months, they'd come up with a new conspiracy theory. It would be debunked. They'd have egg on their face. They go back in their hole for six months and then come back,” Adams said. “You only get so many bites at that apple.”",2024-10-29
NPR,"With much at stake, labor unions knock on millions of doors in final campaign push","With much at stake, labor unions knock on millions of doors in final campaign push
As November 5 draws closer, labor unions are blanketing swing states with tens of thousands of canvassers, deploying far more resources than in past elections in a bid to get the labor-friendly ticket of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz elected.
Some of the outreach is directly targeting union workers, active and retired, who along with their household members make up an estimated one in five voters in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, according to the AFL-CIO.
The American Federation of Teachers has sent hundreds of its members from New York to Pennsylvania and from Illinois to Wisconsin to canvass “labor doors.” The United Auto Workers has similarly deployed union members to fellow members’ homes and work sites, in addition to an aggressive phone, text and mail campaign.
""When members hear directly from other members about what’s at stake and which candidate will have their backs, we’re able to break through,"" said UAW president Shawn Fain in a statement.
In Philadelphia and surrounding suburbs, the hospitality union UNITE HERE is going beyond union members, focusing primarily on Black and Latino voters in working-class communities, whom the union has identified as least likely to vote. The union says it's deploying some 2,000 canvassers across ten states in 2024, a five-fold increase from 2016.
""Some Latinos know nothing about Kamala,"" says Wernel Martinez, a hotel worker from Orlando who was hired by UNITE HERE to knock on doors in Pennsylvania.
Meanwhile, the Service Employees International Union, whose 2 million members include many health care workers, has set a goal of knocking on a million doors in the final four days of the election alone.
A study in contrasts
While both presidential candidates have been trying to woo the working class, their views on unions and labor law and regulations could hardly be farther apart. Harris has said she will strengthen unions, including by passing the PRO Act which would make it easier for workers to organize. As president, Donald Trump sought to weaken unions, going as far as stripping federal employee unions of power and voicing support for Right to Work laws, which allow workers to opt out of paying union dues.
While the Biden administration enacted rules to expand overtime to millions more workers, Trump in public remarks has admitted as a business owner, he hated paying overtime and would hire more people to avoid having to do so, a comment the AFL-CIO has highlighted as part of its voter outreach.
With such a contrast, it's no surprise that most major labor unions were quick to endorse Harris after she entered the race in July. However, there are some notable exceptions, including the Teamsters. Its leadership declined to make an endorsement following an internal survey that found members prefer Trump over Harris by a 2-to-1 margin, and meetings with both candidates that left union leaders unsatisfied. After the non-endorsement, many of the Teamsters' regional and local branches announced their own endorsements of Harris.
“People want to talk to somebody like them”
As part of the AFL-CIO’s massive canvassing effort, Skylar Goodman, a political organizer with the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, has been knocking on doors in every corner of Philadelphia since July, some days averaging five to seven miles on foot.
“People want to talk to somebody like them,” says Goodman, who grew up in northeast Philadelphia, helping out her father, a tow truck driver, in the summers.
Earlier in the campaign, she'd strike up conversations on issues specific to unions — such as union jobs created under legislation championed by the Biden-Harris administration — and on broader issues like abortion.
She would zero in on Trump's record, pointing to his picks for the U.S. Supreme Court, which led to the overturning of Roe vs. Wade, and policies he enacted while in office that diminished the power of unions, many of which were rolled back by the Biden administration.
“It's like all this cleanup work was done and then a tornado is going to run through it all again” should Trump win, Goodman has warned.
But the persuasion phase of this campaign is largely over. Now, it’s all about making sure people have a plan to vote.
Pennsylvania was decided by just 44,000 votes in 2016, and just over 80,000 in 2020, so buttoning up even a handful of votes matters. But even in blue Philadelphia, it’s not the easiest thing.
People don't want to talk politics, but they'll whisper
On a recent weekday morning, a lot of people aren’t home, and the few who come to the door don’t want to share whom they’re voting for.
“Some folks are more worried about how people in their life are going to react to their decision,” says Goodman. “People will whisper it at me. They won't come out and have a conversation, but they’ll whisper, ‘I’m a Democrat. I’m voting for Harris.’”
That fear of being at odds with neighbors and family members is one reason Goodman has chosen to spend so much time talking with voters this election.
“We can disagree,” she says. “We don't need to get angry with each other because we don't see things the same way. We all live different lives. Of course, we're going to see it different.”
Union polling finds outreach is swaying voters
With less than a week to go until the election, unions say their collective campaigning is making a difference, even if the ground game remains challenging.
Last week, the UAW released a poll of 800 UAW members and households in key swing states. It found Harris holding a 29-point lead over Trump among those who reported hearing from the UAW about the election, compared to just a 6-point lead among those who said they’d not heard from their union.
“These numbers highlight the effectiveness of the union's aggressive strategy to inform members about the candidates' positions on key economic issues, including protecting overtime pay, overhauling harmful trade deals, preventing offshoring, expanding retirement security, and taking on corporate greed,” the UAW said in a statement.",2024-10-29
NPR,Supreme Court allows Virginia to purge individuals from voter rolls,"Supreme Court allows Virginia to purge individuals from voter rolls
Just six days before Election Day, the Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed Virginia to continue its purge of more than 1,600 individuals from the state's voter rolls.
The vote was 6 to 3, along ideological lines, with liberal Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissenting.
On Aug. 7, exactly 90 days before Election Day, Virginia’s Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin signed an executive order expediting the removal of noncitizens from the state's voter rolls. The state maintained that the program only removed those who were ineligible to vote due to lack of citizenship.
In early October, the Justice Department and advocacy groups sued, contending that the state had in fact purged at least some eligible voters and that it did so in violation of a federal law that bars systematic removals from voting rolls in the 90 days prior to an election. Specifically, the 1993 National Voter Registration Act creates a “quiet period” within 90 days of a federal election. During those 90 days, states are prohibited from “systematic[ally]” removing “ineligible voters” from the rolls because of the increased possibility of errors.
The challengers alleged that Virginia's voter purge did exactly what the federal law was aimed at preventing; it removed eligible voters who, as a result of the state's action, did not know they were no longer eligible to vote.
A federal district court agreed, ordering Virginia to restore the approximately 1,600 voter registrations that were cancelled. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that order. Virginia then appealed to the Supreme Court, asking the justices to allow the state to strike the voters purged in the 90 days prior to the election.
The state contended that the lower courts “misinterpreted the NVRA.” They argued that the “quiet period” cannot apply to noncitizens, since they are already ineligible to vote. Even if the “quiet period” did apply here, the state argued, the program was sufficiently individualized, not systematic.
On Wednesday, the Supreme Court sided with Virginia, leaving the purged voters off the rolls and allowing the purge to continue.
In a statement, Youngkin called the order ""a victory for commonsense and election fairness.""
The significance of court's the ruling is more a matter of the signal it sends than how the court's action will effect the election in Virginia, where polls show Vice President Harris well ahead of former President Trump. The signal it sends is that if a majority of the justices had an appetite for election appeals like this one, they almost certainly will have an appetite for election appeals from more contentious states in the coming days and weeks.",2024-10-30

NPR,Philadelphia DA sues Elon Musk over $1 million giveaway to registered voters,"Philadelphia DA sues Elon Musk over $1 million giveaway to registered voters
On Monday, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner asked a state judge to stop Elon Musk’s $1 million giveaway to registered voters, calling the scheme “indisputably an unlawful lottery.”
Krasner brought the suit against Musk and his political action committee, America PAC.
“America PAC and Elon Musk are running an illegal lottery in Philadelphia (as well as throughout Pennsylvania),” the suit said.
“In other words, America PAC and Musk are lulling Philadelphia citizens – and others in the Commonwealth (and other swing states in the upcoming election) – to give up their personal identifying information and make a political pledge in exchange for the chance to win $1 million. That is a lottery.”
Musk announced the cash prize to voters in Pennsylvania during a stump speech earlier this month in support of former President Donald Trump.
“I have a surprise for you,"" Musk said shortly before bringing out a giant check. ""We are going to be awarding $1 million to people who have signed the petition — every day, from now until the election.”
Almost immediately, the promise of a cash prize caught the attention of election law experts, who warned that incentivizing a person to vote violates federal law.
""If you look at the conditions, you must be a registered voter,"" UCLA election law professor Richard Hasen told NPR. ""And so this is essentially a lottery that's open only to people who register to vote. So it’s either an incentive for someone to vote or it’s a reward. And either way, it violates federal law.""
Several people in key swing states have already reportedly won the cash prize from signing the petition, which purports to support the constitutional promises of free speech and the right to bear arms.

Musk has fashioned himself as perhaps one of Trump’s most powerful allies in his second swing at returning to the White House.
The billionaire Tesla and SpaceX head, estimated to be the wealthiest man on the planet, launched America PAC as its sole donor with a $75 million cash infusion this summer.

NPR,Pennsylvania voters are complicated. We drove around the state talking to them,"Pennsylvania voters are complicated. We drove around the state talking to them
With 19 electoral votes, Pennsylvania is the largest battleground prize — meaning the road to victory most likely runs through here.
Just days before the election, both Vice President Harris and former President Trump are barnstorming the state to rally support. The state was decided by about a percentage point in 2020, and the vote expected to be close again.
To see how the candidates' messages are resonating, Morning Edition hosts Michel Martin and Steve Inskeep each led teams across Pennsylvania, stopping in Pittsburgh, Gettysburg, Allentown, Philadelphia and other towns to talk with voters.
The Pennsylvanians we met reflect a divided electorate. Some are voting for Harris, inspired by her vision that they say represents stability for them and because they want to see a woman as president. Others are voting for Trump because they believe in his economic policies and promises. And a few weren’t so sure about either candidate.
These are some of the people we met along the way.
At a fracking wastewater disposal site outside Pittsburgh, Ben Wallace shared his frustrations with industry regulations and why he’s voting for Trump.
We met Wallace at a site in New Kensington owned by Penneco Environmental Solutions, where he serves as its chief operating officer. Large tanker trucks full of recovered water used during fracking drove onto the site as we spoke. The water is treated and injected deep under the earth’s surface — a controversial practice due to concerns about water contamination.
Wallace denies that the practice is unsafe and doesn’t believe in human-caused climate change. He argues that industry regulations added over decades have led to hundreds of thousands in additional costs to his business and he believes Trump would be friendlier to the industry.
“This is kind of an argument I give to environmental activists all the time. Show me the industry. You know, you are in the Saudi Arabia of natural gas right now,” Wallace said. “You are standing here and you don't see the industry anywhere.”
Wallace helps lead a political action committee that runs billboard ads supporting Trump and said his support of the former president goes beyond his work.
He backs Trump because of what he believes are American values, which he explained as “The right of self-determination, the right to be a Christian nation, the right to determine your own outcome, the right to be free of government interference.”
A few miles west, Rose Faust, who spent 20 years in a ceramics factory and is now president of her local union chapter, believes Harris could “bring peace back to this country.”
Faust said she’s tired of seeing so much division in the country, and she feels that the country electing a woman of color is the kind of change the U.S. needs.
She began working in manufacturing to support her three daughters after a divorce. She worked the job until her body couldn’t handle it. She eventually needed surgery on both elbows. Though insurance has gotten more expensive, she still credits the union’s strong bargaining for previous health benefits. Her three daughters are all college graduates now.
Ahead of the election, Faust is knocking on doors of union members, both active and retired, to encourage them to vote. She said many of the older, retired members acknowledge that the union helped obtain many benefits they enjoyed during their working days.
Faust said she reminds them that President Biden signed into law the Butch Lewis Act, designed to protect their pensions, and that it only passed the U.S. Senate when Vice President Harris cast a tie-breaking vote.
“They take their union and their retirement seriously,” Faust said. ‘They’ll say ‘Hey, we’re Democrat no matter what. We know how we got our jobs. We know who took care of us all these years.’”
But others dismiss her sales pitch. Some members support Trump, voicing their concerns about immigrants and asylum seekers.
Faust is baffled by the lack of empathy for those fleeing violence and seeking better lives. Their struggles resonate deeply with her; she was born into a troubled family and grew up in foster care.
“I would open my home to anybody. Somebody opened their home to me years and years ago. Had that not happened, where would I have been? I could have been on the streets too, you know,” Faust said.
In Rankin, U.S. Steel worker William Timbers asked to meet at Styles Unlimited, a barber shop in this predominantly Black borough he described as “the country club in the hood.”
He has worked for U.S. Steel for nearly three decades and is active in the local union. For him, this work represents the American dream, which is why he supports the U.S. Steel’s sale to Nippon Steel of Japan. He, like others we spoke to in this economically depressed area, believes the sale could save jobs.
But neither candidate is winning him over on this issue that directly affects him because they both oppose the sale. He was truly an undecided voter, but that didn’t mean he was without his views on the election or planned to sit out like he did in 2020.
“One candidate ain’t always going to line up with everything you believe in, so I got to go with the pros and cons,” Timbers said. “As of right now, I haven't made a choice. And everybody saying, ‘you haven't made a choice? You’re the last person in Pennsylvania’”
Timbers is concerned about Trump saying the country needs to have “one really violent day,” as a way to deter theft and property crime. “Violence begets violence,” Timbers said.
He added that, as a Christian man, what he loves about Trump is his pro-life stance — which was part of why he voted for him in 2016.
As for Harris, Timbers described her as “independent and strong on her views and her values and. I believe she may be a good candidate.”
Could he vote for a pro-choice candidate, we asked?
He stopped, smiled, chuckled and took a deep breath.
“That's a hard question,” Timbers said. “Yes, I could. If when you go through the checklist, if the checks is more pros than cons, I could.”
After a couple of days in the Pittsburgh area, we drove to Gettysburg, where just a few miles away from the historic battlefield, we met Korean War veteran Jack Powell.
Powell, who has lived here for 42 years, describes himself as a ""firm believer in America"" and is backing Trump.
“We’re going backwards. I mean, 15 million immigrants coming in here,” Powell said. “God knows where they're at. New York City's got one square block right now where you don't dare go because they're fighting each other.”
Estimates show that closer to 6 million migrants have entered the country under Biden without authorization or have been paroled into the U.S. under various programs.
Powell, who gets most of his news from the local Gettysburg Times — and YouTube — has just one big concern about his candidate:
“I wish he’d keep [his] mouth shut sometime, but then again, we all get our mouths in trouble.”
Next door, Matthew Nell shares a front lawn with Powell, where the Harris-Walz law sign he planted stands in contrast to his older neighbor’s Trump 2024 sign.
Nell, a local college student who has done voter outreach for Harris and other Democrats, lives with his parents and grandparents. His minivan displays a bumper sticker in support of Pennsylvania U.S. Sen. John Fetterman.
The 22-year-old said he’s concerned about the effect of misinformation and disinformation on democracy. He worries about how false stories and conspiracy theories spread easily online and make their way around the country and the world.
“We are more connected than ever and it's leading us to more division than ever,” Nell said. “There has to be a way we can change education in a way that will allow for people to have more individuality within this sea of information [and] to have informed opinions that are closer to reality.”
On the eastern side of the state, NPR journalists met Norberto Dominguez. The son of two Dominican immigrants said he’s voting for Harris.
Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, Dominguez moved to Pennsylvania in 1974, becoming a leader in Allentown’s emerging Latino community, which now makes up more than half the city’s population. He founded HALA, the Hispanic American League of Artists, to support Latino artists and preserve Latin culture.
“In speaking with folks, you see this wave of change within communities of color, and the conversations have been really fascinating at the barbershops in the different places that I visit and talk to people,” Dominguez said. We met Dominguez at a roundtable discussion NPR organized with local voters.
He’s fascinated by the way his community is engaging in politics at this moment.
“They are listening to everything, but they're also paying attention to what they're seeing from a body language perspective and then what they can repeat and translate from Spanish to English,” Dominguez said.
He said the language Trump uses is “embarrassing” and that he couldn’t repeat, or even translate, some words and ideas at the dinner table with his family.
“Some Latinos that were kind of leaning towards Trump, are kind of backing away because they can't say what he's saying at the kitchen table,” Dominguez shared. “There's this embarrassing factor that's affecting our community. And so it's hard to defend him when he's offending us at the same time.”
For this reason, Dominguez said Harris will win the election.
Jeffrey Opp, the only Republican who joined NPR’s Bethlehem roundtable, is voting for Trump.
After listening to others express support for Harris, Opp took a sip of water, sat up straight and said, “I'm a Republican. Yes, I'm voting for Trump.”
A few ‘humphs’ and slight grunts were audible at the table, but Opp sat patiently as everyone spoke. He responded to any questions directed at him, including why he’s voting for Trump.
“Track record,” he said, “We had four years of Donald Trump, you look at the economics, we were stronger in the world. Then you look at four years of Biden-Harris — high inflation, no job creation, the economy isn't as good as it was. And we're weaker in the world.”
Some participants chimed in when Opp spoke, and there was a brief argument. But when the conversation ended, he shook everyone’s hands, hugged a few, and stood smiling for a picture with the whole group.
In nearby Allentown, we met José Rivera, who was tight-lipped about who he voted for in the last election – and who he’s backing this year.
We met Rivera at La Cocina Del Abuelo, a Latino-owned restaurant on a busy street where cars strolled by blasting bachata.
Rivera was born in New York City, where he was involved in gang activity at a young age. In an attempt to get him away from that lifestyle, his mother moved him to Allentown. But she couldn’t keep him from it, and he got involved in gang activity in the new city and was incarcerated several times. Years later, at age 52, he’s a leader in his community.
Slim, tall and with slick-back hair, he sat and ate among several vocal Harris supporters, but didn’t hesitate to criticize her campaign.
“I can say the messaging on both sides has been horrible,” Rivera said. “When someone [campaigning for Harris] calls the house and says — vote for us because you don’t want a convicted felon in the White House. [I say] hold up, I'm a convicted felon.”
He said he doesn’t feel completely welcomed by either campaign.
“I might not like him [Trump], but now you’re pushing me towards him,” Rivera said. “Because if he can win the White House, I can go for City Council, I can go for mayor, it opens up doors.”
Although he said he has something in common with Trump, he did not say who he would vote for come November.
Alfa Lopez sat at the same table with Rivera. She has complicated feelings about both candidates.
Lopez, a local Latino radio personality, sat at the table across from Rivera. Though she nodded when others’ spoke positively about Harris, she expressed the need to make an informed decision.
“I don’t want to make a mistake — or just be like, ‘Oh, she’s a female, she’s Black.’ You have to study her and you have to study every candidate.”
Like Rivera, Alfa didn’t say who she would vote for, or give any indication of which candidate she’s leaning toward. But she’s confident about one thing:
“My honest opinion, I don’t think the United States in general is ready to have a female. And that being said, I think Donald Trump is gonna win.”
Yasmine Hamou of Philadelphia has already cast her vote — and she’s cautiously hopeful of witnessing history again.
We met Hamou, 27, at Rittenhouse Square, where police sirens and car horns echoed. Streets were closed because Harris was in town.
“She’s right over there,” Hamou said, smiling and looking in the direction of where the sound was loudest.
Hamou recalled knocking on doors with her mother for then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2008 around Gettysburg and nearby Hanover and staying up way past her bedtime to watch him declare victory.
“I just remember the excitement and the energy, even in such a conservative place, [about] this historic moment,” Hamou said. “It was one of the most powerful things I’ve ever done…I’ve been chasing that feeling ever since.”
Now working on voter outreach for Philadelphia’s Working Families Party. Hamou is focused on engaging with Democrats and independents.
As the daughter of a Black mother from the south and an Egyptian immigrant father, she’s inspired by Harris’ accomplishments as a woman of color.
“I know how difficult it is when you speak up in the workplace. You have to work 10 times as hard to get half the result as your white peers,” Hamou said. “When I was voting for her, I got a little emotional because I couldn’t believe I was seeing her name.”
But she’s not without reservations about the vice president. Hamou would’ve liked to hear Harris take a firmer stance against Israel’s actions in Gaza, including an arms embargo. She believes, however, that a vote for Harris is still progress and could yet lead to a more peaceful resolution than under Trump.
“The number one thing we need to do is block white supremacy and the far right,” Hamou said. “Anchoring myself in that, and being grounded in knowing that, is how we get progressive wins and we can build a future that we want to see.”

NPR,Judge continues to block Florida from threatening TV stations over abortion ads,"Judge continues to block Florida from threatening TV stations over abortion ads
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — A federal judge who recently chastised Florida officials for ""trampling"" on free speech rights continued to block the head of the state's health department from taking any more steps to threaten TV stations that air commercials for an abortion rights measure on next week's ballot.
U.S. District Judge Mark Walker extended a temporary restraining order, siding with Floridians Defending Freedom, the group that created the ads promoting the ballot question that would add abortion rights to the state constitution if it passes Nov. 5.
Walker handed down the decision from the bench after hearing arguments from attorneys for the campaign and state officials. The order extends a previous one that bars State Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo from taking any further action to coerce or intimidate broadcasters that run the commercials.
Walker said extending the temporary restraining order will give him more time to rule on the preliminary injunction that the abortion rights campaign is requesting. The order will run through Election Day and expire on Nov. 12, unless the judge rules before then.
The group filed the lawsuit after Ladapo and John Wilson, who was then the top lawyer at the state health department before resigning unexpectedly, sent a letter to TV stations on Oct. 3 telling them to stop running an abortion rights ad, asserting that it was false and dangerous. The letter also says broadcasters could face criminal prosecution.
The ad at issue features a woman named Caroline Williams who said Florida's current law — which bans most abortions after six weeks — would have barred her from getting the procedure that her doctors said was needed to extend her life, after she was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer in 2022. Her providers wouldn't go forward with her cancer treatment while she was still pregnant.
An attorney for the state argued that the claims made in the ad are dangerously misleading and could put Floridians at risk if they don't seek out medical care because they believe all abortions in the state are banned.
Spreading ""false information about the availability of lifesaving medical services"" is not protected by the Constitution, attorneys for the state wrote in legal filings.
At Tuesday's hearing, attorney Brian Barnes compared the FPF ad to a hypothetical commercial that falsely claims the state's 911 system has shut down, creating a public health emergency.
""We see this case as being controlled by the same legal principles that would apply for the 911 hypothetical,"" Barnes said.
An attorney for FPF maintains that ""the ad is true,"" and that it features a Florida resident describing her own medical circumstances in her own words.
Lawyer Ben Stafford argued that robust free speech protections are vital for a functioning democracy, especially in matters where there are clear disagreements on difficult moral and religious issues like abortion.
""What the First Amendment does is leave matters like that to the public marketplace of ideas,"" Stafford said, ""not the whims of a government censor.""
The decision Walker handed down on Tuesday extends an Oct. 18 order barring state officials from ""trampling"" on the free speech rights of those they disagree with.
""The government cannot excuse its indirect censorship of political speech simply by declaring the disfavored speech is 'false,'"" the judge said in the previous order.
He added, ""To keep it simple for the State of Florida: it's the First Amendment, stupid.""
Tuesday's hearing is the latest development in an ongoing fight between advocates for abortion rights and officials in the administration of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has waged his own state-funded campaign to block the ballot measure.
If approved by 60% of Florida voters, the constitutional amendment would protect the right to an abortion until fetal viability, considered to be somewhere past 20 weeks. The measure would override current state law, which bans most abortions after six weeks, before many women know they're pregnant.
In the weeks leading up to the election, DeSantis has held taxpayer-funded, campaign-style rallies with doctors and religious leaders to advocate against the proposed amendment. Four state agencies have set aside millions of dollars in public funds to create their own commercials railing against the abortion measure and another proposed constitutional amendment that would legalize recreational marijuana use in the state — a move that critics say violates a state law that bars government officials from using their public office for electioneering.
At a media event in Naples on Tuesday, flanked by doctors advocating against the ballot measure, DeSantis claimed that providers who say state laws bars them from performing an abortion on patients in medical distress are ""totally lying"" and should lose their medical licenses.
The Associated Press and other news organizations have reported cases of Florida women being denied care for a miscarriage or nonviable pregnancy, despite the risk of serious complications, because providers feared legal repercussions if the patient's life wasn't deemed sufficiently in danger.
""Any suggestion, advertisement, anything to suggest that Florida law in any way prevents a physician from caring for anybody in Florida, for women, for pregnant mothers, is a lie,"" DeSantis said.
The AP previously reported a Florida case in which a doctor admitted state law had complicated emergency pregnancy care.
""Because of the new laws ... staff cannot intervene unless there is a danger to the patient's health,"" a doctor at Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, Florida, told an investigator who was probing the hospital's failure to offer an abortion to a woman whose water broke at 15 weeks, well before the fetus could survive.",2024-10-30
NPR,Trump tells Jewish voters they have 'no excuse' for supporting Harris,"Trump tells Jewish voters they have 'no excuse' for supporting Harris
Former President Donald Trump is casting himself as Israel’s ""protector"" and warning Jewish voters against supporting his rival, Vice President Harris.
Trump addressed the Israeli-American Council summit in Washington, D.C, on Thursday, during an evening focused on commemorating the October 7 attacks that sparked Israel’s war with Hamas.
Speaking to a mostly friendly crowd, Trump touted his past support for Israel and, without providing evidence, claimed that the Jewish state will soon cease to exist unless he’s elected.
“It’s total annihilation — that’s what you’re talking about,” Trump said. “You have a big protector in me. You don’t have a protector on the other side.”
Trump also accused Harris of “pandering” to Hamas supporters and said ""Jewish people have no excuse"" for supporting his Democratic rival. The Hamas attack on October 7 killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took more than 200 hostages, including some American citizens. Since then, health officials in Gaza say more than 40,000 Palestinians have died. Harris has said that she will support Israel’s right to defend itself while also calling the suffering in Gaza “devastating.”
Trump repeatedly reiterated his past criticisms of the majority of Jewish voters who’ve historically supported Democrats.
“Anybody who’s Jewish and loves being Jewish and loves Israel is a fool if they vote for a Democrat,” Trump said, telling Harris supporters, “You should have your head examined.”
The remarks have sparked pushback from Jewish groups
In a thread on X, Amy Spitalnick, CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, called on Trump to, ""Stop labeling those who don't support you as crazy or disloyal,"" and accused him of playing into antisemitic tropes that will ""lead to (more) violence against Jews.""
In a statement, Jonathan A. Greenblatt, CEO & National Director of the Anti-Defamation League, echoed the concern.
""Preemptively blaming American Jews for your potential election loss does zero to help American Jews. It increases their sense of alienation in a moment of vulnerability when right-wing extremists and left-wing antizionists continually demonize and slander Jews,"" he said, adding that Trump's comments could ""spark more hostility and further inflame an already bad situation.""
Spitalnick also criticized Trump's statements about immigrants from the Middle East, and his pledge to reinstate the policy known as the ""Muslim ban"" by refusing refugees from countries he described as ""terror-infested areas like the Gaza strip.""
Spitalnick wrote: ""If the antisemitism wasn't enough, he coupled it with full-on Islamophobia & racism.""
From the stage, Trump also told a story about a moment that shaped his understanding of domestic politics surrounding Israel. During his early days of campaigning for the Republican nomination, during a visit to Iowa in 2015, Trump said he was speaking to a group of “very religious Christians.”
Trump said he was surprised when his host encouraged him to “say something good about Israel.”
“I said my, my, my, how things have changed,” he said.
Trump went on.
“And I said, ‘We love Israel; we will save Israel; and we will fight with Israel,’ and the place went wild. I said, ‘What the hell is going on?’” Trump said. “They love Israel. I hate to say it, sometimes they love Israel much more than Jewish people in New York love Israel.”
Trump's remarks were the latest in a long history of accusing Jewish Democrats of being disloyal to Israel.
Polls suggest that while a majority of Americans as a whole express support for the Jewish state, white evangelicals are among the most supportive groups. American Jews overwhelmingly say Israel’s reasons for fighting Hamas are valid, although younger Jews are more divided in their opinions about Israel’s response to the October 7 attack.
Many Jewish voters in the audience expressed support for Trump
Perri Finkelstein, a 33-year-old American-Israeli dual citizen who lives in Israel, told NPR that her top voting priority is “whoever’s going to do right by Israel.” Finkelstein said she appreciated several of Trump’s policy decisions, including recognizing Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moving the U.S. Embassy there from Tel Aviv.
“I don’t think I have to like him in order to know that he’s gonna do right by my country,” she said.
But Danny Eisenberg, 73, a radiologist from Maryland, called Trump’s statements about Jewish voters “crazy” and “a little antisemitic,” adding that he believes Trump’s promises about supporting Israel are exaggerated. Eisenberg told NPR he believes Trump’s decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal had led to further instability in the region.
Trump's address to the Israeli-American Council comes just weeks after a 23-year-old Israeli-American, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, was found shot dead in a Hamas tunnel in Gaza, along with the bodies of five other hostages.
Other featured speakers scheduled for the three-day conference taking place this weekend include Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York and Republican megadonor Miriam Adelson.",2024-09-20

Today's top stories
Former President Donald Trump made a final appeal to the nation in front of a full crowd at Madison Square Garden last night after more than four hours of guest speaker appearances. The first guest, comedian and podcaster Tony Hinchcliffe joked that Puerto Rico is a “floating island of garbage.” One speaker seemed to imply that Vice President Harris is a prostitute.
- 🎧 NPR’s Danielle Kurtzleben tells Up First there is a stark contrast between Harris’ and Trump’s current message. Harris is highlighting women who have lost their lives or had their lives threatened by the overturning of Roe v. Wade. On the other hand, one of Trump’s openers made a joke about Taylor Swift being killed by her boyfriend. This isn’t a winning message for women voters — a demographic Trump is behind in the polls for, Kurtzleben says. As the end of his campaign nears, he is still rolling out new proposals including a tax credit for people caring for family members.
- ➡️ Harris promoted a new pledge to boost Puerto Rico’s economy yesterday, contrasting the messages made at Trump’s rally. Megastar Bad Bunny highlighted the pledge to his 45 million Instagram followers.
Today, high-ranking South Korean officials are expected to present NATO allies with evidence about North Korean soldiers showing up in Russia to fight in Ukraine. This comes after U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin confirmed he believes at least 3,000 North Korean soldiers are in Russia, calling it a very serious escalation. Today’s briefing aims to get all 32 NATO allies on the same page.
- 🎧 One of South Korea’s concerns is North Korean troops getting battlefield experience, something they haven’t had since 1953, NPR’s Teri Schultz says. Nobody knows what else Russia and North Korea could be exchanging, such as ballistic missiles. NATO can issue a statement about how this cooperation is unacceptable but it doesn’t have the authority to tell North Korea and Russia what to do. South Korean intelligence will also brief European Union officials and the country has the ability to impose sanctions.
The 2024 World Series is coming to the East Coast. After the Los Angeles Dodgers won the first two games, the New York Yankees will now host games three and four and, if necessary, game five. The Dodgers' Shohei Ohtani hurt himself in game two trying to steal second base, but the team’s manager Dave Roberts told reporters yesterday that Ohtani has gotten back his normal range of motion and is expected to play.
- 🎧 “Historically teams that win the first two games, not a surprise, go on to win the series more often than not — 80% of the time,” NPR freelance reporter Steve Futterman says. But teams have come back from 0-2 deficits many times. In fact, the last two times these two teams faced off in the World Series in 1981 and 1978 that’s exactly what happened.

Internal Family Systems, or “parts work,” has surged in popularity. It's the idea that we all have multiple parts, like sub-personalities. According to Richard Schwartz's book No Bad Parts, getting to know our multiple parts better and treating them with compassion may help better manage our lives and stress. Various studies have shown IFS can benefit people with specific problems, including symptoms of PTSD and stress; the pain, discomfort and depression from living with rheumatoid arthritis; and depression. Here’s how it works:
- 🧠 Start by listening to your parts. Tune in to one sensation or image and ask it what it wants you to know.
- 🧠 Try starting a dialogue with your parts: What do you want me to know? What do you want to show me?
- 🧠 IFS teaches that we all have exile parts, which hold onto hurtful memories. These exiles can stay locked deep within, but reliving those experiences can help with unburdening.
- 🧠 If you engage in negative self-talk, use the U-Turn technique: Take a moment to notice what’s happening inside and look inward.

NPR,Trump and Harris' closing messages to Republicans are as different as they come,"Trump and Harris' closing messages to Republicans are as different as they come
GREENVILLE, N.C. — With just over two weeks to go until voting closes on Election Day, Vice President Harris and former President Donald Trump spent Monday campaigning in swing states focused on a voting bloc key to victory: Republicans.
In North Carolina, Trump touted early voting numbers while touring storm damage near Asheville, railed against Harris while promoting hardline immigration policies at a rally in Greenville and courted evangelical voters at a faith-focused event just outside of Charlotte.
""As I look back at my life's journey and events, I now recognize that it's been the hand of God leading me to where I am today,"" Trump said at an event with faith leaders in Concord. ""And my faith took on new meaning on July 13th in Butler, Pennsylvania, where I was knocked to the ground essentially by what seemed like a supernatural hand. And I would like to think that God saved me for a purpose, and that's to make our country greater.""
Meanwhile, Harris held several moderated town hall-style discussions with former GOP Congresswoman Liz Cheney in the suburbs of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, where the vice president framed the election as a choice on the future of democracy where the stakes rise above partisan labels.
""I have said before and it must be repeated each time: There are moments in the history of our country which challenge us, each of us, to really decide,"" Harris said in Malvern, Pa. ""Do we stand for those things that we talk about, including in particular country over party?""
Throughout the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump has made little effort to moderate his message beyond his base within the Republican Party, and has instead sought to grow that base by turning out lower propensity voters receptive to his message and disillusioned by the current Democratic administration.
The coalition that powered President Biden's narrow 2020 victory included a sizable number of anti-Trump conservatives and right-leaning independents who backed his campaign but otherwise support Republicans. After taking over as the Democratic nominee this summer, Harris has ramped up efforts to campaign across the aisle and expand the party's tent to defeat Trump.
As polls continue to show a likely close race in the seven swing states that will decide the election, Monday's events reiterate how important getting every constituency to show up and vote is to both campaigns.
Trump continues to be Trump
North Carolina is the only one of the seven swing states that Trump won in 2020, and is a key part of his path to victory in 2024.
In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, which ripped across the South in late September, Trump has used the storm as a frequent opportunity to bash Harris, Biden and the federal government's response — and to tie everything back to his immigration views.
Speaking to reporters in a hard-hit area of Swannanoa, Trump repeated false claims about the Federal Emergency Management Agency's funding.
""They spent a lot of money on bringing illegal migrants, people that came into our country illegally, and taking them in,"" Trump said. ""And all of the money they've spent — numbers that nobody can even believe. So they don't have any money for the people that live here.""
Trump also declined to denounce threats of violence against FEMA and other federal employees after a North Carolina man was arrested for threats earlier this month.
""Does that mean that if they're doing a poor job, we're supposed to not say it?"" Trump asked.
He also drastically exaggerated the number of pre-screened supporters that he served at a Pennsylvania McDonald's on Sunday and praised early voting numbers from the Tar Heel State.
At his Greenville rally, Trump reiterated his calls for mass deportations, closing the U.S.-Mexico border and attacked Harris as being the enabler of what he calls an ""invasion"" of America.
""So you're either stupid, you hate our country, or they're trying to get them to vote, right?"" he said about Harris' immigration policies. ""And it's probably the third. She's turning beautiful small towns into [a] third world dumping ground.""
There’s no evidence to support claims about noncitizens voting illegally, and Trump himself acknowledged that he had not yet seen any evidence to suggest the election would not be fair. “Unfortunately, I know the other side, and they are not good. But I have not seen that,"" Trump said.
His suggestion that the final vote could be tainted fits with another part of Trump's closing message not grounded in reality: that the only way he loses is if there’s cheating.
At the faith event, Trump largely stuck to his usual campaign stump speech, vowing to ""keep men out of women's sports"" but also promising ""we will proudly say Merry Christmas again,"" while baselessly accusing Harris, who is Baptist, of having anti-Christian bias.
Trump has another rally scheduled in Greensboro, N.C., Tuesday. He will also participate in a roundtable with Latino leaders in Florida.
Harris, Cheney and abortion rights
Harris' campaign pitch to Republicans exists on the complete opposite end of the spectrum from Trump's, both ideologically and rhetorically.
She spent Monday traveling the ""Blue Wall"" states of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, with Cheney bringing a message to suburban voters that support for Harris is not incompatible with conservatism, even for those who oppose abortion.
""I think there are many of us around the country who have been pro-life, but who have watched what's going on in our states since the Dobbs decision and have watched state legislatures put in place laws that are resulting in women not getting the care they need,"" Cheney said in Pennsylvania, referring to the Supreme Court decision striking down the constitutional right to an abortion. ""So I think this is not an issue that we're seeing break down across party lines.""
The bulk of Harris' GOP outreach has been less about adopting more conservative stances of her own on policy issues, but more providing a permission structure for those who identify as Republican — but not as a Trump Republican — to feel like they can support her campaign against the former president.
""In this moment, there are millions of good and honorable people who Donald Trump has just fundamentally betrayed,"" Cheney said in Waukesha, Wis. ""The decision to give somebody the power of the presidency means that you're handing someone the most awesome and significant power of any office anywhere in the world, and you have to choose people who have character, choose people of good faith.""
Harris is scheduled to sit for interviews on Tuesday with NBC and Telemundo. Later this week, she is also slated to campaign with former President Barack Obama in Georgia, and participate in a town hall with CNN.",2024-10-21
NPR,"Over 200,000 subscribers flee 'Washington Post' after Bezos blocks Harris endorsement","Over 200,000 subscribers flee 'Washington Post' after Bezos blocks Harris endorsement
The Washington Post has been rocked by a tidal wave of cancellations from digital subscribers and a series of resignations from columnists, as the paper grapples with the fallout of owner Jeff Bezos’s decision to block an endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris for president.
More than 200,000 people had canceled their digital subscriptions by midday Monday, according to two people at the paper with knowledge of internal matters. Not all cancellations take effect immediately. Still, the figure represents about 8% of the paper’s paid circulation of roughly 2.5 million subscribers, which includes print as well. The number of cancellations continued to grow Monday afternoon.
A corporate spokesperson declined to comment, citing The Washington Post Co.'s status as a privately held company.
“It’s a colossal number,” former Post Executive Editor Marcus Brauchli told NPR. “The problem is, people don’t know why the decision was made. We basically know the decision was made but we don’t know what led to it.”
Chief Executive and Publisher Will Lewis on Friday explained the decision not to endorse in this year’s presidential race or in future elections as a return to the Post’s roots: It has for years styled itself an “independent paper.”
Few people inside the paper credit that rationale given the timing, however, just days before a neck-and-neck race between Harris and former President Donald Trump.
Former Executive Editor Marty Baron voiced that skepticism in an interview with NPR's Morning Edition on Monday.
""If this decision had been made three years ago, two years ago, maybe even a year ago, that would've been fine,"" Baron said. ""It's a certainly reasonable decision. But this was made within a couple of weeks of the election, and there was no substantive serious deliberation with the editorial board of the paper. It was clearly made for other reasons, not for reasons of high principle.""
Bezos: ""inadequate planning"" not ""intentional strategy""
Indeed, in his own opinion piece published by the Post Monday evening, Bezos acknowledged that the timing was not ideal.
""That was inadequate planning, and not some intentional strategy,"" he wrote.
Post reporters have revealed repeated instances of wrongdoing and allegations of illegality by Trump and his associates. The editorial page, which operates separately, has characterized Trump as a threat to the American democratic experiment. Several Post journalists say their relatives are among those canceling subscriptions.
The mass cancellations point “to the polarization of the times we’re living in, and the energy people feel about these issues,” Brauchli says. “This gave people a reason to act on this mood.”
Brauchli has publicly encouraged people not to cancel their Post subscriptions in protest.
“It is a way to send a message to ownership but it shoots you in the foot if you care about the kind of in-depth, quality journalism like the Post produces,” he said. “There aren’t many organizations that can do what the Post does. The range and depth of reporting by the Post’s journalists is among the best in the world.”
Even at the rival New York Times, with a much higher circulation level, a significant protest might register in the low thousands. Earlier this year, Lewis, the Post publisher, had touted the paper's net gain of 4,000 subscribers as noteworthy.
Three of the top 10 viewed stories on the Post’s website Sunday were articles written by Post staffers outraged by Bezos’ decision. The top one was humor columnist Alexandra Petri’s piece, headlined, “It has fallen to me, the humor columnist, to endorse Harris for president.” More than 174,000 people read it online.
Resignations follow Bezos' decision
The decision by Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, was first reported by NPR on Friday. In the days since, two columnists have resigned from the paper and writers have stepped down from the editorial board.
One of those writers, Molly Roberts, warned of the possible consequences of the eleventh-hour decision to stay quiet rather than publish the editorial endorsing Harris. ""Donald Trump is not yet a dictator,"" she wrote in a statement she posted on social media. ""But the quieter we are, the closer he comes.""
Another, David Hoffman, accepted a Pulitzer Prize for editorial writing on Thursday, the day before Bezos’ decision was made public. Pulitzer judges recognized him “for a compelling and well-researched series on new technologies and the tactics authoritarian regimes use to repress dissent in the digital age, and how they can be fought.”
“For decades, the Washington Post's editorials have been a beacon of light, signaling hope to dissidents, political prisoners and the voiceless,” Hoffman wrote in a letter Monday explaining his decision to leave the editorial board. “When victims of repression were harassed, exiled, imprisoned and murdered, we made sure the whole world knew the truth.
“I believe we face a very real threat of autocracy in the candidacy of Donald Trump,” Hoffman added in his letter to Editorial Page Editor David Shipley, which was obtained by NPR. “I find it untenable and unconscionable that we have lost our voice.""
Hoffman says he intends to remain at the paper, saying he ""refuses to give up on The Post, where I have spent 42 years."" He writes of being launched on several projects, including ""the expanded effort to support press freedom around the world.""
Shipley held a contentious meeting on Monday afternoon with scores of opinion section staffers, who posed tough questions to the editorial page chief, including appeals for Bezos to address them.
As recently as last week, according to a person present, Shipley said he sought to talk Bezos out of his decision. Shipley added, “I failed.”
Questions about Bezos' timing and motives
Former columnist Robert Kagan, an editor-at-large, explained his decision on CNN Friday night to resign from the paper.
“We are in fact bending the knee to Donald Trump because we're afraid of what he will do,” Kagan said, noting that officials from Bezos’ Blue Origin aerospace company met with Trump a few hours after the decision became public.
Blue Origin has a multi-billion dollar contract with NASA. During the Trump administration, Amazon sued the government after alleging it had blocked a $10 billion cloud-computing-services contract with the Pentagon over the then-president’s ire about coverage in the Post, which Bezos owns personally.
Yet Bezos resolutely supported the staff's coverage during the Trump presidency (and has not interfered with reporting on his own business interests or personal life).
Bezos: 'I am not an ideal owner of The Post'
Bezos publicly broke his own silence late Monday. In his opinion piece, he characterized his decision to end presidential endorsements as an attempt to avoid a ""perception of bias"" and ""non-independence."" He rejected assertions that he was attempting to placate Trump or protect his other business interests.
""No quid pro quo of any kind is at work here,"" he wrote, adding that he did not consult or inform any candidate about his decision.
Bezos said he did not know about the meeting between Blue Origin executives and Trump on Friday — the same day as the paper announced its decision.
""I sighed when I found out, because I knew it would provide ammunition to those who would like to frame this as anything other than a principled decision,"" he said.
He acknowledged that his stake in other companies — and their lucrative government contracts — complicates things for the Post.
""When it comes to the appearance of conflict, I am not an ideal owner of The Post,"" he wrote. ""I assure you that my views here are, in fact, principled, and I believe my track record as owner of The Post since 2013 backs this up.""",2024-10-28
NPR,Anxiety runs deep in Georgia as voters worry about heated rhetoric spurring violence,"Anxiety runs deep in Georgia as voters worry about heated rhetoric spurring violence
PEACHTREE CORNERS, Ga. — By December 2020, Donald Trump and his allies had been making false claims about widespread election fraud for weeks. Top election officials were facing threats.
Then a young technician who worked for the company that makes Georgia’s voting machines started receiving death threats, too. So did his family. Walking into a press conference at the Georgia State Capitol, Gabriel Sterling, a top elections official in the Secretary of State’s office, was fuming.
“It has all gone too far. All of it. It has to stop,” he said. “Someone’s going to get hurt. Someone’s going to get shot. Someone’s going to get killed.”
Four years later with another election underway, this heated climate has persisted.
Former President Trump has been the target of two assassination attempts, including one at a campaign rally in Butler, Pa., that left one man dead. Meanwhile Trump’s warnings of the potential for election fraud and language about immigration have fueled threats against election workers and some immigrant communities.
The FBI warned in an October bulletin to local and state officials around the country, obtained by WABE, that extremists with election grievances could turn to violence in the coming weeks. The bureau urged stepped up precautions around possible targets such as polling places and election offices.
“I would think we’re more prepared this time because now, I hate to say it, it’s old hat,” Sterling said in a recent interview. “What I get concerned about is some new tactic.”
Sterling said law enforcement and election officials have to be on guard to contend with novel strategies to subvert the vote. In one security briefing, he recalled law enforcement suggesting parking cars alongside a set of windows at a polling place.
“I said, why?” Sterling recounted. “To protect against a bomb attack. That’s the level we’re at now with some of these things.”
Sterling said dedicated election officials are doing everything they can to ensure a smooth election — and that voters should feel safe casting their ballots. He also hopes touting a consistent message of fair elections eventually breaks through the misinformation-soaked environment.
“It’s kind of like the end of Mr. Smith goes to Washington, when he’s sitting there doing his filibuster on the floor,” Sterling said, referring to the 1939 Frank Capra film. “And finally senators say, there’s no way he’s still saying this stuff if there’s not some truth to what he’s saying.”
But that hasn’t happened yet.
Trump has so far declined to say outright he will accept the results of this election, saying he will only do so if it is a “fair and legal and good election.” He and his allies have already made false claims about election fraud, disaster relief and immigrants.
After a grand jury indicted Trump in Georgia on charges that he tried to subvert the 2020 election result, to which he has pleaded not guilty, the jurors received a torrent of online threats.
Already, Georgia Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has amplified a debunked story about a voting machine in Georgia flipping a Trump vote to a vote for Vice President Kamala Harris during early voting.
And in recent weeks, Trump-aligned members of the Georgia State Election Board have passed rules that seemed to allow local election board members to vote against certifying election results. When a judge undercut those rules, he received death threats online.
“He’s got a huge target on his back”
Four years ago, talk of a stolen election, despite multiple audits and recounts proving otherwise, helped propel Daryl Kidd to Washington, D.C. on January 6th, where a mob of Trump supporters violently breached the Capitol.
Wearing a Trump Save America hat outside a Trump rally in Atlanta earlier this month, Kidd said he did not participate in any of the violence that day. But he did have doubts about the 2020 election.
“This time, I think it’s going to be more secure,” Kidd said. “In Georgia anyway, I think it will be more protected.”
A controversial overhaul of Georgia election laws has given him some confidence. Kidd is less sure about other states. He said he would not rule out protesting the result again.
Waiting in line nearby and decked out in red, friends Tina McKay and Dorie Walters have been processing the more recent political violence — the assassination attempts against Trump. They said the attempts did give them pause about coming to a campaign rally, but not for long.
“I thought about it when it first happened, I thought how scary that would be, but as soon as I was able to get a ticket here, I didn’t think twice about it,” McKay said. “I do fear for him because I think he’s got a huge target on his back,” Walters said.
The motives behind the two assassination attempts remain unclear. Walters and McKay, like other voters at the rally, said they blame Democrats, not Trump, for spiking the political temperature.
Both campaigns have described their opponents as grave threats to the country. But it is Trump who talks of bypassing Democratic norms and uses language laced with violent imagery, personal attacks and incendiary claims. His own former chief of staff, John Kelly, in remarks published by The New York Times this week called Trump a “fascist.”
At his Atlanta rally, Trump called on supporters to help “defeat the enemy at all levels of combat.”
Some of his harshest rhetoric has targeted immigrants. At a rally on Thursday, he blamed Harris for ""an invasion of criminal migrants,"" saying the U.S. had become a ""garbage can for the world.""
For Daniela Usurin, who is originally from Uruguay, Trump’s hardline stance is welcome.
Usurin said illegal immigration reflects poorly on immigrants like her. But Trump has made false claims about migrants who are legally in the country, too. From the debate stage, he amplified a false story about migrants in Springfield, Ohio eating cats and dogs. The community became overwhelmed with bomb threats.
“As far as those issues in Ohio, I really can’t say what’s the reality,” Usurin said.
The reality is that city and state officials have debunked the claims as false. But many at the Trump rally say they believe them, or at least the campaign’s description of the country facing an invasion of illegal immigrants.
Many immigrant communities are fearful.
“It’s just dividing us even more”
At a recent Democratic canvassing kickoff at Peachy Corners Cafe in the Atlanta suburbs, Trump’s rhetoric was weighing on many of the volunteers picking up campaign flyers, Vietnamese coffee and bubble tea.
“It’s just dividing us even more, so unnecessarily, with these non-truths and made-up stories,” said Tahmida Shamsuddin, who immigrated from Bangladesh two decades ago.
“And I never felt like I was anything less than because I came here, got an education, got a job and became what I hope is a contributing citizen. It’s personal for me and it’s hurtful,” she said.
While Shamsuddin, who was wearing a Harris-Walz camouflage hat, is committed to the campaign work, she said knocking on doors of strangers to talk about the election can be anxiety-inducing in this environment.
At a high-top by the espresso machine, Tha Vin said he just came in for a quiet spot to read his comic books. He said the language to describe immigrants is shaping his vote though.
“I’m a gun owner, like I find I want to vote Republican,” Vin said. “But the rhetoric toward immigrants has been something that has made me not want to vote Republican.”
Vin came to the U.S. as a refugee from Cambodia in 1980. He said he fled from an authoritarian regime. Preserving democracy is one of the issues motivating him.
Vin fondly remembers his family receiving a welcome basket within a few days of arriving in the U.S. He feels that spirit has now faded. But he said the political climate has made him more resolved to vote. He is wrangling the schedules of his son, niece and nephew, who turned 18 this year, so they can go to the polls as a family.
“We want to make it a big deal,” he said. “I want us as a family to symbolically vote in a way that shows we’re a part of this country.”
Vin said he sees his vote as more than a choice for president. For him, it is a way to assert he belongs in the country that gave him refuge all those years ago.",2024-10-25
NPR,"In a razor-thin race, Trump's complicated ties with Georgia's governor could matter","In a razor-thin race, Trump's complicated ties with Georgia's governor could matter
ATLANTA — When former President Donald Trump campaigned in Georgia on Monday, one of the state’s most popular Republican politicians was absent — Gov. Brian Kemp.
The former president’s ability to capture the Peach State after losing it four years ago could hinge in part on his complicated relationship with the governor.
The two fell out after 2020, when Kemp rebuffed Trump’s efforts to overturn Georgia’s election result.
Kemp went on to a decisive reelection victory in 2022, even after Trump backed another Republican during the GOP primary for governor.
At an Atlanta rally in August, Trump had harsh words for Kemp, whose approval rating has hovered around 60%.
“He’s a disloyal guy and he’s a very average governor,” Trump told the crowd. “Little Brian, little Brian Kemp, bad guy.”
When Trump continued to slam one of the most popular politicians in a crucial swing state, many Republicans scratched their heads, given Kemp’s popularity and top-notch political operation.
Kemp has built up his own sophisticated political infrastructure, now seen by most operatives as far superior to the Georgia GOP. The state party has languished as it has helped foot hefty legal bills for Republicans facing criminal charges related to efforts to overturn the 2020 election result.
“For Trump, Georgia is a must-win,” said Georgia Republican strategist Brian Robinson. “He learned a lesson pretty quick in August that going after Kemp was a bad strategic move.”
Though Kemp told reporters he cast a blank ballot in the GOP primary for president, he also said he would support the Republican nominee no matter what. Then, in a September Fox News interview, Kemp made clear — he was behind Trump. That opened the door for Trump and Kemp to patch things up.
In October, the two men shook hands not at a campaign event, but after Trump surveyed damage from Hurricane Helene in Georgia.
“Your governor is doing a fantastic job,” Trump told reporters.
Kemp's pitch has focused on the GOP record, not Trump
Still, it was unclear how much he would do to actively help Trump win Georgia. Kemp has not attended any Trump rallies so far this year.
But in the final weeks of the campaign, Kemp has hosted his own Get Out the Vote events, including a breakfast for an incumbent lawmaker in a tossup district. Inside a genteel Atlanta country club, Kemp barely nodded at the presidential race, beyond a dig at the Harris campaign’s roster of celebrity surrogates.
He did not mention Trump during his remarks. Instead, Kemp framed his pitch around Republicans’ record at the helm of state government, like cutting taxes.
Pressed by reporters after the breakfast event, Kemp affirmed he is still pulling for Trump, despite their history, which included Trump bashing Kemp’s wife, Georgia first lady Marty Kemp, at that August rally. The first lady had previously told a reporter she would likely write-in her husband’s name when she cast her vote in the November presidential election.
“This is not about me and it’s not about him,” the governor said. “It’s about the people of this country and what they want. Do they really think they were better off right now than they were four years ago?”
Kemp’s political action committees are spending roughly $3 million on door knocking, phone calls, text messages and mail, according to Kemp’s political team. The federal committee has focused its message on opposing Vice President Kamala Harris and is not boosting Trump by name in the literature.
“I want to win,” Kemp told reporters. “So we’re all fighting to make sure we win from the top of the ticket down all the way down to the bottom.”
Kemp and Trump need each other, Robinson said.
“If Donald Trump is president, he could be helpful or create a major hurdle for Brian Kemp and his future political endeavors,” he said.
Kemp is often mentioned as a possible contender for the U.S. Senate in 2026 or the presidency in 2028.
For Trump, Robinson said Kemp may give some suburban independents and Republicans uneasy about Trump permission to cast their ballots for the former president.
“I don’t want to oversell it,” Robinson said. “It is important. And it’s marginally important. But we have an election that will be determined on the margins.”
Many voters trust Kemp — and could be swayed by him
Standing in the back of the Kemp event wearing a floral dress, Tracey D’Arcy was one of the voters who is not enthusiastic about Trump or Harris. But D’Arcy said she trusts Kemp.
“I think he’s a very level person,” she said. “I think he is reasonable. It definitely weighs on which way I will decide to vote.”
D’Arcy described herself as center-right. She said she thinks the restrictive abortion law signed by Kemp banning most abortions after roughly six weeks is too tight and laments the tumult caused by the overturn of Roe v. Wade, which Trump has praised. But she’s also worried by Harris’ liberal record in the U.S. Senate.
As far as Trump’s efforts to pressure Kemp after the 2020 election, when he urged him to call a special legislative session to investigate allegations of election fraud, she said does not know enough about what happened to form a strong opinion.
“I would love it if we had different nominees for both parties, honestly,” D’Arcy said. “Nikki Haley would have been amazing.”
But Haley is not the nominee, so D’Arcy has to make a choice in a key state decided in 2020 by less than 12,000 votes.",2024-10-28
NPR,Former model Stacey Williams is latest woman to accuse Trump of sexual misconduct,"Former model Stacey Williams is latest woman to accuse Trump of sexual misconduct
Another woman has accused Donald Trump of sexual misconduct, adding to a list of more than a dozen women who have accused the former president of inappropriate sexual behavior.
Stacey Williams, a former Sports Illustrated model, claims Trump groped her in 1993, while Jeffrey Epstein, who was later convicted of sex offenses, looked on. She recounted the incident to CNN this week, as well as on a Zoom call with Survivors for Kamala, a group that’s unaffiliated with the campaign.
“The second he was in front of me, he pulled me into him, and his hands were just on me and didn’t come off,” she told CNN in an interview.
“Then the hands started moving, and they were on the side of my breasts, on my hips, back down to my butt … they were just on me the whole time.”
In a statement, Trump campaign National Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt denied the allegations on Trump's behalf.
""It's obvious this fake story was contrived by the Harris campaign to distract from the deeply concerning and newly unearthed allegations"" about Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff, Leavitt wrote. Emhoff has been accused of striking an ex-girlfriend in 2012. The Harris campaign has denied this.
""Fake allegations like this are a disservice to women who are truly victims of assault,"" Leavitt added.
The alleged incident between Trump and Williams took place while Williams was dating Epstein, who was, in the 1980s and 1990s, a friend of Trump’s. Epstein had taken Williams to Trump Tower to meet Trump, and she says Trump immediately started groping her.
“This context made no sense because the hands were on me, and then he and Jeffrey just kept talking and looking at each other and smiling,” she said.
“I just had this really, like, sickening feeling that it was coordinated — that somehow the whole thing was, I was rolled in there like a piece of meat for some kind of weird, twisted game.”
Williams also says she received a postcard from Trump shortly after the encounter, where he wrote that Palm Beach, Fla. — site of what's now his Mar-a-Lago Club — was her ""home away from home.""
She told CNN that she didn’t talk about the incident for a long time, out of shame.
“I felt a wave of shame, and I just couldn’t think about it, face it, talk about it for a very long time. I put it in a little box inside of me, turned the key, locked it,” she said.
Many victims of sexual violence remain quiet long after those incidents occur.
Williams joins a list of women who have accused Trump of sexual assault and other forms of sexual misconduct. Trump has denied all of these allegations.
In addition, Trump bragged about groping and kissing women in the Access Hollywood tape, leaked one month before the 2016 election.
With just over a week until Election Day 2024, polls suggest that the electorate could have the widest gender gap in modern election history. Women voters preferred Harris by 18 points in the latest NPR Marist PBS NewsHour poll, while men voters preferred Trump by 16 points.
It’s unclear how much an allegation like this could sway voters; the Access Hollywood tape’s effects have been debated for years, and Trump did ultimately win that close race. In addition, most voters have their minds made up. This year’s polls have been remarkably stable in the months since Harris entered the race.",2024-10-25
NPR,GOP ads on transgender rights are dominating airwaves in the election's closing days,"GOP ads on transgender rights are dominating airwaves in the election's closing days
Voters consistently say issues like the economy and reproductive rights are their top concerns in this election. But in the closing weeks of the campaign, Republican ads focusing on transgender rights are dominating airwaves all over the country.
Consider the ad below from former President Donald Trump. If you've seen a Trump campaign ad lately, there's a good chance it's this one:
The Trump campaign has recently dropped at least $17 million on ads highlighting Vice President Harris' support during her 2019 presidential campaign for access to gender-affirming medical treatment for transgender people.
It's part of a broader Republican strategy casting the Democratic Party as taking transgender rights to extremes.
According to data compiled by AdImpact for NPR, these ads have aired more than 30,000 times, including in the key swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The campaign has placed a particular focus on NFL and college football broadcast audiences.
""I do think it's just emphasizing that sort of cultural divide that we do see in sport,"" said Jessica Taylor, a nonpartisan election analyst with the Cook Political Report. Taylor said the issue can appeal to men and swing suburban women, and polling backs that up.
Polling from the Marist Center for Sports Communication in 2022 found that 61% of Americans say transgender athletes should only be allowed to ""play on teams that match their birth gender.""
In extremely tight races where small shifts matter, divisive social issues can move the needle.
""If it moves a small sect of voters, that could still be key,"" Taylor said.
Anti-trans rhetoric is also being used down-ticket
Republicans are making similar bets in the House and Senate races that help determine control of the next Congress.
The Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC affiliated with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, is bombarding Ohio with at least $15 million in ads attacking incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat, on these very issues.
Brown responded with an ad of his own, calling the claims he voted to allow ""biological men"" in women's sports leagues a lie.
""The truth is in Ohio, this has already been banned and Sherrod Brown agrees with Gov. DeWine,"" the ad said. ""These decisions should be made by local sports leagues, not politicians.""
Trans-related ads are also targeting Democrats in at least eight competitive House races.
Kelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign, which advocates for LGBTQ rights, said that this slate of ads isn't anything new.
""When MAGA extremists are under attack and feeling like they're not going to win, they go to this old playbook of trying to sow fear and transphobia in our communities,"" Robinson said.
As for how Harris is responding to the ads, her campaign pointed NPR to comments spokesman Michael Tyler made last month on Fox News, where he said these issues are ""not what she's proposing or running on.""
Robinson is unbothered by the lack of Democratic response on the air.
""I'm not looking for them to kind of engage in the fearmongering,"" she said. ""I'm looking for them to show that they're candidates that can pull this country together and that won't use divisiveness as a political tactic.""
These ads are expected to remain on the air until Election Day.",2024-10-19
NPR,DOJ lawyers slam 'glaring gap' in failure to investigate potential Israeli crimes,"DOJ lawyers slam 'glaring gap' in failure to investigate potential Israeli crimes
Justice Department attorneys wrote to Attorney General Merrick Garland this week, calling out the “glaring gap” between the department’s approach to crimes committed by Russia and Hamas — versus the department’s silence on potential crimes committed by Israeli forces and civilians.
The four-page letter, dated Oct. 21, explicitly calls on the department to investigate potential crimes committed by Israeli soldiers and civilians, including the killings of American citizens in the West Bank and Gaza.
""In prosecuting crimes committed by Russia, Hamas and other wrongdoers, the Department has appropriately demonstrated its commitment to upholding the rule of law in the midst of ongoing geopolitical conflicts,"" the letter says. “But against the backdrop of numerous potential violations of U.S. law by individuals and entities affiliated with Israel, the Department’s silence and apparent inaction is a stark omission.”
The letter, which was first reported by Zeteo, a new media organization on Substack, is a rare instance of public disagreement from within the Justice Department. Unlike at the State Department, there is no established internal channel for DOJ employees to express dissent over a policy issue.
NPR reported two weeks ago on the Justice Department's silence over four U.S. citizens killed this year in the West Bank and Gaza Strip — the victims' families say by Israelis — despite demands from the Americans' families that the department investigate.
The DOJ letter was anonymously signed “your colleagues.” NPR has confirmed that the three authors of the letter are mid-career attorneys at the Justice Department, two of whom work at department headquarters in Washington, D.C.
It's unclear how widespread the views expressed in the letter are among the approximately 10,000 attorneys who work at the Justice Department, or what impact it could have.
One of the authors, speaking on condition of anonymity due to concerns about potential professional retaliation, told NPR the letter was emailed Monday from a non-department email account to a senior official in the attorney general’s office.
The Justice Department declined to comment for this story.
""Fair and impartial application""
During his time as attorney general, Garland has frequently spoken about upholding norms and ""treating like cases alike."" That was the theme of a major speech he delivered in the department’s Great Hall to the DOJ workforce on Sept. 12.
In that speech, the letter says, Garland told the department's employees that ""as attorneys for the government, we should not be influenced by, among other factors, a person’s background, our feelings concerning the victims, and the effect of a charging decision on our professional and personal circumstances.”
The letter also raises remarks Garland made after Congress passed the Justice for Victims of War Crimes Act in 2022, which allows the department to prosecute a suspected war criminal in the U.S., regardless of the individual’s nationality.
""In the United States of America, there must be no hiding place for war criminals and no safe haven for those who commit such atrocities,"" Garland said at the time. ""This bill will help the Justice Department fulfill that important mandate.""
After Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, Garland publicly condemned the “war crimes that the entire world has seen,” and set up a special team to focus on possible Russian atrocities. The department has since charged four Russian soldiers with war crimes in Ukraine for allegedly abducting and torturing an American citizen.
In the Israel-Hamas conflict, Garland has publicly confirmed the department is investigating the killing and kidnapping of Americans in Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel. The department also has brought terrorism charges against six Hamas leaders.
But, the letter says, there has been a “glaring gap” in the department’s enforcement of potential violations of U.S. law by Israeli government forces and citizens.
“Despite credible evidence of violations of U.S. law, and in contrast to the department’s public position regarding crimes committed by Russia in its invasion of Ukraine, the department has taken no public steps to hold the perpetrators to account, even when the victims are U.S. citizens,” it says.
The letter lists several Americans citizens who have been killed this year by Israeli soldiers or civilians, including Jacob Flickinger, Aysenur Eygi, Tawfic Abdel Jabbar and Mohammad Khdour.
“Not only has no one been held to account, but the department has made virtually no public announcement of any investigations or even an acknowledgment of its commitment to seek accountability,” the letter says.
It also says that there is “credible evidence” that the Israeli military may have committed war crimes in Gaza, including forced displacement and starvation, unlawful confinement, torture and inhumane treatment of Palestinian detainees and mass destruction of civilian property and infrastructure.
Warning about 'apparatus of politics'
The International Criminal Court prosecutor has requested arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his defense minister on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity. The prosecutor also requested arrest warrants for three top Hamas figures on the same charges, although all three have been been killed by Israel.
Israel, a close American ally that the U.S. supplies with weapons, says its actions in Gaza have been in accordance with the laws of war.
The DOJ attorneys' letter points out that U.S. courts would have jurisdiction over Israeli soldiers or officials who travel to the U.S., as well as the more than 23,000 U.S. citizens who it says are currently serving in the Israeli military.
The same rigor that has been applied to holding Russian and Hamas perpetrators to account should be applied “where the perpetrators are acting on behalf of a political ally and the victims are stateless,” the letter says. “The disparate treatment of conduct by Israeli actors, reflected both in public statements and in charges the Department has brought, risks the precise implication you warned against—that our department has become ‘an apparatus of politics.’”
The department should open investigations into the killings of Americans and potential Israeli war crimes, if it has not already done so, the letter says, and state publicly that it is investigating. The letter also suggests that DOJ and FBI create a webpage for collecting evidence of potential Israeli war crimes, similar to what was set up for collecting evidence of possible Russian war crimes.
“Doing so will not only allow the department to raise awareness and provide guidance to those who may possess evidence of such crimes, but it will restore the public’s faith in the department’s commitment to basic principles of justice and equality under the law,” it says.",2024-10-25
NPR,GOP lawsuits about an obscure immigration database may set up election challenges,"GOP lawsuits about an obscure immigration database may set up election challenges
As former President Donald Trump and his allies spread baseless conspiracy theories about Democrats bringing in noncitizens to vote illegally, GOP state officials are escalating last-minute demands on the Biden administration to check the citizenship of voters on their state rolls.
In recent days, Florida, Texas and Ohio have each sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security over the issue. They argue a longstanding data sharing program, which the federal government has offered states over the last dozen years for this purpose, is insufficient.
""The Biden-Harris Administration has refused to comply with the law and has failed to supply Texas with the required information necessary to secure the integrity of Texas elections,"" Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement.
But with Election Day around the corner, the states' demands are coming far too late to be considered credible, according to election law experts and voting officials.
Instead, the lawsuits are ""in service of a fraudulent narrative — which is the notion that widespread numbers of noncitizens are intentionally registering and voting — which is patent garbage,"" said Justin Levitt, a constitutional law professor at Loyola Law School who also served as an adviser on voting rights issues for the Biden administration.
Levitt said lawsuits filed right before an election usually request expedited review, but none of these suits did, indicating that the goal may be to publicize the issue rather than get a ruling quickly.
Kim Wyman — a Republican former secretary of state of Washington who also served as senior adviser for election security to DHS' Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency — agreed that the timing of the lawsuits seemed more like ""posturing"" and planning for post-election litigation.
""What I've seen in my experience of elections is that when a group or an organization or a person files a lawsuit related to an election this close to Election Day, they're really kind of putting a placeholder in,"" Wyman said.
Kenneth Parreno, an attorney with the nonprofit Protect Democracy that describes itself as ""defeating the authoritarian threat,"" calls suits like these ""zombies.""
""These are lawsuits that are dead on arrival because they're meritless"" Parreno said, adding that after the election, litigants could potentially ""bring these claims back to life and point to them as a basis for challenging the outcome of the election and trying to stop the lawful transition of power.""
An America First priority
Florida, Texas and Ohio are among several Republican-led states that recently asked the federal government to verify citizens on their voter rolls, though so far they are the only ones to have filed lawsuits.
America First Legal, an organization led by former Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller, sent letters to states over the summer with an ""emergency action plan"" that encouraged them to make such requests and said states could sue if DHS failed to respond. At least a half dozen states then sent letters with data requests to DHS' U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
In a June press release, Miller, who is credited as the architect of Trump's immigration policies, claimed without citing evidence that Biden was ""handing out voter registration forms to migrants"" and there is a ""direct effort to sabotage the 2024 election through potential mass illegal alien voting.""
Finding citizenship data isn't easy
Everyone who registers to vote in federal elections must attest, under penalty of perjury, that they are U.S. citizens. Documented cases of noncitizens voting in federal races are incredibly rare, likely because those who try face the possibility of prison and deportation.
There is no database of all U.S. citizens. Election officials typically use a hodgepodge of different data sources to suss out whether their rolls are accurate and up-to-date.
Since 2012, the federal government has offered states the opportunity to use a federal immigration data system known as Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, as a tool for checking if a potential voter is a naturalized citizen, a noncitizen who has interacted with the federal government or someone who acquired U.S. citizenship after being born abroad.
SAVE does not include records for American citizens born in the U.S. or people who entered the country illegally and have remained off the radar of federal officials. Not all of the data is necessarily up to date. Searches cost $1.50 per query, and agencies can only search for people one at a time.
The system's burdensome quirks have long been a thorn in the side of voting officials, so its use has been fairly limited for elections.
Just 10 states are registered with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to use the SAVE system for voting purposes, and even fewer have systems in place to use it regularly to clean up their voting lists. Four of the 10 states registered in the past few months. Some states that do not have a SAVE agreement for voting purposes check voter citizenship in other ways, such as by cross-checking data with the department of motor vehicles.
Georgia recently began doing regular SAVE searches of registered voters who had indicated in other interactions with the state that they were noncitizens. A recent audit yielded 20 suspected noncitizens on the rolls, out of 8.2 million registered voters (0.00024% of the state's list).
Florida has been using SAVE for elections since 2012 and Texas has been working with USCIS to gain access to it for voter list maintenance, according to court filings. Ohio's agreement began in July, and the state logged more than 20,000 queries.
The argument put forth by America First Legal, and echoed in state letters, however, is that SAVE is not a sufficient resource because it requires states to know an alien identification number or citizenship certificate number to query the system. The states are asking the federal government to offer checks based on first name, last name and date of birth of registered voters using a different system reserved for internal federal government use.
With just weeks before Election Day, states made enormous requests. Texas asked the federal government to check 454,289 voters, and Indiana requested verification for 585,774, even though the states offered no reason to believe those voters may not be citizens.
Such checks would have to be done individually and manually by federal government employees and still would not yield a ""definitive result,"" according to an official at the Department of Homeland Security, who spoke to NPR on background.
The director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Ur Jaddou, responded on Oct. 10 to all states who had made requests, saying that the SAVE program ""is the most secure and efficient way to reliably verify an individual's citizenship or immigration status,"" and said the agency ""currently cannot offer an alternative process to any state.""
Requests that missed the federal deadline
Both Florida and Texas sent their data requests to the federal government during a period in which federal law prohibits systematic purging of voters. Ohio's initial request was filed just before that period began.
During the 90-day ""quiet period"" before an election, states cannot use database matching to systematically remove voters from rolls.
The rule is to ensure that eligible citizens are not removed in error right before an election.
""States did not act in good faith months and months ago when systematic database matching might have been lawful depending on the way that they went about it,"" said Kate Huddleston, an attorney with Campaign Legal Center, which has sued states this election cycle for not observing the quiet period.
""Instead [they] are raising this really at the eleventh hour at a time when it would be unlawful to do exactly what they want to do,"" Huddleston said.
When asked about the timing of Texas' request given the 90-day rule, Alicia Pierce, a spokesperson for the Texas secretary of state, wrote in an email: ""All voter list maintenance is being done in compliance with state and federal law.""
Dan Lusheck, a spokesperson for the Ohio secretary of state, said the state began requesting information in the summer. ""The Department failed to respond to several times, and ultimately waited until mid-October to reject the request. Their inaction determined the timing of the lawsuit.""
Florida's Department of State did not respond to an NPR inquiry about that point.
A senior election official in a state that uses SAVE agreed that the timing of the requests and the lawsuits made clear the states were not serious in their efforts. The election official, who did not have permission to speak on the record about the issue, told NPR that voting administrators across the political spectrum have been frustrated with SAVE for years, but that this sort of ""gamesmanship"" is only meant to score political points, not improve voting lists.
""All these people, even the ones that are bringing the lawsuits, know full well that there aren't more than a handful of noncitizens registered to vote,"" said the official, who has worked for both Republican and Democratic administrations. ""But they can make a lot of political hay by bringing it up now.""
In the days after Florida filed its lawsuit, an analysis by the University of Washington's Center for an Informed Public found the announcement prompted the spread of misleading narratives on social media about noncitizens voting and the federal government's actions.
The voting official added they assumed the states suing are actually hoping to lose their cases, so they have something to point to should the election not go Donald Trump's way.
""The really sad truth is that in the deep, dark recesses of their brains, they're hoping they lose these cases so that they continue to have problems accessing that data and can use it as a political cudgel to make their point,"" the official said.",2024-10-25
NPR,"Facing fallout, Trump claims no president did more for Puerto Rico than he did","Facing fallout, Trump claims no president did more for Puerto Rico than he did
ALLENTOWN, Pa. — Former President Donald Trump sought to move past the controversy unleashed by a “joke” about Puerto Rico told at his Madison Square Garden rally, describing the event as “an absolute love fest” on Tuesday while criticizing his Democratic opponent over border enforcement, crime and the economy.
The fallout from the Sunday rally in New York has taken center stage with one week to go until voting closes in a race where polls show Trump and Vice President Harris locked in a razor-thin race in seven key swing states that could decide the contest -- several of which have sizable Latino populations.
Speaking at a rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania on Tuesday, Trump boasted about his support among Latino voters, saying, ""Nobody loves our Latino community and our Puerto Rican community more than I do.""
Trump faced heavy criticism from many Puerto Ricans after Hurricanes Maria and Irma in 2017 for questioning the official death toll, but during his rally in Pennsylvania he said he had ""done more for Puerto Rico than any president by far, nobody close."" He added: ""I will deliver the best future for Puerto Ricans and for Hispanic Americans. Kamala will deliver you poverty and crime.""
His remarks followed attempts by campaign officials on Monday to play clean up after a comedian warming up the crowd at his New York rally called Puerto Rico a ""floating island of garbage"" -- drawing outrage from Boricuas far and wide, and boosting support for Harris’ message.
""This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign,"" Danielle Alvarez, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, said in a statement. Trump himself, however, did not comment on the remarks.
While several Republican lawmakers also distanced themselves from the comments, Sen. JD Vance, Trump's running mate, dismissed the controversy, urging Americans ""to stop getting so offended at every little thing in the United States of America — I'm so over it.""
Puerto Rican voters are a crucial bloc in key swing states
Despite Republican efforts to move past the controversy, backlash has continued to build. Puerto Rican celebrities condemned the remarks, with megastar Bad Bunny posting a video Tuesday to his more than 45 million Instagram followers highlighting cultural contributions by Puerto Ricans throughout history. He titled the video ""garbage,"" a nod to the comments at MSG.
Separately, the Harris campaign announced that Jennifer Lopez would speak at a rally with the vice president in Las Vegas on Thursday.
The island’s Republican Party chairman has also threatened to withhold support from Trump unless he issued an apology for the remark, while the archbishop of San Juan posted an open letter to Trump saying he personally needed to apologize, not his campaign.
Puerto Ricans living on the island don’t get to vote in the presidential election. But those living on the mainland do -- and in Pennsylvania, a pivotal state in this year’s race, they wield significant clout.
According to UCLA’s Latino Policy and Politics Institute, about 580,000 Latinos in Pennsylvania can vote in this election -- and most of them are Puerto Rican.
The Trump campaign moved to highlight Puerto Rican voices
Given the potential stakes, the Trump campaign moved to feature several Puerto Rican speakers during his rally in Allentown.
“I am standing here as a proud Puerto Rican,"" Roberto Albino, director of Hispanic engagement at the Pennsylvania Family Institute, said to cheers. Before leading the arena in a prayer he called out to his ""fellow Puerto Rican brothers and sisters"" in Spanish.
""We need leadership, let us not forget what we need,"" he told the crowd.
The first speaker to address the crowd was Tim Ramos, who welcomed Latinos in the crowd.
Ramos promoted Trump as a candidate that could improve the economy and border security.
""From our flag, to our beaches, to our salsa music, we encapsulate true beauty ... diamonds form under pressure and we need a leader who understands that and sees that in us,"" Ramos said. ""Donald Trump is that leader.""
During his address, Trump also invited Republican Zoraida Buxó Santiago, a U.S. Senate shadow delegate, to address the audience. ""We need this man back in the White House,"" she said.
Biden had to do his own damage control
Republicans also jumped on new comments from President Biden in a video call with Voto Latino, where the president sounded like he was calling Trump supporters “garbage.”
Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla, went on stage at the Allentown rally to demand an apology. “We are not garbage: we are patriots who love America,” Rubio said.
The White House quickly issued a transcript to put Biden’s comment in a broader context:
""And just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a 'floating island of garbage.' Well, let me tell you something. I don't -- I -- I don't know the Puerto Rican that -- that I know -- or a Puerto Rico, where I'm fr- -- in my home state of Delaware, they're good, decent, honorable people. The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter’s -- his -- his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it's un-American.""
Later, Biden attempted to clean up his remarks on X, saying that he was referring to the comedian’s joke at the rally.
Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump's supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage—which is the only word I can think of to describe it. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That's all I meant to say. The…

Trump kept his focus on Harris
Speaking earlier in the day from his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump called the ""love"" at the Madison Square Garden event ""breathtaking.""
""There was love in that room,"" he said. ""There was love for the country.""
For the most part, however, he kept his focus on Harris, who on Tuesday delivered her closing argument of the campaign on the same site in Washington, D.C. where Trump held his Jan. 6 rally.
""In less than four years, Kamala Harris has obliterated our borders,"" Trump said. ""They've unleashed war and chaos all over the world. No person has caused so much destruction and death at home and abroad should ever be allowed to be president.""
Trump began the event with unfounded claims about election fraud in ""bad spots"" in Pennsylvania, where he and Harris are in a virtual tie, according to most credible polls. He claimed to be leading in all seven swing states, which are also tied.
His appearance featured the families of those killed by migrants who were in the country illegally; both he and they blamed Harris and Democrats for the presence of illegal immigrants in the country.
Trump also falsely suggested that countries around the world were sending criminals to the United States in order to lower their own crime rates. Border crossings from the Southern border with Mexico are at levels close to those as when Trump left office in 2021.
Trump also blamed Harris for an increase in violent crime, which is down, according to FBI data. He also claimed credit for the recent stock market spike, though the economy has rebounded during the Biden years from the pandemic downturn more rapidly than most other countries around the world.",2024-10-29
NPR,"Sikh separatist, targeted once for assassination, says India still trying to kill him","Sikh separatist, targeted once for assassination, says India still trying to kill him
It is a phone call Gurpatwant Singh Pannun remembers well. It was June 17, 2023. After playing phone tag for a day, he and his close aide in Canada finally managed to connect.
“He told me that he was informed by the Canadian intelligence officials that there is a serious threat to his life and he might be killed,” Pannun recalled.
On that call, his aide, Hardeep Singh Nijjar, said that assassins were coming for Pannun as well. The conversation is seared into Pannun’s memory because of what Nijjar told him — but also because it was the last time the two men spoke.
The following day, gunmen shot Nijjar dead in the parking lot of a Sikh temple outside Vancouver, Canada. Canadian authorities have arrested four Indian nationals in connection with the murder.
Nijjar’s warning for Pannun, a dual U.S.-Canadian citizen, also proved prescient. Five months later, the U.S. Justice Department announced it had foiled a plot to assassinate Pannun in New York City. An Indian national was charged in the alleged murder-for-hire scheme, and has pleaded not guilty.
Nijjar's killing and the purported plan to assassinate Pannun are part of a broader trend around the world in which foreign governments seek to silence critics overseas, including in the United States.
Last week, prosecutors announced charges against a new defendant in Pannun's case: a former Indian intelligence officer, Vikash Yadav, who allegedly orchestrated the plot.
In the last few years, the Justice Department says it has foiled at least four assassination plots tied to a foreign power. Three of those allegedly link back to Iran, including one targeting Iranian-American activist and journalist Masih Alinejad. The fourth — allegedly targeting Pannun — involves India.
The Indian government denies any involvement in Nijjar’s killing or the purported plot against Pannun.
After the U.S. announced charges in the Pannun case, India set up its own internal inquiry to investigate. Just over a week ago, Indian officials were in Washington for meetings to discuss the case and for both sides to provide an update on their respective investigations.
The State Department called the meetings “productive.” The Indian Embassy did not respond to a request for comment.
""Well-documented"" threats from India
Pannun, who was born in India but moved to the U.S. in 1992, told NPR earlier this year that the threat to his life came as no surprise.
“I have been threatened directly by the Indian parliamentarians while sitting in the Indian parliament,” he said. “They have stated that we are going to kill Pannun, even if we have to do a surgical strike. These are well-documented, the statements of the government officials.”
In particular, he points to remarks Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made several times in recent years, including early this July in India’s parliament.
“Today, post 2014, India enters your home and kills you,” Modi said before lawmakers. “Carries out surgical strikes. Carries out air strikes.”
In Pannun’s view, Modi’s threat about how India deals with its perceived enemies is directed at people like him.
Pannun is a Sikh separatist. He is a leading figure in the Khalistan movement, which wants to create an independent Sikh homeland carved out from northern India. He and his organization, Sikhs for Justice, have been spearheading a global referendum for independence.
Khalistan referendum campaign
Pannun is a practicing attorney. At his law office in Queens, boxes of case files and legal books lined the walls. His legal work pays the bills, but much of his time he dedicates to the Khalistan cause.
In his office, he has a green screen set up and camera for the videos he produces and posts online for the campaign.
Behind his desk hung a yellow and blue Khalistan flag. On the wall was a framed picture of the Golden Temple in Amritsar, India, the holiest site in Sikhism.
Pannun and Nijjar first worked together to document the events surrounding the Indian military’s attack on the temple in 1984, known as Operation Blue Star, and the government’s bloody, nearly decade-long effort to stamp out an armed Sikh insurgency fighting for independence. Thousands were killed.
The two men then shifted their focus to the future and started the Khalistan referendum campaign. The idea is to have Sikhs around the world vote on the question of creating an independent Sikh state. It is an unofficial referendum, and not legally binding.
Pannun has dedicated his life to the campaign. He told his family years ago that his advocacy work would put him at odds with India’s government.
“I have told them very clearly what it would entail and where it can lead,” he said. “That’s why when we are talking about assassination attempts and killings and threats, that doesn’t come as a surprise to us. That doesn’t come as a surprise to the family.”
""Survive to the finish line""
The Modi government in 2020 designated Pannun and Nijjar terrorists for their separatist work.
Pannun rejects the allegation. He said he follows the law, and that his campaign is a peaceful, democratic process.
India’s response, he said, has been to come after him, and that has forced him to look over his shoulder.
“That’s how I’m going to survive to the finish line,” he said.
The alleged assassination plot was not a one-off. He said there are active threats against his life right now. That danger has not forced him to end his separatist work, but it has forced him to take precautions.
At his office, a security team screens visitors with a metal detector. Body guards ferry him to and from work. He had security before the alleged plot, he said, but he’s beefed it up since the case was charged last year.
“Today, what you see is very, very obvious,"" he said of his security detail. “This is a message that I’m giving that I’m not out there to do it in suicide mode. I’m going to continue to campaign and I’m going to continue to protect myself.”
Still, the threat on his life has altered, to a degree, how he operates. The interview with NPR was in his office, in part, because it is secure.
“I cannot just abruptly take a car and jump in the car and go anywhere,” he said. “That’s what I have been advised by my security details. That’s where you get killed.”
He’s changed his residence several times since the alleged plot was foiled. He doesn’t go to restaurants much. He said he hasn’t been to the grocery store in years; he gets things delivered instead. And he's curtailed his on-the-ground campaign appearances.
Boycotting Indian-owned businesses
He remains very active online, though, and regularly posts videos on Instagram. Some of them show pro-Khalistan rallies, while others offer heated challenges against India or Indian officials.
In one from last November, Pannun declares: “Sikhs are facing existential threat under the successive India regimes.”
“We are going to target India,” he adds. “From Air India to made in India, we are going to ground everything.”
Some Indian media outlets interpreted that as a threat in light of the 1985 bombing of an Air India passenger jet flying from Canada to India that killed more than 300 people. A Canadian Sikh was found guilty in 2003 for involvement in the bombing. A Canadian court acquitted two others.
Pannun pushed back, calling that interpretation of his video an “Indian narrative,” and saying he was calling for a Sikh boycott of Indian-owned businesses.
“The objective behind it is that I want the (Sikh) community to stop funding their own genocide,” he said. “I want the community not to spend a dime on Indian-owned businesses.”
Breaking up the Indian state
He’s also come under criticism over posters with the words “Kill India” and the names and photos of Indian officials that the placards claim were involved in Nijjar’s killing. One of the officials pictured was Sanjay Kumar Verma, India’s high commissioner, who was among the six Indian diplomats recently expelled from Canada.
Pannun said his goal is to break up the Indian state.
“I say to kill Modi politics. We are in America. We say ‘kill Biden politics,’ we say ‘kill Trump politics,’” Pannun said. “’Kill India’ means balkanize India. India is not a human being. India is in a union of states. We want to balkanize India.”
Some of his posts on social media are about his late colleague and friend, Nijjar. His assassination, Pannun said, has left a hole.
“You feel the vacuum, but then you also get the strength and the courage: what Nijjar stood for, for what he gave his life, for what he has spent the last 15, 16 years with us,” he said.
But Pannun also said there’s no time to sit back and grieve. There is work to be done, a campaign to run, despite the risks.
“I would rather take a bullet in my head than stop the Khalistan referendum campaign,” he said.",2024-10-27
NPR,Harris releases her medical report — and uses it to raise questions about Trump,"Harris releases her medical report — and uses it to raise questions about Trump
Vice President Harris on Saturday released a medical report — a document that her campaign is using to draw a contrast with her older rival — and dared former President Donald Trump to do the same.
This is the first time Harris, 59, has released results of a physical. Similar to reports released by previous commanders-in-chief, the two-page letter says that Harris is in excellent health and has “the physical and mental resiliency required to successfully execute the duties of the presidency.”
Harris told reporters traveling with her that every candidate for president had released medical information ""except Donald Trump in this election cycle.""
""It is clear to me that he and his team do not want the American people to really see what it is that he is doing and whether or not he actually is fit to do the job of being president of the United States,"" she said.
Trump released a three-paragraph letter about his health a year ago
This medical disclosure come as Harris and Trump seem locked in a tie, less than a month before Election Day — each looking for ways to shake up the race and win over the small number of undecided or persuadable voters in swing states.
Harris’ campaign has been raising questions about whether Trump, 78, is up to the job, drawing attention in particular to his rambling and disjointed speeches as a sign that he has slipped.
""He talks at his rallies about fictional characters. He constantly is in a state of grievance about himself,"" Harris said on Saturday, rhyming off a list of failings. ""He is quite unfit to do the job,"" she said.
Trump in Nov. 2023 released a three-paragraph letter from a doctor about his health. It said Trump’s “overall health is excellent” and that his “cognitive exams were exceptional.”
On Saturday, Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung said that the former president had voluntarily released information over the years that showed ""he is in perfect and excellent health to be commander in chief.""
Trump’s health has been a subject of speculation since he first released a short statement as a candidate in 2015 that said he would be “the healthiest individual ever elected” to the office — a letter that his then-doctor later said that Trump himself had dictated. The veracity of subsequent reports were also widely questioned.
When President Biden, 81, was still running for a second term, stumbles, mumbles and mistakes drew headlines and his age became his greatest political liability with voters, while Trump’s age and acuity came under less scrutiny.
After he was seemingly overwhelmed during his June debate with Trump, Biden was pressured by his party to bow out and pass the torch to a younger leader.
Here are some highlights from Harris' medical report
Dr. Joshua Simmons, a White House Medical Unit physician who has been Harris' doctor since Jan. 2021, wrote the three-page report. He said.
- Harris has seasonal allergies and has been on allergen immunotherapy to reduce her symptoms. She occasionally uses Atrovent but has never experienced severe symptoms, angioedema or anaphylaxis, her doctor said.
- She is nearsighted and wears contacts, but can read comfortably without contacts or glasses.
- Her most recent physical exam was in April 2024. She is up-to-date on preventive care like colonoscopy and annual mammograms. She takes a Vitamin D3 supplement.
- She is at low risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.
- She works out daily and eats healthy; does not smoke and drinks only occasionally and in moderation.",2024-10-12
NPR,How the ‘blue dot’ of Omaha could decide the race for president,"How the ‘blue dot’ of Omaha could decide the race for president
OMAHA, Neb. — In August, blue dots started popping up on Omaha lawns like mushrooms.
The signs express support for Vice President Harris — and recognition of the unique role that this congressional district could play on Nov. 5.
Jason Brown was brainstorming ways to make a difference this election year when he found some inspiration in his garage.
“I saw an old yard sign that a neighbor kid had left in our lawn a couple of years back from doing some lawn care, and I had some spray paint,” Brown said.
He drew a blue dot on a white background and used a flower pot to clean up the edges. Jason and his wife Ruth Huebner-Brown thought about putting a slogan on the sign, but decided to let the dot speak for itself.
They put the sign in their yard and immediately it went viral. “People just kept wanting them so we just kept ordering and ordering and painting,” said Huebner-Brown. “Ten went to 100 went to 200 to 400.”
After 5,000 signs, their hands were stained and local hardware stores were running out of Brilliant Blue Rust-Oleum. So they got a professional printer to make more. They are up to 12,500 signs and counting.
It could all come down to Omaha
This very homespun effort comes as the Harris campaign is pouring real resources into winning here. Unlike most other states, Nebraska allocates its electoral votes by congressional district, rather than winner-take-all.
Of the swing states, if Harris were to only win Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania she would be one electoral vote short of the presidency. And that’s where Omaha comes in — a little blue dot with huge stakes for this election.
These blue dots are a “Nebraska nice” way for people to show they plan to vote for Harris in a time of partisan polarization and discord. And Republicans took notice.
“When the blue dots appeared I probably fielded at least 30 or 40 phone calls in a matter of probably an hour and a half,” said Theresa Thibodeau, co-chair of a group called Red State Nebraska.
Blue dot — or red state?
Thibodeau’s group started printing its own signs: a simple red map of Nebraska on a white background.
“We are not a blue dot — we are a red state — and that’s the statement that we want to make with that,” Thibodeau said.
She says some people come in asking for four or five signs to compete with all the blue dots around them.
“A lot of people who maybe aren’t particularly comfortable with having a certain candidate sign in their yard, they feel comfortable having a red state sign,” Thibodeau said.
Thibodeau and dozens of volunteers spent part of last week hanging little red plastic bags with Republican campaign literature on thousands of doors, targeting low-propensity voters in hopes of boosting GOP candidates up and down the ballot.
A failed effort to change Nebraska winner-take-all
The limited public polls that exist show Harris with a firm lead here. A campaign office in a nondescript office building hummed with action last Wednesday night as Democratic volunteers reminded people to send in their absentee ballots.
In September, Former President Donald Trump and his allies made a last-ditch failed push to get the state’s legislature to move to a winner-take-all system for its electoral votes.
During that effort, John Fredrickson, a Democratic state senator, who represents a Republican majority district in Omaha, said he heard a lot push-back from voters – Republicans and Democrats alike.
“I like to call [the district] the purple dot because the reality is, that electoral vote has gone to Republican administrations, it’s gone to Democrat administrations. It goes back and forth,” said Fredrickson. “It truly is a swing district.”
The Harris campaign has poured resources into Omaha
It’s not just homemade signs. The Harris campaign has spent $5 million on advertising so far here, while Trump has only spent about $200,000, according to data from ad-tracking firm AdImpact.
Republican VP nominee JD Vance has campaigned here and Democratic VP candidate Tim Walz is in Omaha for a repeat visit on Saturday.
At a blue dot sign pickup party in the city last week, Laurie Churchill said she likes that national politicians have to pay attention to Nebraska because of the way it allocates its Electoral College voters.
“Other than our little blue dot we would be totally ignored, so we like being able to not be ignored and we think that’s the way it should be for everybody,” Churchill said.
Churchill drove an hour from Lincoln to get her sign. “We have just caught the blue dot fever. We’re so excited with what they do. It’s so grassroots,” Churchill said.
This weekend, a group called Blue Dot Energy is organizing an event in Omaha’s Memorial Park to create a giant human blue dot and photograph it using a drone.
It’s just the latest effort to generate hype ahead of the election. Ryan Wilkins, one of the organizers, says it’s about sending a signal that people are not alone.
“It's just a dot. It doesn't feel like much. The world feels big and you feel small. But what happens when the dots become a drizzle and the drizzle becomes a storm and the storm becomes a wave and the wave, the tsunami,” Wilkins said, waxing philosophical.
He even put that sentiment into a rap.
“In a lot of states, there's just not really any question as to which way it's going to go, blue or red,” said Wilkins, noting the unique opportunity in his district to see its electoral vote go for Harris.
“And there's even a scenario in which that electoral vote could be decisive. So we wanted to do everything we could in our neck of the woods to get that outcome,” he said.

NPR,Grammy-winning rapper Lil Durk is charged in murder-for-hire conspiracy,"Grammy-winning rapper Lil Durk is charged in murder-for-hire conspiracy
FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — Grammy Award-winning rapper Lil Durk has been arrested in Florida on federal charges that he paid for the attempted 2022 revenge killing of rapper Quando Rondo at a Los Angeles gas station, a shooting that resulted in the death of Rondo's cousin.
Durk, 32, is charged with conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire in the slaying of Saviay'a Robinson, 24, who was gunned down on Aug. 19, 2022, according to an FBI affidavit released Friday.
Five other members of Durk's Chicago-based rap collective, “Only the Family"" or “OTF,” have also been arrested and at least two more arrests may be forthcoming, according to court documents that have been filed. Durk was arrested Thursday night in South Florida as he attempted to flee the country, the FBI says.
Durk, whose real name is Durk Banks, won a Grammy earlier this year for Best Melodic Rap Performance for his song “All My Life,” which featured J. Cole. He has also been nominated three times and was a featured performer on Drake's “Laugh Now Cry Later.”
Martin Estrada, the U.S. attorney for Los Angeles, called the shooting “a cold-blooded murder.""
“The shooting occurred in the open, at a gas station at a busy intersection, endangering many others in the area,"" Estrada said in a statement. “Violent gun crime of this sort is devastating to our community and we will have zero-tolerance for those who perpetrate such callous acts of violence.”
FBI Agent Sarah Corcoran said in her affidavit that OTF members engage “in violence, including murder and assault, at the direction of Banks and to maintain their status in OTF.”
Durk's representatives did not immediately respond to emails Friday seeking comment.
According to Corcoran's affidavit and other federal court records, the shooting stems from the November 2020 slaying of OTF rapper King Von, 26, at an Atlanta nightclub after Von and Rondo got into a fight. Records say a friend of Rondo's pulled a gun and shot Von several times, killing him. Von, whose real name was Dayvon Bennett, had two hit singles, ″Crazy Story″ and “Took Her to the O.”
Authorities say Durk made it known that he would “pay a bounty” to anyone who killed Rondo, whose real name is Tyquian Bowman.
Almost two years later, a murder plot quickly came together, Corcoran wrote.
On Aug. 18, 2022, Durk's associates learned that Rondo was staying at a Los Angeles hotel. That day, Deandre Wilson, Keith Jones, David Lindsey, Asa Houston and a fifth unnamed suspect flew from Chicago to San Diego and then drove to Los Angeles using funds provided by Durk, Corcoran said.
That day, Durk allegedly texted an associate arranging the flights, “Don’t book no flights under no names involved wit me.” Corcoran said there is video evidence that Durk was staying at a house in the San Fernando Valley that day.
Once arriving in Los Angeles, the OTF members met Kayon Grant, who had flown there on a private jet. Grant, a top OTF associate, got the men hotel rooms, purchased four ski masks and obtained two luxury sedans, court records say. Grant allegedly gave Jones, Lindsey and a third unnamed suspect guns, including one that had been converted into a machine gun.
The next day, the group allegedly followed Rondo and Robinson as they drove a Cadillac Escalade to a Los Angeles marijuana dispensary, a West Hollywood clothing store and then a gas station across the street from the Beverly Center.
There, Houston allegedly parked his car behind the station so Jones, Lindsey and the unnamed defendant could ambush Rondo. They got out and opened fire, killing Robinson, who was standing outside the Escalade, but missing Rondo, the indictment and news stories about the shooting say.
The suspects then went to an In-N-Out hamburger stand where they discussed payment with Grant and then flew home to Chicago from San Diego, Corcoran and other documents say. Wilson allegedly later paid Jones and Lindsey an undisclosed amount.
Grant, Jones, Lindsey, Wilson and Houston were arrested Thursday in Chicago on conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire charges. No attorney information was immediately available for those men in court records.
After their arrests, Corcoran wrote, Durk booked two flights from South Florida airports — one to Dubai and one to Switzerland. He then booked a private flight to Italy, but was arrested in Miami before he could board it.
Durk and the other defendants are being held pending their transfer to Los Angeles.
In 2019, Durk and King Von were charged in Atlanta with a drive-by shooting that left a man wounded in the leg. Prosecutors dropped the case against Durk in 2022, two years after Von's slaying. Durk had denied his involvement.
In 2014, Durk pleaded guilty to felony aggravated unlawful use of a weapon and felony possession of a firearm after he was seen carrying a gun on a Chicago street. He was spared jail time.
Two villages in Chicago’s western suburbs, Bellwood and Broadview, last week honored Durk and announced collaborations with his charity, Neighborhood Heroes Foundation, to provide youth mentors.
But on Friday, Broadview Mayor Katrina Thompson announced she had severed ties to Neighborhood Heroes and had withdrawn the honorary key to the village given Durk.
While acknowledging that Durk and other suspects are presumed innocent, village residents have “even higher moral and ethical standards of behavior,” Thompson wrote on the village’s Facebook page.
A telephone message seeking comment from Andre Harvey, Bellwood’s mayor, was left at his office.",2024-10-26
NPR,"Trump campaign hack traced to three Iranians seeking to disrupt election, DOJ says","Trump campaign hack traced to three Iranians seeking to disrupt election, DOJ says
The Justice Department on Friday unveiled criminal charges against three Iranian hackers employed by Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corp. for targeting and compromising the electronic accounts of Trump campaign aides and others.
The indictment alleges the hacking is part of Iran's effort to erode confidence in the U.S. electoral process ahead of the November presidential election.
Attorney General Merrick Garland, speaking at a press conference on Friday, said the U.S. government is tracking various plots by Iran to harm American officials, including former president and current Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
""These hackers impersonated US government officials, used the fake personas they created to engage in spearphishing, and then exploited their unauthorized access to trick even more people and steal even more confidential information,"" FBI Director Christopher Wray said on Friday, according to his prepared remarks.
The FBI had been investigating after the Trump campaign last month said it had been hacked and suggested Iran was involved, without providing specific evidence for that.
The three men are accused of wire fraud; conspiracy to obtain information from protected computers; and material support to a terrorist organization.
Garland said both the Trump and Harris campaigns have been cooperating with the investigation.
The defendants are outside the reach of the U.S. and it’s not clear when, if ever, American authorities may be able to arrest them.
Several technology companies have also been monitoring and reporting on hacking threats to the U.S. from foreign countries, including Iran.
Google Threat Intelligence Group's John Hultquist said Iran's attacks are constantly evolving.
Hackers from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard ""regularly assume the guise of hacktivists or criminals and have increasingly targeted random individuals through email and even text messages,"" he said in a statement.
""Most of this activity is designed to undermine trust in security, and is used to attack confidence in elections in particular.""",2024-09-27
NPR,"Trump was targeted in apparent 'attempted assassination,' the FBI says","Trump was targeted in apparent 'attempted assassination,' the FBI says
The FBI said former President Donald Trump was the target of what the agency said “appears to be an attempted assassination” on Sunday afternoon at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Fla.
A suspect, identified by local officials as Ryan Wesley Routh, is in custody.
In a news conference on Sunday, Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said the Secret Service alerted local authorities about multiple gunshots at the course around 1:30 p.m. ET.
According to Bradshaw, a Secret Service agent who was stationed one hole ahead of Trump spotted an AK-style rifle sticking out of a fence at the golf course. The agent ""immediately engaged"" with the person holding the rifle. That's when the suspect took off in a black Nissan. A spokesperson for the Secret Service said agents opened fire at the individual.
Bradshaw said the suspect was about 300 to 500 yards from Trump. ""With a rifle and scope like that, it's not a long distance,"" he said. He added that the suspect left two book bags and a GoPro camera.
A witness was able to provide authorities with the suspect's car model and license plate, according to Bradshaw. Officers later located Routh on Interstate 95.
Martin County Sheriff William D. Snyder told WPLG that the suspect was “relatively calm” when detained. “He was not displaying a lot of emotions. Never asked, ‘What is this about?’” Snyder added.
In July, the Republican presidential nominee was wounded in an assassination attempt by a gunshot at a rally in Butler, Pa.
Trump 'safe and well'
In an email sent out by his campaign, Trump wrote ""There were gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL!”
Trump later wrote on Truth Social to ""thank everyone for your concern and well wishes,"" and wrote, ""It was certainly an interesting day!""
Trump's post continued: ""Most importantly, I want to thank the U.S. Secret Service, Sheriff Ric Bradshaw and his Office of brave and dedicated Patriots, and, all of Law Enforcement, for the incredible job done today at Trump International in keeping me, as the 45th President of the United States, and the Republican Nominee in the upcoming Presidential Election, SAFE. THE JOB DONE WAS ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING. I AM VERY PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN!""
Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, said he spoke to Trump after the shooting. “I'm glad President Trump is safe. I spoke to him before the news was public and he was, amazingly, in good spirits,” he wrote on X.
Local officials said the whole golf course would have been surrounded if it had been a sitting president. But for a presidential nominee, there were only some Secret Service agents with him and the shrubbery surrounding the golf course made detection harder.
""The threat level is high,"" Rafael Barros, Special Agent in Charge of the Miami Field Office, told news reporters, adding that “we have increased the amount of assets.” He added, ""We live in dangerous times.""
The White House said President Biden and Vice President Harris were also briefed about the security incident at the Trump International golf course.
""They are relieved to know that he is safe. They will be kept regularly updated by their team,"" the statement said. Attorney General Merrick Garland has also been briefed and is monitoring the situation, his office said.
The Secret Service also briefed Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer about the incident, and he praised the Secret Service for their quick work.
""There is no place in this country for political violence of any kind. The perpetrator must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,"" he said in a statement.",2024-09-15
NPR,A judge orders Virginia to restore registered voters purged too close to Election Day,"A judge orders Virginia to restore registered voters purged too close to Election Day
A voter removal program in Virginia illegally purged registered voters from the state’s rolls too close to this fall’s election, a federal judge ruled Friday.
U.S. District Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles, who was nominated by President Biden, has ordered the state to put removed voters back on the state’s registration list and blocked Virginia from “continuing any systematic program intended to remove the names of ineligible voters” through Election Day.
“Virginia will immediately petition the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals and, if necessary, the U.S. Supreme Court, for an emergency stay of the injunction,” Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin said in a statement.
Former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate, voiced his support for Virginia’s appeal on his social media platform, calling the order “a totally unacceptable travesty.”
Eligible voters in Virginia still have time to register to vote in this fall’s election. In-person voter registration continues at voting sites through Election Day.
The ruling marks the second time this month a federal court has temporarily blocked voter purging efforts by a Republican-led state for violating the National Voter Registration Act.
Passed in 1993, the federal law bans Virginia and most other states from systematically removing registered voters within the 90 days before a federal election. That “quiet period,” which began in August for this fall’s races, is designed so that eligible voters have enough time to work out any issues before they’re kicked off lists and can’t cast a ballot in an upcoming election.
In August, Youngkin issued an executive order calling for “daily updates” to the state’s voter rolls in order to remove people who were not able to verify they are U.S. citizens to the state’s Department of Motor Vehicles.
The Justice Department and immigrant advocacy groups argued in court that this voter removal program was carried out during the 90-day quiet period and relied on DMV data that can be wrong or out of date to determine people’s U.S. citizenship status.
After the judge ruled, challengers of Virginia’s program said the court’s decision would help ensure naturalized U.S. citizens in Virginia can exercise their right to vote this fall.
“Every American citizen, regardless of where they were born, has the freedom to vote,” Paul Smith, the Campaign Legal Center’s senior vice president, said in a statement. “We’re glad the court acted so every Virginian can make their voice heard in this upcoming election.”
""Last-minute voter purges not only violate the law but also undermine the core principles of our democracy, especially when they are premised on xenophobic lies,"" said Celina Stewart, CEO of the League of Women Voters of the United States, in a statement.
Trump has claimed on his social media platform that the DOJ case against Virginia was filed to help Democrats “cheat” in the upcoming election. There is no evidence for that assertion.
Documents that the court ordered the state to release show that Virginia’s program has removed more than 1,600 registered voters from its rolls during the quiet period, Ryan Snow, an attorney with the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, who is representing the groups challenging Virginia, said Wednesday during a call with reporters.
Last week, a federal judge blocked a similar program led by Alabama Secretary of State Wes Allen, a Republican. U.S. District Judge Anna Manasco, who was nominated by Trump, ruled that Allen “blew the deadline” under the National Voter Registration Act when he announced a voter purge program 84 days before the last day of voting.

NPR,Steve Bannon feels 'empowered' after four months in federal prison,"Steve Bannon feels 'empowered' after four months in federal prison
Steve Bannon, the right-wing podcaster and one-time political adviser to former President Donald Trump, was released from federal prison Tuesday morning after serving four months behind bars for contempt of Congress.
Bannon was convicted in 2022 on two counts for defying subpoenas from the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters. He left prison a week before Election Day, as Trump and Vice President Harris deliver their respective closing messages in a tight race for the White House.
Just hours after his release, Bannon returned to host a new episode of his daily podcast, “War Room.” Dressed in a black shirt and with his gray hair slicked back, Bannon falsely claimed that former Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sent him to federal prison as a political prisoner “to tamp down the power of this show and to break me.”
“Four months in federal prison didn’t break me. It empowered me,” Bannon told his online audience. “I’m more energized and more focused than I’ve been in my entire life.”
Bannon echoed the false argument of other Republicans, including Trump, who accuse Democrats of weaponizing the Justice Department and the legal system against members of the party.
Bannon served his four-month sentence at the federal lockup in Danbury, Conn. Another former Trump aide, Peter Navarro, also served four months in prison after being convicted of the same charges.
A variety of people filled in on the “War Room” podcast while Bannon was in prison. He marked his return to the podcast with a fiery message for Trump’s supporters ahead of Election Day, telling them: “This is a fight not simply for the direction of this country but what this country stands for.”
Democrats, Bannon claimed, “have no intention of giving up power.”
Trump’s supporters in Congress also have lobbed accusations of politicization against the Justice Department, pointing to the two federal indictments brought against the former president for allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 election and for hoarding classified documents.
Attorney General Merrick Garland has rejected the allegations. In recent years, the department has twice indicted President Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, for gun and tax crimes; charged two Democratic members of Congress with corruption; indicted the Democratic mayor of New York City on corruption charges; and investigated the president himself over his handling of classified documents after his vice presidency.
At a news conference later in the day, Bannon said his immediate focus is getting Trump supporters to the polls before and on Nov. 5, and on ensuring ""election integrity.""
""My focus is on victory next Tuesday and the biggest number possible, because folks: don't think it's going to end on Tuesday,"" he said. ""This is going to take a while to sort through.""
That said, Bannon accused the Harris campaign of preparing for a possibly contentious legal fight after Election Day. He left out that the Trump campaign is making similar preparations.",2024-10-29
NPR,"Faced with obstacles to abortion, military women have built their own support system","Faced with obstacles to abortion, military women have built their own support system
Air Force Staff Sgt. Octavia James has helped fellow airmen navigate the difficult choices faced by women in the military when they are contemplating an abortion.
People usually seek James out when they don’t feel comfortable going to a commanding officer. She has invited airmen to stay in her apartment in Norfolk, Va., while they recover from an abortion. She recalls once having to help a friend out of the shower because her sedation was slow to wear off.
“Every person's different,” she said. “Everybody recovers different, everybody needs different things after, and everybody's seeking an abortion for a different reason. So I can't tell you what's best for you. But if you need me, I'm here.”
Seeking an abortion has always presented unique challenges for women in the military. For decades, a measure known as the Hyde amendment has banned federal funding for most abortions, and only allows military doctors to perform abortions in the case of rape, incest or where the life of the mother is at stake.
But more than two years after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, striking down the constitutional right to abortion, the obstacles for members of the military have only gotten harder. Some 40% of women in the military now serve in states with abortion bans or expanded abortion restrictions.
This new landscape has left many service members scrambling to navigate their options, having to figure out how to travel — sometimes hundreds of miles from base — even though they’re not free to leave whenever they want. The military has tried to make it easier by creating a policy that allows extra leave and paid travel for women seeking an abortion outside of the military, but the policy was used just 12 times from June to December last year, according to the Pentagon.
Instead, women in the military are often relying on an ad-hoc peer support system that many compared to an “underground railroad” of military women helping one another, according to interviews with more than 40 current and former service members, advocates and researchers..
“Women are coming up with their own solutions,” said Caitlin Clason, a former Army captain and fellow at the University of Pennsylvania who researches how women in the military access abortion. “As a healthcare provider, we can do better for these service women who have volunteered to serve our country, and we should do better.”
Women are going where they feel welcome
A short drive from James’ home in Norfolk, Virginia Beach has become part of an informal network of military towns seeing an increase in military clients as state laws change. The area has the highest concentration of U.S. Navy personnel in the world. The city also has the most military clients for Planned Parenthood in Virginia, according to the organization.
“I think a lot of military folks have friends in other areas with a high military population. So if I'm stationed in Jacksonville, I might know someone in Virginia Beach that I can stay with,” said Merrin Cenicola, a nurse at the clinic.
Virginia is becoming a hub for abortion care as other states with large military populations, including Georgia and Texas, impose strict limits. Abortion remains legal in Virginia through the end of the second trimester, in line with the protections that were allowed under Roe.
On average, women stationed in states with strict limits on abortion are traveling hundreds of extra miles to access care since Roe was struck down. The average travel time for a woman stationed in Texas is more than eight hours by car, according to research published in JAMA.
The maze of laws can be a particular problem for women who have only recently transferred to a base and might not know the area. North Carolina now has a 12 week ban on abortions, but it also requires patients to come for a consultation and then come back for the procedure. A second visit may require another request for leave, Clason said.
“I am not trying to make light of the very real issues that civilian women have, but you do not need your boss's legal permission to travel more than a certain number of miles,” Clason said. “That is the first hurdle that active duty service women deal with. The second is you do not choose where you live.”
One Air Force sergeant who spoke with NPR recalled her experience trying to get an abortion after being transferred from Germany to Minot Air Force Base in North Dakota in 2022, after the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization striking down Roe. NPR has agreed to withhold her name because she feared the decision could follow her.
“My son was six months at the time,” she said. “I had also suddenly lost my mom unexpectedly, right before I gave birth to my son. So mentally, I just was not there. I could not handle another kid.”
She and her husband drove more than four hours to the only clinic in North Dakota. She said her Air Force provider seemed sympathetic but hands off.
“I did not get any information from him.” The only other resources she got, she said, was from a local health clinic.
But when the state’s near-total abortion ban took effect, the clinic shut down. She received the medication for her abortion just before it closed.
A chilling effect
Current and former service members who spoke with NPR say these types of challenges date as far back to 1977, when the Hyde Amendment first went into effect. Nearly 50 years later, they say, the language continues to have a chilling effect on some providers.
The physician who helped coordinate Navy Lt. Commander Juliette Ruff’s abortion in 2016 with a local clinic in Japan, felt obligated to clock out so she wasn’t being paid by the federal government while she helped her.
“She was doing it on her own personal time,” Ruff said. “She was not doing it as an affiliate of the medical system. We became friends through the process.”
Ruff is also a nurse stationed at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in North Carolina and makes herself available to women to answer questions online — part of the informal network of military women helping one another, she said.
There are private groups set up to help women pay for abortions — including women in the military. The National Network of Abortion Funds does not list any fund geared specifically to very particular needs of women in the military.
“You need somebody who was impacted to start that type of a group. You have to have funding and resources to do that. As women in the military, we're a fairly small percentage of our overall force,” Ruff said.
Few women have used the Pentagon’s travel policy
After Dobbs, the Pentagon created a travel and leave policy that pays for off-base travel and up to three weeks of leave for uncovered reproductive care, which includes abortion or in-vitro fertilization. To increase the level of privacy, the policy also gives women 20 weeks to inform their command that they are pregnant.
Advocates say the program is a good first step, but they also worry that it's not been promoted enough.
The policy has also drawn critics. Republican Senator Tommy Tuberville of Alabama held up confirmation of all top military appointments for months in protest of the policy.
Earlier this year, the Pentagon said the program was used just 12 times from June to December last year. The Defense Department did not release figures for the months prior to that, and declined to provide updated figures beyond the end of last year. It responded to a request for comment by referring NPR to a list of existing Pentagon policies.
Advocates say one potential change that could make the program easier to use would be to have military doctors issue the leave, so women won’t have to ask their commands for time off. Andrea Ward-Wiley, a former nurse at a clinic at Naval Air Station Fallon in Nevada, suggested having a person at each base who is point of contact for non-covered reproductive health options, similar to the advocates for victims of sexual assault that are common on military bases.
There are still deep concerns that having an abortion could follow someone throughout their career, said Jackii Wang, senior legislative analyst with the National Women’s Law Center.
“There's a stigma around abortion in the military,” Wang said. “I talk to women service members and they have left the military, often feeling like that system failed them in so many ways. I think that extends to their experience with reproductive health care in the military.”
Air Force Lt. Col. Sharon Arana is stationed at Joint Base Langley-Eustis, Va. In 2009, she was in officers training school in Alabama. She remembers her and her husband stopping outside the base to take a pregnancy test.
“I was in a gas station bathroom because I didn’t want to do it in the dorms, thinking what if someone finds this in the trash,” she said.
Arana leads Sword Athena, an Air Force group that looks at barriers women face in the Air Force — including access to abortion. After Dobbs, she compiled an anonymous survey of over 1,000 women about their experiences with abortion in the military. One woman sold her car to pay for an abortion. Other women said they were denied leave.
Arana has found no consistency in the information or help women were provided — 93% of women were not offered mental health counseling and 88% didn’t receive convalescent leave, according to her findings. Women encountered providers with moral objections to providing even contraception.
The data helped inform the Pentagon’s travel policy, but the program hasn’t fixed some of the underlying problems, she said.
“What we were seeing was that a lot of the people in the military who are getting abortion are those of our airmen who are still in training or living in the dorms,” she said. “They haven't learned yet how to advocate for themselves. And they are kind of beholden to their leadership to take care of them.”",2024-10-29

Vice President Harris toured a semiconductor plant in the swing state of Michigan on Monday to highlight big federal investments in manufacturing jobs that former President Donald Trump has recently panned.
The investments come from the CHIPS and Science Act — a bipartisan bill that's pouring $54 billion into the semiconductor manufacturing industry to try to bring back an industry that is dominated by Taiwan, South Korea and China.
""Look: we've got to win the competition for the 21st century. We're not gonna have China beat us in the competition for the 21st century,"" Harris said after touring a factory near Saginaw owned by Corning that makes polysilicon used in semiconductors.
The company received $325 million in CHIPS funding, and is nearly doubling its workforce to 3,000 people as it expands.
""These are the type of jobs that pay 40% above the regional median,"" Corning's chief executive Wendell Weeks said. ""They help people build lives, raise families and foster strong communities.""
The visit comes as some Democrats urge Harris to focus more on the economy in the waning days of the campaign.
Investments from the CHIPS Act have supported massive expansions of the semiconductor industry in Arizona — another swing state — as well as other regions of the country. The White House has said the projects backed by CHIPS funding have helped create more than 115,000 jobs.
On Friday, Trump blasted the law during a lengthy interview on The Joe Rogan Experience. ""That chip deal is so bad, Trump said on the podcast, saying the subsidies went to ""rich companies.""

NPR,A baseless voting claim is being amplified by a network of social media accounts,"A baseless voting claim is being amplified by a network of social media accounts
A network of accounts on the social media site X claiming to be foreign nationals who have illegally voted in the U.S. presidential election, according to new research from the nonprofit Institute for Strategic Dialogue.
The accounts have multiple signatures that suggest they are coordinated, drawing the attention of researchers in the final stretch of election.
Some of the accounts have shared images of ballots alongside passports, including from countries that no longer exist, including the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany and Prussia, the disinformation and extremism research organization reported. The accounts are reinforcing baseless narratives about voter fraud promoted by former President Donald Trump and his allies. The most popular post, sporting an image of a French passport, has racked up more than 12 million views on X, formerly Twitter.
ISD said that the first post from the network was published on Oct. 22, not long after Republicans filed lawsuits challenging overseas voters’ ballots in a few swing states. Those lawsuits cast doubt on the eligibility of some overseas voters. Trump falsely claimed in a social media post in September that Democrats intended to use overseas ballots to “CHEAT” and manipulate the election results. The lawsuits have not found success in the courts.
The Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act, or UOCAVA, lets states set up systems to allow military members and American citizens living overseas to vote. The allegations surrounding the law are part of a larger narrative that the election will be stolen from Trump through a combination of lax voting laws and the possibility that noncitizens will illegally vote in large numbers and swing the very tight presidential race.
Multiple studies have found that noncitizen voting is extremely rare. Still, Trump-supporting Republicans have latched onto the idea and may use claims that noncitizens voted to challenge the election results.
While the baseless claims about overseas voting frame Trump as the victim of illegal votes cast for Vice President Kamala Harris, many of the accounts that ISD identified boast that they actually voted for Trump in swing states.
“I’m going to illegally vote for Donald Trump as a European national,” said one post.
One sign that accounts may be coordinated is that many of the posts shared identical language and images. Some repeat the phrase “Democrats had it coming for not enforcing voter ID laws.” Republicans in many states have long pushed for stricter voter ID laws.
The accounts may have received algorithmic amplification from X. An ISD researcher received a push notification from X about one of the posts, even though the researcher did not follow the account. The posts have also circulated on the Telegram messaging app, where they have been promoted by accounts that share Russian propaganda, and the message board 4chan, ISD said.
X did not respond to a request for comment.
ISD was unable to say who is behind the apparently coordinated network of accounts. Influence operations run by foreign governments are known to amplify domestic tensions to drive up tension and chaos in the U.S.
“Given this threat landscape, it is critical for platforms like X to appropriately label these types of posts” the report said.",2024-10-29
NPR,The ongoing lawsuits over whose mail-in ballots must be counted in Pennsylvania,"The ongoing lawsuits over whose mail-in ballots must be counted in Pennsylvania
Right now, there are several ongoing lawsuits across the state over whose mail-in ballots must be counted. With polls suggesting a tight presidential race, the final outcome of the cases could be key.
MARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:
In the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania, voters have already begun sending in their ballots by mail. Right now there are several ongoing lawsuits across the state over whose mail-in ballots must be counted. The final outcome of these cases could help determine who wins Pennsylvania's electoral votes, which could really matter, with polls suggesting we are in for a tight presidential race. NPR voting rights correspondent Hansi Lo Wang has been tracking this and is here now. Hi, Hansi.
HANSI LO WANG, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise.
KELLY: What is the focus of these lawsuits?
WANG: They're all focused on what to do when a mail-in voter in Pennsylvania returns an absentee ballot on time but doesn't follow other rules for getting their vote counted.
KELLY: OK, before we get into the details, who is bringing these lawsuits?
WANG: Well, it's been voting rights groups, and they're arguing that sometimes voters make mistakes, and those who do should not have their ballots rejected. But Republican groups have been pushing back, and generally, they're arguing in the court that the state's election rules are the rules, and they should be followed exactly. You know, what's interesting is that all of these legal questions could be resolved by state lawmakers. In fact, a bipartisan advisory board recommended changes to Pennsylvania's election law to, quote, ""eliminate confusion and litigation."" But there's been partisan gridlock in Pennsylvania, so voters in the state really have to pay close attention to all the required steps for mail-in voting.
KELLY: OK, so they have to do each step exactly as it has been laid out. What are the steps?
WANG: If you are voting by mail in Pennsylvania, you have to first seal your completed ballot inside a yellow-colored secrecy envelope and put that yellow envelope inside an outer return envelope. And before you return it, you have to add your signature on that return envelope and handwrite the current date under your signature.
KELLY: Go back to one of the things you just said about that - the yellow secrecy envelopes - because those have been the focus of some of this litigation.
WANG: Yeah, election officials have been calling ballots that come without those secrecy envelopes naked ballots. And if you're missing that yellow secrecy envelope, your ballot is not supposed to be counted. But there's a lawsuit over whether Pennsylvania voters whose naked ballots are rejected can cast provisional ballots in person on Election Day. And this month the Pennsylvania Supreme Court said, yes, those provisional ballots should be counted, but this afternoon the Republican National Committee asked the U.S. Supreme Court to weigh in.
KELLY: OK, I got it. And then what about that other step you mentioned - ballots in return envelopes but that maybe are missing the current date handwritten by the voter?
WANG: Right. Some call these undated and misdated ballots. And to be clear, we're talking about ballots that arrive on time, but the issue is about this artifact of Pennsylvania's election rules that require the voter to handwrite the current date on that outer return envelope. And for now, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has ruled these undated or misdated ballots should not be counted, but that may not be the final word before Election Day. I'm watching a case out of Philadelphia that's working its way up the state courts.
KELLY: OK, so we're talking about what's happening in Pennsylvania. What should absentee voters in other states be keeping in mind as they're maybe looking at mail-in ballots and we're getting step by step closer to Election Day?
WANG: You know, mail-in voters in every state should take real care when they're returning their ballots. We often see thousands of ballots rejected in a state's election because of mistakes. And I should point out tomorrow is the postal service's suggested deadline for returning your ballot if it arrives - so it arrives by Election Day. And after that, absentee voters may want to consider returning their ballot in person...
KELLY: Right.
WANG: ...At their county election office or at a drop box if there's one nearby.
KELLY: NPR's Hansi Lo Wang. Thank you.
WANG: You're welcome.

NPR,"The U.S. has had a long history of political violence, but experts see a new trend","The U.S. has had a long history of political violence, but experts see a new trend
Just days before the apparent second attempted assassination of Donald Trump, Colin Clarke gathered in New York with experts for a global summit on counterterrorism and political violence.
Clarke, director of research at a security and intelligence consulting firm called the Soufan Group, said a feeling of dread was shared even then.
“There's a real sense of urgency and concern that we are going to see more political violence surrounding this upcoming election,” he said.
This weekend’s events have only compounded that sense of foreboding.
On Sunday, 58-year-old Ryan Routh allegedly tried to assassinate the former president while he was golfing at his Florida club. Routh appeared in federal court on Monday, but so far, law enforcement authorities have not disclosed a known motive behind the episode. Nonetheless, the incident has intensified concerns over the growth of political violence in the U.S., and the likelihood of it worsening in the remaining weeks before the election.
“I'm very pessimistic about where we're heading in the lead-up to November,” said Clarke.
Uptick in political violence
The U.S. has a long history of political violence, but multiple sources suggest that the scope and frequency of political harassment, threats and violence are reaching new levels. Gary LaFree, a criminology professor at the University of Maryland and former director of the UMD National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START Center), said that the center’s data indicate that the trend began almost a decade ago.
One database, which tracks incidents of terrorism across the globe, shows that the 1970s were a high water mark for political violence in the U.S. A wide range of groups committed criminal acts in attempts to coerce policy change or instill mass fear, including activists for Puerto Rican independence, domestic terrorists like the Ku Klux Klan, anti-Vietnam war agitators and the far-right, militant Jewish Defense League. But the numbers fell sharply in decades following.
“We had some years where we didn't have a single case that qualified for our database as terrorism in the United States in the 2000s,” said LaFree. “And then we start to see this uptick in about 2015, 2016.”
LaFree said there’s a notable difference in the ideology underpinning attacks in the 1970s versus during the last decade.
“Back in the '70s, most of the action was coming from leftist groups,” he said. “The big players right now are right-wing groups, actually.”
Everyday political violence
Beyond incidents that qualify as terroristic, however, there is a growing sense that everyday political violence has been on the rise. For two years, the Bridging Divides Initiative and CivicPulse have conducted quarterly surveys of local elected officials to assess the level of harassment, threats and violence they experience. It has found baseline levels of hostility against these officials to be consistently high.
“It's part of the larger atmospherics that we have in this country, where nearly anything you do could be perceived as having some kind of political connection, no matter the kind of position you may have,” said Jason Blazakis, director of the Center on Terrorism, Extremism and Counterterrorism at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.
Blazakis said this development, in which everyday Americans find themselves in the crosshairs of the so-called “culture wars” that animate political rivalry, is part of a dangerous stew.
“Those atmospherics, coupled with the election polarization driven by the rise of conspiracy theories, mis- and disinformation, and then the global political scene... is making for a really dangerous situation,” he said. “And then you add to that sort of recipe our gun culture and the easy access people have to guns.”
Stoking the flames
Among the most concerning aspects of this growth in political violence is the role that high-profile figures have played in amplifying conspiracy theories and lies. In the days following the nationally televised debate between Trump and Vice President Harris, in which the former president parroted debunked narratives about immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, bomb threats against city facilities and schools followed, and Haitian immigrants have reported feeling unsafe.
After Sunday’s apparent attempted assassination of Trump, Elon Musk published and then deleted a post on X, the social media platform that he owns, that some took to be a call for assassination attempts against Harris and President Biden. Musk has claimed that the post was meant as a joke.
In the counterterrorism world, Blazakis said that these kinds of statements from influential figures can have real-world consequences — something known as “stochastic” terrorism.
“Stochastic terrorism isn't necessarily a kind of terrorism that might be necessarily motivated by a certain strain or ideology, but instigated by the rhetoric of individuals being inspired to carry out, for instance, attacks based on the dog whistles of somebody who might be a charismatic leader,” said Blazakis.
Clarke said stochastic terrorism, however, is complex, because those who peddle conspiracy theories and incendiary narratives often deny any relation to violence that may follow.
“The almost egging on or kind of walking right up to the line and kind of pushing supporters right into that kind of mindset, that engaging in any type of violence is actually noble in some ways,” said Clarke. “But then when people are questioned, they easily back away and say, ‘Oh, no, no, that was merely, you know, heated rhetoric.’ Or, ‘I was trying to mimic what the other side was saying about me.’ No one ever takes responsibility for this, but words we know have consequences, especially when people are riled up.”
Concern about the weeks to come
So far, there has been little evidence that Trump’s campaign and other influential voices on the right are backing away from public statements that deepen division and grievance. On Tuesday, Trump again reiterated the lie that Democrats cheated in the 2020 election and vowed to prosecute individuals “to the fullest extent of the Law” for their alleged role if he returns to the White House.
To experts like Blazakis, there is concern that efforts to curb acts of political violence will largely fall entirely to the law enforcement apparatus to detect and prevent.
“What I'm most concerned about is individuals taking inspiration from these last two assassination attempts and to try to be copycats,” said Blazakis. “At the same time, I think the rhetoric from our politicians is only going to become more heated, and that might also trigger individuals to become inspired to carry out some kind of act of violence.”
Stopping such attacks before they occur, however, has become a more difficult task, said Clarke. He said he doesn’t see organized paramilitary groups or people posting prominently online as the major concern here.
“I'm more concerned about the silent militia types that have their guns that are, you know, very pro-2A,” he said, referencing the Second Amendment. “The people that aren't out there running their mouths. To me, those are the [Oklahoma City bomber] Tim McVeighs of the world and those are the people that are really serious and can really cause real harm in this country if they want to.”",2024-09-17
NPR,The GOP’s ‘survival instinct’ acts as an ally for Trump on Election Day and beyond,"The GOP’s ‘survival instinct’ acts as an ally for Trump on Election Day and beyond
Former President Donald Trump’s campaign for reinstatement has taken some unusual flak in recent days. One of his former chiefs of staff, retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, said the man he once served in the Oval Office fit the definition of a fascist, adding Trump spoke admiringly of the Nazi generals who had obeyed orders from the Nazi dictator Adolph Hitler.
Any such description from a credible source would have been fatal for many a presidential campaign in the past. The same could be said of testimony from others that Trump in office had little respect for the Constitution or regard for the rule of law.
These attacks follow upon a highly public salvo from the uber-Republican Cheney family: former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter Liz, who was co-chair of the House Select Committee to Investigate the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Both Cheneys had withheld their support for Trump during the primary season earlier this year, but this fall came out to endorse Harris.
They also extend the denunciations heard from a category of anti-Trump conservatives in the media known as “never Trumpers.” The group has included such illustrious figures on the right as William Kristol and George Will. Online publications such as “The Bulwark” have been sounding alarms from the right about Trump’s autocratic tendencies for nearly a decade.
In recent days, Trump himself has garnished the mix with salacious soliloquies on golf great Arnold Palmer’s anatomy and labels for Democratic Vice President Harris that use a four-letter expletive for excrement. He says her time in office has seen America become “the garbage can of the world.”
All this follows a months-long litany of statements and outbursts from Trump that indicated sympathy for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and affinity for autocratic figures elsewhere in global politics such as Hungarian strongman Viktor Orban.
Yet as Nov. 5 nears, none of the stories that might have torpedoed another politician’s prospects has had that kind of effect, or even made a detectable difference in the polls or the tenor of Trump’s campaign.
All that stands as evidence that Trump’s base of voters has largely tuned out negative stories about him, which is easily done by watching only Trump-friendly cable news, websites or social media. For those who are still exposed, such stories can be dismissed as “fake news,” a phrase Trump adopted in 2016 that has since proven popular among autocratic politicians around the world.
Beyond the hardcore base, the politics of addition
But Trump’s seemingly unfazed pursuit of this style also demonstrates something else about our present political moment. Trump has his fanatical base, to be sure, but he has more than that. If he did not have more, he would not have won in 2016 or attracted in 2020 the most votes ever cast for an incumbent president, even though he lost that contest.
Trump’s most loyal fans are often described as being ready to “crawl over broken glass” to vote for him, and these legions of such enthusiasts surely exist. But to win he needs more. All the polling shows the race too close to call in the national popular vote and in at least seven swing states.
So Trump needs voters who may have misgivings about him or some of his behavior but who have deep loyalty to the Republican Party or deep aversion to the Democrats.
Most notably, he needs mainstream Republicans who may well have preferred another nominee in 2016 or 2024 but who will abide another term for Trump rather than risk having a Democrat in the White House for the next four years.
This week, the popular Republican governor of New Hampshire, Chris Sununu, brushed off the Hitler remarks without questioning their authenticity. Sununu, who in the past has called Trump “crazy,” was asked on CNN if the Hitler talk prompted a reconsideration of the governor’s endorsement.
“No,” Sununu said. “We’ve heard a lot of extreme things from Donald Trump. With a guy like that it’s kind of baked into the vote.”
Days earlier, on ABC News, Sununu had dismissed the outrage over Trump threatening to use the military against the “enemy within” in the U.S. He called such reactions “hyperbole.”
And, Sununu said, he would be voting for Trump because he could not face four more years of a Democratic agenda.
Some defections, but do they prove the rule?
It must be said that in recent days there have been Republican officials who have spoken out against their party’s fealty to Trump.
After the Hitler remarks, for example, the most senior Republican in the Wisconsin state Senate announced he would not vote for Trump. In the same week, Shawn Reilly, the independent mayor of that state’s largest Republican city, said he would be voting for Harris.
Lifelong Republican David Holt, the mayor of Oklahoma City, wrote in a Philadelphia newspaper this week that he could not vote for Trump. Holt wrote that prior to 2016 he “took for granted that both [parties’] leading candidates respected the rule of law and deeply understood the concept that no president is above the law.”
The Harris campaign has compiled lists of hundreds of Republicans in public positions who have endorsed the Democrat. But as a rule, notable Republicans with recognizable names have stayed in the fold. The scenario first seen when Trump emerged from the candidate pack in 2015 is replayed again and again.
It goes like this: Trump says something headline-grabbing about Muslims or immigrants or the POW ordeal of Sen. John McCain. The statement prompts intraparty denunciations. But after a few days or weeks, Trump is still on top, unrepentant, unbent and unbowed — and so dominant in the media coverage as to marginalize his opposition.
After the infamous “Access Hollywood” tape aired in October 2016, such prominent Republicans as former House Speaker Paul Ryan declined to campaign with him. It did not seem to matter, even in Ryan’s home state of Wisconsin.
The controversies have erupted, reached a moment of apparent crisis and subsided. And the hardcore Trump support has often seemed to grow all the harder.
Respecting and obeying that hardcore has generally been the safe position for Republicans in statewide office or seats in Congress. They may not need to be front-line Trump defenders, but they cannot assume they will escape retribution if they openly support an opponent — especially a Democrat.
After the attack on the Capitol in 2021, Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy said Trump bore responsibility for the riot. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said Trump “summoned the mob and incited the mob.” Yet, within days, both Republicans were backing down. McCarthy was going hat in hand to Mar-a-Lago for a photo opportunity, and McConnell was unwilling to support Trump’s impeachment for his role in the Jan. 6 events.
It was apparent in each of these situations that whatever reaction might appear in some newspapers or on certain TV channels, the popular underpinnings of the Trump phenomenon remained solid. The soundings taken by Republican leaders confirmed this and guided their actions thereafter.
This has proven true even during the years after Trump was out of office and his return to power far from presumed. Even then, desertion to support a rival such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the primaries has cost former Trump allies their momentum, at a minimum, and cost some their party support.
The minority mindset and survival instinct
Is all this new? Not really. To some degree, the endgame in any presidential cycle consists of the two parties telling their loyalists to turn out and cast one for the team, largely to keep the other side from winning. In some cycles, that’s an easier sell than others. Democrats in particular have been resistant to the idea of turning out just because it was Election Day and voting “D” because they were supposed to.
It has long been said that in choosing their presidential candidates: Democrats want to fall in love while Republicans want to fall in line. Once a GOP has a front-runner, most Republicans recognize the power of pulling together to put that candidate over the top.
Republicans, at least in recent generations, have been more inclined to vote and to stick with the party when they do. That expresses loyalty, to be sure, but it also comes from what might be called a survival instinct. Republicans felt like the minority party for roughly half a century after Franklin Roosevelt swept into office and installed the New Deal in an era of Democratic dominance in other elections as well.
Republicans even felt like the minority party when their post-World War II candidates started winning the White House and winning second terms with bigger margins than their first. President Dwight Eisenhower did that, and so did successors Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush.
There have been plenty of voters in both parties who had to swallow hard before pulling the lever for their party’s man — or woman — in the past. References to holding one’s nose in the polling booth led some to refer to the “clothespin vote,” a regular feature of two-party politics where only the two major party nominees have any chance of being elected.
In the late 1990s, Republicans and not a few other observers were amazed that President Bill Clinton maintained his high voter approval ratings even in the depths of his impeachment over an affair with a White House intern. Even after the most damning evidence had been presented in public, Clinton’s approval rating in the Gallup Poll stayed above 60%. In December 1998, the month he was impeached, Clinton’s approval hit 73%.
Still, Trump has taken this dynamic to unprecedented levels. His rise to the presidency was not built on previous political experience or public service but on a media presence in a “reality show” based on his tough businessman persona. He has made a specialty of maintaining a connection with an audience through showmanship and media dominance that other candidates cannot match.
And given its unprecedented origins and sustainability, that connection seems all but certain to live on — whatever happens on Nov. 5.",2024-10-27
NPR,DA recommends resentencing of Menendez brothers for the 1989 slaying of their parents,"DA recommends resentencing of Menendez brothers for the 1989 slaying of their parents
Erik and Lyle Menendez should be resentenced for the 1989 slaying of their parents, the Los Angeles County District Attorney recommended on Thursday, citing recent public attention to the case in the wake of a new documentary about the brothers.
The recommendation will be presented to a Los Angeles Superior Court judge, and the brothers, who are serving life sentences, would be eligible for parole, District Attorney George Gascón said.
""Under the law, resentencing is appropriate,"" Gascón said, making clear that he still believed that the crime of murder had been committed but that there had been extenuating circumstances that made resentencing appropriate.
""I understand that sometimes people can get desperate,"" Gascón said.
Gascón said that because the two brothers were under the age of 26 at the time of the killings, he recommended the sentencing be changed from life without the possibility of parole instead to the lesser sentence of 50 years to life, which would make the Menendez brothers now eligible for release.
More than 30 years after the pair were convicted of the brutal murders of their parents, the case continues to grip the national focus, including a recent Netflix series about the siblings and deep dives by social media sleuths over the years.
On Aug. 20, 1989, Jose and Kitty Menendez were shot to death in their Beverly Hills home while they were watching television.
Two juries deadlocked in 1994 after Lyle, now 56 years old, and Erik, 53, testified that they shot their parents in self-defense. The brothers said they had feared their parents were going to kill them to prevent stories emerging about the alleged physical and sexual abuse of their sons.
The brothers said that Jose, a record executive, had been sexually abusive, while Kitty turned a blind eye to their molestation.
Jose has also been accused by one of the members of the hit Latin band Menudo, who said the then-RCA Records exec molested him in his early teens.
The Menendez brothers were 18 and 21 years old at the time of the killings.
After the shootings, the two went on a lavish spending spree, and initially, authorities believed that the murders had been the result of a mafia hit.
The brothers would eventually admit to killing their parents, citing the abuse, which was corroborated by another family member.
After a second trial, in which a judge limited testimony related to their sexual abuse, the brothers were convicted of the shooting deaths of their parents.
“Since the original prosecution of the Menendez brothers more than nearly three decades ago, our office has gained a deeper understanding of the complexities surrounding sexual violence,"" Gascón said.
""We recognize that it is a widespread issue impacting individuals of all gender identities, and we remain steadfast in our commitment to support all victims as they navigate the long-lasting effects of such trauma.""",2024-10-24
NPR,Harris rallies with Beyoncé in Texas as Trump sits for hours with Joe Rogan,"Harris rallies with Beyoncé in Texas as Trump sits for hours with Joe Rogan
HOUSTON — The stands were vibrating under the stomping feet of the crowd at Shell Stadium in Houston Friday night.
But Beyoncé hadn’t even come out yet.
The crowd was chanting ""Beat Ted Cruz,"" as Cruz’s senate challenger, Democratic Congressman Colin Allred, raised his fist behind the podium on stage, cheering the crowd of 30,000 attendees on.
Vice President Harris’ visit to Houston in the final stretch to Election Day was in part to rally support for Allred. But the focus was mainly to bring the spotlight back on reproductive rights — in the place Harris has called ""ground zero"" in the fight to restrict abortion rights in the country.
The Lone Star State may seem like an unusual stop with less than two weeks until voting closes — it is not a swing state and former President Donald Trump is all but certain to carry it. But Trump and Harris both campaigned there on Friday, and the messages they each brought to the state highlight the urgency of their closing themes.
""I know sometimes in Texas, folks are like, 'Is it worth it? Doesn't make a difference,'"" Harris said, nodding to the fact that she is unlikely to take this red state. ""You are making a difference. And momentum is on our side.""
Harris focused on Texas' strict abortion ban at her rally in Houston, as Democrats have spent years hammering Republicans over unpopular crackdowns on reproductive rights — to great success at the ballot box.
The rally featured dozens of OB-GYNs in white coats and women who told their personal stories about how their lives were endangered by abortion bans — and blaming Trump for the trauma.
""This is not just some theoretical concept. Real harm has occurred in our country, a real suffering has occurred,"" Harris told reporters traveling with her on Friday.
Harris underscored that the kinds of restrictions seen in Texas could happen in any state if Republicans were to pass a national abortion ban. Trump said this month that he would veto such a ban.
Harris was introduced by hometown superstar Beyoncé, whose song Freedom has been Harris' campaign anthem, and Kelly Rowland, who rose to fame with Beyoncé as part of the group Destiny's Child.
""I’m not here as a politician. I’m here as a mother. A mother who cares deeply about the world my children and all of our children live in,"" Beyoncé said.
""It’s time to sing a new song, a song that began 248 years ago,"" she said. ""The old notes of downfall, discord, despair no longer resonate.""
Trump joined Joe Rogan for a three-hour interview
Trump started his Texas pit stop in Austin, where he largely focused on immigration, baselessly blaming Harris for crimes committed by undocumented migrants. ""Kamala refuses to stop importing these killers into our country. Every day she brings in more,"" Trump said. ""She's got no remorse at all for the innocent blood that's on her hands.""
At one point, he invited Alexis Nungaray to speak. Nungary is the mother of 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray, who was allegedly killed by two men accused of entering the country illegally earlier this year.
Trump repeated inflammatory attacks against immigrants, calling America a ""garbage can for the rest of the world to dump the people that they don't want.""
He also criticized a federal judge's decision Friday to restore the voting rights of more than 1,600 people in Virginia who had been purged from the state's rolls, calling the ruling ""un-American"" and ""election interference.""
While in Texas, Trump taped a podcast with Joe Rogan, who has millions of followers and an audience overwhelmingly younger and more male — a key constituency for the former president. The interview lasted three hours, making Trump three hours late for a rally in Traverse City, Mich.
The interview touched on a wide range of topics — from Trump’s past appearances on The View and his years on The Apprentice to his thoughts on extraterrestrial life and whether he would bring Robert F. Kennedy into his administration.
Trump also spoke about tariffs, saying they’d be a better incentive to promote chip making in the U.S., rather than the federal subsidies that the Biden administration has promoted.
At one point, Trump was asked about his recent suggestion that the U.S. could eliminate income taxes altogether and replace them with tariffs. Pressed by Rogan on whether he was serious about that, Trump responded, ""Yeah, sure, but why not?""
Trump's media strategy this election cycle has relied heavily on these social media-friendly, male-heavy podcasts and influencers that largely eschew probing policy questions and paint the former president as a friendly, accessible figure.
The two appearances in Texas also underscore what could potentially be the largest gender gap in a recent presidential election, with Trump increasing support among men and Harris among women.
That gender split is reflected in the audiences each candidate will be reaching through interviews they held Friday. While Trump had Rogan, Harris spoke with Brené Brown's Unlocking Us, a podcast popular with women.",2024-10-25
NPR,Family releases video of final moments before Black man's death in Missouri prison,"Family releases video of final moments before Black man's death in Missouri prison
COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) — A Missouri man who died after he was placed in a spit hood and restrained in a Missouri prison was motionless for nearly 10 minutes before a nurse checked on him, prison video released Tuesday shows.
Video of the final the moments before Othel Moore's December 2023 death shows the Black 38-year-old heaving with a mask covering his face, hands restrained behind his back and legs bound together as a guard watches from outside the cell.
Four former staffers at the Jefferson City Correctional Center have pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder. Charges against a fifth were dropped, Department of Corrections spokesperson Karen Pojmann said.
A criminal complaint alleges that guards pepper-sprayed Moore, placed a mask over his face and left him in a position that caused him to suffocate.
Moore's mother and sister separately filed a wrongful death lawsuit.
Surveillance video provided by Moore family lawyers shows a number of incarcerated men stripped down to their boxers with their hands restrained behind their backs as guards filter through cells and belongings on Dec. 8, 2023, the day Moore died.
While standing handcuffed just outside his cell door, a guard pepper-sprayed Moore, according to Cole County Prosecuting Attorney Locke Thompson's office.
Video released by Moore's family then shows him being led away from the other incarcerated men. Guards held his arms as he went down to his knees and eventually lay face down on the floor.
Guards then bound his legs together and put a mask over his face before strapping him into a cart in a reclined position, the video shows.
As he was restrained, the video shows Moore swayed back and forth but did not appear to struggle with guards.
Guards told investigators that Moore was not following orders to be quiet and that he spit at them, although witnesses said Moore was spitting pepper spray out of his mouth.
Video shows guards then wheeled Moore to a locked cell, where he initially attempted to push himself to a more upright position before falling back into the reclined headrest.
His movements gradually slowed for about 20 minutes until he lay motionless, his head slumped to one side.
A nurse arrived about 10 minutes after Moore went motionless, calmly checked his pulse and moved his limp head. The nurse and another staffer briefly applied rapid compressions to his upper body before he was wheeled out of the cell.
The Moore family's attorney, Andrew M. Stroth, said in a Tuesday news conference that prison staff acted with ""no sense of urgency.""
In a separate statement, Stroth said the video highlights ""the complete disregard for the sanctity of life, deliberate indifference and failure to provide emergency medical care to Othel by the medical staff.""
Ten staffers and contractor employees were fired in response to Moore's death.
""We have taken and will continue to take steps necessary to mitigate safety risks to everyone in our facilities,"" said a June statement from the department after criminal charges were filed against several former staffers. ""We take seriously our responsibility for creating the safest environment possible and will not tolerate behaviors or conditions that endanger the wellbeing of Missourians working or living in our facilities.""
Pojmann in a Tuesday email said body cameras are now used at all of the state's maximum-security facilities.
Three of the former staffers charged with second-degree murder in Moore's death have scheduled court appearances in January. A fourth faces trial Dec. 11.",2024-10-30
NPR,"With dueling rallies this week, Georgia is on the mind for Trump and Harris","With dueling rallies this week, Georgia is on the mind for Trump and Harris
DULUTH, Ga. — If the road to the White House runs through seven swing states, then Georgia is a flashing neon sign at the end of the road for both campaigns.
It’s a state that President Biden won by just 12,000 votes in 2020, a state that was ground zero for both false claims of election fraud and the political fallout afterwards, and a state home to the key demographic groups that will help decide the next president.
On Wednesday, it was also the site of two events featuring former President Donald Trump. The Republican nominee spoke at a middle Georgia church for a “Ballots and Believers” town hall aimed at the evangelical base of the GOP, before heading to a rally in suburban Gwinnett County on the north side of Atlanta.
Thursday, Vice President Harris will hold a rally with former President Barack Obama in DeKalb County just east of Atlanta, as re-energized Democrats seek to mobilize their base of Black voters and keep intact the fractious coalition that narrowly elected Biden. Ahead of that visit, she participated in a CNN town hall on Wednesday, where she said she agreed that Trump is a ""fascist.""
Georgia is a fast-growing state that has a large nonwhite voter population, a sizable share of college-educated suburban voters and plenty of young voters, all key constituencies that could influence the outcome in Georgia and other battlegrounds.
Nearly one in three Georgia voters have already cast their ballot in the presidential race, as elections officials tout record in-person early voting turnout.
Trump painted a dire picture of the nation
At Christ Chapel church in Zebulon, Ga., Trump ticked through his usual campaign talking points around everything from immigration and hurricane recovery to oil production and his poll numbers.
Much like the rest of his campaign events, Trump painted a dire picture of the state of the country and what it would look like if he lost.
“I think we really energized a lot of people this time, because they’ve seen how bad it is,” he said. “This last four years, it’s been a horror show. Absolute horror show.”
He also said there’s “persecution” going on against Catholics, school boards and “people of religion.”
In Gwinnett County, Trump spoke at a rally put on by the conservative group Turning Point USA. Thousands were in attendance to see Trump, and to hear from more than a dozen local and national figures that have taken up the former president’s mantle, including Tucker Carlson, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. and former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard.
“This is a very important distinction: Election Day is the last day of voting,” Turning Point founder Charlie Kirk said. “We have 12 days of voting left in this state ... So for those of you that already voted, you need to go find a low propensity voter. Someone that is a little shaky about voting, and get them out to the polls.”
Early voting statistics from Georgia show strong turnout from smaller Republican-heavy counties and those who reliably vote in Republican primaries. An analysis of those voters by NPR also found a large percentage of those are Republicans who are opting to vote earlier than they have in past elections.
Harris to speak from the same spot Trump gave his Jan. 6 address
Harris was last in Georgia over the weekend, speaking to an enthusiastic crowd of about 11,000 people at Lakewood Amphitheater and attending two church services, all the while attacking Trump’s energy level and scattershot speeches.
Harris’ closing message is leaning heavily into warnings that Trump is not fit to be president again and is a threat to democracy. Her campaign said she will make that case on Tuesday, from the same spot on the National Mall that Trump spoke on Jan. 6, 2021, before a mob of his supporters headed to the Capitol in a failed insurrection attempt.
Harris on Wednesday seized on remarks made by Trump’s former chief of staff, Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, who called Trump a “fascist” with a “dictatorial” leadership style. Trump’s campaign has said Kelly fabricated his stories about the former president.
After addressing Kelly's comments in remarks from her residence in Washington, D.C., Harris traveled to Pennsylvania to participate in a CNN town hall. Asked directly if she believed Trump was a fascist, Harris replied, ""Yes, yes I do.""
Harris appeared at the town hall after Trump declined a second debate.
Her campaign has also dispatched two of the party’s most beloved figures – former President Obama and his wife Michelle – to multiple swing states this week to boost turnout.",2024-10-23
NPR,"Off-color jokes, vitriol take over Trump Madison Square Garden rally","Off-color jokes, vitriol take over Trump Madison Square Garden rally
Donald Trump put on a rally in New York City’s Madison Square Garden on Sunday to kick off the final full week of campaigning for president, complete with celebrity guests and a new economic proposal. But repeated insults and at times racist and misogynistic remarks from guest speakers threatened to grab the most attention.
The final weeks of a campaign are often when candidates put forth a unifying message to gather as many voters as possible. Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally was instead marked by swear words, racist jokes about Latinos and misogynistic remarks.
The focus could help Trump grab headlines and mobilize some existing supporters, though it's unlikely to bring in new voters who are already turned off by some of the Republican presidential candidate’s rhetoric.
The first speaker at the former president’s Madison Square Garden rally, roast comedian and podcast host Tony Hinchcliffe, set the tone with a disparaging joke about welcoming Latinos into the U.S. “with open arms” while making a shooing motion.
He also disparaged Latinos with a crass joke about making babies and illegal immigration, quipped that Puerto Rico is “a floating island of garbage,” and joked that Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce “might be the next O.J. Simpson,” referring to the football star who was accused and later acquitted of murdering his ex-wife.
Kelce is in a relationship with pop singer Taylor Swift, who earlier this year said she would vote for Vice President Harris.
Trump has made anti-immigrant rhetoric a centerpiece of his campaign. As president, he also talked about ending the automatic right to citizenship for babies born in the U.S. to noncitizens — though many scholars agree changing the law could require a constitutional amendment.
The Trump campaign is currently fighting to get votes from women and Latinos. Polls suggest the gender gap in this year’s election could be the largest on record. The Harris campaign, in contrast, has been highlighting stories of women whose lives have been threatened by strict abortion bans.
The Harris campaign immediately seized on Hinchcliffe’s remarks about Puerto Rico. In a tweet posted after his introduction, Hinchcliffe wrote in response, “These people have no sense of humor.” He also added, “I love Puerto Rico and vacation there. I made fun of everyone… watch the whole set.”
The Trump campaign also distanced itself from Hinchliffe's remarks.
""This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign,"" Danielle Alvarez, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, said in a statement.
Defining who is an American
The rally marshaled high-profile Trump supporters including Terry Bollea — better known as the professional wrestler Hulk Hogan — television personality Dr. Phil McGraw and singer-songwriter Lee Greenwood.
But other Trump allies appealed to an “us versus them” mentality. Radio host Sid Rosenberg insulted former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, as well as the Democratic Party as a whole.
“The whole party — a bunch of degenerates,” he added. “Jew-haters and lowlifes, every one of them.”
Multiple speakers also insulted Harris, with private equity fund manager Grant Cardone calling her a ""fake."" ""Her and her pimp handlers will destroy our country,"" he said.
Conservative commentator Tucker Carlson later made fun of Harris’ mixed-race heritage.
“It’s gonna be pretty hard [for Democrats] to look at us and say, ‘You know what? Kamala Harris, she got 85 million votes because she’s just so impressive. As the first Samoan-Malaysian low-IQ former California prosecutor ever to be elected president. It was just a groundswell of popular support.’”
Carlson went beyond insults, nodding to the racist “great replacement theory” he has espoused in the past.
“People know in a country that has been taken over by a leadership class that actually despises them and their values and their history and their culture and their customs, really hates them to the point that it's trying to replace them,” he said. “They know someone who actually has affection for them and that's Donald Trump. And it’s requited.”
That sentiment was echoed later, when former Trump White House aide Stephen Miller told the crowd: “America is for Americans and Americans only.”
Tax credits and ‘enemy from within’
After a more than four-hour pre-program of speakers, Melania Trump made a rare campaign trail appearance, introducing her husband.
In his speech, Trump started by laying out his economic message, emphasizing the inflation that hit the country under the Biden administration, and saying he would fix it.
He also announced a new policy, saying he would implement a tax credit for people caring for family members at home.
Harris earlier this month announced her own plan to expand Medicare to cover that kind of caregiving.
Trump also devoted a large section of his speech, as he often does, to the topic of undocumented immigrants.
“Once I take office, the migrant invasion of our country ends and the restoration of our country begins,” he told the crowd.
Trump also took the time to address a recent interview with Fox News, in which he had characterized “radical left lunatics” as “the enemy from within” and proposed using the military against them.
He stood behind those comments at Sunday night’s rally.
“They’re smart and they’re vicious, and we have to defeat them,” he said. “And when I say, ‘the enemy from within,’ the other side goes crazy. Becomes a sound — ‘oh, how can he say’ — no, they’ve done very bad things to this country. They are indeed the enemy from within.”
However, Trump still attempted to make his speech into a message of unity.
“The Republican Party has really become the party of inclusion, and there’s something nice about that,” he said near the end of his remarks.

JPMorgan Chase has begun filing lawsuits against customers who took advantage of an “infinite money glitch” this summer — a technical issue with the bank’s ATMs that allowed people to deposit bogus checks and withdraw the money from their accounts.
The trend shot across social media with TikTok users broadcasting how to deposit the fraudulent checks and walk away with huge sums of cash.
The bank, which is the largest U.S. financial institution, has so far filed four suits — two against individuals and two against businesses. These have been in Los Angeles, Houston and Miami.
“Fraud is a crime that impacts everyone and undermines trust in the banking system,” Chase spokesperson Drew Pusateri said in a statement. “We’re pursuing these cases and actively cooperating with law enforcement to make sure if someone is committing fraud against Chase and its customers, they’re held accountable.”
In the largest of the four suits filed so far, in the Southern District of Texas, JPMorgan wrote that a ""masked man"" deposited a fraudulent $335,000 check into a defendant's bank account at an ATM.
The man allegedly then withdrew most of the cash before the bank had realized it was counterfeit. The bank said it is owed back a sum of $290,939.47.
“Chase prides itself on its efforts to protect its customers against fraudsters, particularly in an environment where bank and wire fraud are increasingly more commonplace,” the bank said in its filing.
“While fraud methods have evolved over time, the core intent to exploit and deceive remains unchanged,” it said.",2024-10-29
NPR,Native voters could swing Arizona. Both parties want their votes,"Native voters could swing Arizona. Both parties want their votes
PHOENIX — Both parties are ramping up their efforts to court Native American voters in the final stretch to Election Day.
This demographic could swing the election results in several closely divided states like Arizona.
Native Health, an urban Indian health center, has held several voter registration events across the Grand Canyon state in the run-up to the election.
“I always think that the Native vote in Arizona shouldn't be discounted,” said Walter Murillo, CEO of Native Health. “In such a tight race, I think any marginal or incremental influence that a candidate or issue might have really, really depends on convincing American-Indian voters.”
President Biden only won Arizona in 2020 by about 10,000 votes — less than a 1% margin — in a state where Native Americans make up 5% of the population.
Native Americans have traditionally voted for Democrats, and the Harris campaign is seeking to ensure that pattern continues in 2024.
The Harris campaign on Oct. 2 launched the Native Americans for Harris-Walz coalition, aiming to mobilize tribal leaders, organizations and voters. The campaign dubbed its operations in Arizona, home to 22 federally recognized tribes, the “most expansive tribal organizing program ever in the state,” a campaign official told NPR on Oct. 12, speaking on background to discuss sensitive campaign strategy.
The campaign has already hired over 20 staff members, with plans for more, to focus on the state’s tribal areas. This is the largest Native voter outreach team for a Democratic presidential campaign in the state. Staff dedicated to Native American communities have also been hired in Wisconsin.
The Democratic National Committee on Monday announced a six-figure ad campaign targeting Native voters — dubbed the “I will Vote” campaign — in Arizona, North Carolina, Montana and Alaska, with digital, print, and radio ads with a majority being placed in local and national Native-owned publications. This is their third, and most expensive, Native-focused ad campaign.
Vice President Harris on Oct. 8 received an endorsement from the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe in Nevada, the first-ever endorsement from the tribe in a presidential election, with the tribe citing record funding to tribes and Native American federal appointments.
Tribal leaders and young people in Nevada and Arizona spoke with Harris and her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz last week as they rallied in western swing states.
“It means so much to be back with the Gila River Indian Community,” Harris said, noting that last summer she was the first vice president to visit that tribe, mainly based outside Phoenix. “I strongly believe that the relationship between tribal nations in the United States is sacred — and that we must honor tribal sovereignty, embrace our trust in treaty obligations and ensure tribal self-determination.”
Voters already making their choices
At a powwow in Phoenix, tribal members gathered for an evening of dancing, fry bread and sales.
Kevin Jackson, a member of White Mountain Apache, has “Democracy is Indigenous” flags above his jewelry stand. He has already cast his ballot for Harris.
“I think we need someone in there who's going to help out and help us build our infrastructure because right now it's awful,” Jackson said, noting he hopes to attend the inauguration if she is elected.
Across the park, Charles Quimayousie is making his way through the vendors. A member of the Tohono O’odham tribe, he also hopes Harris wins.
“That wall just feels too prejudiced to me,” Quimayousie said, referring to Trump’s border wall — one of the former president’s signature campaign promises to stem migration into the U.S.
“It's a good thing, but it just turns me away because when they built that, it went right through my reservation, and some of my people are still on that side, so I'm against that all the way,” he said.
Both said their tribes generally would agree with them — though there are members who will support Trump.
Gerel Nells, who lives in Mesa and is Navajo said that between Harris and Trump he prefers Trump.
“I did like the fact that Trump put aside a plan for the missing and murdered Indigenous women of this nation,” he said. However, he has already turned in his ballot for comedian Dave Chappelle.
GOP hopes to stave off Democratic efforts
To the east of Phoenix, across the border in Gallup, New Mexico, members of the Navajo Nation pulled in to set up their booths and shop at the Gallup Flea Market, on a sunny Saturday morning.
Navajo Nation, also known as the Dine, is the largest federally recognized tribe both in terms of enrolled members and geographical land. Its territory spans the state borders of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. Organizers are looking beyond state lines for mobilizing Arizona voters.
“I do feel like the Natives kind of brought it over last time to the Democrat side,” said Ina Noggle, who was tending to the Arizona GOP’s table at the market. She's campaigning for Trump in Arizona.
“We're just out there trying to present the different platforms and what they have been familiar with and explaining to them that the Democrat Party is no longer the party of their grandparents and their parents,” she said. Noggle talks to voters about issues like abortion and energy independence.
Noggle, Halee Dobbins — the RNC’s communications director — and others at the event said they were not asking market-goers to vote for a specific candidate — but rather approached the conversation by talking about values.
“It makes the conversation more fruitful and more productive, honestly,” Dobbins said. “If you talk to the Navajos based on their values, that's where you really get people to feel comfortable talking about who are they going to vote for. You don't want to start with ‘Are you just going to vote for this candidate?’”
She said the Trump campaign has been meeting with Navajo Nation members at markets, rodeos, parades, and other local events, and Arizona GOP ran an ad on tribal radio to urge voters to “vote Republican.” The campaign didn’t share statistics about how much they’re spending on Native voters overall.
As a part of their showing at the flea market, the McKinley County GOP drove about a dozen cars waving GOP flags for Trump, and New Mexican Republican candidates by honking their horns. Some people waved and honked back. Others grumbled at them to get out.
Making inroads
Still, GOP organizers said they have noticed a change.
“Four years ago it was like, we’d get like so many fingers,” said Pablo Martinez, who is the McKinley County GOP chair and joined Arizona organizers at the market. “But it's different now. Like people are coming out of their shells and there’s a little more pride.”
At the stand, market-goers picked up signs and stickers in support of Trump and Senate GOP candidate Kari Lake. Tribal members walking by assured their support.
Democrats had their own presence in the market.
Brenda Hoskie, a member of the Navajo Nation and chair of the McKinley County Democratic Party in New Mexico, said she had organized precincts and others to put up mutton stew stands on Election Day and for early voting, which began last week.
“After people vote, they can eat and give out signs,” she said.
Since the Navajo Nation stretches across both states, she hopes her efforts will shore up Democratic support among the Navajo in Arizona, as well the San Juan Southern Paiute tribes.
“We need to win Arizona. So I'm out there making sure that we are not sitting back,” Hoskie said.",2024-10-14
NPR,American Airlines fined $50 million for its treatment of passengers with disabilities,"American Airlines fined $50 million for its treatment of passengers with disabilities
WASHINGTON — Citing ""numerous serious violations"" of the laws protecting airline passengers with disabilities, the U.S. Department of Transportation fined American Airlines $50 million on Wednesday.
The penalty follows an investigation by the DOT that found violations at American over a four-year period between 2019 and 2023.
The DOT says it uncovered cases of ""unsafe physical assistance that at times resulted in injuries and undignified treatment of wheelchair users, in addition to repeated failures to provide prompt wheelchair assistance."" The investigation also determined American mishandled thousands of wheelchairs by damaging them or delaying their return.
“The era of tolerating poor treatment of airline passengers with disabilities is over,” said Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg in a statement. “With this penalty, we are setting a new standard of accountability for airlines that violate the civil rights of passengers with disabilities. By setting penalties at levels beyond a mere cost of doing business for airlines, we’re aiming to change how the industry behaves and prevent these kinds of abuses from happening in the first place.”
In February, the DOT brought dozens of disability advocates to Washington to talk about a proposed regulation that would require airlines to up their game. Among them was Thomas Braddy who directs the National Council on Independent Living. ""The reason I didn't fly anymore and I gave up flying was because too much damage to my chair,"" Braddy testified.
He said not flying has held him back in his career and stopped him from traveling with his wife.
Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth lost both of her legs in the Iraq War. She spoke at the meeting and said a wheelchair is like a part of her body. ""If this is broken, you've broken my legs.""
Duckworth said airlines routinely damage her own wheelchairs and others. In fact, Duckworth says they broke 892 wheelchairs in a single month last year. ""Imagine if the American public saw that the airlines broke 892 pairs of legs in a single month. There would be hue and cry, but there hasn't been.""
In announcing the fine, the DOT highlighted this video recorded at the Miami International Airport showing an American Airlines employee dropping a wheelchair down a baggage ramp.
American says it has a long-standing commitment to serving passengers with disabilities. It says it's spent $175 million this year ""in services, infrastructure, training and new technology to help ease their journey and transport their specialized equipment."" In a release, the airline notes it received more than eight million requests for wheelchair assistance in 2023. Of those, the company says less than 0.1% of customers submitted a disability-related complaint.
""Today's agreement reaffirms American's commitment to taking care of all our customers,"" said Julie Rath, a senior vice president at American.
The DOT says the problems it uncovered are not unique to American Airlines. The department says it has active investigations into similar violations at other U.S. airlines.

NPR,Harris called Trump a 'fascist.' Experts debate what fascism is — and isn't,"Harris called Trump a 'fascist.' Experts debate what fascism is — and isn't
Since before his first presidential run in 2016, former President Donald Trump has been accused of invoking the leadership style of the world’s most infamous fascists, namely Benito Mussolini, the Italian dictator who popularized fascism, and Adolf Hitler.
With Election Day looming, the fascist accusations against Trump grew louder this past week.
Retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, Trump’s longest-serving chief of staff, said in an interview with The New York Times published on Oct. 22 that Trump “certainly falls into the general definition of fascist.”
The next day, the Republican presidential candidate’s Democratic opponent, Vice President Harris — when asked on CNN whether she thought Trump was a fascist — said, “Yes, I do.”
She later added that many people care about “not having a president of the United States who admires dictators and is a fascist.”
Name-calling, especially in the final act of a presidential race, is common. But many experts who say the fascist label is apt argue that it’s more than just political polemics. They say the term is useful — serving as a distress signal for the threat to democracy.
Other experts say it’s an imprecise critique that obscures other, very real threats of Trumpism.
The Trump campaign responded to NPR's request for comment on the accusations with a statement insulting NPR.
Here's a closer look at what fascism is — and what it isn’t — according to scholars who study the ultranationalist ideology.
What is fascism?
Scholars have long argued over the definition of fascism.
Roger Griffin, an emeritus professor of modern history at Oxford Brookes University in the U.K. and a widely cited political theorist on the topic, offers one explanation: an authoritarian, “revolutionary form of extreme nationalism” that often incorporates racism, xenophobia, male chauvinism and the culture of violence.
“It sees things like communism and liberalism as a threat to society,” he told NPR. “Fascists themselves want to overthrow either a communist or a traditional conservative or a liberal state to create a new order.”
Historically, as with Mussolini and Hitler, fascists have relied on military power to suppress the opposition.
In October 1922, Mussolini, head of the National Fascist Party, declared his plan to assume power before members of the armed fascist militia — known as Blackshirts — marched on Rome. In Germany, Hitler’s Nazi Party had an army of “Brownshirts” to carry out a violent intimidation campaign against leftists and the Jewish population. Both leaders censored the press and encouraged racism through propaganda.
The word “fascist” has since taken on a looser definition, Griffin said. It’s not just Trump — it’s become a favorite epithet in the political sphere on both sides. Many on the left have lobbed the term at other conservative and right-wing leaders, including Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. Conservatives, for their part, are also known to compare Democrats to fascists.
“Anything that smacks of authoritarianism or chauvinism or being a control freak can be dismissed as fascist,” Griffin said.
Why some scholars use ""fascist"" to describe Trump
Those who endorse the fascist label for the former president have pointed to the following marks of Trump’s campaign and presidency: Upon announcing his 2016 presidential bid, Trump maligned Mexican migrants as rapists and pledged to ban all Muslims from entering the United States. He’s cited Mussolini and, according to former staff, has spoken highly of Hitler. He’s sought to delegitimize news media, calling the press an “enemy of the American people.”
He tried to overturn a free and fair election that he lost, convinced most Republicans that President Biden’s victory was illegitimate, and promoted lies about a stolen election, sowing distrust in the democratic process.
For many scholars, the answer to whether Trump meets the qualifications of a fascist boils down to what happened on Jan. 6, 2021, when Trump’s followers stormed the Capitol to stop the democratic transfer of power.
“If Trump [on Jan. 6] intended to overthrow the American Constitution and inaugurate a new order based on charismatic power exercised by him, then he was absolutely a fascist,” Griffin, the British political theorist, said.
But, according to Griffin, Trump himself lacked intention on that day because he has no fixed ideology.
“You can associate him with racism, xenophobia, male chauvinism, extreme capitalism and the whole load of -isms,” he said, but he sees “no evidence that Trump has a coherent enough ideology, let alone a coherent ideology of the overthrow of the state through a coup to merit the word fascism.”
For Robert Paxton, a foremost scholar on fascism, focusing on the followers is just as important in trying to understand fascism, according to the Times.
Paxton, a former Columbia University professor and author of The Anatomy of Fascism, was previously only convinced that Trump bore some staples of fascism. But he said his mind changed after Jan. 6. In a Times interview published last week, he confirmed that he was no longer opposed to calling Trump a fascist after the Capitol siege.
Trump’s brand of fascism, Paxton told the Times, is “bubbling up from below in very worrisome ways, and that’s very much like the original fascisms,” when Mussolini and Hitler leveraged mass discontent to gather support.
Trump's ""enemy"" rhetoric
A recent NPR investigation found more than 100 instances in which Trump has said his opponents, critics and private citizens should be investigated, prosecuted, jailed or otherwise punished.
He's accused ideological opponents of being “the enemy from within.”
For Kelly, the highest-profile Trump-era official to publicly denounce the former president, it was these comments that moved him speak out against Trump, he said in an interview with the Times.
The “enemy from within” rhetoric is a key facet of fascism, said Griffin, author of The Nature of Fascism.
“Fascists are obsessed with the idea that the present state of the nation is decadent. The world is falling apart. It's got inner and outer enemies. There are forces at work destroying sacred, eternal truths or important things about the nation or the race,” he said.
Jason Stanley, who is a philosophy professor at Yale University and author of How Fascism Works, said Trump is also targeting the same people Hitler did. He told WNYC’s On The Media last week that “the word is required now to keep us out of the history books as being complicit in the rise of fascism.” But he also acknowledged that it’s not a perfect fit: “I use the word fascism because we don’t have another word for something that looks so much like fascism.”
Griffin, however, said the fascist label is a red herring. What we’re witnessing with Trump is “far more dangerous because it can sit in a democracy,” in his view.
“Trump is dangerous not because he's a fascist,"" he said, ""but because he is systematically trying to destroy the fundamental principles of liberal democracy — freedom of speech, and respect for experts and open mindedness — all this stuff which is fundamental to healthy democracy all over the world.”",2024-10-29
NPR,Why Pennsylvania could be the key to the White House,"Why Pennsylvania could be the key to the White House
The race for Pennsylvania is in full swing.
Commercial breaks across the state are packed with attack ads. Some claim Vice President Harris made inflation worse while others highlight former President Donald Trump's role in restricting abortion access for millions of Americans.
With just over two weeks until Election Day, the amount and frequency of ads shouldn’t come as a shock. Daniel Hopkins, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said bombarding state residents with TV ads is politically strategic.
“Candidates are better off when they can persuade voters, because if they persuade a voter, they not only add one to their tally, but they take one out of their opponents tally,” Hopkins said. “Whereas if I just turn out a voter, then I've added one to my tally, but I haven't done anything to my opponent's tally.”
But voters across the state are bearing the brunt of the political grind, as both campaigns have spent more money on ads in Pennsylvania than any other battleground state. Harris and Trump need the state because it holds 19 electoral votes – the largest share available among the seven closely watched battleground states.
Why is Pennsylvania getting so much attention?
Polls show Harris and Trump are locked in a tight race here. Several Pennsylvania political observers NPR spoke to as part of our We, The Voters series say the state is a toss up, which is why the candidates are fiercely fighting to win votes here.
Both candidates and their running mates have spent increasingly more time here over the past few weeks.
Harris sat for a testy interview with Fox News anchor Bret Baier in Philadelphia last week, as she attempted to present herself as an alternate choice for Republicans who are unhappy with Trump. And earlier this month, Trump returned to Butler, where he survived an assassination attempt this summer, and honed in on immigration and border control.
Since President Biden dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Harris in late July, Democrats have spent about $159 million on advertising in Pennsylvania compared Republicans who have spent around $121 million, according to a recent AdImpact report.
Pennsylvanians have voted for the winner of every presidential election since former President Barack Obama won in 2008. And in the prior four presidential elections, Pennsylvania voted reliably blue.
But the state swung red in 2016 when Trump won it by roughly 45,000 votes. In 2020, the Keystone State state flipped again. Biden won it by about 80,000 votes, according to Pennsylvania voting results data. Although Biden’s win was larger than Trump’s, it was not an overwhelming victory. In a state that then had more than 9 million registered voters, his win amounted to one percentage point.
So what's on the minds of voters this year?
A September poll of 800 likely Pennsylvania voters found that people here care most about the economy, followed by abortion.
Retired Navy veteran Ed Grkman, whom NPR met in West Mifflin, a borough located southeast of Pittsburgh, said he favors Trump to handle the economy. An American flag waved from a pole in his front lawn, as he cut his grass and stopped to speak. Grkman lives off of a fixed Social Security income and said prices have gotten higher over the past four years.
“I'm doing worse than I was when Donald Trump was in office,” Grkman said. “So, anybody voting should be voting for the price to be lower.”
Meanwhile, abortion access — Harris' strongest issue — is top of mind for nearly half of Pennsylvania voters, including many independents.
Jessica Krayer, a lactation consultant at West Penn Hospital in Pittsburgh, said supporting Harris and Democrats would help preserve abortion access in the state.
Krayer, a nurse with 19 years of experience in women’s health, has helped deliver babies and handled more difficult pregnancies, including some that threatened the help of patients. After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, she also welcomed and treated patients from neighboring states with restrictive abortion laws.
“No matter what, that decision [to get an abortion] is never taken lightly,” Krayer said. “It is not my job to judge anyone for that situation. If I was in a situation where I couldn't afford to feed another kid, I don't know what I would do.”
Here's what Trump and Harris need to win the state
Trump is a household name at this point. And his populist message continues to resonate with white Pennsylvania voters without college degrees, aging voters and blue collar workers, including many who worked in the state’s declining steel, coal and manufacturing industries.
Those residents make up about half of the state's eligible voter base.
""Donald Trump will do particularly well here in Pennsylvania to the extent that the Trump campaign is able to turn out irregular voters who lean toward the president,” Hopkins said.
Harris will need to maintain gains that Biden made in many of the suburbs around Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, Hopkins added. Biden won in 2020 in large part from turnout in the most populous cities in the state — Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Allentown — voted in his favor. He also benefited from losing by fewer votes in the state’s more conservative small towns and suburban areas.
Harris will also need to rely on the sizable share of Black voters and smaller number of Latino voters in places like Philadelphia, Hopkins said.
Black people make up nearly 40% of the population in Philadelphia, according to the United States Census Bureau. Latinos make up about 16%.
Joe Hill, a board member of Black Leadership Pennsylvania, a political action committee working to educate Black residents across the state about voting, said Harris has strong appeal in the state's big cities thanks to her identity as a Black and South Asian woman.
“Her ability as a woman to rise up the ranks on her own merits is motivating a lot of women in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh,” Hill said.
The same is true for some Latino voters in the state, like Guillermo Lopez of Allentown, Pa., where Latinos make up more than half the population.
Pinned to his sweater, when NPR met him for an interview, were two big blue buttons that read ""Vote for Harris.""
""I already filled in my ballot and mailed it in,"" Lopez said. ""If I keep talking, I'll get weepy because I never imagined in my life that I would be voting for someone that looks like my daughter.""

That was the first time Abate, a 24-year-old sergeant in the Marines, had talked openly about what he did that day.
At that point, he was doing well in the Marines. He made sergeant early, got a Navy commendation medal and was selected for this coveted internship with the National Security Agency.
“If you get the internship, you can basically ride that out until retirement if you wanted to,” he said. “It exponentially grows your career.”
Abate has always wanted to be a Marine. “There's nothing else I wanted to do. There was no plan B,” he said. “It was Marine Corps.”
Abate is tall and muscular, with short brown hair and a bit of a baby face. One of his forearms is covered in a large and colorful tattoo depicting the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. It’s from Revelations 6, he says.
He grew up in rural Virginia, about 30 miles west of Washington, D.C., and met his wife, Ashley, when they were both in high school taking part in Junior ROTC. Abate is the son of a former Marine who became a cop. He tells us his dad is a Republican and his mom, a nurse, is a Democrat. Abate recalls that they would often argue about politics.
But for Josh and Ashley, there was one politician for them: Donald Trump.
Ashley is blond and petite, and the day NPR interviewed her, she held their infant daughter as she spoke to us.
She called Trump a moral man and said they share the same values.
“You know, I come from a household where religion, manners, work ethic, that kind of thing, is very important,” she said.
And Josh? He said he likes the fact that Trump is supportive of a strong military.
Josh said he gets most of his news from Fox and conservative websites. When asked, he said he hasn’t seen headlines like when Trump called fallen soldiers “losers” and questioned John Kelly, his former chief of staff, saying, “I don't get it. What was in it for them?"" at a 2017 Memorial Day event in Arlington National Cemetery, where Kelly’s Marine son, Robert Kelly, is buried. He was killed in Afghanistan in 2010.
A text invite
In the months before Jan. 6, 2021, Abate was at Marine Base Quantico, about an hour south of Washington. Fox News was playing on several base TVs most of the time. The pandemic was raging. Tens of thousands of Americans had died from COVID-19 at that point and most public spaces like bars and restaurants had been shut down. Abate and his fellow Marines were stuck in the barracks, day after day, staring at screens. The Marines even canceled a training trip to Norway.
Abate found that annoying.
“We were just cooped up in our rooms,” he recalled. “You didn’t join the Marine Corps to stay in your bedroom and work for a couple of hours a day and play video games.”
After the elections that November, the main message being spread by Fox anchors, reporters and guests was the same: Joe Biden had “stolen” a victory from President Donald Trump. Abate was buying into it.
So were two of his friends, Sgt. Dodge Hellonen and Cpl. Micah Coomer. They were planning to drive out to Washington, D.C., for the now infamous “Stop the Steal” rally. And they texted Abate, asking him if he wanted to come along. He said he accepted because he wanted to listen to Trump’s speech.
“I actually wanted to see him speak in person, like, the last time as sitting president,” Abate said.
The two Marines picked up Abate at his home and drove north to Washington. But he said the traffic getting into D.C. slowed them down, so they missed the speech on the Ellipse, near the White House, which ended with Trump telling the crowd that they had to fight for their country. “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol,” Trump said.
Abate said they all noticed a crowd heading that way and joined in, crossing the wide lawn toward the iconic building.
Something ugly
They entered through the Senate wing doors about seven minutes after the crowd broke through. This was the first entrance to be breached that day, so Abate and his friends were among the first people to actually go into the Capitol.
“We walked right in,” he said. “We didn't see any signs that, you know, said ‘do not enter’ or ‘no trespassing.’ And as soon as we walked through the door of the Capitol building, there were two police officers standing right across from the door. I figured if we weren't supposed to be there, they would have told us to get out. Nobody was trying to be, like, rambunctious.”
He told us he was inside the Capitol for about an hour and saw or heard no yelling, breaking glass, or violence.
But we were outside the Capitol at the exact same time and we experienced something very different — something ugly — and reported on that extensively. While getting crushed by a crowd of angry Trump supporters, we met rioters who spoke proudly into NPR microphones about plans to hang politicians from gallows before storming up the marble steps and surging through doors and windows. The overwhelming evidence is of one of the most violent and shocking days in American history.
Meanwhile, Abate said he calmly and quietly strolled the halls for about an hour, helped put a MAGA hat on a statue, and then finally left with his friends when police ordered everyone out.
Then he said they drove south, back toward Quantico, before joining Ashley at a restaurant called Fatty’s.
“Holy crap”
While they were eating, every TV screen in the restaurant showed images of a raging mob at the Capitol, surging into the building and punching cops, smashing some with flagpoles and their own shields.
“We were all just looking at it like, holy crap,” Ashley said.
She said she turned to her husband, wide-eyed. “Did you see any of the stuff they’re talking about?” she said she asked him that night.
He said no. But all three Marines looked at each other. “Like, we should probably not talk about this,” Abate remembered. He told us he took out his phone and started deleting all pictures and videos from the day.
“I knew that if word broke that Marines were in the Capitol it would reflect badly on the Marine Corps,” Abate told us. “And I knew that even though I didn’t do anything bad — I didn’t cause any violence, I didn’t perpetrate any sedition or treason and things like that — I knew that I would just be grouped into everything.”
The three never talked about Jan. 6 with each other again. And before long, Coomer was transferred to another assignment at Camp Pendleton, Calif. Hellonen was off to Camp Lejeune, N.C.
Over a year later, Abate passed that polygraph test — the one where he admitted being in the Capitol on Jan. 6. He was sent to a special signals intelligence school in Florida. Josh and his wife returned to the Washington, D.C., area at the end of 2023, ready to start that prized internship and set up a home with Ashley, who had just found out she was pregnant.
“Just be truthful”
Just two weeks before Abate was about to start his NSA job at Fort Meade in Maryland, he got a text. His sergeant wanted to meet for a cup of coffee. “Change into civilian clothes,” he told Abate, who figured the meeting was about his internship. But after passing the building where Abate was supposed to work, they pulled into the parking lot of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service.
“So NCIS just wants to ask you a few questions,” the sergeant told him. “Nothing to worry about. Just be truthful.”
Abate said he got a sinking feeling.
A half dozen agents came from both sides of the building and surrounded him, telling him he was under arrest for Jan. 6. They clasped on handcuffs and escorted him to an interrogation room.
“I was like, s***, this is happening,” Abate said.
They showed him pictures of himself inside the Capitol, along with Hellonen and Coomer. Then they put Abate in the back seat of a government car and drove him south to Washington, where he was booked. He spent the night in jail, sleeping on a metal bench with a bright light shining from the ceiling.
What he didn’t know yet was that not all of his Marine friends were able to keep that vow of silence about being inside the Capitol.
According to the FBI, just three weeks after Jan. 6, Coomer sent a private message to a friend. An FBI search warrant found that he was talking about the extremist movements present in the Capitol that day, including guys in Hawaiian shirts who often call themselves the Boogaloo Bois. Coomer said to his friend, “I’m waiting for a Boogaloo.”
His friend wrote back asking, “What’s that?”
Coomer simply replied: “Civil War 2.”
Both Coomer and Hellonen declined our requests for comment.
The charm offensive
All three Marines were charged with the same crimes in early 2023. Federal prosecutors had them on four charges, including entering a restricted building and disorderly conduct.
Over the next few months, Abate was placed on administrative duty at work. And as he and Ashley waited at home for the legal case to run its course, the grim reality set in. “You think all the typical things,” she said. “Like, what are we going to do when he loses his job?”
Abate and his lawyer, Dave Dischley, a family friend in Warrenton, Va., were eventually able to work out a deal with prosecutors. They were willing to drop most charges in exchange for a guilty plea on just one misdemeanor. And the recommendation was a reduced sentence of 21 days in jail.
Abate appeared before U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes, a Biden appointee. She was assigned to Hellonen and Coomer, as well. She declined a request for an interview.
But what we know about Judge Reyes is that, going into the sentencing, she was openly stunned that a Marine would participate in the insurrection. “It’s scary to think that our active duty military were part of the insurrection,” Reyes told Abate, according to a transcript of the hearing. Reyes said she was inclined to give Abate six months behind bars.
Abate told the court in a written statement that he was wrong about the election being stolen, about what Trump was telling the country. “Each of the lies circulated by President Trump were incredibly harmful to our democracy and our unity as a nation.”
And then came the letters. More than 50 of them from family members, friends and fellow Marines. Judge Reyes said she read them all beforehand. Twice.
One was from a Gold Star mom whose son was killed in 2011. “I have met many Marines that are truly good Marines and good people,” she wrote. “Josh is one of those Marines.”
The mother of a childhood friend wrote: “Even though I’m a strong liberal, I would never consider Josh to be a threat. I truly believe he is just fundamentally good.”
Not everyone was willing to write a letter. Abate said a fellow Marine told him basically, ""Josh, I like you, but not what you did.""
But there were more than enough to sway Reyes. She went as far as telling Abate that his case had made her a “better judge.” And she gave him a sentence: 279 hours of community service — one hour she said, for each Marine casualty in the American Civil War.
“She mentioned something about how she’s kind of envious of the story that I can tell my daughter and help her learn from my mistakes,” Abate told us. So this federal judge had gone from being openly disgusted with Abate for joining the violent mob at the Capitol, to essentially helping to craft a redemption story for him.
“Maybe this won’t be so bad after all,” Abate remembers thinking.
An unlikely assist
Earlier this year, NPR spent several hours talking with Abate and wanted to learn more about his activities that day. His description of the insurrection — that he meandered in and never really noticed that what he was doing was wrong — just didn’t make sense based on what we saw that day.
We went through a few other direct questions about Abate’s actions that day.
Did you chant?
“No.”
Of the statue he put the MAGA hat on: A statue of what? A specific person?
“I don’t remember,” he said. “It was just a random statue in the Rotunda.”
He really didn’t see anything disturbing or aggressive?
“I think if I had seen any violence, I would have left sooner,” he said.
On Feb. 21, he called us back for a second interview. When we arrived, he was holding a printout from the FBI’s official statement of facts and started reading from it.
“ ‘Abate appears in the crowd and then he walks,’ ” he said. “And it talks about how he walks and walks and walks and walks and walks. And nothing in our summary of our actions is actually, you know, spooky or violent or scary. I thought it was humorous that they, in their summary of me, my time in the Capitol building, that’s all they could really sum it up to was walking.”
But down at the bottom of the printout it said “Page 1 of 45.” So clearly there was a lot more to the story.
Including video.
A few weeks after we talked with Abate, the House Republicans started dropping some 5,000 hours of security camera footage from Jan. 6 on a public video platform, including time stamps. The security footage does not contain any audio.
What we saw was that seven minutes after the doors to the Capitol were breached, Abate walked in with Hellonen and Coomer. They slowly made their way toward the front of a crowd just 20 steps from the House chamber itself. At one point, Abate cupped his hands around his mouth, and the video shows he clearly is chanting “stop the steal” over and over. At one point, Abate is holding a yellow flag with the words “Don’t Tread on Me.” He appears to gesture to his friends to follow him to the front of the crowd toward the chamber doors. Soon, tear gas starts to fill the hallway. They make their way out of the space and back into the Capitol Rotunda.
Way in the back of the Rotunda video, you can make out Abate taking a hat out of someone’s hands and trying to place it on top of a statue. He finally gets it on there by climbing onto the pedestal.
It’s a bust of Martin Luther King Jr.
From there, Abate and his friends became part of a large, rowdy crowd. The front of the crowd is facing off against a line of Capitol Police who are attempting to push everyone out. Abate stands firm amid the crush and scuffles happening around him, not turning around and leaving. Finally, after several minutes and jostling in the crowd around them, the three of them make their way out of the Rotunda and out of frame.
The story that Abate told us — about an almost casual stroll through the Capitol — just didn’t hold up.
We called his lawyer to tell him what we’d just watched and to ask to sit down with him again. Abate declined.
The Marines and Jan. 6
Despite avoiding jail time, Abate’s career with the Marines was still on the line. In December 2023, he had a retention hearing, where a panel of his colleagues would decide whether he stayed or would be kicked out. It was held in a nondescript government building at Quantico. The hearing lasted 4½ hours.
Retention hearings are administrative but structured like a courtroom. There was a Marine officer who argued in Abate’s defense, saying he was remorseful and accepted responsibility for what he did. His defense lawyer, Dave Dischley, was also there.
Ashley and their baby showed up to support him. Dischley made sure to introduce them to the room.
Another officer served as a kind of prosecutor. One of the points he argued is that Abate by his actions violated an agreement he signed when he joined — one that explicitly forbids participation in extremist activities. The officer said Abate should be kicked out with an other-than-honorable discharge, a red flag to all future employers.
Several Marines acted as witnesses, all telling the panel that Abate is a fine Marine.
“I would say that his initiative is top-notch, sir,” one said.
“By far the most outstanding professional Marine I’ve ever encountered,” said another. “Gentlemen, I wouldn’t be here if someone didn’t give me a second chance. If he can pull off what I know he’s capable of, as a man, as a Marine, as a father, he will show that growth can occur, and that he can overcome even something as trivial as this.”
And then something truly startling happens. The panel includes two officers and a senior sergeant. They all are asked by Abate’s defense attorney about their views on the attack on the Capitol. Are they positive, negative or indifferent?
“Depending on what news source you look at, you get a different narrative, different perception,"" Lt. Col. Sean Foley said. ""It’s a tale of two cities, and at this point, I mean, to be honest I’m tired of hearing about it three years later.”
Then Master Gunnery Sgt. Steven Glew, who said, “So I wasn’t there. I can’t say I know exactly what happened there. So I’m indifferent to what happened that day.”
And finally, Capt. Spencer Morris: “The video footage I’ve seen of the day, specifically focused on the more violent parts of Jan. 6, it definitely gives me a negative perception of how things transpired.”
In the end, the panel unanimously decided to keep Abate in the Marine Corps. Separate panels for Hellonen and Coomer did the same. But Coomer was kicked out shortly after his hearing by a general at Camp Pendleton; Hellonen ran out his enlistment — his contract with the Marines was up — and he left the Corps.
Glew, who had said he was indifferent to what happened that day, was the only one of the panelists who agreed to talk with us about why he voted to retain Abate.
“I have just seen a lot of him in me,” Glew said. “And then, you know, just seeing his family there, his baby, just made me think, you know about my family and what they would have been going through if I was in Josh’s position.”
Extremism in the ranks?
Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro will be the one who makes the final decision about Abate’s fate in the Marines. Ten months later, he has yet to make the call.
Digging into Abate’s story and the aftermath of Jan. 6, we learned that Abate was by far not the only Marine — active or retired — who went into the Capitol that day. Some one-third of the 200 active and retired military participants arrested for their role in the Capitol attack were Marines. That’s a disproportionate number, considering the Marines are the smallest of the fighting forces.
“It is shocking when somebody that’s taken an oath to protect the country is doing something to harm it,” said Michael Jensen, who researches domestic terrorism at the University of Maryland. He said the Marines have one of the highest rates of extremist activity going back more than three decades.
“The Army is the largest branch, so you’d expect for it to have the highest numbers,” he said. “But the second highest number comes from the Marine Corps. They are having an outsized impact driving these numbers of cases, yet they are doing the fewest investigations.”
The Jan. 6 attack forced the Pentagon to come up with a definition of prohibited extremist activity. That definition came out at the end of 2021, and it basically says service members can’t get involved in any activities that call for political violence, passing out literature or raising money for extremist groups, liking something on social media, even wearing clothing or having bumper stickers that promote extremist causes.
Each of the services this year put out guidelines and said they would start collecting data on any extremist activities in the ranks. Right now, the military has yet to start collecting data that was called for in the recently released guidelines, but Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and other officials say they think the numbers are small. Still, some say that even a small number of extremists can have an outsized effect on the military force.
We have spent the last six months trying to get officials to talk about the new guidelines, and most have refused. But just a few weeks ago, we were able to ask the Marines' top officer, Gen. Eric Smith, this question: Do the Marines have an extremism problem?
He said a minuscule percentage of Marines engage in inappropriate behavior.
“What I don’t want to do is hit a fly with a sledgehammer,” he said, “and accuse all Marines of doing something untoward because that’s just not the case.”
But what about the lopsided number of Marines who took part in the Capitol attack?
“No, I don’t worry about that. I think what you see is an anomaly. Those individuals who participated in the Jan. 6 events, those weren’t Marines. They were individuals masquerading as Marines. Our culture didn’t bind to them.”
We’d heard the word “anomaly” before. In Abate’s retention hearing from his defense lawyer Dave Dischley.
“The odds that another event like January 6th is going to occur in this country, you know, in the next hundred years in this country, I think is very slim,” Dischley said. “I think we can all agree to that. The odds that Sergeant Abate would be a part of that? Less than a fraction of a percent.”
But an Associated Press investigation found that nearly 100 people were killed or injured since 2017 in plots that included U.S. military or veterans, most of them in service of a far-right agenda.
In mid-October — just weeks before the 2024 election — Trump was asked about the Capitol attack at a Univision town hall. His answer was defensive and laced with inaccuracies. He also called it “a day of love.”
As for Abate, he wasn’t ruling out another vote for Trump in 2024.
“I still like Trump,” he said. “There's no bad taste in my mouth about Trump.” But, he said, he was still deciding.
We called Josh Abate back one more time as we wrapped up reporting, to ask again if he still liked Trump. But through his lawyer, he declined to speak with us again. He was done telling his story.
Correction Oct. 26, 2024
A previous version of this story incorrectly said U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes sentenced Joshua Abate to 279 hours of community service for each American killed in the American Civil War. It should have read that Abate was sentenced to 279 hours of community service for each Marine casualty in that war. Also a previous version of this story incorrectly said 200 participants were arrested for their role in the Capitol attack. It should have said 200 active and retired military participants were arrested.",2024-10-25
NPR,The Trump campaign tries to distance itself from Puerto Rico ‘joke’ at MSG rally,"The Trump campaign tries to distance itself from Puerto Rico ‘joke’ at MSG rally
Vice President Harris was promoting a new pledge to boost Puerto Rico’s economy in Philadelphia on Sunday — contrasting her approach with that of former President Donald Trump — when her message got some unexpected traction thanks to her opponent’s rally in New York.
A comedian warming up the crowd at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” — drawing outrage from Boricuas far and wide, and boosting support for Harris’ message.
Megastar Bad Bunny posted Harris’ video message pledging to work to create more jobs on the island and rebuild its rickety power grid to his 45 million Instagram followers, and other Puerto Rican artists followed suit.
Trump's campaign has distanced itself from the joke, one of several offensive lines from his act. Trump himself did not yet directly comment on it at two campaign appearances in Georgia on Monday.
But speaking from Wausau, Wisconsin, Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance dismissed the controversy.
""The way that we unite the country is to talk about the issues the American people care the most about,"" Vance told reporters, saying he had heard about the offensive material but hadn't seen it.
""I'm not going to comment on the specifics of the joke, but I think that we have to stop getting so offended at every little thing in the United States of America — I'm so over it,"" Vance said.
Other Republicans similarly sought to distance Trump from the remark.
""Puerto Rico isn’t garbage, it’s home to fellow American citizens who have made tremendous contributions to our country,"" wrote Florida Sen. Marco Rubio in a post on X. ""I understand why some people were offended by a comedians jokes last night. But those weren’t Trump’s words. They were jokes by an insult comic who offends virtually everyone, all the time….. because that is what insult comedians do.""
The 'joke' could have political impact in a key state
Puerto Ricans living on the island don’t get to vote in the presidential election. But Boricuas living on the mainland do — and in Pennsylvania, a pivotal state in this year’s race, they wield significant clout.
According to UCLA’s Latino Policy and Politics Institute, about 580,000 Latinos in Pennsylvania can vote in this election — and most of them are Puerto Rican.
Unidos US Action Fund said it would work to amplify the issue in the swing states Pennsylvania, Arizona and Nevada as it works to get out the Latino vote.
""This level of disrespect toward Puerto Ricans and Latinos at large is unconscionable and, more importantly, a reminder that when people show you who they are, believe them,"" said Rafael Collazo, executive director of the group, in a statement.
After Hurricane Maria hit the island in 2017, Trump questioned the death toll and fought with San Juan’s mayor over the federal response to the disaster. During a visit to the island after the storm, he infamously threw rolls of paper towels into a group of people at a church collecting supplies.
On Monday, the Harris campaign cut a new television ad with the comedian's comments superimposed over images of the island after 2017's Hurricane Maria and footage of Trump throwing rolls of paper towels into a group of people at a church collecting supplies.
Harris told reporters she was proud to have the support of Bad Bunny and Jennifer Lopez, and said Trump's rally was an example of how he has divided the country.
""Donald Trump spends full time trying to have Americans point their finger at each other, fans the fuel of hate and division. And that’s why people are exhausted with him,"" Harris said.
It was a message that former President Barack Obama echoed at a rally for Harris in Philadelphia, as he decried the “island of garbage” line from the MSG rally.
“These are fellow citizens he’s talking about,” Obama said. “Here in Philadelphia, they are your neighbors, they are your friends, they are your co-workers, they go to school with your kids. These are Americans. ”",2024-10-28
NPR,Florida fighting with the U.S. Justice Department over prosecuting Ryan Routh,"Florida fighting with the U.S. Justice Department over prosecuting Ryan Routh
MIAMI — Florida’s Attorney General is asking a federal judge to stop the U.S. Justice Department from blocking the state from investigating and prosecuting Ryan Routh. Routh is charged with attempting to assassinate former President Donald Trump while he was golfing in September.
Deputies arrested Routh after fleeing from what the FBI says was a “sniper’s nest” at Trump’s golf club in West Palm Beach. He’s charged with several counts, including attempting to assassinate a major Presidential candidate. Routh has pleaded not guilty.
Shortly after his arrest, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said the state would open its own investigation. At a news conference, DeSantis questioned whether the Justice Department, which is prosecuting Trump in two criminal cases, can handle Routh’s prosecution fairly and transparently.
The federal government quickly blocked that move. Justice Department officials cited a law which gives the federal government superseding authority over state investigations in cases like this. In a letter to Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody, U.S. Attorney for Florida’s Southern District Markenzy Lapointe said that the federal indictment of Routh on a charge of attempted assassination “resolves any potential uncertainty” about whether the federal law preempting the state’s authority applies.
That same law, Lapointe says, “does not preclude state prosecutions permissibly following the conclusion of the federal prosecution.”
Moody has filed a complaint in federal court asking a judge to overrule the Justice Department’s action and allow the state’s investigation of Routh to go forward. She says forcing Florida to wait to begin its investigation until the federal government completes its prosecution makes the state’s case harder to prove at trial. “Evidence disappears, memories fade, and the State has no way to force the federal government to cooperate.”
By blocking the state’s investigation and prosecution of Routh, she says the federal government is illegally taking authority from the state guaranteed under the Constitution’s 10th amendment. “The federal government’s attempt to thwart Florida’s investigation vastly overreads (the law),” Moody says, “and any enforcement of it would constitute illegal executive action.”
It's not clear when the federal judge will rule on the request.",2024-10-24
NPR,Democrats are vying for the support of rural voters in North Carolina : Consider This from NPR,"Democrats are vying for the support of rural voters in North Carolina
Down Home North Carolina is a non-profit organization focused on rural communities. They say their platform is ""survival"" – helping poor and working class people get basic needs met like housing and education.
As Consider This host Scott Detrow witnessed while spending an afternoon with the group, they are committed to turning out every voter they can.
He and the Consider This team tagged along with Down Home NC Regional Field Director Adon Bermudez-Bey and other door-knockers, watching them spring into action when they met a registered voter who wasn't planning on casting a ballot this year.
Down Home NC volunteer Alex Cook started peppering him with questions about the issues he's facing in his life.
""You need health care, though, right? You get SSI, so you need your health care,"" Cook said.
""Yes I get SSI,"" replied Jakai Britton, the unaffiliated voter who was in his car, about to pull out of the driveway.
""So, do we have a vote from you?"" Cook asked.
""Yeah, you got a vote from me,"" said Britton.
And that, according to Bermudez-Bey, was a sign of success: to get just one voter to go from driving away, to a conversation, and from a no to voting to a maybe – all in the span of just a couple minutes.

Vital rural Democrats
In an election season like this one, Down Home NC is mostly focused on local races, but they endorse candidates up and down the ticket – usually Democrats.
Most of their time is spent urging residents, especially residents of color, to get out and vote.
Nash County is in a rural part of this key swing state. It is near-evenly divided between white and Black residents, and in recent presidential elections, it was near-evenly divided by its results.
President Joe Biden won the county by two tenths of a point in 2020, and four years before that, former President Donald Trump won it by the exact same razor-thin margin.
Driving around the tiny town of Nashville, where the Down Home NC group was canvassing, it didn't feel that way, with plenty of Trump and MAGA signs all over.
Still, Bermudez-Bey and his team of volunteers found Democratic doors to knock on.
""What I noticed is that there's a lot of people [who] want to stay out [of] the way. They see the Trump signs. They see what's going on, in school boards, in the city council. They're just like, 'I'm going to stay out of it,'"" said Bermudez-Bey.
""We're trying to tell them, there's an organization that specifically focuses in rural areas to pull those folks out.""
Undecided voters
With two weeks to go before Election Day, finding a true undecided voter feels like a rarity. But the Down Home NC team says it meets them all the time.
The Consider This team encountered a few too, like Nashville resident Sean Jones, who said he planned to vote. He hadn't quite made up his mind on the presidential race, but said he's leaning toward Vice President Kamala Harris.
""I just recently went to go see my brother in prison this weekend, and he was kind of like on my head about it, like voting. He wanted me to vote for Trump,"" Jones said. ""But I still wanted to vote for Kamala. So, I'm still trying to look into the politics as far as what's what and who's who.""
Adon Bermudez-Bey, speaking only for himself and not for Down Home NC, told Consider This he's also still undecided – even as he led a group of canvassers for an organization that has endorsed Harris.
""I don't know if I'm voting for Kamala. Just full transparency. But I know that I'm definitely not voting for Trump.""
Bermudez-Bey cited his concerns about Harris' time as a prosecutor in California, and her support for Israel during the ongoing war in the Middle East. He's set a deadline for himself: November 2nd, the last day of early voting in North Carolina, to decide between Harris or a third-party candidate.
But he said he still sees the merits of a Harris presidency – at least for Down Home NC's goals.
""No, it's not going to be perfect, but it's going to be a lot easier for us to organize under her presidency than Trump's.""

NPR,Michelle Obama says she's a 'little angry' at the hesitation to vote for Harris,"Michelle Obama says she's a 'little angry' at the hesitation to vote for Harris
KALAMAZOO, Mich. — Michelle Obama stood before a crowd at an event center in Kalamazoo on the first day of early voting in Michigan and confessed she was frustrated — and a “little angry” — at some of the things she’s heard about why people are holding back on support for Vice President Harris.
Speaking directly to the stark gender divide that polls show is a feature of this presidential campaign, Obama railed against “the lie that we do not know who Kamala is or what she stands for,” saying too many voters are shrugging off former President Donald Trump’s character and his track record on a wide range of issues.
Trump was also campaigning in Michigan this weekend, making a stop in Traverse City late Friday night, and a second in the Detroit suburbs on Saturday.
Polls show the race is extremely tight in swing states like Michigan, and Democrats — including former President Barack Obama — have been urgently working to shore up enthusiasm for Harris among Black men, young voters, and other parts of the Democratic base.
“I hope you'll forgive me if I'm a little frustrated that some of us are choosing to ignore Donald Trump's gross incompetence while asking Kamala to dazzle us at every turn,” the former first lady said in her first appearance on the campaign trail with Harris.
“I hope that you will forgive me if I'm a little angry that we are indifferent to his erratic behavior, his obvious mental decline, his history as a convicted felon, a known slum lord, a predator found liable for sexual abuse — all of this while we pick apart Kamala’s answers from interviews that he doesn't even have the courage to do, y’all,” she said.
Obama described Harris as a “grown up” with a clear set of policies, and said she fears “too many people are willing to write off Trump’s childish, mean spirited antics by saying, ‘Well, Trump's just being Trump,’ rather than question his horrible behavior. Some folks think he's funny.”
“That's exactly how he got elected the first time — folks gave him a pass and rolled the dice betting that he couldn't possibly be that bad,” she said.
Harris and Obama focused on women's health care
Harris focused much of her remarks on Saturday on abortion restrictions. She had made a stop at a local doctor’s office in Kalamazoo before the rally and talked to providers and medical students about concerns Trump would expand abortion restrictions nationally, should he win.
Doctors were also featured in her Friday night rally in Houston, making the case that they were unable to provide adequate care for women because of new abortion restrictions.
“Remember how we got here,” Harris told the Saturday rally. “Donald Trump hand-selected three members of the United States Supreme Court with the intention that they would undo the protections of Roe v. Wade. They did as he intended,” she said.
Obama pointedly named a long list of women’s everyday reproductive health issues – cramps, nausea, hot flashes, lumps, and pap smears – and said a second Trump presidency could have a “chilling effect” on doctors being willing to specialize in women’s health care because of abortion restrictions.
She spoke specifically to men in her remarks, emphasizing that further restrictions on abortion and other aspects of women’s health care would impact them and their sons, too.
“I am asking y'all from the core of my being to take our lives seriously — please,” Obama said. “Do not put our lives in the hands of politicians — mostly men — who have no clue or do not care about what we, as women, are going through.”

NPR,"What are Trump’s final rally speeches like? Lower energy, less focused and running late","What are Trump’s final rally speeches like? Lower energy, less focused and running late
There are many recurring characters at former president Donald Trump’s rallies, and the shoutout he gave a traveling group of female superfans at a Greensboro, N.C., rally last week was no different.
Until he messed up their nickname.
“And we have our’ Front Row Jacks’ ... we have ‘Front Row Jacks and Joes,’ thank you very much,” he said about the women that call themselves “Front Row Joes” and attend seemingly every public event he does. “What happened, you’re not in the front row? Whoa!”
When ad-libbing about a visit to a McDonald’s where he served food to supporters in a campaign stunt meant to attack Vice President Harris, he couldn’t remember the word fryer.
“And those French fries were good, they were great,” he said. “They were right out of the ... they were right out of whatever the hell they may come out of.”
In Prescott Valley, Ariz., an attempt to recognize a group of Assyrian supporters went seriously awry when he welcomed what sounded like “Azur-Asians.”
These gaffes aren’t isolated events, but are more emblematic of the final weeks of this election on the trail with Trump, who at 78 years old would be the oldest person ever elected president if he wins next week.
In some ways, though, his closing message isn’t all that different from his first trip down the golden escalator nearly a decade ago.
""When do we beat Mexico at the border? They’re laughing at us, at our stupidity,” he said in 2015. “And now they are beating us economically. They are not our friend, believe me. But they’re killing us economically. The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else’s problems.”
In the discography of Donald Trump, his 2016 campaign topped the charts with concerns over immigration. Today, he still plays his greatest hits, like at that speech in Tempe, where he once again called the U.S. a “dumping ground” for migrants from other countries.
“We're a dumping ground,” he said on Oct 24, 2024. “We're like a ... we're like a garbage can for the world. That's what's happened. That's what's happened to — We're like a garbage can.”
Now in the final days of campaign No. 3, Trump often abruptly jumps from remarks on a teleprompter to nonsensical tangents back to his prepared speech.
In a marathon three-hour interview with podcaster Joe Rogan, Trump touted the oratorical method as a quote “weave” that’s not for everyone.
“I like to give a long — the weave,” Trump said on The Joe Rogan Experience. “But when you do the weaves, and you have to be very smart to do weaves, when you do the weave, look at this, just in this one thing, we’re talking about little pieces.”
“Gotta get it back home,” Rogan interjected.
“No, no, it comes back home for the right people,” Trump continued. “For the wrong people, it doesn't come back home and they end up in the wilderness, right?”
Trump’s attacks have become increasingly profane
Over the summer, Trump had a hard time pivoting away from bashing President Biden after he dropped out. But lately, Trump has fallen into a familiar refrain of calling Harris stupid and low-IQ, and pushing back on criticism of his speeches by arguing none of her words make any sense.
“I have no cognitive,” he said in an Oct. 20 town hall in Lancaster, Pa. “She may have a cognitive problem, but there's no cognitive problem.”
Trump has always pushed the envelope of acceptable speech from a politician, but in recent weeks he’s become more vulgar in his anecdotes and attacks.
""We can't stand you,” he said of Harris in Latrobe, Pa. “You're a sh** vice president ... The worst. You're the worst vice president. Kamala, you're fired. Get the hell out of here!”
And while Trump's final weeks could serve as a farewell tour to campaigning, he's also occasionally told his supporters it’s time to face the music about what might come next.
“If you don't win, win, win, we've all had a good time, but it's not going to matter, right?” he said. “Sadly, because what we've done is amazing: Three nominations in a row. What we've done, we've got to win.”
“If we don't win, it's like it was all it was all for ... not very much. We can't — we can't let that happen.”
It’s a tight race that has required multiple, lengthy events in a day, and the fatigue can be heard in his voice.
In many ways, the Donald Trump of 2016, 2020 and even earlier this year, who promised to “Make America Great Again,” is not the same Donald Trump who stands before voters when the curtains close on this election in November 2024.",2024-10-28
NPR,Man who attacked Nancy Pelosi's husband gets life in prison,"Man who attacked Nancy Pelosi's husband gets life in prison
SAN FRANCISCO — The man who was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison for attacking the husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi with a hammer in their California home was sentenced Tuesday to life in prison without the possibility of parole following a separate state trial.
A San Francisco jury in June found David DePape guilty of charges including aggravated kidnapping, first-degree burglary and false imprisonment of an elder.
Before issuing the sentence, Judge Harry Dorfman dismissed arguments from DePape's attorneys that he be granted a new trial for the 2022 attack against Paul Pelosi, who was 82 years old at the time.
“It’s my intention that Mr. DePape will never get out of prison, he can never be paroled,"" Dorfman said while handing out the punishment.
One of the defense attorneys, Adam Lipson, asked Dorfman before the sentence was handed down to consider DePape’s mental health and isolation that made him susceptible to online propaganda.
“This is a man who has always been a peaceful, law-abiding person up until his activation,” Lipson said.
When given the chance to address the court prior to his sentencing, DePape, dressed in prison orange and with his brown hair in a ponytail, spoke at length about Sept. 11 being an inside job, his ex-wife being replaced by a body double, and his government-provided attorneys conspiring against him.
“I’m a psychic,” DePape told the court, reading from sheets of paper. “The more I meditate, the more psychic I get.”
In a letter read in court by the victim's daughter, Christine Pelosi, Paul Pelosi called for the maximum sentence, saying the “last peaceful sleep” he had ended abruptly “when the defendant violently broke into my home, burst into my bedroom and stood over my bed with a hammer and zip ties demanding to see my wife, yelling ‘Where’s Nancy?’”
He said the attack left him with bumps on his head, a metal plate in it, dizziness and nerve damage in his left hand. Sleeping alone at home evokes memories of the attack, he said.
Previously, a federal jury convicted DePape of assaulting a federal official’s family member and attempting to kidnap a federal official. In May, he was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison during an unusual resentencing hearing that resulted from judicial error. The punishment in the state trial will run concurrently with the federal sentence.
DePape’s attorneys have said the state trial amounted to double jeopardy following his federal conviction. Even though the criminal counts were not exactly the same, the two cases stem from the same act, they argued. The judge did dismiss some of the state charges but kept others that were not covered by the federal case.
The Oct. 28, 2022, attack on Paul Pelosi was captured on police body camera video just days before the midterm elections and shocked the political world. He suffered head wounds, including a skull fracture that was mended with plates and screws. His right arm and hand were also injured.
DePape, a Canadian citizen who has been living in the U.S. for years, admitted during his federal trial that he planned to hold Nancy Pelosi hostage, record his interrogation of her, and “break her kneecaps” if she did not admit to the lies he said she told about “Russiagate,” a reference to the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign.",2024-10-29
NPR,Former 'Bob's Burgers' actor sentenced to 1 year in prison for role in Capitol riot,"Former 'Bob's Burgers' actor sentenced to 1 year in prison for role in Capitol riot
WASHINGTON — An actor known for his roles in the television comedies Bob's Burgers and Arrested Development was sentenced on Monday to one year in prison for his part in a mob's attack on the U.S. Capitol nearly four years ago.
Jay Johnston, 56, of Los Angeles, joined other rioters in a “heave ho” push against police officers guarding a tunnel entrance to the Capitol during the Jan. 6, 2021, riot. Johnston also cracked jokes and interacted with other rioters as he used a cellphone to record the violence around him, prosecutors said.
Johnston expressed regret that he “made it more difficult for the police to do their job"" on Jan. 6. He said he never would have guessed that a riot would erupt that day.
“That was because of my own ignorance, I believe,” he told U.S. District Judge Carl Nichols. “If I had been more political, I could have seen that coming, perhaps.”
The judge, who sentenced Johnston to one year and one day of imprisonment, allowed him to remain free after the hearing and report to prison at a date to be determined. Nichols said he recognizes that Johnston will miss out on caring for his 13-year-old autistic daughter while he is behind bars.
“But his conduct on January 6th was quite problematic. Reprehensible, really,” the judge said.
Johnston pleaded guilty in July to interfering with police officers during a civil disorder, a felony punishable by a maximum prison sentence of five years.
Prosecutors recommended an 18-month prison sentence for Johnston. Their sentencing memo includes a photograph of a smiling Johnston dressed as Jacob Chansley, the spear-carrying Capitol rioter known as the “QAnon Shaman,” at a Halloween party roughly two years after the siege.
“He thinks his participation in one of the most serious crimes against our democracy is a joke,” prosecutors wrote.
Johnston played pizzeria owner Jimmy Pesto Sr. in Bob’s Burgers, a police officer in Arrested Development and a street-brawling newsman in the movie Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy. Johnston also appeared on Mr. Show with Bob and David, an HBO sketch comedy series that starred Bob Odenkirk and David Cross.
Johnston, a Chicago native, moved to Los Angeles in 1993 to pursue an acting career. After the riot, Johnston was fired by the creator of Bob's Burgers, lost a role in a movie based on the show and has ""essentially been blacklisted” in Hollywood, said defense attorney Stanley Woodward.
""Instead, Mr. Johnston has worked as a handyman for the last two years — an obvious far cry from his actual expertise and livelihood in film and television,"" Woodward wrote.
Woodward accused the government of exaggerating Johnston’s riot participation “because he is an acclaimed Hollywood actor.”
Johnston attended then-President Donald Trump's “Stop the Steal” rally near the White House on Jan. 6 before he marched to the Capitol. He used a metal bike rack to scale a stone wall to reach the Capitol's West Plaza before making his way to the mouth of a tunnel entrance that police were guarding on the Lower West Terrace.
“When he was under the archway, he turned and waved to other rioters, beckoning them to join him in fighting the police,” prosecutors wrote.
Entering the tunnel, Johnston helped other rioters flush chemical irritants out of their eyes. Another rioter gave him a stolen police shield, which he handed up closer to the police line. Johnston then joined other rioters in a “heave ho” push against police in the tunnel, a collective effort that crushed an officer against a door frame, prosecutors said.
Johnston recorded himself cracking a joke as rioters pushed an orange ladder toward police in the tunnel, saying, “We’re going to get those light bulbs fixed!”
A day after the riot, in a text message to an acquaintance, Johnston acknowledged being at the Capitol on Jan. 6.
“The news has presented it as an attack. It actually wasn’t. Thought it kind of turned into that. It was a mess,” Johnston wrote.
FBI agents seized Johnston's cellphone when they searched his California home in June 2021.
More than 1,500 people have been charged with Capitol riot-related federal crimes. Over 1,000 rioters have been convicted and sentenced. Roughly 650 of them received prison time ranging from a few days to 22 years.",2024-10-29
NPR,U.S. citizens are among the voters removed in Virginia’s controversial purge,"U.S. citizens are among the voters removed in Virginia’s controversial purge
Nadra Wilson of Lynchburg, Va., was concerned and confused when she received a letter in the mail from local election officials notifying her that her U.S. citizenship was in question.
The notice said she needed to affirm she was a U.S. citizen within 14 days or her voter registration would be canceled. It was first sent to an old address and then was forwarded. By the time Wilson received it in October, the deadline had passed.
But Wilson was puzzled by the letter. ""I was born in Brooklyn, N.Y. — I'm a citizen,"" Wilson said in an interview with NPR before showing her American passport as proof.
Wilson, who works in health care, moved to Virginia nine years ago and first registered to vote there before the 2016 election.
Supreme Court pauses order halting Virginia’s purge program
Wilson is among 1,600 Virginia voters who have been removed from the voter rolls since Aug. 7 because state officials suspected they were noncitizens. On Wednesday, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed Virginia’s program to continue.
The state's Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, has said the program enforces a 2006 state law and removes noncitizens who are ineligible to vote. He issued an August executive order requiring county election officials to remove suspected noncitizens flagged by the state on a daily basis.
But as Wilson and other voters' stories show, the program has also erroneously ensnared U.S. citizens who are eligible to vote.
Civil rights groups and the U.S. Department of Justice had sued Virginia over the program earlier this month. U.S. District Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles ruled Friday the state program violated federal law by systematically removing voters too close to a federal election.
Under the National Voter Registration Act, during the 90 days before an election, states must pause certain kinds of voter list maintenance programs that systematically remove voters to ensure mistakes aren't made too close to the election. The so-called quiet period began this year on Aug. 7, the same day Youngkin issued his executive order.
Giles, who was nominated by President Biden, ordered Virginia to reinstate the 1,600 voters who were taken off by Wednesday. Her order also said the state could still remove noncitizens ""through individualized review.""
Youngkin blasted the lower court’s ruling last Friday..
""This is a stunning ruling by a federal judge who is ordering Virginia to reinstate individuals who have self-identified as noncitizens back on the voter rolls,"" he told Fox News.
Wilson countered that Youngkin is ""not correct"" in how he has characterized the program given that it has also ensnared U.S. citizens like her. She described the state program as ""very, very unfair.""
Over the weekend, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the lower court's ruling against Virginia. The state then appealed to the Supreme Court.
Then on Wednesday, the Supreme Court granted Virginia’s emergency request to block the lower court’s ruling in a 6-3 decision. The emergency stay means that Virginia can continue its program to remove voters and does not have to restore the 1,600 voters removed since Aug. 7.
Because Virginia allows in-person voter registration through Election Day, there is still time for eligible voters to register and vote in the election.
Yet some Virginia voters who were removed in error may have missed the opportunity to request an absentee ballot.
The litigation in Virginia comes during a campaign season in which former President Donald Trump and Republican leaders have repeated baseless conspiracy theories that noncitizens are poised to vote in large numbers this election. Critics say it is an effort to sow distrust in the election and lay the groundwork for potential election challenges. Only U.S. citizens can vote in federal and state elections. A limited number of localities permit noncitizens to vote in local elections, such as school board.
Trump has mischaracterized the Justice Department's lawsuit by claiming the agency is aiming to put ""Illegal Voters"" back on Virginia's rolls and ""CHEAT"" in the upcoming election. There is no evidence for the claim.
Virginia is among several Republican-led states that have announced controversial new initiatives in recent months that purported to remove potential noncitizens but that critics say were overly broad and have also affected eligible citizens.
A federal judge in Alabama earlier this month halted that state's program to inactivate the registrations of 3,251 people the state suspected could be noncitizens. The secretary of state's office has so far acknowledged at least 2,074 of those individuals were eligible voters, according to court filings. The judge — a Trump nominee — said in an Oct. 16 hearing that the state ""has identified a handful, at least four, perhaps as many as ten, perhaps more, noncitizens who were somehow on Alabama's voter rolls.""
Errors from the DMV
Another Virginia voter, 22-year-old Rina Shaw, who said she was born in the state, had not realized that her voter registration had been canceled until NPR asked her about her registration status and she checked it online.
Shaw, who began voting in 2020, said she recently updated her voter registration at the Virginia Department of Motor Vehicles when she was getting her learner's permit and found the form to be ""poorly designed.""
She likely failed to mark a box that she was a U.S. citizen, because afterwards, she received a letter from her county election office notifying her that information from the DMV indicated that she ""may not be a U.S. citizen."" The notice asked her to affirm her citizenship, which she did, and then she mailed back the form.
Shaw acknowledged she likely missed the 14-day deadline to respond, though had not expected her registration would be canceled.
According to a spreadsheet of removed voters that was filed in court and obtained by NPR, it appears that Shaw's registration was canceled on Oct. 20.
Shaw called it ""outrageous"" that the state was removing voters like her ""so close to the election"" and gave so little time for voters to correct the mistake. ""It's insane, I can't believe this has happened,"" Shaw said.
Wilson had also gone to the DMV to renew her driver's license not long before she got her notice of cancellation in the mail. She said she was later told she must have marked a box that she was not a citizen but told NPR, ""I don't believe I did that.""
Eric Olsen, the director of elections for Prince William County, is familiar with stories about DMV visits leading to Virginia voters being mistakenly flagged as potential noncitizens.
The DMV driver's license application has boxes at the very top, above the title, for people to indicate whether or not they are citizens. Olsen said ""it just lends itself to people making mistakes or not seeing the information.""
Olsen said that if someone is flagged by the state as a possible noncitizen, county offices like his must send notices asking them to affirm their citizenship and then must automatically remove anyone from the rolls who doesn't respond within 14 days.
In May, Olsen reviewed the records of the 162 people who his office had removed from the rolls over the previous year under this program. He said of the 43 people in that group who had previously voted, all of them had affirmed on earlier records that they were U.S. citizens, sometimes as many as ""three, four or five times.""
In those cases, Olsen said, ""we would assume that more than likely they just missed this box on the form.""
Lawyers for state election officials denied in court filings that Virginians who left the citizenship box blank at the DMV were flagged to be removed from the voter rolls.
Only voters who were removed after Aug. 7 are subject to the district court's order to be reinstated to the rolls.
It is unknown at this point what the citizenship status is of all of the 1,600 voters. There is no database of U.S. citizens to check against. Lawyers representing civil rights groups in the lawsuit have been attempting to contact everyone on the list.
Anna Dorman, an attorney for the nonprofit Protect Democracy which advocates for voting rights, said she has reached ""numerous"" citizens on the list of 1,600 voters and said there are signs ""a lot of these people are citizens who have been unlawfully purged under this program.""
Dorman and her colleagues have spoken with other U.S. citizens who visited the DMV right before they received cancellation notices from election officials.
Carolina Diaz Tavera, a naturalized U.S. citizen whose voter registration was canceled but who does not appear on the list of voters removed after Aug. 7, filed a declaration in the lawsuit saying she is concerned the state removed her from the voter rolls due to outdated DMV records since she was a legal resident when she got her driver's license.
Virginia's Department of Elections worked with the DMV over the summer to run people who had previously presented noncitizen documents through a federal database, SAVE, and flagged people who appeared not to be citizens, according to court filings.
Dorman said most of the people she has been able to reach did not know that they were removed from the voter rolls. ""They either never got the flier from the government or they got it and they thought it was a scam,"" Dorman said.
As for Nadra Wilson, she arranged to take off early from work so that she could go to her county board of elections and straighten out her voter registration.
""I'm grateful that I was able to get it fixed,"" Wilson said.
Wilson decided to vote early and was able to cast her ballot Tuesday during her lunch break.

NPR,2 close calls have the Secret Service facing criticism and an uncertain future,"2 close calls have the Secret Service facing criticism and an uncertain future
The U.S. Secret Service is once again embroiled in controversy following a second apparent attempt on the life of former President Donald Trump.
The agency came under criticism in July when a gunman at a Trump rally in Butler, Pa., was able to fire multiple shots at the Republican presidential nominee, killing one rally attendee, striking Trump's ear and wounding two others.
The Secret Service had been made aware of a ""suspicious male"" loitering near the rally, but officials lost track of him.
Now, just over two months later, a second alleged gunman was able to make it within several hundred yards of Trump in West Palm Beach, Fla.
This time, the man, armed with a semiautomatic rifle, was thwarted when an agent saw the barrel of the man's gun sticking out through the bushes as the former president played golf. The agent began shooting at the armed man, and the gunman did not return fire, according to authorities.
Trump was uninjured in that event, and in a Monday interview on the social media platform X, he praised Secret Service agents for having done a ""great job"" in protecting him.
But both incidents added to criticism of the agency for letting danger get so close to a person under its protection.
What is the Secret Service?
The Secret Service is the official protection system for sitting and former presidents and vice presidents; their families; major party nominees to those offices; visiting foreign heads of state; and others. As of now, the agency has 36 people under routine protection, including President Biden and his family, as well as former President Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama.
The agency was founded in 1865 under the Department of the Treasury to help combat counterfeiting of U.S. currency following the Civil War. Ironically, President Abraham Lincoln signed approval to start the agency on the same day he was shot.
It wasn't until the 1901 assassination of President William McKinley that the Secret Service would be tasked with protecting the president.
In the years since, the agency has been at the forefront of a number of history-altering events in U.S. politics, including the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and serious attempts on the lives of Presidents Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan.
Following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the U.S., the agency shifted from the Treasury Department to the Department of Homeland Security, which was created in response to the attacks.
The Secret Service's reach as a law enforcement agency has expanded broadly since then.
What are the problems with the agency?
The agency aims for a ""zero-fail"" mission. But the recent attempts against Trump have called into question the agency's leadership and its operatives' ability to do their jobs.
The Secret Service is currently helmed by acting Director Ronald Rowe, who stepped into the role after Kimberly Cheatle's resignation in the wake of the attempt on Trump's life in July.
Lawmakers slammed Cheatle for the Secret Service's response to that shooting, including failures to communicate with local law enforcement officials before and during Trump's rally in Butler and its lack of a good plan to secure the roof that ultimately gave the gunman a clear line of sight to shoot at Trump.
The Department of Homeland Security's Office of Inspector General in July launched its own review into the Secret Service's process for securing the Trump rally.
At a news conference on Monday, Rowe defended his agency and said that following the Pennsylvania shooting, he ordered a paradigm shift of being more proactive instead of reactive. But, he said, the organization needs help.
""We have done more with less for decades,"" Rowe said. ""We have immediate needs right now.""
The Secret Service operates on a budget of just over $3 billion. It employs some 3,600 special agents, 1,600 Uniformed Division officers and more than 2,000 additional personnel.
In a meeting last week with members of Congress, Rowe asked lawmakers for better training for countersnipers and the ability to hire more staff, he said. It wasn't immediately clear how much extra money or personnel the agency is asking for.
Biden similarly noted the agency's issues on Monday, telling reporters: ""The service needs more help.""
What is Congress' role?
Various committees in Congress have launched their own probes into the incidents around Trump.
Following the July assassination attempt, the U.S. House established a task force to investigate the shooting, while the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee launched an investigation.
Speaking on Tuesday in a fireside chat with the right-wing America First Policy Institute think tank, House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said the House task force would expand to include an investigation into the Sunday incident as well.
But lawmakers are divided on whether the Secret Service's problems could be fixed by more money.
Johnson acknowledged that the agency faces problems but questioned whether those issues needed to be solved with additional funding.
""The Secret Service, as you've seen reported, suggests that they have a manpower shortage. And look, it's about allocation of resources,"" he said. ""I'm not so sure it's a funding issue, but Congress will be willing to do what's necessary.""",2024-09-19
NPR,Harris needs young voters of color to win. A new poll finds cracks in her support,"Harris needs young voters of color to win. A new poll finds cracks in her support
When Vice President Harris took over the Democratic ticket this summer, her candidacy brought viral memes, packed rallies and a boost in the polls. Some of the biggest gains were among young Americans, a key Democratic-leaning group that President Biden struggled with before dropping out.
But now, with just under two weeks until voting closes, a new poll finds that some of the early enthusiasm around Harris among young voters may be starting to plateau.
Harris is continuing to outperform former President Donald Trump among Gen Z and millennial voters 47% to 35%, according to the University of Chicago’s latest GenForward poll released Wednesday.
The survey, which was exclusively obtained by NPR, polled more than 2,300 white, Black, Latino and Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) individuals under the age of 40 from Sept. 26 to Oct. 6.
Despite her advantage, the GenForward poll points to a key challenge still remaining for Harris. While the findings show the vice president performing better with younger Americans than President Biden did before he left the race, she has struggled to match the historically high support that Biden enjoyed from voters under 30 during the 2020 election, especially among young Americans of color. That support diminished during Biden’s presidency, and Harris has been unable to regain it.
“The threat of Trump that I think many voters who align with the Democratic Party believe is imminent, I'm not sure young people kind of buy into that narrative,” said Cathy Cohen, a professor at the University of Chicago who founded and serves as the executive director of the GenForward poll.
“I also think that for young voters of color, there is a kind of tentative feeling about the effectiveness of democracy anyway,” she added.

The GenForward poll details a complicated picture of support for Harris when it comes to young voters — especially when broken down by race and ethnicity.
Though Harris enjoys support among six in 10 young Black Americans, it’s a drop compared to Biden’s standing in GenForward’s poll from four years ago, when more than seven in 10 backed him.
For Trump, one in five young Black Americans said they back the former president; among Black men specifically, Trump’s support stood at 25%.
Among young Black women, just 12% said they were supporting Trump, but an additional 16% said they wanted “someone else” when given the options of Trump, Harris and a handful of third party candidates.
Harris has been making direct efforts to engage with Black voters on the campaign trail, laying out a set of economic proposals geared at Black men and doing interviews with media programs geared at Black audiences. But Cohen said she still faces skepticism.
“I think, come Election Day, those who turn out will overwhelmingly vote for Harris,” she said. “But I do think there's a generational moment in Black communities where young people are saying, ‘the Democrats haven't done enough for Black people.”
The poll also found holes in Harris’ support among other demographic groups. Despite her 12-point edge overall against Trump with young Latinos, the former president holds a lead specifically among Latino men.
Trump has additionally made gains among AAPI men since GenForward’s survey four years ago — though a majority of AAPI voters still side with Harris.
Harris and Trump are virtually tied among young white Americans — the only group under 45 that Trump won in 2020 — but the former president now holds a slight edge that is within the margin of error among young white women.
The findings come as Trump has grounded a sizable portion of his campaign’s outreach to young voters in interview appearances with a handful of popular male influencers and podcast hosts that have shows geared toward young men.
The issues shaping the youth vote: the economy and abortion
Harris has established credibility with younger voters on several key issues, including protecting access to reproductive rights — where Americans under 40 said they trusted her over Trump by a 36-point margin, according to the GenForward poll.
It’s an issue Harris has heavily campaigned on, given safeguarding access to the procedure has previously driven youth turnout. She also leads Trump in young voter trust on issues related to racism and inequality, providing housing opportunities and protecting democracy.
But Trump has an edge over Harris and third party candidates on handling a number of other issues, most notably inflation. It’s a topic where roughly four in 10 young Americans trust Trump to bring down prices.
That's significant because as with older voters, economic concerns remain the most important election issue for Americans under 40, according to the survey.
Because of that, Cohen said, it remains an obstacle for Harris in appealing to Gen Z and millennials.
“I believe, for many potential voters, when they come back to the issues that matter most to them right now — in terms of their life — they see [Harris], I think, as attached to a Biden administration that didn't handle inflation in particular,” Cohen said.
That said, there may still be some uncertainty in this race for young Americans still evaluating Harris’ candidacy, leaving room to make gains.
While nearly eight in 10 say they “pretty much already know” what they need to know about Trump, just 57% feel the same for Harris.
Instead, a third of respondents in the poll said they still want to learn more — particularly young Americans of color — presenting an opportunity for the Harris campaign to potentially pick up more votes, but the clock is ticking.",2024-10-23
NPR,Latino voters in focus as Trump and Harris sketch out the campaign's final 2 weeks,"Latino voters in focus as Trump and Harris sketch out the campaign's final 2 weeks
There are only two more Tuesdays left in the 2024 presidential election, and both former President Donald Trump and Vice President Harris’ campaign schedules are filling up with focused stops in key swing states — and beyond.
Both candidates spent part of Tuesday continuing to make their appeals to Latino voters: Trump with a panel discussion at his golf resort in Miami, and Harris in taping an interview with Telemundo that will air Wednesday.
Trump spent the day falsely claiming Harris was taking a day off from campaigning before holding a nighttime rally in Greensboro, North Carolina, his fourth event in two days in a state that has become a must-win for his White House hopes.
Harris spent Tuesday in Washington, D.C., sitting down with NBC News for an interview as well, while former President Barack Obama rallied in Wisconsin with Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz and in Michigan with native son Eminem.
Twenty million people have already cast their ballot in the 2024 presidential election, according to the University of Florida’s Election Lab, including more than 1 in 4 active Georgia voters.
Harris talked policy while Obama rallied in the Midwest
Harris continued to outline how she would govern if elected, as the campaign seeks to push back on criticism of the number and type of interviews she has done.
In an interview on NBC Nightly News, Harris answered a broad range of questions about her policy proposals and the contrast between herself and Trump.
Harris pointed to Trump’s actions during the January 6th insurrection, and said he tried to undo the will of the voters.
“This is a serious matter. The American people are at this point two weeks out, being presented with a very, very serious decision about what will be the future of our country,"" she said.
Asked if she would pardon Trump if she won the White House and he was convicted in the federal election interference case against him, Harris refused to engage.
“I’m not going to get into those hypotheticals,” she said. “I’m focused on the next 14 days.”
Harris also declined to say whether she would make concessions, such as religious exemptions, to get the support of some Republican senators to quickly pass a law enshrining abortion access.
“I'm not going to go down that rabbit hole with you right now,” she said.
In her interview with Telemundo, Harris focused more specifically on her outreach to Latino voters.
“A lot of my agenda is about creating opportunity for people to succeed,” Harris said in a preview of the sitdown that posted Tuesday night.
Harris planned to use the interview to announce a series of policies geared toward Latino men. Those measures include a plan to double the number of registered apprenticeships and remove college degree requirements for up to 500,000 federal jobs.
The Harris campaign said the vice president would also provide 1 million forgivable loans worth up to $20,000 each for Latino and other entrepreneurs, and set a goal to more than double the number of first-time Latino homebuyers to nearly 600,000.
Meanwhile on the campaign trail, Walz and Obama were in Madison, Wisconsin to mark the first day of early voting in the state.
The Minnesota governor railed against Trump’s campaign stop to a McDonald’s over the weekend so he could work the fryer.
""There is something not just nuts, but cruel about a billionaire using people’s livelihoods as a political prop,"" Walz said.
Speaking in Detroit, Obama said that Trump was incompetent and only wanting the power of the presidency as a means to an end, urging voters to support Harris because “we do not need to see what an older, loonier Donald Trump looks like with no guard rails.”
“Donald Trump wants us to think that this country is hopelessly divided between us and them,” he said. “And ‘us’ for him is the ‘real Americans’ who support him, and everybody else who doesn’t, that’s ‘them’ — that’s the enemy.”
Speaking from New Hampshire on Tuesday, President Biden similarly sought to frame Trump as a threat to democracy, telling an audience at a Democratic campaign office in Concord, ""We got to lock him up."" He quickly clarified to explain he was speaking figuratively. ""Politically lock him up. Lock him out. That’s what we have to do,"" Biden said.
The remark drew quick condemnation from the Trump campaign.
""Joe Biden just admitted the truth: he and Kamala’s plan all along has been to politically persecute their opponent President Trump because they can’t beat him fair and square. The Harris-Biden Admin is the real threat to democracy. We call on Kamala Harris to condemn Joe Biden’s disgraceful remark,"" Karoline Leavitt, the national press secretary for the Trump campaign, said in a statement.
Trump is doubling down, especially on immigration
In Florida, Trump argued at a roundtable that the economy was better for Latinos during his four years in office, but often veered off topic. He lobbed personal attacks against Harris, calling her “lazy,” “slow” and “low IQ.”
While Latino voters have historically supported Democrats in greater numbers, Republicans hope Trump’s central focus on immigration issues and border security will help peel away support from a crucial bloc of voters.
His rhetoric around immigration and its effect on the country continues to be dire, even outside his rally settings.
“We can't take a chance at losing this election, because if we lose this election, we may not have a country anymore,” he said.
At his Greensboro, North Carolina rally, Trump continued to call migrants who enter the country illegally part of an “invasion,” vowed to oversee mass deportations and blamed Harris for violent crimes committed by some migrants in the U.S.
He spoke for nearly two hours and mixed in his usual prepared remarks from the teleprompter with lengthy asides, including boasts about his crowd size and a melancholic reflection that his time on the campaign trail is coming to an end, both for this election and potentially for good.
“It's sad, because we're sort of wrapping it up, you know that, right?,” he said. “We've been doing this for a long time. We had two unbelievable elections ... when you think, we've been doing it for, from 2015 and now we're where we are.”
Trump, who would be the oldest person to become president if he wins, has also seen an increase in verbal gaffes and distracting non sequiturs in his speeches recently. Tuesday night, he appeared to forget the word “fryer” when talking about his McDonald’s stop and mistakenly called a segment of loyal superfans known as the “Front Row Joes” the “Front Row Jacks” and “Front Row Jacks and Joes.”
“Those french fries were good,” he said. “They were right out of the — they were right out of whatever the hell they make ‘em out of.”
The final countdown for both campaigns
With 14 days to go until voting closes, the time, place and focus of each event added to the calendar gives insight into the campaigns’ closing messages and priorities to get out the vote.
Trump will headline a Turning Point USA rally in suburban Gwinnett County, Ga. Wednesday while Harris tapes a town hall with CNN in Chester Township, Pa. Thursday, Harris also heads to Gwinnett County to rally voters with Obama and Bruce Springsteen.
The Harris campaign announced Tuesday that the vice president will travel to Houston, Texas on Friday to discuss how the state’s abortion restrictions have hurt women — and to pin the blame for that on Trump. The event is also aimed at boosting support for Rep. Colin Allred, D-Texas, who is challenging Republican Ted Cruz for his Senate seat.
Trump also announced multiple rallies in Pennsylvania and Michigan later this week, joining events planned in Nevada and Arizona before holding an event at Madison Square Garden in New York.

NPR,Judge unseals new evidence against Trump in the Jan. 6 election interference case,"Judge unseals new evidence against Trump in the Jan. 6 election interference case
In a newly unsealed court filing, special counsel Jack Smith provides the most detailed picture yet of his criminal case against Donald Trump for allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 election and why the former president isn't immune from prosecution.
U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, who is presiding over the case, released the filing, with minor redactions, on Wednesday.
The special counsel uses the 165-page document to make his case that Trump's actions around the election were made in a private capacity and not in his official role as president.
The filing comes after the Supreme Court ruled this summer that presidents enjoy broad immunity for official acts while in office, but not for unofficial acts as a candidate or a private citizen.
""When the defendant lost the 2020 presidential election, he resorted to crimes to try to stay in office,"" the special counsel's team writes. ""With private co-conspirators, the defendant launched a series of increasingly desperate plans to overturn the legitimate election results in seven states that he had lost.""
A D.C. grand jury indictment accused Trump of actions that culminated in the violent siege at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. If he regains the White House, Trump is expected to direct new Justice Department leaders to drop the landmark case.
Prosecutors accuse Trump of spearheading a conspiracy to overturn the results of the 2020 election and disenfranchise millions of American voters.
""At its core, the defendant's scheme was a private criminal effort,"" the special counsel writes. ""In his capacity as a candidate, the defendant used deceit to target every stage of the electoral process.""
The filing offers several new details about Trump's actions
The broad strokes of the special counsel's allegations against Trump have long been known. The filing, though, adds some new details, including sensitive testimony from witnesses and notes taken by former Vice President Mike Pence.
It also offers some colorful details, largely designed to tie Trump to overlapping conspiracies to overturn the 2020 election.
In one section, the filing details what Trump was doing on Jan. 6, 2021, as a violent mob of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. Trump, it says, settled into the dining room off the Oval Office around 1:30 p.m. and spent the afternoon reviewing Twitter on his phone while Fox News played in the background.
At one point, a staffer rushed into the dining room to tell Trump that Pence had been rushed to a secure location because of the rioters. The staffer hoped, the filing says, that Trump would do something to ensure Pence's safety.
Instead, the document says, Trump ""looked at him and said only, 'So what?'""
The new filing also provides a closer look at Trump's interactions with his former political aide, podcaster Steve Bannon, including a phone call the two men had the day before the Capitol riot, the new court filing says.
Just a couple of hours later, Bannon told his podcast audience that ""all hell"" would break loose the following day.
Lawyers for Trump and for Smith, the special counsel, had clashed over whether the court filing should be released, given its potential impact on the 2024 presidential election, where Trump is the Republican nominee.
Ultimately, Chutkan agreed to release part of the government's new arguments against the former president, saying the public must understand the court's eventual decision on immunity and therefore needs access to the government's arguments.
In response to the release, Trump posted to TruthSocial to accuse Democrats of ""Weaponizing the Justice Department against me because they know I am WINNING.""
""This is egregious PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT, and should not have been released right before the Election,"" he continued.",2024-10-02
NPR,"In an election race this close, Asian American voters have become a force","In an election race this close, Asian American voters have become a force
PHILADELPHIA — Exactly a month before Election Day, James Delos Reyes was waiting in the parking lot of Philadelphia’s only Jollibee.
This branch of the Filipino fast food chain has become the de facto meet-up spot for canvassers for the Asian and Pacific Islander Political Alliance (APIPA) — a group that is knocking on doors every day until the election for Vice President Harris and other candidates they’ve endorsed.
“It’s indicative of how much this area has grown in Asian population,” said Delos Reyes, the group’s deputy field director. “It is home to a large Korean, Viet, South Asian population that’s steadily growing. I guess we can count Filipinos up on that list, if Jollibee’s considered enough folks to open up a restaurant.”
Asian American and Pacific Islanders are the fastest-growing voting group in the country. In Pennsylvania, the number of eligible voters from this demographic group grew by a whopping 55% between 2010 and 2020.
It’s still a narrow slice of eligible voters — about 3% — in this critical state. But polls show the presidential race is essentially tied here, so AAPI turnout could help determine who wins.
Growth of the AAPI population in Pennsylvania has been massive
In 2020, President Biden won Pennsylvania by a razor-thin margin – in part thanks to record turnout among AAPI voters.
“The lesson from 2020 was that no matter how small a community is, they matter, especially in a time when the country is so polarized,” said Neil Makhija, the commissioner of Montgomery County.
The county invested in a brand new voting van — where people can register to vote and cast their ballots on the spot. The county plans to take it to Diwali events, fall festivals, and other community gatherings, Makhija said. He said the van is also equipped with information about voting in eight different languages.
For years, the majority of Asian American voters hadn’t been reached out to by either party, data from AAPIVote and AAPI Data shows.
In part that’s because it takes a lot of labor and money to translate flyers, signs and information on how to vote, said Delos Reyes. His group’s pamphlets in the Philadelphia area have every English sentence translated into simplified Chinese, Viet and Urdu.
While AAPI voters have overwhelmingly voted blue in the past, they haven’t been strongly tied to a specific party, which means they are persuadable targets. But once engaged in politics, Asian American voters tend to stay engaged, according to APIPA.
How candidates are reaching out this year
Harris’ campaign has three staffers dedicated to AAPI voter outreach, and they have boosted advertising in Asian American media.
One recent ad slammed Trump for the surge of anti-Asian hate during the COVID-19 pandemic. Another has Harris talking about her mother, an immigrant from India. The phrase “she is one of us” — referring to Harris — is displayed in the ad.
The Trump campaign has done less specific outreach to the community. A Trump campaign official speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to reporters said their strategy to reach AAPI voters is the same for Black and Latino voters — which is to try to tap into nostalgia for the economy when Trump was president.
This summer, Trump visited the Eden Center, a Vietnamese shopping center in northern Virginia, and rallied with Hung Cao, the GOP candidate for the Senate.
“I don't know what it is. You'll have to explain it. But the Vietnamese community loves me and I love them,” Trump said.
AAPI voters will also be critical in other states
Outreach from both parties to AAPI voters could be a deciding factor in other swing states, too. In Nevada, for example, AAPI voters make up nearly 12% of the state’s electorate.
Engaging specific communities within the AAPI demographic could matter, too. In swing states like North Carolina, Georgia and Michigan, Indian Americans are the largest ethnic group among AAPI voters.
In North Carolina, Democratic organizer Mona Singh with the group They See Blue said she saw a surge of interest from South Asians to campaign for Harris after the vice president entered the race.
When President Biden was still the nominee, Singh said she would see about five South Asian volunteers, on average, come out to canvas events Singh organized. Now, she said there are consistently around 20 canvassers.
Advocacy groups say they’re building for future elections, too
In past election cycles, the lack of outreach made many people in the community feel like politics wasn’t for them.
Jamie Min, 29, said he doesn't vote. He's a Korean American software engineer who says he has concerns about the economy and immigration.
“I think it's mostly the culture of just kind of being second-class, almost like and we kind of feel like we don't have a voice,” Min said as he took a look around this year's Kimchi Festival in downtown Philadelphia.
That feeling is something Linh Nguyễn, the executive vice president of AAPI Victory Fund, is trying to change. Her organization is a political action committee that has backed Harris, and works to engage and mobilize Asian American voters.
Nguyễn has worked for past Democratic campaigns, and said it used to be a “literal battle” to have rally signs translated into different Asian languages.
“I hate to say this, but we were barely on the map. And the understanding of who and what it means to be Asian in America was just not there in mainstream politics,” she said.
This cycle, they’ve put out mailers in California with pictures of families eating hot pot for dinner, and they’ve worked with Asian American influencers and bloggers to reach young voters.
“To see how it’s grown … is one of the most remarkable things I’ve seen in the last 10 years,” Nguyễn said.
