CNN,Analysis: Trump’s plan to radically remake government with RFK Jr. and Elon Musk is coming into view | CNN Politics,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.
For much of the presidential campaign, former President Donald Trump worked to distance himself from Project 2025, the detailed game plan written by conservative activists for a second Trump term.
Whether or not his allies will try to implement portions of the controversial plan if he wins the 2024 election is still the topic of some debate.
But there is an equally radical and expansive government reformation plan coming out of Trump’s own mouth, in which heterodox figures like Robert F. Kennedy Jr. would be given free rein to “go wild” on the health safety system and Elon Musk would be enabled to, as the tech billionaire said, “start from scratch” with the federal workforce.
So without getting bogged down in whether Trump does or does not support Project 2025, here’s a look at what the former president and the people he says he would empower have said they would do if he wins the White House.
‘Go wild’ with RFK Jr.
Trump has promised to give Kennedy leeway to remake the way the government health apparatus protects Americans.
“I’m going to let him go wild on the food. I’m going to let him go wild on the medicines,” Trump said during his closing argument rally at Madison Square Garden on Sunday.
Much of what Kennedy pushes sounds positive. His “Make America Healthy Again” PAC promises to focus on “prioritizing regenerative agriculture, preserving natural habitats, and eliminating toxins from our food, water, and air.”
But those ideas are short on specifics, and there are personal issues that would impede anyone else from government service. Kennedy compared vaccine requirements with the Nazi Germany era, claiming Anne Frank was in a better situation; was once arrested for heroin possession; and has pushed wild conspiracy theories about chemicals in the water making children gay or transgender.
Kennedy’s own health has also been a concern. He once ate so much tuna and perch that he experienced “severe brain fog” from mercury poisoning, he told The New York Times.
In video obtained by CNN, Kennedy told supporters on Monday that Trump had promised to give him sweeping power over multiple agencies if the former president wins the election.
“The key that I think I’m – you know, that President Trump has promised me is – is control of the public health agencies, which are HHS (Department of Health and Human Services) and its sub-agencies, CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), FDA (Food and Drug Administration), NIH (National Institutes of Health) and a few others, and then also the USDA (Department of Agriculture), which is – which, you know, is key to making America healthy. Because we’ve got to get off of seed oils, and we’ve got to get off of pesticide intensive agriculture,” Kennedy said.
CNN has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment, according to a report by Aaron Pellish. So it’s not clear if Trump’s “go wild” is the same as Kennedy’s view that he would be given such broad control. Trump has definitely said Kennedy would be included on a panel to investigate the rise in chronic diseases. For what it’s worth, Project 2025 suggested a massive overhaul of health agencies, including splitting up the CDC.
“Trump’s plans have been met with alarm in the public health community, not so much for the specific policy proposals Kennedy has communicated as part of his ‘Make America Healthy Again’ platform as much as for the key issue he’s been leaving out: vaccines,” according to CNN’s Meg Tirell. She wrote an in-depth review of Kennedy’s record on health issues.
Both Trump and Kennedy have expressed vaccine skepticism, and Kennedy has been a longtime activist pushing debunked theories about vaccines. During the campaign, Kennedy has deemphasized his views on vaccines, Tirrell notes. His push for more natural food does find support among some health experts.
‘Start from scratch’ with Musk
Musk, the superrich Trump supporter, would be given a much wider portfolio than Kennedy and be charged with a massive downsizing of the federal government.
It’s an even stickier situation since Musk’s many companies, including SpaceX and Tesla, have a profit-motivated interest in business with the government. The US government currently relies on SpaceX, which also owns the satellite internet provider Starlink.
If there’s any doubt that a Musk government role could be a risk for conflict of interest, simply look at the fact that he has said he could be in charge of the “Department of Government Efficiency.” DOGE is the name of Musk’s cryptocurrency, an area the Trump family is also keen to enter.
Musk is also constantly pushing out antisemitic things and has mused about how women shouldn’t vote. Not to mention reports of his meetings with hostile foreign leaders.
In a potential new Trump administration, Musk promises a reinvention of the federal bureaucracy.
“Let’s start from scratch,” Musk said at an event in October in Pittsburgh, suggesting a drastic remaking of the federal bureacracy.
CNN’s David Goldman looked this month at what Trump and Musk have said about a potential Musk role in government, which would be focused on steep spending cuts – Musk has said he could trim $2 trillion, perhaps with help from artificial intelligence – and rolling back regulations. But he’d do it in a nice way, apparently.
“Musk has promised a gentle touch, offering generous severance packages to laid-off government workers, while at the same time proposing an assessment system that threatens layoffs to wasteful employees,” Goldman wrote.
The problem, according to the former Treasury Secretary Larry Summer, is that there’s not $2 trillion to be gained from massive government layoffs.
“Respectfully, I think it is idiotic,” Summers said on Fox News this week. “These people think it’s like some business. But here’s the problem: Only 15% of the federal budget is for payroll. So even if you took all the employees, every single person working for the federal government out, you couldn’t save anything like $2 trillion.”
Summers has a point about payroll. The government spent about $271 billion to compensate 2.3 million civilian employees in 2022, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Summers said that to achieve trillions in cuts, Musk would have to look at Social Security and Medicare benefits, something Trump has promised not to do.
‘No Obamacare’
House Speaker Mike Johnson, a top Trump ally, said in Pennsylvania on Monday that if Trump wins and Republicans keep the House, there would be a “massive” overhaul of the health care system. “No Obamacare?” shouted an attendee at the campaign event. “No Obamacare,” Johnson said.
He added: “The ACA is so deeply ingrained; we need massive reform to make this work. And we got a lot of ideas on how to do that.”
During a debate with Vice President Kamala Harris in September, Trump did not give specifics, but he did say he had “concepts” of a plan. These have not been shared publicly.
Trump tried, and failed, during his time in White House to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but retooling the health care system is clearly still a priority for Republicans.
Drastic change won’t be easy
This is a good spot to point out that no matter what Trump is promising Kennedy and Musk, and no matter what Johnson hopes to do about health care, the realities of the US government make drastic change hard to achieve.
A minority in the Senate, assuming it’s larger than 40 senators, could block any attempt to really undo the Affordable Care Act. The Senate is supposed to confirm top officials like Cabinet secretaries, although Trump and other presidents found ways around that rule in the Constitution. It’s not clear if Kennedy could find the votes to be confirmed as secretary of Health and Human Services or if Trump would even nominate him. If Kennedy had a role in the White House, his ability to enact sweeping change would be limited.
While presidents have authority over the federal workforce and Trump was working to reclassify many federal employees to make them easier to fire when he was president, a “start from scratch” scenario would theoretically require congressional approval.
Not that we can say with any certainty what would require congressional approval since, unlike with the detailed Project 2025 plan, there are no specifics to match any of these big ideas. At least not yet.",30/10/2024
CNN,Supreme Court rules RFK Jr. will appear on battleground ballots despite suspending campaign | CNN Politics,"The Supreme Court declined Tuesday to let Robert F. Kennedy Jr. withdraw his name from ballots in Michigan and Wisconsin, battleground states where votes for his now suspended campaign could cut into support for former President Donald Trump.
Kennedy, who left the presidential race in August and endorsed Trump, urged the Supreme Court in an emergency appeal to force the states to yank his name from the ballots. But state election officials countered that early and absentee voting in the states was already well underway. In other words, they said, it was too late.
The Supreme Court handed down its decision without further explanation, which is common on its emergency docket. Justice Neil Gorsuch, a member of the court’s conservative wing, dissented in the Michigan case.
In an unusual twist, Kennedy had asked the high court weeks earlier to help him push his way onto the ballot in New York. After suspending his campaign, Kennedy initially suggested voters could continue to support him in less competitive states. The Supreme Court also rejected that request.
At the center of Kennedy’s case in Michigan and Wisconsin was an argument that the states were violating his First Amendment rights by compelling his speech by forcing him to suggest to voters that he is still a candidate.
Michigan told the Supreme Court this week that over 1.5 million voters had already returned absentee ballots with Kennedy’s name listed as an option on them and that another 263,000 residents had voted early.
“This election is not merely ‘imminent,’ it is already underway, and voters are already voting,” Michigan officials had told the Supreme Court.",29/10/2024
CNN,Supreme Court allows Virginia to purge suspected noncitizens from voter registration rolls | CNN Politics,"A divided Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed Virginia to implement a program that state officials say is aimed at removing suspected noncitizens from its voter registration rolls, siding with Republicans in one of its first significant decisions tied to next week’s election.
The decision, issued without comment from a majority of conservative justices, will allow the state to keep off the rolls certain voters it suspects of being noncitizens.
Liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented.
Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, framed the effort in Virginia as a commonsense way of ensuring noncitizens don’t vote. But the Biden administration, voting rights groups and lower courts said Virginia’s program also ensnared – and potentially disenfranchised – an unknown number of citizens.
Even though Virginia isn’t a battleground state, both the program and the legal fight took on sharply political overtones as Trump and other Republicans have fueled false narratives about widespread voting by noncitizens. At issue are about 1,600 voter registrations that Virginia said came from self-identified noncitizens but that a US District Court said hadn’t been fully vetted for citizenship status.
Noncitizens are not allowed to vote in federal elections; none of the lower court rulings had changed that fact.
Trump and other Republicans have seized on claims of illegal voting and that was part of the argument they made to explain the former president’s loss in 2020. But documented cases of noncitizens voting are extremely rare. A recent Georgia audit of the 8.2 million people on its rolls found just 20 registered noncitizens – only nine of whom had voted.
The Virginia case began with an order signed by Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, in August that required election officials to take more aggressive steps to match residents who self-identified as noncitizens at the Department of Motor Vehicles against voter rolls and to purge those matches.
Youngkin on Wednesday called the Supreme Court’s order a “victory for common sense and election fairness.”
The state’s voters, he said, “can cast their ballots on Election Day knowing that Virginia’s elections are fair, secure, and free from politically-motivated interference.”
The Biden administration and voting rights groups sued and a US District Court concluded last week that at least some eligible US citizens had their registrations culled under the program. District Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles said that none of the parties involved in the case knew for certain the citizenship status of the purged voters because the information wasn’t verified.
Those opposed to the program relied on a 1993 law, the National Voter Registration Act, which bars states from making “systematic” changes to voting rolls with 90 days of a federal election. The Biden administration said that Youngkin’s order created exactly that kind of systematic program within the so-called “quiet period” mandated by the federal law.
Virginia argued that the quiet period prohibitions applied only to eligible voters, not noncitizens.
None of the lower court orders blocked the state from making individual eligibility assessments, or from ultimately knocking noncitizen voters off the rolls, nor gave noncitizens the right to vote in federal elections. The federal law only bars “systematic” changes.
A three-judge panel of the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals – all appointed by Democratic presidents – affirmed most of Giles’ ruling, keeping the program paused and required the state to return the 1,600 registrants to the rolls.
In their emergency appeal to the Supreme Court, Virginia election officials relied in part on a still-developing legal theory that warns federal courts against making last-minute changes to the status quo of voting rules before an election. The so-called “Purcell principle” is intended to stop federal courts from getting dragged into last-minute election controversies.
Virginia argued that the federal district court violated that principle by pausing the program. Voting rights groups countered that there was a federal law in play in this instance that specifically allowed plaintiffs to challenge last-minute voting changes.
Lawyers for Virginia also pointed to its option for same-day registration. Those whose registrations were wrongly cancelled could re-register at an in-person polling place by affirming their citizenship.
Virginia’s opponents countered that that option would not solve the issue for purged voters who planned to vote absentee, unaware their registrations had been cancelled and that it risked confusion at polling places – particularly if poll workers weren’t adequately prepared to deal with the scenario.
Because the Supreme Court offered no explanation for its decision, it’s not clear which of Virginia’s arguments were persuasive.

CNN,Judge rejects GOP congressmens’ lawsuit challenging vetting process for Pennsylvania overseas ballots | CNN Politics,"A federal judge on Tuesday tossed out a Republican lawsuit that sought to segregate overseas ballots in Pennsylvania for additional vetting.
US District Judge Christopher Conner said that the challengers to Pennsylvania’s policies for overseas ballots filed by GOP members of the Pennsylvania congressional delegation and an outside group came too late and that it was too close to the election for a court to intervene.
The overseas vote has long been viewed as sacrosanct because of its connection to the military vote, and the Pennsylvania lawsuit – which would have jeopardized the ballots of service people abroad – drew a sharp backlash.
In recent election cycles, the civilian expat community has outnumbered military voters casting ballots. Democrats have touted their effort to turn out their voters abroad.
Tuesday’s ruling comes on the heels of court losses for Republicans in Michigan and North Carolina in Republican National Committee lawsuits that challenged overseas ballots cast by voters who had never lived in those states but were eligible to vote because of familial ties to those states. Those cases have been appealed, but the Michigan appeal will not be resolved before the election.
Conner said that the court order that Republicans were asking for was a “nonstarter.”
“An injunction at this late hour would upend the Commonwealth’s carefully laid election administration procedures to the detriment of untold thousands of voters, to say nothing of the state and county administrators who would be expected to implement these new procedures on top of their current duties,” Conner, who was appointed by President George W. Bush, said.
“Plaintiffs delayed too long to file their action, they lack standing, they have failed to join indispensable parties, and they have failed to articulate a viable cause of action,” Conner added.
He cited other procedural issues with Republicans’ lawsuit as well.
A lawyer for the House Republicans did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Pennsylvania election officials said in court filings that the lawsuit “would potentially disenfranchise thousands of voters who are qualified to vote under Pennsylvania law.” At a court hearing earlier this month, a lawyer for the election officials said that by the time the complaint had been filed, 26,000 overseas ballots had been requested in Pennsylvania. It’s not clear how many would have been rejected under the more stringent verification procedures Republicans were seeking.
In the Pennsylvania case, the Republicans were arguing that election officials should take additional steps to verify ballots cast in the state from overseas voters.

CNN,Biden makes the case for wartime aid to Israel and Ukraine in primetime address | CNN Politics,"President Joe Biden tied the wars in Ukraine and Israel together during a primetime Oval Office address Thursday, making an impassioned appeal to the American people to support two fellow democracies that he says are facing existential threats.
The president has often cast this moment in history as an “inflection point” – a battle between the world’s democracies and autocracies. On Thursday, he argued that “this is one of those moments,” making a direct appeal to the American people as he sought to build support for US funding for wars abroad that could face a challenging path in Congress, where the House of Representatives remains unable to pass legislation in its second week without a speaker.
“Hamas and Putin represent different threats, but they share this in common: They both want to completely annihilate a neighboring democracy, completely annihilate it,” Biden said.
“We can’t let petty partisan, angry politics get in the way of our responsibilities as a great nation. We cannot and will not let terrorists like Hamas and tyrants like Putin win. I refuse to let that happen,” he added.”
He laid out the stakes for the American people, calling the wars a national security imperative and a critical moment for the future of American leadership and democracies worldwide.
“American leadership is what holds the world together. American alliances are what keep us in America safe. American values are what make us a partner nation you want to work with,” he said. “To put all that at risk – we walk away from Ukraine, we turn our backs on Israel – it’s just not worth it.”
The president said support for both wars is “vital for America’s national security.”
“History has taught us that when terrorists don’t pay a price for their terror, when dictators don’t pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos and death and more destruction. They keep going. And the cost and the threat to America in the world keep rising,” Biden said, warning, “If we don’t stop Putin’s appetite for power and control in Ukraine, he won’t limit himself just to Ukraine.”
And he warned more broadly that the United States’ adversaries and competitors “are watching.”
“If we walk away and let Putin erase Ukraine’s independence, would-be aggressors around the world would be emboldened to try the same. The risk of conflict and chaos could spread in other parts of the world – in the Indo Pacific, in the Middle East, especially in the Middle East,” Biden said.
A request for more funding
The primetime address took place on the eve of the White House requesting north of $100 billion from Congress to deliver aid and resources to Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan, and the US border with Mexico, even though the legislative branch is paralyzed by the dysfunction in the House of Representatives.
The administration has informed lawmakers it plans to seek $14 billion for border security in its new funding package, a marked increase from the previous ask, according to a source familiar. The administration previously asked for $4 billion in supplemental funding to address needs on the US-Mexico border. The new ask encompasses fiscal year 2024, which is why it’s higher than the supplemental request submitted by the White House over the summer, according to another source familiar.
Biden said he would be submitting an “urgent budget request” for supplemental funding for Israel and Ukraine, among other national security priorities.
“That’s why tomorrow I’m going to send to Congress an urgent budget request to fund America’s national security needs – needs to support our critical partners, including Israel and Ukraine. It’s a smart investment that’s gonna pay dividends for American security for generations,” Biden said.
While the White House believes there remains broad bipartisan support in Congress for the package, as three administration officials told CNN, real questions remain about the path for such a package with a leadership vacuum in the House of Representatives and consternation about federal spending levels that have cast into question the government’s ability to fund itself beyond mid-November.
The Biden administration in August delivered its last so-called supplemental funding request, which encapsulates unique requests beyond traditional government programs. The proposal requested $24.1 billion to aid Ukraine through the end of the year, but Congress failed to approve it during a process to greenlight short-term federal funding.
Biden reiterated that he will not put American boots on the ground in Ukraine.
“I will not send American troops to fight in Ukraine. All Ukraine is asking for is help. For the weapons, munitions, the capacity, the capability of pushing invading Russian forces off their land and the air defense system to shoot down Russian missiles before they destroy Ukrainian cities,” he said.
As public opinion toward military aid provision for Ukraine has waned in the last year, Biden also sought to explain the process, tying it to American jobs.
“We send Ukrainian equipment sitting in our stockpiles. And when we use the money allocated by Congress, we use it to replenish our own stores, our own stockpiles, with new equipment. Equipment that defends America and is made in America,” he said, pointing to Patriot missiles for air defense batteries that are made in Arizona and artillery shells that are manufactured in 12 states across the country, including Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Texas.
“Just as in World War II, today, patriotic American workers are building the arsenal of democracy and serving the cause of freedom,” he said.
Public opinion regarding US assistance has been mixed.
In a recent CNN poll, nearly all respondents were sympathetic with the Israeli people in the wake of surprise attacks launched by Hamas, but there was no clear consensus on the right level of US involvement. One-third (35%) said the US is providing the right amount of assistance – and another 36% were unsure whether the level of US assistance is appropriate. The US has long provided security assistance to Israel, which receives roughly $4 billion annually under a 10-year memorandum of understanding. The new request would provide billions more.
By contrast, support to sustain aid to Ukraine has waned significantly since Russia’s unprovoked invasion in February 2022. An August CNN poll found 55% of respondents said Congress should not pass more funding to aid Ukraine. The partisan divide has been deepening, too: Nearly three-quarters of Republicans opposed more funding for Ukraine, while 62% of Democrats supported it.
Since Russia’s invasion, the White House and Congress have provided more than $75 billion in funding to Kyiv, according to the Kiel Institute for the World Economy.
Speech comes after high-profile visit
The speech comes on the heels of his wartime visit to the Middle East, which went on even after a blast tore through a hospital in Gaza. While his planned stop in Amman, Jordan, to meet Arab leaders was canceled just as the president was preparing to depart the White House, Biden did spend hours on the ground in Tel Aviv.
For Biden, a trip in the formative days of a potentially drawn-out conflict amounted to the ultimate test of his confidence – built over decades – that getting in the same room can influence people and events.
During the speech, the president reflected on the visit, which included a meeting that stretched well past what officials had expected, in which Biden sought to use his decades-long relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu – one that has endured significant strain over the past year – to offer advice and seek commitments on the flow of humanitarian aid to Gaza.
“The terrorist group Hamas unleashed pure, unadulterated evil in the world. But sadly, the Jewish people know, perhaps better than anyone, that there is no limit to the depravity of people when they want to inflict pain on others. In Israel, I saw people who are strong, determined, resilient and also angry, in shock and in deep, deep pain,” he said.
He reiterated his support for Americans being held hostage by Hamas.
“As I told the families of Americans being held captive by Hamas, we’re pursuing every avenue to bring their loved ones home. As president, there is no higher priority for me than the safety of Americans held hostage,” he said.
He also pointed to an agreement securing “sustained delivery of lifesaving humanitarian assistance for the Palestinians, from the United Nations to Palestinian civilians in Gaza,” warning Hamas against diverting or stealing the shipments.
The US, Egypt and Israel have all signaled readiness for aid to begin moving into Gaza, following Biden’s high-profile visit. However, the Rafah crossing from Egypt to Gaza is not expected to open Friday for a convoy of humanitarian aid to get into Gaza, multiple sources told CNN, despite expectations voiced by Biden and others that it would be open.
“I would not put money on those trucks going through tomorrow,” one source familiar with the discussions told CNN.
During his address, Biden sought to draw a clear distinction between Hamas and the Palestinian people and argued for a two-state solution to the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians.
“Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people. Hamas uses Palestinian civilians as human shields, and innocent Palestinian families are suffering greatly because of them,” he said.
The US, he later added, “remains committed to the Palestinian people’s right to dignity and to self-determination. The actions of Hamas terrorists don’t take that right away.”
Biden empathizes with both Muslims and Jews
During Biden’s speech, he spoke out forcefully against both Islamophobia and antisemitism, both of which have intensified in recent days, offering comfort and condemnation.
Biden acknowledged the fear from Jewish families “worried about being targeted in school, wearing symbols of their faith walking down the street, or going out about their daily life.”
And he empathized with Muslim Americans who are “outraged… saying to yourself, ‘Here we go again, with Islamophobia and distrust we saw after 9/11.’”
“We can’t stand by and stand silent where this happens. We must, without equivocation, denounce antisemitism. We must, also without equivocation, denounce Islamophobia,” he said.
Biden and first lady Dr. Jill Biden spoke Thursday evening with the father and uncle of Wadea Al-Fayoume, the Palestinian American boy stabbed to death in Illinois on Saturday.
The Bidens “expressed their deepest condolences to the ( Al-Fayoume) family as they mourn; their prayers that Wadea’s mother, Hannan Shahin, makes a full recovery; and their commitment to keep speaking out against anti-Palestinian, anti-Arab, and anti-Muslim hate and violence,” the White House said.
Biden invoked the Al-Fayoume family in his Oval Office address.
“Just last week, a mother was brutally stabbed. A little boy – here in the United States – a little boy who just turned six years old was murdered in their home outside of Chicago. His name was Wadea, Wadea. A proud American, a proud Palestinian-American family,” Biden said.
He offered a message of recognition to those impacted: “To all of you hurting, those of you hurting, I want you to know I see you. You belong. I want to say this to you: You’re all American.”
“In moments like these, and when fears and suspicion, anger and rage run hard, we have to work harder than ever to hold onto the values that make us who we are,” he said.
While he said that Americans should not “forget who we are,” he also warned that the government of Israel should not “be blinded by rage.”
The message – tinged with hard-learned lessons from life in the United States after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks – echoed thoughts Biden shared with Israelis while in Tel Aviv the day before.
“I caution this: While you feel that rage, don’t be consumed by it,” Biden told his audience, a collection of Israelis and Americans.
“I know the choices are never clear or easy for the leadership,” Biden went on, recalling mistakes the United States made after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. “There’s always cost, but it requires being deliberate, requires asking very hard questions. That requires clarity about the objectives and an honest assessment about whether the path you’re on will achieve those objectives.”

CNN,Promises Donald Trump has made so far in his campaign for a second term,"Promises Donald Trump has made so far in his campaign for a second term
Editor's Note: CNN's What Matters newsletter connects the dots of the ever-changing political landscape. Click here to sign up for free.
Since launching his third bid for the White House, former President Donald Trump has insisted on the campaign trail that life was better under his administration, and he has vowed to reverse many of the policies enacted since he left office. His successor's sweeping climate change agenda, new restrictions on guns and protections for transgender people would all be on the chopping block, he has said.
In rolling back the calendar to before January 2021, Trump also wants to pick up where his administration left off on many of his first-term priorities, and his ideas will sound familiar to anyone who paid attention to his first campaign eight years ago. He has said he plans to finish building the wall between the US and Mexico that he first promised in 2016, remove all undocumented individuals, implement more tariffs on imports and increase American energy production.
His quest to pick up new support has also led him to dangle promises to specific audiences, including proposing in Las Vegas to eliminate income taxes on tipped wages. He has also floated ambitious but vague ideas to position America for the future by embracing flying cars, promoting cryptocurrency and promising to build 10 new ""Freedom Cities.”
But an urge for vengeance is also coursing through Trump's bid to return to Washington, and he is plotting retribution against the systems, institutions and people he believes have wronged him. He and his allies have suggested Trump in a second term could unleash the Justice Department on his political enemies, purge the federal government of disloyal bureaucrats and consolidate power in the executive branch.
Trump will face Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race, in November. (See Harris’ campaign promises here.)
Economy
Trump has promised to extend the cuts from his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, notably the TCJA’s individual income tax breaks. The former president has also talked about reducing the corporate tax rate to 15%, from 21% – but only for companies that make their products in the US.
“I will make the Trump tax cuts the largest tax cut in history,” the former president said earlier this year at the Black Conservative Federation’s Honors Gala in South Carolina. “We’ll make it permanent and give you a new economic boom.”
I will make the Trump tax cuts the largest tax cut in history.”
In September, Trump said he would push for legislation that would end taxes on overtime pay.
“That gives people more of an incentive to work,"" Trump said at a rally in Arizona. ""It gives the companies a lot, it’s a lot easier to get the people.”
This summer, during a campaign stop in Las Vegas, Trump also pledged to end taxes on tips, a move targeted to appeal to hundreds of thousands of people working in the city.
The former president has also promised to stop taxing Social Security benefits. He has yet to outline a proposal to replace the lost revenue, which could harm the popular entitlement program, as well as Medicare and the federal budget.
He has also proposed a government efficiency commission as a way to reduce government spending and announced that Tesla CEO Elon Musk has agreed to lead it. The commission will “develop an action plan to totally eliminate fraud and improper payments within six months,” Trump said in September remarks at the Economic Club of New York.
The former president has also announced plans to get rid of the $10,000 limit on state and local tax, or SALT, deductions that he signed into law as part of his 2017 tax cuts. Reversing this cap would largely affect higher-income people in high-tax blue states who itemize their deductions.
In an early October speech, Trump promised to make the interest paid on car loans fully tax deductible. He also vowed in an October video to end the double taxation on Americans who live abroad. This move could stop some Americans living abroad from having to pay taxes to both the US and to the country where they live. He has not provided details on how such relief would work.
Trump has also pledged to repeal Biden’s tax hikes, “immediately tackle” inflation and end what he called Biden’s “war” on American energy production. He has promised to rescind all unspent funds from the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which put in place a wide array of climate measures and funneled about $80 billion over 10 years to the Internal Revenue Service.
In an effort to address housing affordability, Trump has floated a ban on mortgages for undocumented immigrants, claiming that they push up housing costs. CNN has reported that undocumented immigrants, however, make up a tiny portion of the mortgage market.
To help “working Americans” catch up on credit card debt, Trump promised in September to temporarily cap interest rates on credit cards at 10%. The average credit card rate is just under 21%, while the average rate on retail store cards is a record high 30.45%.
Immigration
Trump has made immigration and the border a central campaign issue, successfully pressuring Republicans to reject a major bipartisan border deal earlier this year and making a trip to the southern border on February 29, where he touted his previous hard-line immigration policies.
In a Des Moines Register op-ed published roughly a week before winning the Iowa caucuses in January, Trump vowed to use the “Alien Enemies Act to remove known or suspected gang members, drug dealers, or cartel members from the United States.”
“We will shift massive portions of federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement — including parts of the DEA, ATF, FBI, and DHS,” he wrote.
In a video posted on Truth Social in late February before his border visit, Trump also promised to “carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history.”
We will shift massive portions of federal law enforcement to immigration enforcement — including parts of the DEA, ATF, FBI, and DHS.”
But in June, Trump proposed “automatically” giving green cards to foreign nationals who graduate from US colleges — comments that break from his efforts to curb both legal and illegal immigration while in office.
After the Israel-Hamas war began last October, Trump also promised to terminate the visas of “Hamas’ sympathizers.”
“We’ll get them off our college campuses, out of our cities and get them the hell out of our country, if that’s OK with you,” he added.
Drug cartels
The former president has also made waging “war” on drug cartels a priority for his second term. If elected, Trump said in his November 2022 campaign announcement that he would ask Congress to ensure that drug smugglers and human traffickers can receive the death penalty for their “heinous acts.”
Trump also vowed to “take down” drug cartels by imposing naval embargos on cartels, cutting off cartels’ access to global financial systems and using special forces within the Department of Defense to damage the cartels’ leadership.
At an August campaign event in Arizona, Trump also vowed to impose a “10-year mandatory minimum sentence for anyone guilty of human smuggling, a guaranteed life sentence for anyone guilty of child trafficking, and a death penalty for anyone guilty of child or woman sex trafficking.”
Education
Trump announced plans in a September 2023 campaign video to close the Department of Education and send “all education and education work and needs back to the states.”
“We want them to run the education of our children, because they’ll do a much better job of it,” he added.
The former president has also promised to “put parents back in charge and give them the final say” in education. In a January 2023 campaign video, the former president said he would give funding preferences and “favorable treatment” to schools that allow parents to elect principals, abolish teacher tenure for K-12 teachers, use merit pay to incentivize quality teaching and cut the number of school administrators, such as those overseeing diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.
We want them to run the education of our children, because they’ll do a much better job of it.”
Trump reaffirmed plans to close the Education Department in a conversation on X with Musk in August, during which the tech billionaire proposed the commission to look for ways to cut government spending.
“This is where I need an Elon Musk. I need somebody that has a lot of strength and courage and smarts. I want to close up the Department of Education, move education back to the states,” Trump said.
Trump also said in that 2023 campaign video that he would cut funding for schools that teach critical race theory and gender ideology. In a later speech, Trump said he would bring back the 1776 Commission, which was launched in his previous administration to “teach our values and promote our history and our traditions to our children.”
The former president said he would charge the Department of Justice and the Department of Education with investigating civil rights violations of race-based discrimination in schools while also removing “Marxists” from the Department of Education. A second Trump administration would pursue violations in schools of both the Constitution’s Establishment and Free Exercise clauses, which prohibit the government establishment of religion and protect a citizen’s right to practice their own religion, he said.
Trump has also promised to fund free online classes with funds seized from private university endowments.
Health care
Last November, Trump promised to replace the Affordable Care Act, known colloquially as Obamacare, in a series of posts on Truth Social. A Trump-backed effort to repeal and replace Obamacare failed in 2017 after three Republicans senators joined with Democrats to vote against the bill.
“Getting much better Healthcare than Obamacare for the American people will be a priority of the Trump Administration,” he said.
“It is not a matter of cost, it is a matter of HEALTH. America will have one of the best Healthcare Plans anywhere in the world. Right now it has one of the WORST!,” he continued. He also doubled down on his vow during a speech in early January.
Getting much better Healthcare than Obamacare for the American people will be a priority of the Trump Administration.”
Trump also vowed in a June 2023 campaign video to reinstate his previous executive order so that the US government would pay the same price for pharmaceuticals as other developed countries. Some of the former president’s pharmaceutical policies were overturned by Biden.
Trump said in April that he would not sign a federal abortion ban and has taken the position that abortion laws should be decided by states.
“The states will determine by vote or legislation or perhaps both, and whatever they decide must be the law of the land,” Trump said in an April recording posted to his Truth Social platform.
Trump also said in May that he did not support banning birth control. He previously said that he was “looking at” contraceptives when asked if he supported restrictions.
In August, Trump announced plans to make either the government or insurance companies pay for in vitro fertilization treatments. He did not specify how the treatments would be paid for.
The former president also praised medical marijuana ahead of some states voting on the issue this fall. In a September social media post, he pledged that, if elected, he’d “continue to focus on research to unlock the medical uses of marijuana to a Schedule 3 drug, and work with Congress to pass common sense laws, including safe banking for state authorized companies, and supporting states rights to pass marijuana laws, like in Florida, that work so well for their citizens.”
Gender care
“I will revoke every Biden policy promoting the chemical castration and sexual mutilation of our youth and ask Congress to send me a bill prohibiting child sexual mutilation in all 50 states,” Trump said at the 2023 Conservative Political Action Conference last March.
Trump added in a campaign video that he would issue an executive order instructing federal agencies to cut programs that promote gender transitions, as well as asking Congress to stop the use of federal dollars to promote and pay for gender-affirming procedures. The former president added that his administration would not allow hospitals and health care providers to meet the federal health and safety standards for Medicaid and Medicare if they provide chemical or physical gender-affirming care to youth.
Justice system
Trump has promised to use the Department of Justice to attack critics and former allies. In several videos and speeches, the former president also laid out plans to gut the current justice system by firing “radical Marxist prosecutors that are destroying America.”
“I will appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family,” Trump said in June 2023 remarks. “I will totally obliterate the Deep State.”
Trump said in a campaign video last year that he would reinstate a 2020 executive order to remove “rogue” bureaucrats and propose a constitutional amendment for term limits on members of Congress.
I will appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family.”
To address what he labeled the “disturbing” relationship between technology platforms and the government, the former president said in a January 2023 video that he would enact a seven-year cooling off period before employees at agencies such as the FBI or CIA can work for platforms that oversee mass user data.
Trump added in multiple campaign releases that he would task the Justice Department with investigating online censorship, ban federal agencies from “colluding” to censor citizens and suspend federal money to universities participating in “censorship-supporting activities.”
In a September 2023 speech at the Family Research Council’s Pray Vote Stand Summit in Washington, DC, Trump also touted plans to continue appointing conservative judges.
“I will once again appoint rock-solid conservative judges to do what they have to do in the mold of Justices Antonin Scalia; Samuel Alito, a great gentleman; and another great gentleman, Clarence Thomas,” he said.
Trump has also pledged to “appoint U.S. Attorneys who will be the polar opposite of the Soros District Attorneys and others that are being appointed throughout the United States.”
In a September 2023 speech in Washington, DC, Trump also announced that he would appoint a task force to review the cases of people he claimed had been “unjustly persecuted by the Biden administration.” Trump noted that he wanted to “study the situation very quickly, and sign their pardons or commutations on day one.”
It’s a move that could lead to potential pardons of many rioters from the January 6, 2021, insurrection – which he suggested he would do at a CNN town hall in May 2023.
At the Libertarian Convention in May, Trump also promised to release Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the online black market Silk Road who is serving a life sentence in prison for money laundering, drug trafficking and computer hacking. Trump declined to commute Ulbricht’s sentence during his presidency.
*Only promises on judge appointments and congressional term limits are similar to prior campaigns
Crime
Trump said in two February 2023 campaign videos that if “Marxist” prosecutors refuse to charge crimes and surrender “our cities to violent criminals,” he “will not hesitate to send in federal law enforcement to restore peace and public safety.”
Trump added that he would instruct the Department of Justice to open civil rights investigations into “radical left” prosecutors’ offices that engaged in racial enforcement of the law, encourage Congress to use their legal authority over Washington, DC, to restore “law and order” and overhaul federal standards of disciplining minors to address rising crimes like carjackings.
Addressing policies made in what Trump calls the “Democrats’ war on police,” the former president vowed in a campaign video that he would pass a “record investment” to hire and retrain police, strengthen protections like qualified immunity, increase penalties for assaulting law enforcement officers and deploy the National Guard when local law enforcement “refuses to act.”
The former president added that he would require law enforcement agencies that receive money from his funding investment or the Department of Justice to use “proven common sense” measures such as stop-and-frisk.
Foreign policy
Trump has continued his attacks against member countries of NATO, a European and North American defense alliance. At a South Carolina rally earlier this year, Trump said he would not abide by the alliance’s collective-defense clause and would encourage Russia to do “whatever the hell they want” if a member country didn’t meet spending guidelines.
“NATO was busted until I came along,” Trump said. “I said, ‘Everybody’s gonna pay.’ They said, ‘Well, if we don’t pay, are you still going to protect us?’ I said, ‘Absolutely not.’ They couldn’t believe the answer.”
The former president has also previously pledged to end the war in Ukraine, though he’s offered no details on how he would do so. “Shortly after I win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled,” Trump said at a New Hampshire campaign event last year, adding in another speech that it would take him “no longer than one day” to settle the war if elected.
NATO was busted until I came along. I said, ‘Everybody’s gonna pay.’ They said, ‘Well, if we don’t pay, are you still going to protect us?’ I said, ‘Absolutely not.’”
Trump further addressed his strategy of stopping the “never-ending wars” by vowing to remove “warmongers,” “frauds” and “failures in the senior ranks of our government,” and replace them with national security officials who would defend America’s interests. The former president added in a campaign video that he would stop lobbyists and government contractors from pushing senior military officials toward war.
In addition, Trump has said he would restore his “wonderful” travel ban on individuals from several majority-Muslim countries to “keep radical Islamic terrorists out of our country” after Biden overturned the ban in 2021.
New cities and flying cars
Trump said in multiple campaign videos that he would spearhead an effort to build so-called “Freedom Cities” to “reopen the frontier, reignite American imagination, and give hundreds of thousands of young people and other people, all hardworking families, a new shot at home ownership and in fact, the American Dream.”
In his plan, the federal government would charter 10 new cities on federal land, awarding them to areas with the best development proposals. The former president said in a campaign video that the Freedom Cities would bring the return of US manufacturing, economic opportunity, new industries and affordable living.
In the March 2023 video, Trump added that the US under a second Trump administration would lead in efforts to “develop vertical-takeoff-and-landing vehicles for families and individuals,” not letting China lead “this revolution in air mobility.” The former president said these airborne vehicles would change commerce and bring wealth into rural communities.
Electric vehicles
Trump has promised to roll back new car pollution rules at the Environmental Protection Agency that could require electric vehicles to account for up to two-thirds of new cars sold in the US by 2032. Biden’s electrical vehicle-related policies, Trump claimed at a Michigan rally last September, “spell the death of the US auto industry.”
“On day one, I will terminate Joe Biden’s electrical vehicle mandate, and I will cancel every job-killing regulation that is crushing American autoworkers,” Trump added.
When pressed on whether he would keep Biden’s $7,500 tax credit for EV purchases, Trump told Reuters in late August, ""I'm not making any final decisions on it.”
""I'm a big fan of electric cars, but I'm a fan of gasoline-propelled cars, and also hybrids and whatever else happens to come along,"" he said.
Energy
Trump has promised to reduce energy prices by increasing domestic production. In several campaign appearances, he has laid out plans to end delays in federal drilling permits and leases.
“We’re going to ‘drill, baby, drill’ right away,” Trump told a crowd of supporters in Des Moines, Iowa, during a victory speech after winning the state’s Republican caucuses in January.
At a South Carolina rally in February, he pledged to remove limits on American natural gas exports.
The Washington Post has also reported that Trump, during an April meeting at Mar-a-Lago, pledged to roll back some of Biden’s climate policies if oil executives raised $1 billion for his campaign.
As for other energy sources, Trump has also changed his tune on the expansion of offshore wind farms, which he had touted at the start of his presidency as part of a broader push to “unleash the forces of economic innovation to more fully develop and explore our ocean economy.”
In May, Trump described wind farms as “horrible” and accused turbines of killing birds and whales, adding that he would “make sure that ends on day one.”
Trump has also promoted US cryptocurrency mining, an industry that has grown significantly more reliant on fossil fuels. Bitcoin mining is energy-intensive because servers require enormous amounts of power to solve a complex series of algorithms to verify transactions in order to receive the cryptocurrency as a reward.
At a cryptocurrency conference in July, the former president promised to make it easier for cryptocurrency mining companies to operate in the US.
“If crypto is going to define the future, I want it to be mined, minted and made in the USA,” Trump said, adding that he would create a “strategic national bitcoin stockpile.”
He also vowed to fire Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, who has pushed to regulate the industry.
Trade
In February, Trump pledged to impose “stiff penalties on China and other trade abusers.”
“It’s called you screw us, and we screw you,” Trump said at a South Carolina rally.
Under his proposed “Trump Reciprocal Trade Act,” the former president said if other countries impose tariffs on the US, the country would impose “a reciprocal, identical” tariff right back.
It was the same pledge Trump made in a campaign video in 2023: to impose the same tariffs that other countries may impose on the US on those countries. The goal, the former president said then, is to get other countries to drop their tariffs.
It’s called you screw us, and we screw you.”
As part of a larger strategy to bring jobs back into the US, Trump also said he would implement his so-called “America First” trade agenda if elected. By setting universal baseline tariffs on a majority of foreign goods, the former president said Americans would see taxes decrease as tariffs increase. His proposal also includes a four-year plan to phase out all Chinese imports of essential goods and stop China from buying up America and US companies from investing in China.
Trump also said in February that he would consider imposing a tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports if he’s reelected. He has also called for adding a tariff of at least 10% on all imports from all countries. At an August campaign event in North Carolina, he suggested that the across-the-board tariff could be as high as 20%.
In a meeting with GOP congressional lawmakers in June, Trump also suggested replacing federal income taxes with high tariffs, according to a report from Reuters.
In September, Trump floated a 100% or 200% tariff on cars made in Mexico. He claimed this would stop Chinese companies from building auto plants in Mexico as a way to avoid US tariffs, which he could impose by executive action.
In October, Trump announced that if he wins the White House again, he would invoke the six-year renegotiation provision of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which was signed into law in January 2020 as a replacement for NAFTA.
The former president has particularly focused on China, vowing in a January 2023 campaign video to restrict Chinese ownership of US infrastructure such as energy, technology, telecommunications and natural resources. Trump also said he would force the Chinese to sell current holdings that may put national security at risk. “Economic security is national security,” he said.
Second Amendment
“I will take Biden’s executive order directing the federal government to target the firearms industry, and I will rip it up and throw it out on day one,” Trump said at the 2023 National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action leadership forum last April.
The former president also promised in the speech that the government would not infringe on citizens’ Second Amendment rights. In May, he said would sign legislation forcing states to recognize a concealed carry permit from any jurisdiction.
Equity
“I will create a special team to rapidly review every action taken by federal agencies under Biden’s ‘equity’ agenda that will need to be reversed. We will reverse almost all of them,” Trump said in a campaign video.
Trump added in multiple campaign videos that he would revoke Biden’s equity executive order that required federal agencies to deliver equitable outcomes in policy and conduct equity training. If elected, Trump said he would also fire staffers hired to implement Biden’s policy, and then reinstate his 2020 executive order banning racial and sexual stereotyping in the federal government.",11/10/2024

CNN,Tensions between Trump and RNC spill over into public view | CNN Politics,"Former President Donald Trump’s decision to skip next month’s third GOP presidential primary debate and instead hold a rivaling rally just up the road highlights how complicated – and at times thorny – the relationship between the Republican National Committee and the front-runner’s team has become.
The RNC was caught off guard when Trump’s campaign announced last week that it would hold a counterprogramming event the same night as the debate, just down the road from the Miami arena where other Republican candidates would be facing off.
While Trump has not attended any of the debates, citing his commanding lead in the polls, the decision to host what appears to be a competing event in the same area has rubbed some Republicans the wrong way.
“It’s a slap in the face [to the RNC],” one Republican operative with ties to the committee told CNN. “An intentional slap in the face.”
Allies close to Trump attempted to justify the decision, pointing to Trump’s public frustration that the RNC is continuing to hold debates despite the wide margin he has over the rest of the field. Earlier this month, the former president’s top campaign advisers called on the RNC to “immediately cancel the upcoming debate in Miami and end all future debates in order to refocus its manpower and money” on defeating Democrats in 2024.
But even before the debates took center stage, Trump’s relationship with the organization, led by his own hand-picked chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel, had become increasingly tumultuous in recent months.
For one, the former president privately still harbors resentment towards the organization over the 2020 election, blaming them for not having what he believes were the proper attorneys in place to challenge the election results, multiple sources told CNN. Some Trump allies have tried unsuccessfully to rid him of this belief – noting that it was not the RNC’s responsibility to provide the legal resources to challenge the election. Others have pointed out that his own 2020 campaign should have had a better legal infrastructure in place – however, these arguments, like many involving the 2020 election, have fallen on deaf ears.
While Trump seems to understand that why the RNC has not endorsed his 2024 candidacy, sources said he has asked allies and aides why the RNC must remain neutral in the 2024 GOP presidential primary race. The RNC’s bylaws mandate neutrality; this primary season, McDaniel has taken pains to act as an impartial chair.
The RNC stressed that it is focused on presiding over the GOP primary in a fair way to all the candidates running for the Republican nomination for president.
“The RNC will continue to enact a fair, transparent debate process. In addition to sanctioning the primary debates, the RNC is continuing to buildout our 2024 operation, with in-state hires for Political and Election Integrity staffers in key battleground states,” an RNC spokesman said in a statement.
Trump appointed McDaniel as chair after he was elected in 2016, and dozens of establishment Republican committee members were replaced by Trump loyalists. Trump personally felt like he helped make McDaniel into the party leader she is, and has expected loyalty from her as a result, sources familiar with their relationship said. When Trump was president, McDaniel was extremely supportive. And, while Trump was a driving force behind McDaniel retaining the chair of the committee earlier this year, many in his orbit fault her for Republicans’ underwhelming results in the 2022 midterms.
“There’s a general concern about Ronna and the RNC when it comes to the 2020 and 2022 elections,” a person close to Trump told CNN, pointing to what they saw as mistakes with the party’s messaging strategy and get out the vote efforts.
“There’s a lot of concern about her leading the party going forward,” the source added.
However, Trump’s top campaign officials are in regular touch with RNC leadership and Trump’s senior campaign advisers, including Susie Wiles, flew to California earlier this year for McDaniel’s reelection as chair. Privately, Trump’s team had made it clear that they were backing McDaniel against her opponent, Trump attorney Harmeet Dhillon.
Shortly after winning, McDaniel told Fox News that this would be her “last term as chair…It’s done.”
After a major political party picks a nominee, there are usually some adjustments between that nominee’s campaign structure and the party committee – something that some members of Trump’s inner circle would like to see if Trump becomes the GOP nominee.
One source noted that it was too early to have a conversation about changes at the RNC, but added that top officials, including McDaniel, should be willing to step aside to make way for new leadership if Trump wins the nomination.
Another insisted that Trump is not planning to “clean house” should he becomes the nominee.
“It’s not unusual for the nominee to make some changes at the RNC, and I imagine Trump will, but there is nothing planned,” one source close to the former president said, noting that McDaniel’s term would be over in a year and a half anyway. “There would be a new RNC chairman that I imagine Trump would be influential and in choosing just like he was influential with [McDaniel].”
The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.
Tensions began escalating ahead of first debate
After McDaniel announced the first debate would be in August, Trump began to suggest publicly he may not participate, citing his lead in early polls and because he would face questions from what he described as “hostile” news networks.
Trump also said in a Truth Social post that the RNC didn’t get “approval” from him or his campaign ahead of announcing the debates, though presidential candidates do not have singular control over the format or timing of these events.
A GOP adviser familiar with the process said Trump’s campaign was fully briefed on the timing, location and other specifics of the announced primary debates. McDaniel had told Trump personally that the debates would start in August, according to two sources familiar with the conversation.
The debate fight came to a head when RNC officials met with Trump’s senior campaign advisers in Nashville last spring at the RNC retreat to sort out what had become a public back and forth, multiple sources familiar with the meeting told CNN.
The conversation turned into a heated back-and-forth between David Bossie, who is in charge of the RNC debate committee, and Trump campaign adviser Chris LaCivita. McDaniel and Wiles stepped in break it up.
As it became clear Trump would not likely participate in the first debate, McDaniel and Bossie privately visited Trump at Bedminster in July to encourage him to participate in the debates, CNN previously reported. Trump was noncommittal on his plans during that meeting. However, in the weeks that followed, he increasingly became frustrated with McDaniel and Bossie for continuing to try and pressure him into attending – something that has also contributed to the straining of their relationship, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.
“Sitting there, having Bossie and Ronna tell him that it’s a good idea to go to a debate where he’s going to get the crap kicked out of him by all the other candidates, never mind the moderators, there’s no upside,” the source said. “He didn’t appreciate it.”
“It just started to grate on him,” the source said.
RNC officials and members pushed back at the idea that they would not hold the debate just because Trump is leading in the polls.
“The reality is 50% of the base is with him – that means there’s another 50% that’s not,” the Republican operative said. “That 50% has to feel like there’s a fair process that played out if they’re going to turn out if Trump is nominated and actually vote for him.”
While Trump bristled at the date, which he said was early, the sources said that he did not completely shut it down. But two Trump sources familiar with the conversations between Trump’s campaign and the RNC said that his team and the former president himself had made it clear that he would not attend a debate before Labor Day.
Trump instead sat for a pre-recorded interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.
The legal complications
The link between Trump world and McDaniel and the RNC goes deeper than politics, as the chairwoman and the committee have become entangled in Trump’s legal woes. The RNC paid millions of dollars to law firms representing Trump in various investigations, but stopped after Trump announced his third presidential run due to their neutrality policy.
The committee “cannot pay legal bills for any candidate that’s announced,” McDaniel told CNN’s Dana Bash last November when asked whether the RNC would stop paying Trump’s legal bills if he became a candidate.
“We cannot do in kind contributions to any candidate right now. He’s the former president being attacked from every which way with lawsuits, and he’s certainly raised more under the RNC than we’ve spent on these bills,” she added at the time.
McDaniel also testified before the House select committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, and is likely to testify in the federal trial as well. The federal case into Trump’s alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election is just one of several trials Trump is facing early next year.
Earlier this month, the judge presiding over the Georgia election subversion case signed an order to compel McDaniel to testify at the trial.
“You’d think that maybe everyone attacking her would take into consideration that she’s probably going to end up in several of his trials,” the GOP operative told CNN.
As of now, it’s unclear how her potential testimony could further impact their relationship, but her role as a likely witness could further add to the strain between the two.",23/10/2023
CNN,"Harris hopes Ellipse speech will recall Trump’s chaos, but also evoke her own promise | CNN Politics","As advisers to Vice President Kamala Harris were mulling where to stage the final major address of her campaign, they had a few boxes to check.
The venue, they believed, must convey a degree of gravity about the choice before voters. But equally important, in their view, was its ability to evoke the promise of the office she seeks.
In the Ellipse – the patch of park where Donald Trump rallied his supporters on January 6, 2021, within view of the White House – they believe they found that equilibrium.
“It’s really a reminder of the gravity of the job, how much a president can do for good and for bad, to shape the country and impact people’s lives,” Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, the campaign chair, said Tuesday.
“But it’s also a stark visualization of probably the most infamous example of Donald Trump and how he’s used his power for bad, really focusing on himself and spreading division and chaos and inciting a mob to try to maintain his own power and put himself over the country.”
For Harris, striking a balance between dire warnings about a rival she calls a fascist and forward-looking optimism about the president she would be has become a defining challenge of the campaign’s closing stretch.
Tuesday’s high-profile speech is one of the last remaining opportunities for the vice president to try to reach a critical segment of the electorate known inside the campaign as “conflicted voters,” aides said, or those who may have concerns with Trump’s conduct but who are not yet convinced Harris is a candidate of change who can get the country on track.
While it’s hard to imagine that one speech could move the needle, aides said, it is also intended to draw a clear contrast with Trump’s controversial Madison Square Garden rally Sunday evening. That was not the original intent of Harris’ major address, aides said, but they believe it serves as a timely rebuttal.
“It’s going to crystallize many of the key arguments that she started with,” according to a source familiar with Harris’ speech, citing reproductive freedom and her framing of what she calls an “opportunity economy.”
Despite the sober overtones of the setting – it is where Trump told his supporters to march to the Capitol on January 6; many did, causing destruction and death – Harris’ advisers say the speech will be hopeful and optimistic, and not focused exclusively on the events that unfolded at the site nearly four years ago.
If there is a takeaway from that day she wants to drive home, it is that her own victory would turn the page on Trump’s divisiveness, according to advisers.
With the office she is seeking to occupy 500 yards to the north, the setting provides Harris an opportunity to describe her plans for country, principally on the economy, the top issue for voters.
In the final week of the campaign, the speech isn’t intended to cover entirely new ground, aides said, but rather to frame the stakes of the race and highlight the deep contrast between Harris and Trump.
Standing on the Ellipse, aides said, will allow Harris to bring familiar arguments about democracy to life in a setting that explicitly highlights the lengths that Trump and his allies went to try to overturn the 2020 election. The venue will also underscore how she believes a second term could be worse, they said.
“As I’ve said many times and I’ll say tomorrow night in my speech, there’s a big difference between he and I. If he were elected on Day 1, he’s going to be sitting in the Oval Office working on his enemies list,” Harris said Monday. “On Day 1, if I’m elected president of the United States, which I fully intend to be, I will be working on behalf of the American people on my to-do list.”
Preparations were underway on Monday ahead of the speech, including the installation of tall black fencing to create a secure perimeter around the Ellipse.
An amended permit for the event showed as many as 40,000 people are expected to attend, with spillover onto the National Mall – her first major campaign speech outdoors in Washington. Most of Harris’ large rallies this year have been in arenas or stadiums in battleground states.
The vice president worked on her remarks as she traveled to Michigan on Monday for three campaign stops, aides said, working through final drafts for one of the biggest speeches since the Democratic convention. She also is expected to address the economy, lowering the cost of prescription drugs, and her broader middle-class agenda, even though the sharpest contrasts are likely to come on Trump’s character.
In some ways, it harks back to Harris’ remarks at campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, the day after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race, making Tuesday’s speech something of a bookend in her extraordinarily truncated campaign.
“All of this is to say building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency,” Harris said at the time. “Because we here know, when our middle class is strong, America is strong.”
Aides have likened Tuesday’s speech to the closing arguments Harris delivered as a prosecutor early in her career. After laying out evidence for a jury — in this case, voters — she is hoping to tie the various threads together into a single case for herself.
She hasn’t been lacking in advice. As they have been since Biden was the party’s standard-bearer, Democrats are somewhat divided on how much to emphasize Trump’s character and perceived danger to democracy versus more narrowly focusing on pocketbook issues.
Last week, the leading super PAC supporting Harris’ candidacy raised concerns that the Harris campaign was too closely centering its closing message on calling Trump a fascist.
“This topic is not as persuasive as contrast messages featuring Harris’ economic plans, and her promise to protect reproductive rights,” the group warned in an email to Democrats about messaging in the final stretch of the campaign.
Still, Harris’ advisers believe there are moderates who will be swayed by the links between Trump and fascism, particularly when raised by his former top aide, John Kelly.
More broadly, the Harris team views the closing days of the campaign as a moment to harness widespread exhaustion and frustration at Trump’s chaotic brand of politics, not only by shining a spotlight on the tumult but also by offering a clear alternative.
Since the moment Harris ascended to the top of the ticket in July, her campaign has worked to capitalize on the trappings of office – and the power of strong imagery – to help voters see her as presidential and take the historic step of electing the first woman as commander in chief.
The sweeping backdrop of the White House and the National Mall was designed for maximum effect a week before the final day of voting. It’s something of an analogue to an August rally in Detroit, where Harris spoke to thousands before the majestic backdrop of Air Force Two.
The prime-time speech on the Ellipse comes amid rising anxiety from some over how much time Harris is devoting to disqualify Trump compared with what she would do if elected. The Tuesday night address, advisers tell CNN, is intended to be a balance of both messages.
“We don’t have the luxury of just talking about what she would do as president,” a top Democratic adviser said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss strategic decisions. “We can’t pretend this is an ordinary election.”",29/10/2024
CNN,"Small number of North Korean troops are already inside Ukraine, officials say | CNN Politics","A small number of North Korean troops are already inside Ukraine, according to two western intelligence officials, and officials expect that number to grow as the North Koreans complete training in eastern Russia and move toward the front lines of the war.
The North Korean troops’ presence inside Ukraine goes a step beyond what NATO and the Pentagon confirmed on Monday, which is that roughly 10,000 North Korean troops are training in eastern Russia with some en route to Russia’s Kursk region. Ukrainian troops have held territory inside Kursk since August.
“It seems that a good many of them are already in action,” one of the officials said on Tuesday, referring to the North Koreans. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said last week that Ukrainian intelligence assessed that the troops would start to enter combat zones on Sunday.
A US official said the US can not yet corroborate reports that North Koreans troops are already inside Ukraine. The US has been playing catchup, however, when it comes to North Korea’s deployments — US officials did not confirm publicly that the troops were in Russia until weeks after South Korea first alleged it.
US and South Korean diplomatic and military officials are meeting in Washington, DC this week to discuss the deployment and North Korea’s “expanding relationship with Russia” more broadly, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Monday.
Separately, top Ukrainian official Andriy Yermak is in the US capital Tuesday for meetings with National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Yermak said he and Sullivan discussed the “North Korean soldiers whom Russia is preparing for war.”
South Korean officials also traveled to NATO headquarters on Monday and briefed allies on the North Korean deployments. NATO allies have been hoping that the intelligence spurs South Korea to begin providing military aid to the Ukrainians, which would be at odds with the South Koreans’ longstanding policy of not arming countries at war. But South Korea’s president has signaled an openness to changing that policy.
“While we have maintained our principle of not directly supplying lethal weapons, we can also review our stance more flexibly, depending on the level of North Korean military activities,” South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said last week.
It is still unclear how helpful the North Koreans will be to the Russians on the battlefield. Many of the troops deployed are special forces, the sources said, and intelligence assessments suggest that the North Korean government believes their troops have more combat power than regular Russian troops because they are better trained and specialized, officials said.
But North Korea’s military has not fought in an actual war for over 70 years, and intelligence officials believe the North Korean government sent them in large part so they could gain combat experience.
Officials also expect that at least some of the troops will desert their units once they get to the battlefield, and that the language barrier with the Russians will be a significant impediment to conducting seamless operations. The Russians have been teaching North Korean soldiers basic Russian commands in training, like “fire” and “in position,” South Korean lawmakers told reporters on Tuesday.
Some Russian troops are already raising concerns about how the North Korean soldiers will be commanded and provided with ammunition and military kit and have wondered “what the f**k to do with them,” according to audio intercepted by Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence on October 23 from encrypted Russian transmission channels.
The intercepts also reveal plans to have one interpreter and three senior officers for every 30 North Korean men, CNN has reported.
‘The number may rise’
Many of the public assessments that have emerged on North Korea’s troop movements have come to light via South Korean lawmakers speaking to the media after briefings with the country’s intelligence services.
On Wednesday, two lawmakers – Lee Seong-kweun and Park Sun-won – spoke to reporters after a closed door briefing from the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). Their assessment was that North Korea had sent members of its elite XI Army Corps to Russia, which specialize in urban terrain and infiltration. But the DIA questioned such a unit’s effectiveness in the more open terrain of the Kursk region.
The DIA added that there was not exact information on whether North Korean troops have been sent to fighting positions, but there “is a possibility that an advance team may have been sent to the frontline,” the lawmakers said.
South Korean intelligence has put the number of North Korean troops inside Russia right now at about 13,000, higher than the US and the UK. The number could go up further — the US has already revised its assessment upward from last week, when the White House assessed that only about 3,000 North Korean troops were in Russia.
“The number may rise,” a third western official said. “Allies and partners across the globe are watching and consulting and will proactively share intelligence on the matter as it affects the security of the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions and beyond.”
In addition to military personnel, North Korea has provided Moscow with 11,000 containers of ammunition consisting of around 2 million artillery rounds since last year, a senior NATO official told CNN earlier this month.
The US has also been urging China, which maintains a relationship with Pyongyang, to intervene and pressure the North Koreans to pull back, officials said.
Sullivan “directed the US government to engage the PRC and to organize an effort to get other countries to reach out to the PRC as well over our concerns about DPRK sending troops into Russia and the implications of that,” a US official told CNN, referring to China.
“We have communicated with the PRC about this matter to make clear that we are concerned about it, and that they ought to be concerned about this destabilizing action by two of its neighbors, Russia and North Korea,” Miller said.
Western officials are not optimistic, however, that China will intervene with North Korea’s plans, the sources said. China has continued to be a “critical enabler” of Russia’s war effort, according to the NATO official, and is still fueling Russia’s defense industry with substantial amounts of dual-use goods like microelectronics and machine tools that can be used to build weapons.

CNN,Michelle Obama makes passionate plea for women’s health while campaigning for Harris | CNN Politics,"Michelle Obama issued a scathing indictment of Donald Trump on Saturday at a rally in Michigan for Kamala Harris, calling the former president an existential threat to women’s rights and telling men that a vote for Trump “is a vote against us.”
The former first lady, in a reprise of her passionate and often cutting remarks this summer at the Democratic National Convention, expressed hope and fear in equal turn, touting Harris’ bravery and compassion while openly agonizing over the prospect of Trump’s return to the White House. By the time she introduced and embraced Harris, Obama’s voice was nearly trembling — gripped by worry and frustrated by a race that, she insisted, should not be as close as the polls suggest.
“By every measure, she has demonstrated that she’s ready,” Obama said of Harris. “The real question is, as a country, are we ready for this moment?”
Addressing a raucous, adoring crowd in Kalamazoo, Obama spoke frankly and often in bleak terms about the implications for women — and “the men who love us” — if the federal government, led by the president, is not inclined to cushion the blow of state abortion bans.
“Please, please do not hand our fates over to the likes of Trump, who knows nothing about us, who has shown deep contempt for us,” Obama said. “Because a vote for him is a vote against us, against our health, against our worth.”
Harris’ Kalamazoo rally — or “Kamala-zoo,” as the former first lady joked — followed another reproductive rights-themed event on Friday night in Houston, where music superstar Beyoncé endorsed the vice president and issued a similar message of faith and fear.
“I’m not here as a celebrity. I’m not here as a politician,” the singer said. “I’m here as a mother.”
Harris in Houston spoke directly to male voters, saying, “Men across America do not want to see their daughters and wives and sisters and mothers put at risk because their rights have been taken.”
Obama in Michigan made a similar overture, but often in more vivid, painfully detailed terms.
“If your wife is shivering and bleeding on the operating room table during a routine, the delivery gone bad, her pressure dropping as she loses more and more blood, or some unforeseen infection spreads and her doctors aren’t sure if they can act — you’ll be the one praying that it’s not too late,” Obama said. “You’ll be the one pleading for somebody, anybody to do something.”
To the women watching, Obama asked that they either try to convince undecided friends and family members to vote for Harris or that they strike out on their own.
“If you are a woman who lives in a household of men that don’t listen to you or value your opinion, just remember that your vote is a private matter,” Obama said. “You get to use your judgment and cast your vote for yourself and the women in your life. Remember, women standing up for what is best for us can make the difference in this election.”
That appeal to moderate Republicans and conservatives disillusioned by the Trump brand of Republican politics has been another theme of Harris’ campaign in the closing weeks of the campaign.
“Kamala, she is putting herself out there fearlessly, facing down even her harshest critics. She’s seeking out Republicans to find common ground,” Obama said. “Unlike her opponent, she’s not ducking interviews or cowering in safe spaces only with fawning audience. She’s showing us what a sane, stable leader looks like.”
After a spelling out a litany of criticism against Trump, his “horrible behavior” and what she described as his bumbling pandemic response, Obama — again — offered a glimpse of her own anxiety.
“With all that being said, I got to ask myself, ‘Well, why on Earth is this race even close?’” Obama said. “I lay awake at night wondering what in the world is going on.”
Harris, who has been on a dayslong swing-state blitz, with the exception of her star-studded event in Texas, focused her remarks on now-familiar themes and lines of attacks, again contrasting Trump’s “enemies list” with her “to-do list.”
“Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails,” Harris said. “He who will claim unchecked and extreme power if he is reelected, he who has vowed he will be a dictator on Day 1, he who has said he wished he had generals like Hitler, who calls Americans who disagree with him ‘the enemy from within.’”
Standing behind a podium with a presidential seal, Harris pointed to Trump’s previous call to terminate the Constitution and restore him to power, saying the comments alone should disqualify him.
“Never again, never again,” she said.
Harris received raucous applause as she delivered the passion-filled line, the loudest response to the vice president of the evening.
Speaking in a typically blue-leaning county that President Joe Biden won by about 20 points in 2020, Harris also made a direct appeal to younger voters — including those in Kalamazoo, which is home to multiple colleges.
“Generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom, and now the baton is in our hands,” she said, asking, “Can I see Gen Z?” — which prompted a cheer from some younger attendees.
“I love you guys,” Harris said, adding, “Of the many things that I just think are so great about you, you are rightly impatient for change.
“I love that.”",26/10/2024
CNN,Analysis: Today’s swing states are tomorrow’s safe states | CNN Politics,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.
For the vast majority of Americans who live outside the seven battleground states, there is a confounding helplessness in 2024.
On the one hand, polling suggests a historically tight race heading into Election Day.
On the other hand, the Electoral College map suggests that the results in all but those seven states are a foregone conclusion, assuming people show up and vote the way polling suggests they will.
Every vote counts, obviously, but some seem to matter more than others. At least in some years.
Swing today, safe tomorrow
If there is some consolation for the millions of Republicans in California and Democrats in Texas – and so on – it is that today’s swing state is tomorrow’s safe state.
Missouri, for example, is a flyover state for presidential candidates today, reliably red and far off the radar of campaigns popping back and forth between actual battlegrounds.
But for about 100 years, Missouri was the ultimate bellwether in presidential elections, voting for the winner in 25 of 26 elections between 1904 and 2004 – within the lifetime of most of today’s voters.
Florida and Ohio, both of which are now red states for presidential purposes, were hotly contested battlegrounds until this election cycle. Virginia and Colorado, which were battlegrounds in roughly the same era, are now essentially blue in presidential years.
In the closest possible election that people alive today can remember, 2000, it’s Florida’s “hanging chads” and the US Supreme Court decision that ended a recount there that stick in people’s minds. But New Hampshire and New Mexico, now both blue states, were also decided by the smallest of margins.
Battlegrounds for about a generation
The point is that the people and politics of this country are constantly churning and moving. The makeup of the battlegrounds seems immutable in a single election, but battlegrounds have a shelf life, and it might only last about a generation.
I talked to David Schultz, a political science professor at Hamline University and author of the book, “Presidential Swing States,” which will be due for its fourth edition after the 2024 presidential election.
Swing, battleground and competitive are different things
Schultz told me that while we use terms like “swing state” and “battleground state” interchangeably, they’re actually different things.
A swing state is one that has actually flipped and recently supported presidents from different parties. Think of the “blue wall” states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. They swing from Democratic President Barack Obama in 2012 to Republican President Donald Trump in 2016 and then back to Democratic President Joe Biden in 2020.
Now they’re battleground states, or places where candidates show up and campaign.
They also fall into a third category of competitive states, where results are within 5 percentage points.
“In many cases, a swing state is really all three. It’s a battleground state. It’s been flipped. It’s competitive. But in some cases, there are states that have not flipped yet,” he argued.
More technically, according to Schultz, these states usually share some characteristics, including that they are relatively evenly split between Republicans and Democrats and that their “average or median voter is to the right of where the Democrats are nationally and to the left of where the Republican Party is nationally.”
Today’s battlegrounds
That’s about where the Rust Belt states collectively known as the blue wall are at the moment.
They had voted in a bloc for Democrats in every election from 1992 until Trump won them in 2016. They moved back toward Democrats in 2020 and represent Democrats’ best chance to retain the White House, according to many political strategists, even though the long-term demographic trends might not be so favorable for Democrats there. The parties are increasingly divided by education and race.
In Schultz’s view, if there’s one single bellwether state this year, it’s Pennsylvania.
Republicans are in a similar situation with Sun Belt states like Georgia and North Carolina, which have seen population growth among young people and people of color.
The country is constantly changing
Schultz argued that with deaths spurred by the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as internal migration and new voters being eligible to vote, some states have seen up to a 20% change in the makeup of their populations since just the last election.
That means the country’s population has changed quite a bit since some states last swung.
In the 1988 election, the last time the blue wall did not vote together, Pennsylvania and Michigan voted with the loser, Democrat Michael Dukakis. That election represented the end of an era in many ways. That was the last election in which California, the most populous state, voted for a Republican president, George H.W. Bush.
Texas, the second most populous state, on the other hand, hasn’t voted for a Democrat since Jimmy Carter won the White House in 1976, although results there were quite close in 1992 and 1996 when Clinton won the White House.
Schultz said the country has seemed to sort itself into red and blue and that something is shrinking the number of competitive states.
“If a state gets to be a reputation of being Republican or Democrat, we start to see patterns of immigration, of people sorting themselves out of where they want to live,” he told me.
Will Texas ever turn?
Democrats, for years, have been hoping that demographic shifts would again put Texas in play, something that could completely reshuffle the electoral map. Schultz doesn’t see that kind of shift in Texas for another four or eight years.
But he does think there are some states that could become new swing states in the years to come. He mentioned South Carolina and Montana, states that could shift as more young people move into them, changing their makeup.
If you look at all the competitive states in all the elections going back to 1976, most of the states have swung one way or the other or been competitive in the past 50 years.
Some states change all of a sudden
Sometimes, the swing bypasses the competitive category altogether.
West Virginia today is one of the most reliably Republican states – when it swung from Democrats to Republicans in the 2000 election, it swung hard. The result placed it outside the “competitive” category.
In other years, nearly the entire country swings, such as in 1984 – when the only state won by the Democratic candidate, Walter Mondale, was Minnesota, his home, which he took along with Washington, DC.",29/10/2024
CNN,"Michigan young voters enthused for Harris, but their level of support is still a big question | CNN Politics","The campus art museum doubles as a voting hub. There are voter registration tables seemingly everywhere. Even the sleeves at the campus coffee shop have a message: “Wolverines: Let’s Vote Early.”
So Jade Gray bristles a bit at this hypothetical: What if Kamala Harris comes up just short in battleground Michigan?
“If she comes up short in Michigan, I don’t think it’s because of young voters,” said Gray, a former co-president of the University of Michigan College Democrats who graduated in May. “I think it’s probably because we waited too long to make a switch of the candidate.”
Voters aged 18-29 are a vital piece of the Democratic coalition. They were crucial to Joe Biden’s 2020 Michigan win and in the dramatic state-level gains the party made in 2022. But young voters’ level of support is a big question for 2024 because of anger and disappointment with how the Biden-Harris administration has handled the Israel-Hamas conflict.
“I don’t think there is any blame to put on young people or people of color or Muslim voters in this election cycle, and I quite frankly don’t really want to hear about that,” Gray said in an interview. “I think that you got to put that on campaigns, and you have to put that on the elected officials that are running for office. I sure hope she doesn’t come up short in Michigan, because I don’t really want to be talking to people about how young people should have done more when I feel like we’re doing a lot.”
The conversation with Gray and Anushka Jalisatgi, also co-president of the College Democrats last school year, was our third in 11 months. Both are part of a CNN project, called All Over the Map, designed to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in battleground states and are part of crucial voting blocs.
In the two prior conversations, both said Biden’s age was a concern for many young voters who felt little connection to the octogenarian president. Now, with Harris as the Democratic nominee, the energy and enthusiasm difference is obvious.
Gray now works as a digital organizer for a progressive group.
“I have noticed a significant shift in activity, across the board,” Gray said.
Jalisatgi is back on campus as a first-year law student, and just switched her voter registration to Michigan.
“A lot of my out-of-state friends are switching their registration to Michigan because it is a battleground state,” Jalisatgi said.
And while Gray and Jalisatgi have moved on, the College Democrats are in high gear for election crunch time. A Harris campaign official stopped by a meeting during our latest visit and a crowded room of students spent time phone banking after getting a pep talk from the state’s Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer.
“The work that you are doing is so important and I am energized by what I see happening with all these Dem clubs on campuses. You are kicking a**. So, we just got to keep rolling through,” Whitmer said over a video link.
Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell stopped by in person, and warned against overconfidence.
“I’m going to look you all in the eye and tell you, neither candidate is winning in Michigan right now.”
No encampment on campus, but tensions still high over Israel-Hamas conflict
The almost everywhere-you-look focus on registration and early voting at the Ann Arbor campus is remarkable.
One registration table we stopped by on our latest visit was in a familiar spot: on the same campus path where students last semester built an encampment to air their grievances at Israel, at the Biden administration and at school officials they were pushing to divest from companies that do business with Israel.
The school will not allow a new encampment, so it is harder to gauge how much the raw anger of last semester has carried over to the new school year – and into voting decisions.
“A lot of that energy, because it can’t happen in a physical space – it’s still occupying a lot of online space,” Gray said.
Jalisatgi sees it directed less at Harris and more at university officials.
“People still very much care that this is ongoing and that the university is complicit in contributing to it,” Jalisatgi said. “I’m seeing universities putting out a lot of new free speech guidelines, new regulations for how they want to curb free speech or how they want to regulate it.”
The Ann Arbor College Republicans would not let CNN into a meeting they held during our recent visit.
Member Max Scheske, a junior, said attendance and energy are up some as the election draws close. But he also said the group was pretty evenly divided when it comes to enthusiasm for Donald Trump.
“We certainly do have our, you know, ‘Trump is basically Jesus’ wing of the club,” Scheske said. “But we do have a very sizeable, you know, very critical of Trump.”
Scheske describes himself as libertarian and Trump as a populist. “So, he is kind of hit or miss with me,” Scheske said.
There are Harris yard signs and posters and placards all around Ann Arbor. Signs of Trump support are much harder to find. On campus, Scheske said Trump’s unequivocal support for Israel makes it harder to win over Democrats critical of the Biden-Harris administration’s defense of the Jewish state.
“If it was up to me, he would not have been the Republican nominee,” Scheske said.
‘We feel a sense of betrayal’
The biggest risk for Harris is that young voters stay home, skip the presidential line on the ballot, or vote third party.
In May, Wayne State student Summer Matkin was leaning third party. Biden was the Democratic nominee then, and she had concerns both about his age and the Israel-Hamas conflict.
Now, she calls Harris “the safest option” even though she is frustrated the bloodshed in the Middle East continues.
There were signs of trouble for Harris, though, when we stopped by a meeting of the Wayne State Syrian Students Association.
The roughly 20 students in the room did not want to be quoted by name or have their faces captured on camera. But when asked if they would have a hard time voting for Harris, nearly every hand in the room went up.
Likewise, Wahbeh Nuseibeh, a 26-year-old Wayne State student, said he would not vote for Harris in 2024 after voting for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020.
“We feel a sense of betrayal,” said Nuseibeh, who is Palestinian.
“I’m not voting for Kamala Harris. I cannot in good conscience,” he said. In his view, his tax dollars pay for bombs shipped to Israel “to kill my friends and family overseas.”
Nuseibeh will likely choose a third-party option.
“Donald Trump is a threat to our democracy and a threat to our society,” he said in an interview at a Yemeni coffee shop in majority Arab American Dearborn just outside Detroit.
Maya Siegmann will cast her vote for Harris, though she found the vice president’s debate answers far too vague.
“She didn’t directly answer most of the questions and seemed to go around them or could not give a real answer,” Siegmann said. “And when the topic of the Israel-Hamas war came up, there wasn’t really a solid response as to how she would solve it.”
Siegmann is active in the Hillel campus Jewish organization at Wayne State and just got back from a summer in Israel. There, she said, she was asked a lot about public opinion in the United States.
“The response was basically that the propaganda war, the social media war, the news war that Hamas and Israel are fighting, Hamas is winning right now,” Siegmann said.
Last year was tense on campus and as both the October 7 anniversary of Hamas’ attack on Israel and then the US election draw near, Siegmann said she is mindful that emotions could get high again. She is a proud Jew and fervent supporter of Israel, but she is also critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his conduct of the war.
But she says such nuance can get quickly lost when passions get high.

CNN,Huge fundraising powers Democrats’ hopes to flip the House | CNN Politics,"Rep. Cindy Axne, the last Democrat standing in Iowa, went to her party’s leadership about a month before the 2022 midterms to ask for a few hundred thousand more dollars in her race, or risk losing her seat.
The money didn’t come, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions, and Axne lost the Des Moines-based seat by around 2,000 votes — one of nearly two dozen close House races that cost Democrats their majority that year.
Now, that cash crunch is a distant memory and Democrats are in striking distance of not one, but two red-tinted seats in Iowa. Vice President Kamala Harris, who raised a stunning $1 billion in three months, has fueled a fundraising revolution this cycle that is changing the game for down-ballot Democrats and deeply troubling GOP leaders. House Democrats are so flush with cash that they are seriously competing on red-tinted turf in places like Iowa and Wisconsin that were trending away from the party just a few years ago.
The Democrats’ inroads in the Midwest are on top of the dozen-plus GOP-held seats in New York and California that were already the epicenter of the battle of House control. Democrats’ huge summertime war chests have expanded that battlefield as party leaders seek every possible path to victory. Republicans have had to buckle down on defense, keeping them from truly competing in once-feasible places like southwestern Connecticut, the Nevada suburbs and southeastern Pennsylvania.
“When excitement and energy happens, then the money follows,” said Christina Bohannan, the Democrat running in the neighboring Iowa district who has shattered fundraising records in her increasingly competitive rematch against GOP Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks. Bohannan not only outraised Miller-Meeks in the last quarter, but outspent the GOP incumbent by almost a 3-to-1 margin. And Democrats are planning to spend even more there in the final weeks.
The GOP is taking the threat seriously: House Speaker Mike Johnson will head to the district this week, followed by Majority Leader Steve Scalise, Majority Whip Tom Emmer and Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders later this month, according to a person familiar with the planning.
“People are just fired up,” Bohannan, the Democrat, told CNN. “We had a great message in 2022 but we didn’t have quite as much resources there to get that message out.”
But money alone won’t determine which party controls Congress. While Democrats need to net just four seats to flip the House, voters’ focus on issues like the border and the economy means that the political climate still favors the GOP. And there’s the Trump factor: Former President Donald Trump continues to do better among Hispanic voters and working class voters, fueling GOP hopes of flipping seats near the US-Mexico border and in rural Alaska and Maine.
“There is no candidate in modern history, Democrat or Republican, who turns out voters more effectively than President Trump,” Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, the House Republican Conference chairwoman, told CNN.
What is certain is that whichever party wins the House battle is almost guaranteed to face another razor-thin margin — making it all but impossible to govern for another two years.
Republicans’ cash crunch
In the final three week stretch, Republicans say it’s the Democrats’ cash advantage that’s keeping them up at night.
Out of the 32 most competitive House seats, all but two Republicans were outraised by Democrats in the most recent quarter, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission made public Tuesday. (The two GOP exceptions were Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia and Rep. Michelle Steel of California.)
All but six of the Democrats broke the $2 million mark, and some pulled in far more.
In a competitive open seat in central Virginia, the GOP candidate Derrick Anderson brought in $1.1 million — putting him in the upper echelon of House Republican fundraisers this year. But the Democrat in the race, Eugene Vindman, raised an astounding $6.5 million. That allowed him to outspend his GOP opponent by almost 11 to 1.
Then there is Democrat Will Rollins, with a $3.6 million haul against long-time Republican Rep. Ken Calvert in southern California, and Democrat Amish Shah, who’s challenging Arizona GOP Rep. David Schweikert, who brought in $3.45 million. Both GOP incumbents are now in more danger than Republicans believe they should be.
Elon Musk’s super PAC recently spent big for Calvert, while Trump himself stumped for Calvert in the desert town of Coachella, California, over the weekend.
Rollins described his own fundraising as “higher than we ever thought imaginable.” And he described Trump’s visit as a last chance move to save Calvert. But, he predicted: “I don’t think they’re going to end up having the resources to do it. That’s why I ultimately think we’re going to win.”
Across the country, senior Democratic Rep. Ann Kuster of New Hampshire recently drove through Pennsylvania stumping for Democratic candidate Janelle Stelson, whose fundraising haul tripled that of her GOP opponent Rep. Scott Perry, the former House Freedom Caucus chairman.
“It’s insane. It’s like Senate numbers,” said Kuster, who is retiring this year after 12 years in a New Hampshire swing seat. “I never had a million dollar quarter. And now all of the candidates are having million-dollar quarters.”
Top Republicans have been forced to respond: The GOP leadership-aligned super PAC, Congressional Leadership Fund, this week announced a $2.6 million buy to help defend Perry in a seat that Trump won by nearly 5 points.
In another “reach” seat, Democrats raised so much against Steel that Republicans moved money out of a highly competitive open seat in Orange County to help protect the GOP congresswoman. And the Republican group is even beginning to spend in an open Colorado seat that Trump won by 8 points.
A ‘tsunami’ of Democratic dollars
One incumbent, Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, said he could lose his race because of the “tsunami” of money that Harris and her allies have dumped into his seat because of its unique status as a stand-alone electoral vote.
“That’s my number one issue right now, how we’re being outspent at the top of the ticket,” Bacon said, noting that Harris is spending $21 million on messaging in his district, compared to about $100,000 from Trump.
“I wish he’d put some stuff on the airwaves, show people why they need to vote for him. It helps everybody down-ballot,” Bacon said, adding: “I think the other side holds every ace right now, but we’re in the fight.”
Two years ago, Bacon’s challenger, state Sen. Tony Vargas. was outspent 3 to 1 by GOP super PAC groups. This time, Democrats have the money to keep up.
“Because we have these resources, now we have been able to battle back,” Vargas told CNN.
While Trump has been focused on his own race, Johnson and his leadership team — including campaign chief, Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina — have been making urgent pleas to fellow Republicans for last-minute cash.
But it’s too late to match one key Democratic advantage: The party went up on TV early in GOP-held seats, forcing Republican outside groups to respond in those places and narrow their own offensive opportunities. As a result, GOP groups decided not to compete in once-competitive turf, such as the seats of Democratic Reps. Angie Craig in Minnesota, Nikki Budzinski in Illinois, and Hillary Scholten in Michigan.
“(The money) is definitely sounding the alarm bells,” one senior House GOP aide told CNN. “It’s been very hard to keep up with. If we lose seats, I think that will be a defining part of the post mortem.”
With fewer of his own members on defense, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and his party jumped into some long-shot races that would have been unthinkable earlier this summer. House Majority PAC is now competing in tougher races like those of Perry in Pennsylvania, Ryan Zinke in Montana and Monica De La Cruz in Texas.
Zinke himself put out an urgent fundraising call this month, warning supporters in a text: “If I don’t do a total 180 on the fundraising front, not only will I lose my House seat, Republicans may never hold the majority in Congress again.”
Zinke raised $2 million but was still narrowly outraised by his Democratic challenger, Monica Tranel. Trump won the seat by 7 points last cycle.
Trump’s strength keeps GOP’s hopes alive
Democrats need to flip several seats in two key states to have a shot at retaking the House: New York and California. These roughly dozen seats are, on paper, friendly to Democrats. Yet troubling signs have emerged.
Stefanik, who is determined to protect the GOP’s hold in New York, said Trump is so far beating his poll numbers from the last two elections while Harris is underperforming those of Biden and Hillary Clinton.
“There’s a reason President Trump is coming to Madison Square Garden,” Stefanik said. “President Trump is a believer in Republicans winning New York,”
Republicans privately believe they are likely to lose at least two incumbents in the blue states: Rep. Brandon Williams in Syracuse and John Duarte in California’s Central Valley (along with GOP Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer in Oregon, where Trump’s support hasn’t improved.) Many are also worried about Rep. Mike Garcia of southern California and Rep. Marc Molinaro in upstate New York.
And Republicans are feeling hopeful about heavily Hispanic seats in Colorado, New Mexico and Texas, where Trump is helping them go on offense. Democrats fear Rep. Yadira Caraveo of Colorado is particularly vulnerable.
Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar, who represents a slice of the US-Mexico border in south Texas, said it’s a warning for his party across the board — including Harris.
“The Democrat Party, they cannot take Hispanic voters for granted,” Cuellar told CNN. As Democrats have been slow to respond on border issues, he warned Republicans are “chipping away” at their base of Hispanic voters.
He added, “In the minds of a lot of voters, they see the Democrats not being strong on border security and Republicans being strong on border security. I don’t want to say I told you so, but I used to say, ‘Guys, this is important.’”

CNN,Arizona fake electors led vocal campaign to overturn the 2020 election – they’re now part of a ‘robust’ state investigation | CNN Politics,"They called it “The Signing.” Eleven fake electors for President Donald Trump convened at the state Republican Party headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona, on December 14, 2020. They broadcast themselves preparing to sign the documents, allegedly provided by a Trump campaign attorney, claiming that they were the legitimate representatives of the state’s electoral votes.
By that time, Trump’s loss in the state – by less than 11,000 votes – had already been certified by the state’s Republican governor affirming that Joe Biden won Arizona in the 2020 presidential election.
But in the weeks that followed, five of Arizona’s 11 “Republican electors,” as they called themselves, pushed an unusually vocal campaign, compared to other fake electors from states across the country, for Vice President Mike Pence to reject the legitimate Democratic slate of electors.
Instead, they called on Pence to accept them or no electors at all, according to a CNN KFile review of their interviews, actions and comments on social media.
Much attention has been drawn to the fake elector schemes in Georgia and Michigan where local and state authorities charged some participants for election crimes this past summer. But in no other state were there fake electors more active in publicly promoting the scheme than in Arizona.
Now those fake electors find themselves under new legal scrutiny as the Arizona attorney general announced a broad investigation into their actions and their public campaign that could open the electors up to increased legal liability, according to experts who spoke with CNN.
“They were more brazen,” Anthony Michael Kreis, an expert on constitutional law at Georgia State University told CNN. “There is no difficulty trying to piece together their unlawful, corrupt intent because they publicly documented their stream of consciousness bread trail for prosecutors to follow.”
Attorney General Kris Mayes, in an interview with CNN, said she has been in contact with investigators in Michigan and Georgia and the Department of Justice.
“It’s robust. It’s a serious matter,” Mayes, a Democrat, said of her ongoing investigation. “We’re going to make sure that we do it on our timetable, applying the resources that it requires to make sure that justice is done, for not only Arizonans, but for the entire country.”
All 11 electors took part in multiple failed legal challenges, first asking a judge to invalidate the state’s results in a conspiracy theory-laden court case and then taking part in a last-ditch, desperate plea seeking to force Pence to help throw the election to Trump. The cases were dismissed.
Of the 11 fake electors in Arizona, five were the most publicly vocal members advocating the scheme in the state: Kelli Ward, the chairperson of the state party and her spouse, Michael Ward; state Rep. Anthony Kern, then a sitting lawmaker; Jake Hoffman, a newly elected member of the Arizona House; and Tyler Bowyer, a top state official with the Republican National Committee.
Each of these five publicly pushed for the legitimate electors to be discarded by Pence on January 6, 2021. One of the fake electors, Kern, took part in “Stop the Steal” rallies and was photographed in a restricted area on the Capitol steps during the riot at the Capitol.
“The Arizona false electors left a trail here that will surely interest prosecutors,” Ryan Goodman, a law professor at New York University who previously served as the special counsel to the general counsel at the Department of Defense, told CNN.
Electors, a part of the Electoral College system, represent the popular vote in each state. When a candidate wins a state, the party’s designated slate of electors gets to participate in the Electoral College process. The electors meet in a ceremonial process and sign certificates, officially casting their vote for president.
CNN reached out to all of the electors, but only received comment from two of them.
Five vocal fake electors
The most publicly vocal of the fake electors, Kelli Ward called the group the “true electors,” and provided play-by-play updates on the Arizona Republican Party’s YouTube. Falsely saying the state’s electoral votes were “contested,” even though legal challenges to the count had been dismissed, she urged supporters to call on Arizona’s state legislature to decertify the state’s results.
“We believe our votes are the ones that will count on January 6th,” she said in one interview on conservative talk radio, two days after signing the fake documents.
Ward’s comments were echoed in tweets by her husband, Michael, also an elector and a gadfly in Arizona politics known for spreading conspiracy theories. In a post sharing a White House memo that urged Pence to reject the results from states that submitted fake electors, Michael Ward hinted at retribution for Republicans who failed to act.
“My Holiday prayer is that every backstabbing ‘Republican’ gets paid back for their failure to act come Jan 20th!” he wrote in a tweet on December 22.
Another prominent elector was the RNC Committeeman Bowyer, who on his Twitter account pushed false election claims and conspiracies.
“It will be up to the President of the Senate and congress to decide,” Bowyer tweeted after signing the fake electors documents.
In repeated comments Bowyer declared the decision would come down to Pence.
“It’s pretty simple: The President of the United States Senate (VP) has the awesome power of acknowledging a specific envelope of electoral votes when there are two competing slates— or none at all,” wrote Bowyer in a December 28 tweet.
“We don’t live in a Democracy. The presidential election isn’t democratic,” he added when receiving pushback.
A spokesperson for Bowyer said that he was simply responding to a question from a user on what next steps looked like and maintained that there was precedent for a competing slate of electors.
Bowyer urged action in the lead up to the joint session of Congress on January 6.
“Be a modern Son of Liberty today,” he said late in the morning of January 6 – a post he deleted following the riot at the Capitol.
The spokesperson for Bowyer said he had not directly been contacted by Mayes’s office or the DOJ.
Newly elected state representative Hoffman sent a two-page letter to Pence on January 5, 2021, asking the vice president to order that Arizona’s electors not be decided by the popular vote of the citizens, but instead by the members of the state legislature.
“It is in this late hour, with urgency, that I respectfully ask that you delay the certification of election results for Arizona during the joint session of Congress on January 6, 2021, and seek clarification from the Arizona state legislature as to which slate of electors are proper and accurate,” wrote Hoffman.
In interviews, Hoffman repeatedly argued no electors be sent at all because “we don’t have certainty in the outcome of our election,” and to contest Democrat electors if they were sent.
Then-state Rep. Kern, who lost his seat in the 2020 election, spent his final weeks in office sharing “stop the steal” content and participating in their rallies. He said he was “honored” to be a Trump elector.
“On January 6th, vice President Mike Pence gets a choice on which electors he’s going to choose,” Kern told the Epoch Times in an interview in December.
“There is no president elect until January 6th,” he added.
Kern hadn’t changed his tune in an interview with CNN.
“Why, why would you think alternate electors are a lie?,” Kern said.
Kern repeatedly promoted the January 6, 2021, rally preceding the Capitol riot. Kern was in DC that day and shared a photo from the Capitol grounds as rioters gathered on the steps of the Capitol.
“In DC supporting @realDonaldTrump and @CNN @FoxNews @MSNBC are spewing lies again. #truth,” he wrote in a tweet.
Later Kern was seen in a restricted area of the Capitol steps during the riot. There is no indication he was violent, and he has not been charged with any crime.

CNN,Misleading text messages from ‘voter mobilization’ group create confusion in key swing states | CNN Politics,"Thousands of voters in Pennsylvania received a confusing text message this weekend claiming they already voted in the 2024 presidential election.
“Records show you voted,” the message said, directing people to an official website with information about polling places and early on-demand voting in the state.
The organization behind the texts, AllVote, said the messages contained errors and should have told voters they had cast their ballots in 2022 and directed them to a link with information about voting in 2024. However, “in 2022” was left out, causing confusion. A spokesperson said the misleading text was followed by an apology message, though those who had replied “STOP” or marked the first message as spam may not have received it.
It’s the latest case of misleading or incorrect election-related information being disseminated by the group, which has been flagged by officials from across the country – including in the key swing states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, North Carolina and Arizona – as a scam.
“Voters should be more cautious as we get closer to the November 5th Election, as other bad actors may attempt to send similar phishing emails/texts,” the Pennsylvania Department of State warned this summer after voters in Northampton County received confusing messages from AllVote claiming there was an issue with their voter registration status.
AllVote – which, according to its website, works to “mobilize progressive voters,” by providing information on how to vote – told CNN it doesn’t engage in phishing because it doesn’t collect data or send out links that solicit personal information.
AllVote spokesperson Charlotte Clymer told CNN the organization estimates “several thousand registered voters were affected by our error” – referring to the text messages received by Pennsylvania voters over the weekend.
The texts, Clymer said, were an “unfortunate copy-editing error by staff working long hours,” and the organization has made its “approval process substantially more rigorous to ensure this doesn’t happen again.”
The controversy in the Keystone State comes just a few days after the Wisconsin Election Commission criticized AllVote over another misleading text message campaign. The group previously sent thousands of Wisconsin voters text messages that had a link to the wrong election website, leading to complaints to the commission.
The Wisconsin Election Commission reviewed text messages from AllVote that provided a link to “what at first appeared to be the voter’s municipal website but was incorrect,” the commission said. Meagan Wolfe, the commission administrator, said groups like AllVote often attempt to represent themselves as an official source of election information, and “voters should be very careful when dealing with this type of unsolicited outreach, as the information being put forth is often inaccurate and misleading.”
Clymer told CNN last week that about 15,000 Wisconsin voters received texts from the group linking to the voting website for the wrong municipality, out of 750,000 total voters they contacted.
“We take every step to ensure we don’t send voters incorrect information,” Clymer said, adding that “we never represent ourselves as election officials.”
Little is known about the group, its founders or financial backers. A super PAC by the same name registered with the FEC earlier this month but hasn’t yet reported any money raised or spent. Clymer declined to provide information about its funding.
Howie Stanger, who is listed as AllVote’s treasurer on the FEC filings, did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. Stanger is the founder of Pocketbook Strategies, which aims to support “progressive organizations who want to dream big,” according to LinkedIn.
If voters have questions or concerns about their ballot or the election process, they should consult official sources, said Philip Hensley-Robin, executive director of advocacy group Common Cause Pennsylvania.
“A week before the general election, with election misinformation and disinformation on the rise, we highly recommend that voters rely on trusted and official sources from state and county elections offices,” he said.",29/10/2024
CNN,"Appeals court upholds January 6 obstruction prosecution, in a ruling that could bolster case against Trump | CNN Politics","A federal appeals court has upheld the Justice Department’s ability to prosecute January 6, 2021, rioters with an obstruction charge, in a new opinion that is likely to bolster prosecutors’ criminal case against former President Donald Trump on the same charge.
The decision, issued Friday, means prosecutors can use the law that criminalizes obstructing an official proceeding as they seek to bring to justice rioters who disrupted the congressional certification of the 2020 presidential election.
The three-judge panel of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals split 2-1 in the decision.
Trump is scheduled to go to trial in his federal election subversion case in March. His attorneys are arguing to have the case against him dismissed.
The appeals court ruled in the case of Thomas Robertson, a former police sergeant from southern Virginia who was convicted for taking part in the US Capitol riot. Robertson had asked the courts to examine the use of the obstruction law in relation to the riot.
Robertson went into the Capitol after then-President Trump’s speech on the Ellipse, and he hit a police officer with a stick. Robertson was later found guilty of obstruction.
The mob violence at the Capitol complex prompted Congress to evacuate the House and Senate chambers, pausing their certification of Joe Biden’s Electoral College win – a development that is a key factor of the DOJ’s obstruction cases against rioters.
Robertson argued in court that he shouldn’t face the obstruction charge because he hadn’t been acting corruptly, as the law requires. He also argued the law was too vague and was unconstitutional.
But the Friday ruling solidifies that his conviction and others like it can stand. In Robertson’s case, the court found he had broken the law in multiple ways, making it clear he acted corruptly.
“Where a defendant acts feloniously to obstruct a proceeding before the Congress, with no evidence or argument that he was merely engaged in peaceful expression, his culpability – i.e., the ‘corruptness’ of his actions – is not difficult to discern,” Judge Florence Pan of the DC Circuit wrote in the opinion.
Judge Nina Pillard agreed with the decision, while Judge Karen Henderson dissented.
Trump is separately charged under the same obstruction law and has pleaded not guilty. Trump is not personally accused of violence, as many rioters like Robertson were, and instead is accused of exploiting the Capitol riot as to derail the presidential transfer of power.",20/10/2023
CNN,Analysis: What happens if there’s a tie in 2024? Be ready for a ‘contingent election’ | CNN Politics,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.
When Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suspended his presidential campaign, he did it in the most complicated way.
Get your head around this: Kennedy will take himself off the ballot in certain key states, but he is encouraging supporters to vote for him in safe red and blue states so that he can feature in a “contingent election” if former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris tie.
In the battleground states, Kennedy said he’s supporting Trump.
Could Kennedy actually feature in a “contingent election?” Short answer: No. He could not take part unless he won electoral votes, something that does not seem to be mathematically possible. Perhaps he’s envisioning an elector going rogue and supporting him in defiance of voters, but Kennedy did not share details of his thinking.
For the facts about contingent elections, read on.
With two presidential candidates fighting over a mere 538 Electoral College votes, a tie scenario is more than possible. It’s actually kind of surprising there has only been one tied election so far, in 1800, between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr.
That tie was the result of a failure of coordination by Democratic-Republicans, but it led to the nation’s first “contingent election,” decided in the House of Representatives.
Could a tie actually happen this year?
Yes. While a tie is not a likely outcome, it is something to be ready for. Here is one plausible scenario for the 2024 election:
If Harris wins Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada and a single electoral vote in Nebraska, all of which Joe Biden won in 2020, but she loses Pennsylvania and Georgia, there’s a tie, 269-269.
The website 270 to Win also has more tied-election scenarios.
Unlike every other state, Maine and Nebraska award two electors to the statewide winner and one to the winner of each congressional district. Those individual, competitive electoral votes in Maine and Nebraska become hugely consequential in potential tie scenarios.
Make your own 269-269 scenario with CNN’s interactive election map.
What happens if there’s a tie?
If there’s a 269-269 tie, or if a third party or independent candidate wins electoral votes and keeps a candidate from reaching an Electoral College majority of 270, the next step is the same. It’s called a “contingent election.”
According to the 12th Amendment, enacted in the wake of that divisive 1800 election, if no candidate gets a majority of the Electoral College votes, the new Congress, which would have just been sworn in on January 3, chooses the president. The Senate would choose the vice president.
When would a ‘contingent election’ occur?
According to an analysis by the Congressional Research Service, a contingent election would occur on January 6, immediately after members of Congress met to count electoral votes and determined that no candidate had a majority.
There is a lot of information from that CRS report in this story. While it dates back to 2017, it’s still a valuable resource.
How would the process work?
The nation would clearly be divided. Lawmakers could be torn between supporting their preferred candidate and the one their state’s voters preferred.
In a contingent election, the House selects the president and the Senate selects the vice president. House members can only choose from among the top three finishers in the Electoral College for president, and senators can choose from among the top two finishers for vice president. Kennedy would presumably need to win electoral votes – win a state or a congressional district in Nebraska or Maine – in order to be an option in a contingent election. There’s no chance of that happening at the moment.
Rather than voting as individuals, each state delegation in the House would get one vote, although how the state delegations select their preferred candidate is not spelled out. A simple majority, 26 state delegation votes, would appoint the new president.
If state delegations in the House did not select a president by Inauguration Day, January 20, the new vice president selected by the Senate would become temporary president. It is possible the Senate could select a vice president when the House is deadlocked, because in the Senate each senator would get one vote.
If the Senate had not selected a vice president by January 20, the presidential succession plan in the 20th Amendment temporarily takes effect. First in line after the vice president is the speaker of the House, currently Mike Johnson, although it could be a different Republican or a Democrat if Democrats win a majority in the House this November.
Does either side have an advantage?
If the Electoral College already benefits smaller and more rural states, the contingent election process – in which each state, regardless of population, has an equal vote – gives them a huge advantage.
California and Texas get the same say as Delaware and Wyoming in a contingent election. Plus, Washington, DC, which gets three votes in the Electoral College, would be cut out of the contingent election.
There’s nothing to require state delegations to honor the winner of their state’s vote. And in closely divided states, the results in single seats, perhaps determined by gerrymandered congressional maps, could swing a delegation’s vote.
Heading into the 2024 election, Republican lawmakers held a majority in 26 states, compared with Democrats, who held the majority in 22, with ties in Minnesota and North Carolina. Republicans in North Carolina have changed the state’s congressional map, however, and it is likely to have a majority-Republican congressional delegation in January. Republicans are likely to maintain their advantage next year, especially if voters are so split that they deliver a national tie at the top of the ticket.
In Arizona, for instance, who is to say that a potential majority of Republican members of Congress would vote for the Democratic candidate, even if Harris pulled out a narrow win there? Would Alaska’s Democratic member of Congress, assuming she wins reelection, vote for the Democrat for president even though her state is likely to go for Trump in November?
Why does this bizarre tie-break system exist?
It’s actually meant to be an improvement. The way the Electoral College was first assembled, electors voted for two candidates. Whoever got the most votes was president and whoever got the second-most votes was vice president.
By the time political parties were forming – Federalists and Democratic-Republicans in 1800 – electors needed to coordinate to cast more votes for their presidential pick than their vice presidential pick.
In the 1800 election, a rematch of 1796, Jefferson’s Democratic-Republicans beat incumbent President and Federalist John Adams.
But the Democratic-Republicans were poorly coordinated or bad at counting and foolishly cast equal numbers of votes for their presidential pick, Jefferson, and his running mate, Burr.
Out of pique, when the early version of the contingent election rolled around, the Federalists, who still controlled the House at that time, backed Burr. Despite the intervention of Alexander Hamilton, a noted Federalist, it took 36 rounds of voting to finally elect Jefferson.
By 1804, the 12th Amendment was being ratified.
Has a contingent election happened in the years since the tied election of 1800?
Yes. In 1824, multiple candidates got votes in the Electoral College but none of them received a majority, triggering a contingent election.
Amazingly, from today’s perspective, all of the candidates who got Electoral College votes that year were from the same Democratic-Republican political party, although they were split into regional sects.
Andrew Jackson won 40% of the popular vote and got the most votes in the Electoral College with 99 of the 131 needed for victory. But the House ultimately picked his top rival, John Quincy Adams, whose father lost that 1800 election.
Jackson would have his revenge with a victory four years later, and John Quincy Adams would round out his career as the only former president to be elected to Congress, the body that made him president.
Another contingent election occurred with the 1836 race, but just for vice president. Virginia’s electors did not like Robert M. Johnson, the running mate of election winner Martin Van Buren, and withheld their votes for him in the Electoral College. The Senate later elevated Johnson to the vice presidency in a contingent election.
What about the disputed election of 1876?
In 1876, when there was a contested outcome, the contingent election system was bypassed.
That year, at the height of Reconstruction, the issue was not that no person got a majority in the Electoral College, but rather that three Southern states – Florida, Louisiana and South Carolina – sent multiple slates of electoral votes to Washington, DC, after the state elections were disputed. And in Oregon, there was a dispute over one elector.
Congress created a special bipartisan commission, with one more Republican than Democrats, to determine which candidate should get the 20 disputed electoral votes. They ultimately gave the votes to Republican Rutherford B. Hayes even though Democrat Samuel Tilden got more popular votes.
Hayes then largely ended Reconstruction, perhaps as part of a secret deal that gave him the White House.

CNN,Biden’s clean energy law revived this red corner of Georgia. Voters there are backing Trump anyway | CNN Politics,"The face of a new era in American manufacturing is here, just off Interstate 75, tucked into this northwest corner of Georgia.
That’s where you’ll find the Qcells plant that pumps out 32,000 solar panels a day and has a total panel production capacity of 5.1 gigawatts. For context, officials note, the peak capacity of the Hoover Dam is roughly 2 gigawatts.
“When I came here, there was dirt. There was no building,” said Lisa Nash, the plant manager here, walking CNN through the high-tech factory floor in August. “I was the first person hired.”
Asked if she could have envisioned where things are now, she didn’t hesitate: “No.”
In Nash’s view, the dramatic growth isn’t just a success story for the company or industry, it’s also major win for the community here in Dalton.
“The population’s growing. They’re buying houses, rent, shopping, eating out. They’re contributing back into the local community, paying taxes,” Nash said.
It’s a cutting-edge operation that was made possible by the sweeping climate investment law enacted by the Biden administration in 2022.
“We’ve had lots of support in the state and federal level of various kinds,” said Scott Moskowitz, the head of market strategy and public affairs at Qcells. “But it wasn’t till the Inflation Reduction Act passed, which really provided the spark that this industry needed to make these types of investments.”
Which is why Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to the plant last year to highlight its growth – and speak to some of its employees.
“To meet her and to have a conversation with her, I was shocked because I was thinking, you know, she’s up here, but she’s actually down to earth, very straightforward,” said Kimberly Richardson, the Qcells employee selected by management to introduce Harris during her visit.
Richardson embodies a new generation of manufacturing workers – someone with no experience in solar panels or the green technology space prior to joining Qcells who has quickly acclimated – and risen – inside the company, where she’s now in charge of the plant’s recycling operation.
For Richardson, a Black woman, Harris’ campaign for president carries a deep meaning.
“She represents every woman in the United States, every woman,” Richardson said. “She set the tone for every woman in the United States, every little girl, to say, ‘I can do this,’ and that’s a good thing.”
But while Georgia may be a hotly contested battleground state, Richardson’s view isn’t exactly widespread here, where support for former President Donald Trump runs strong.
“She wasn’t well received in north Georgia,” Kasey Carpenter, the Republican state representative for the area, said of the Harris visit.
The Qcells plant offers a window into the convergence of local, state and federal government aligning to accelerate a manufacturing transition that has turbocharged a local economy. That the effort has crossed party lines is rare enough in these polarized times.
But that it happened in a community that backs a presidential candidate who has attacked the very law that is central to its rapid expansion underscores the complex – and in this case, contradictory - overlap of politics and a local economy.
Trump strikes a chord
Located in the congressional district represented by GOP firebrand Marjorie Taylor Greene, Dalton is Trump country.
“The independence that we keep up here – it’s that independence and outsider that he’s really struck a chord with,” Carpenter said of Trump’s rock-solid support in the area. “And my folks, they appreciate that. And quite frankly that I appreciate that too.”
Carpenter is far from a die-hard Trump supporter.
“We’re in a world where we get two candidates, but we have 27 boxes of cereal on the shelf. That’s the world I live in,” he said. “It’s that frustrating that you have two candidates.”
But for voters here, the political debate over the economy comes down to one thing.
“Inflation is such a big issue for our community right now that that’s going to trump anything that kind of I think about,” Carpenter said.
This is the paradox playing out during a dramatic comeback for this part of the state.
The Qcells plant – the largest of its kind in the Western Hemisphere – sits in what has long been known as the carpet capital of the world.
The moniker can be found on the signs welcoming visitors to Dalton, which has held a dominant market share of the carpet and flooring industry for decades.
But it also left the area particular vulnerable to something most thought was impossible until 2008: a housing market crash.
“It was a bloodbath for us here,” Carpenter said. “It was a ghost town. And it took us years to get out of it.”
The market collapse sparked local leaders to start thinking through – and setting up the infrastructure for – the diversification of the town’s economy.
That overlapped with efforts at the state level – most recently by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp – to line up incentives for major companies to relocate to or build in Georgia.
The Biden administration’s incentives from the federal side turbocharged the efforts on green energy.
“They are all equally important,” Nash said when asked whose support was most critical between federal, state and local government. “It’s like a recipe and without one ingredient, you can’t successfully have this project.”
The result has been the revival of a model that was thought to be a thing of the past.
“If you walk around in the factory, you’re going see a broad age band,” Nash said. “We have a 65-year-old father. His son and his daughter work here. There are high school students that we interview because of their gaming.”
What was once aspirational is now reality – and growing.
‘A hometown feel’
Just about 50 miles down I-75 is Cartersville, where on a recent Saturday the center of town was jam-packed with residents stopping through booths filled by local vendors selling locally sourced food and agricultural goods.
For two years running, this has been ranked the top farmer’s market in Georgia, which might not be expected in a county that voted 75% for Trump in 2020.
But in some ways, it’s a key element to an approach that helped the town lure Qcells to build its next plant here, just a few miles away from where CNN linked up with its mayor, Matt Santini.
This is clearly a Republican town, with deep-rooted support for the former president. But in Santini’s mind, the true nature of the place is the community itself.
“It’s doubled in size since I moved here in the early ‘90s, but it’s still a place where, again, you can walk through a farmer’s market,” Santini said. “You see people talking and getting along with each other. We have a hometown feel.”
Back in Dalton, that hometown feel is exactly the vibe a visitor gets walking into the Oakwood Cafe.
The restaurant is technically the day job for Carpenter, the state legislator – and one that keeps him connected to the community he represents while in Atlanta when the Legislature is in session.
“I’m real connected,” Carpenter said with a chuckle. “I fry their chicken on Monday, and Saturdays I’m washing their dishes.”
Carpenter describes his community and its residents with pride.
“It’s blue-collar, man. We’re all workers,” he said.
But he acknowledges there’s a heavy dose of ideological irony in the economic engine that has taken root in the area over the past few years.
“We’re growing the green energy that they don’t necessarily care that much about,” he said. “But I think they’re coming around because they see the impact on the economy.”
That impact, he notes, has been significant.
“Whether it’s janitorial, whether it’s restaurants, catering, whether it’s, you know, plastics, you know, garbage bags, whatever, shipping goods, all of that stuff flows downstream from something like that,” Carpenter said.
Threats that haven’t resonated
That downstream effect – perhaps most tangible in the form of downtown Dalton’s new boutique hotel, right across the street from the Oakwood Cafe, the area’s first in 50 years and evidence to many of the city’s comeback.
Still, the campaign-trail threats from Trump to repeal pillars of the climate law that sparked the growth haven’t moved voters here – or really resonated.
“I don’t think they realize that if the whole thing is repealed, it will affect those 2,500 jobs down on the south end of the county. And it’s real,” Carpenter said. “It will have consequences.”
Qcells representatives are quick to point out that they first broke ground in Dalton in 2018 because Trump’s tariffs on solar panels incentivized production stateside.
Still, the former president’s threats are impossible to ignore, even if the bipartisan support for the project across the federal, state and local levels offers it a level of protection should Trump win.
“You want to ask me that after November?” Nash, the Qcells plant manager, responded when asked about the future for the industry.
But she underscored the scale of the transformation already underway – and what that means for the future.
“No, I’m optimistic because we’re just scratching the surface,” she said.
It’s a future Nash’s parents thought didn’t exist.
“Both of them said, ‘Don’t go into manufacturing,’” she recalled. “I’d like to think they’re both proud of me today because of this. I look at my kids and my grandkids, and I’m thinking: ‘I wouldn’t mind them doing that.’”
It’s a window into a transformation that has taken hold of an entire community – a one-industry town no more.
Asked if there were any plans to add “Solar capital of the world” onto the current Dalton signs in town, Carpenter thought about it for a minute.
“No, but we should, though,” he said. “We’ve gotta wait and see what happens. Right now, the story still remains.”",27/9/2024
CNN,Redistricting battles have mostly ended. Here’s how they could determine the balance of power in the US House | CNN Politics,"Multiple Supreme Court showdowns. Closed-door negotiations. And millions of dollars in litigation.
After months of legal and legislative skirmishes around the country, much of the redistricting drama of the 2024 election cycle is behind us. And it has ended pretty close to where it began: Just a handful of seats could determine which party controls the US House of Representatives, where Republicans now hold a threadbare majority.
In North Carolina, newly empowered GOP state legislators took an aggressive approach with their map-drawing, crafting lines that are expected to allow their party to flip at least three seats now held by Democrats. But, in recently concluded redistricting in New York, Democrats, who had final say over the map, adopted a more modest position – essentially turning just one Republican-held seat a deeper shade of blue.
In the South, Democrats are expected to gain two seats as a result of Voting Rights Act rulings out of Alabama and Louisiana. But a protracted battle over the congressional map in another Southern state, Georgia, has not changed the partisan balance of the state’s US House delegation heading into November.
“It’s amazing that with all of the states where we’ve had things going on and with all the different lawsuits, we are really only talking about a small number of districts that are guaranteed to change hands as a result of this entire shuffle,” said Nick Seabrook, a political scientist at the University of North Florida and the author of the 2022 book “One Person, One Vote: A Surprising History of Gerrymandering in America.”
“We have actually emerged nationally with a pretty fair map,” he said. “I certainly think that there are ample opportunities for either party to win.”
Adam Kincaid, the president and executive director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, sees a “tick to the right” under the new landscape, with the likely net addition of two more House seats that former President Donald Trump would have carried in 2020. But he cautioned that it was still a “tight map” and a “tight electorate.”
“From top to bottom, the country is a 50-50 country right now,” Kincaid said.
(Although Republicans control the House by a narrow margin, under the map used in the 2022 midterm elections, 17 of those GOP lawmakers were elected in communities that backed President Joe Biden in 2020.)
Democrats, meanwhile, say they emerged in a stronger position after wielding the nearly 60-year-old Voting Rights Act to prevail in legal fights in deep-red Alabama and Louisiana. Federal judges ordered lawmakers in those states to give Black residents more opportunities to elect House candidates of their choice.
“Alabama and Louisiana are just two states once thought to be unreachable in the fight for fairness that have quickly become more representative” as a result of the legal actions, John Bisognano, president of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, said in a statement. “I’m confident the House map will remain highly competitive going into 2024.”
Here’s a state-by-state look at the recent redistricting disputes and where they stand:
Louisiana
Facing a court-ordered deadline, the Republican-controlled state Legislature in January approved a map with a second Black-majority district that is expected to be in effect for this year’s elections.
The action, viewed as a win for Democrats, endangers the seat now held by Republican Rep. Garret Graves.
The implementation of the new map follows a protracted legal battle over the state’s congressional district lines.
Although Black people make up roughly a third of the state’s population, Louisiana has just one Black lawmaker – who is also the lone Democrat – in its six-member US House delegation.
A federal judge threw out the state’s Republican-drawn map in 2022, saying it likely violated the Voting Rights Act. Republican officials in the state appealed to the US Supreme Court, which put the lower-court ruling on hold until it decided the Alabama case, which it did in June this year.
Once the high court had weighed in on the Alabama case, the legal skirmishes again lurched to life in Louisiana.
A federal court had given the GOP-controlled state Legislature until the end of January to draw a new map, after deciding that the lower court had ruled correctly that the state lawmakers’ map improperly diluted the voting power of Louisiana’s Black residents.
If the Legislature had not acted by that deadline, the lower court could have proceeded to a full trial to resolve the map in time for this year’s elections. A dozen non-Black voters filed a legal challenge to the Legislature’s map, arguing it was an illegal racial gerrymander, and a three-judge panel agreed.
That set off a fresh appeal to the US Supreme Court, which on May 15 paused the panel’s ruling in an order that will likely allow the Legislature’s map to be used in this year’s elections.
New York
Republicans flipped four US House seats in New York in the 2022 midterm elections, victories that helped secure their party’s majority in the chamber.
Then, a ruling by the state’s highest court appeared to jeopardize those gains by potentially making it easier for Democrats to pick up as many as six GOP-held seats.
In the end, however, the Democratic state lawmakers, who hold ultimate control of the redistricting process, settled on a map that made only modest adjustments to the status quo lines.
First, a bit of history: A state court judge oversaw the process of drawing the map used in the 2022 elections following a long legal battle and the inability of New York’s bipartisan Independent Redistricting Commission to agree on new lines. But Democrats scored a court victory last summer when a state appellate court ruled that the redistricting commission should redraw the map.
Republicans appealed that decision, and oral arguments were held in November before New York’s Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court.
On December 12, the Court of Appeals ordered the state to once again restart the mapmaking process. As a result, New York’s redistricting commission created a new map, but the Democratic-controlled state Legislature tinkered with the commission’s lines, as permitted under state law.
The Legislature’s final product ended up putting a Central New York seat held by Republican freshman Brandon Williams at greater risk for his party. It also shored up for Democrats Tom Suozzi’s Long Island seat, which the party flipped in a February special election to succeed expelled former Rep. George Santos.
Leaders of both political parties say they can live with the map’s modest approach, which still puts the Empire State at the epicenter of the battle for the House. But some progressives have criticized New York Democrats, who hold supermajorities in the state Legislature, for not taking a more aggressive approach.
Former New York Rep. John Faso, a Republican who had been a key player in litigation over redistricting, said the map drawn by Democrats “has no material differences from the current map.”
“This turned out to be much ado about very little,” he added.
North Carolina
North Carolina’s legislature, where Republicans hold a supermajority, has drawn new congressional lines that observers say could prove a windfall for the GOP and boost the party’s chances of retaining its House majority next year.
The state’s current House delegation is split 7-7 between Democrats and Republicans.
A map that Republican state lawmakers approved put three House Democrats in what one expert called “almost impossible to win” districts.
The affected Democrats were Reps. Jeff Jackson, who currently represents a Charlotte-area district; Wiley Nickel, who holds a Raleigh-area seat; and Kathy Manning, who represents Greensboro and other parts of north-central North Carolina. All three opted not to seek reelection to the House.
A fourth Democrat, Rep. Don Davis, saw his district retooled to become more friendly toward Republicans while remaining competitive for both parties.
State-level gains in the 2022 midterm elections gave the GOP new sway over redistricting in this swing state – Republicans flipped the state Supreme Court, whose members are chosen in partisan elections. Last year, the new GOP majority on the court tossed out a 2022 ruling by the then-Democratic leaning court against partisan gerrymandering.
A map that had been created after the Democratic-led high court’s ruling resulted in the current even split in the state’s House delegation.
Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper does not have veto power over redistricting legislation. A group of Black and Latino residents of North Carolina filed a lawsuit alleging that the GOP-approved map “intentionally discriminates” against minority voters in violation of the US Constitution.
Alabama
In one of the cycle’s highest-profile redistricting cases, a three-judge panel in Alabama approved a map that created a second congressional district with a substantial Black population. Before the court action, Alabama – which is 27% Black – had only one Black-majority district out of seven seats.
The fight over the map went all the way to the US Supreme Court – which issued a surprise ruling, affirming a lower-court opinion that ordered Alabama to include a second Black-majority district or “something quite close to it.” Under the map used for the 2024 election, the state’s 2nd District now loops into Mobile to create a seat where nearly half the population is Black.
The high court’s 5-4 decision in June saw two conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, side with the three liberals to uphold the lower-court ruling. Their action kept intact a key pillar of the Voting Rights Act: that it’s illegal to draw maps that effectively keep Black voters from electing a candidate of their choice.
The ruling reverberated around the country and affected the outcome of similar court cases underway in Louisiana and Georgia that centered on whether Republican-drawn maps improperly diluted Black political power in those states.
Given that Black voters in Alabama have traditionally backed Democrats, the party now stands a better chance of winning the newly reconfigured district and sending two of its members to Congress after November’s elections.
The new map also could result in two Black US House members from Alabama serving together for the first time in state history.
Georgia
Georgia Republicans, who hold a governing trifecta in the state, finalized a new congressional map last year that safeguarded their party’s dominance in state politics and dashed Democrats’ hopes of adding an additional US House seat.
The new map complied with an order issued by US District Judge Steve Jones to establish an additional Black-majority district. But it preserved the GOP’s 9-5 edge in Georgia’s US House delegation by moving the Atlanta-area district represented by Rep. Lucy McBath, a Black Democrat, farther into Republican territory.
Jones had ordered state lawmakers to draw a new congressional map by December 8, arguing that the Republican-controlled legislature improperly diluted the political power of Black voters in their establishment of district boundaries following the 2020 census. In that ruling, Jones said state lawmakers’ earlier map had violated the Voting Rights Act.
In a big win for Republicans, Jones in late December ruled that the new legislature-drawn map that preserved Republicans’ 9-5 advantage “fully complied” with his order.
A separate federal case in Georgia challenges the congressional map on constitutional grounds.
Florida
A state judge in September struck down congressional lines for northern Florida that had been championed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, ruling that the Republican governor’s map had improperly diluted Black voting power.
This case, unlike the Alabama fight decided by the US Supreme Court, centers on provisions in the state constitution.
The judge concluded that the congressional boundaries – which essentially dismantled a seat once held by Al Lawson, a Black Democrat, that connected Black communities across a northern reach of the Florida – violated the state’s Fair Districts amendments, enacted by voters. One amendment specifically bars the state from drawing a district that diminishes the ability of racial minorities “to elect representatives of their choice.”
But in December, a state appeals court upheld the map DeSantis had advocated, saying the plaintiffs “failed to present any evidence” that the earlier version of the district – which connected Black communities from Jacksonville to Tallahassee – contained a singular cohesive community that would have a right to protection under Florida’s constitution.
The case is now before the all-Republican state Supreme Court, where DeSantis appointees hold most seats. The disputed map appears likely to remain in place for this year’s elections after the court denied the plaintiffs’ request to speed up the case and hold arguments before the congressional candidate qualifying period in April.
In a separate case — centered on whether the map violates the US Constitution – a federal court sided with DeSantis.
Observers say that in the end, the outcome of the state litigation is more likely than the federal case to determine the future of the North Florida district, given the state constitution’s especially strong protections for the voting rights of racial minorities and the lower burden of proof required to establish that those rights were abridged.
Kentucky
The Kentucky Supreme Court in December rejected arguments from Democrats that a map drawn by the state’s Republican-controlled legislature violated the state constitution as an “extreme partisan” gerrymander.
The dispute centered on lawmakers’ decision to move Kentucky’s capital city – Democratic-leaning Frankfort – out of the 6th Congressional District and into an oddly shaped – and solidly Republican – 1st District. Doing so helped shore up the GOP odds of holding the 6th District, represented by Republican Andy Barr.
Under its previous lines, the 6th District was a more competitive seat. (Democrat Amy McGrath came within 3 points of beating Barr in 2018; last year, Barr won a sixth term under the new lines by 29 points.)
A lower-court judge had ruled that the Republican-drawn map did not violate the state’s constitution, and the state’s high court, in a December 14 ruling, agreed.
South Carolina
A redistricting case pending before the US Supreme Court centers on the future of a Charleston-area seat held by Republican Rep. Nancy Mace, who made headlines last year for joining House GOP hard-liners in voting to remove Kevin McCarthy as speaker.
Last year, a three-judge panel concluded that the lines for the coastal 1st Congressional District, as drawn by state GOP lawmakers, amounted to an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.
The Republican lawmakers appealed to the US Supreme Court. During oral arguments, several justices in the court’s conservative majority expressed skepticism that South Carolina officials had engaged in an improper racial gerrymander and seemed inclined to reinstate the lawmakers’ map.
The 2024 elections will proceed under the current map, the three-judge panel ruled in March. The judges, in part, cited the delay in the high court issuing a decision.
New Mexico
Republicans in New Mexico argued that the congressional lines drawn by the Democrats who control state government amounted to an illegal gerrymander under the state’s constitution.
At stake: a swing district along the US border with Mexico. If Republicans had prevailed, the 2nd District seat – now held by a Democratic Rep. Gabe Vasquez – could have become more favorable to Republicans.
But a state judge in October upheld the map drawn by Democrats, and the New Mexico Supreme Court affirmed that ruling.
Utah
The state Supreme Court, in a case it heard in July, is considering whether it even has the authority to weigh in on map-drawing decisions by the GOP-controlled state Legislature.
Republican state officials have argued that the court’s power over redistricting decisions is limited.
Advocacy groups and a handful of voters are challenging a congressional map that further carved up Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County between four decidedly Republican districts.
Doing so, the plaintiffs asserted in their lawsuit, “takes a slice of Salt Lake County and grafts it onto large swaths of the rest of Utah,” allowing Republican voters in rural areas and smaller cities far away from Salt Lake to “dictate the outcome of elections.”

CNN,Analysis: One of the most important jobs in American politics has turned into a nightmare | CNN Politics,"Winning a majority party’s nomination for speaker of the House of Representatives usually elevates a lawmaker into the pantheon of American political leaders.
But such is the toxicity of the GOP three weeks after the ouster of Speaker Kevin McCarthy that the nominee expected to emerge on Tuesday may never get the top job.
The nomination is an assignment to what may be an impossible political mission to unite a conference that might never be reconciled. And even if the nominee wins the gavel, the next speaker has a reasonable chance of a tenure even shorter than McCarthy, who lasted nine months.
But this is about more than the plight of a Republican Party that often looks like it’s tearing itself apart. If the dysfunctional House GOP majority cannot get its act together, the US government could run out of funding before Thanksgiving week – and millions of Americans could pay the price.
As lawmakers returned to Washington on Monday, there was a growing sense of rising public frustration about a House that has been paralyzed for three weeks, as global crises boil and the shutdown deadline approaches.
Florida Rep. Vern Buchanan said his constituents “think all of us are incapable.” Buchanan, who is supporting fellow Sunshine State lawmaker Byron Donalds for speaker, added: “People are very angry and upset.”
The hopefuls lined up on Tuesday at the start of rounds of secret balloting that will produce a party nominee for speaker following the failures of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan to replace McCarthy. But there is no guarantee the candidate who emerges from secret balloting will be able to get the required majority in the full House – given the extreme splits in the GOP between some of the far-right hardliners who helped eject McCarthy and more moderate lawmakers in battleground districts.
Because of their tiny majority, almost every Republican must back the nominee for him to become speaker – a longshot in a conference that is deeply divided. Ex-President Donald Trump has been fielding calls from top candidates seeking his endorsement but joked on Monday that only divine intervention could end the crisis.
“I said there’s only one person who can do it all the way,” Trump said in New Hampshire. “You know who that is? Jesus Christ. If Jesus came down and said, ‘I want to be speaker,’ he would do it.”
A new GOP speaker could find it impossible to unite the party
The fact there were so many candidates on Tuesday tells its own tale – namely that no one is strong enough to clear the field and whoever emerges may not have a strong base of support.
There are signs House Majority Whip Tom Emmer has been making progress, but as a member of a House leadership team distrusted by the right-wing House Freedom Caucus, his candidacy may suffer the same liabilities as those of Scalise and McCarthy. Another possible nominee is Donalds of Florida, a member of the House Freedom Caucus and one of the few Black Republicans in Congress. But Donalds may be too radical for moderate Republicans in districts that voted for President Joe Biden. There’s been palpable anger among such members – on whom the majority rests – that the lawmakers who voted out McCarthy have escaped punishment. A speaker from the far-right may be too much for them to accept.
But the identity of the new Republican speaker – when he eventually emerges (there’s not one woman among the current candidates) – may be less important than the dire situation he will confront. The House GOP has now spent three weeks failing to select a new leader – time that would have been better spent staking out a position on a new government funding deal needed to prevent the government from closing down in mid-November. Even if a new speaker is selected by the end of this week, there’s barely three weeks before the Thanksgiving break to get a deal with a Democratic-run Senate and the White House to avoid yet another governing debacle on the GOP majority’s watch.
The funding showdown will represent one of the most difficult tests ever for a new speaker. The likelihood that this leader will be a compromised figure at risk of losing his job at any moment at the head of a rebellious conference makes the position even more vulnerable.
As former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, himself a notoriously polarizing figure, said on Fox News this weekend: “They got big decisions coming down the road. There’s a very real danger that they’ll elect somebody and three of four or five weeks from now, you’re going to have a group of people blow up and decide to go back into the same mess.”
The risk of such a scenario is raised by the fact that any new speaker will face the same kind of impossible choices that confronted McCarthy when he narrowly averted a government shutdown last month. Knowing that he couldn’t satisfy extreme demands for spending cuts from hardliners with a Democratic Senate and the White House, McCarthy was forced to use some Democratic votes to pass a stopgap funding bill. And it cost him his job.
The growing pressure to fill the speaker’s chair might be a motivating factor for the GOP to finally end the stalemate. But the risk is that a compromise candidate will not have spent the years building a powerbase – inside the Capitol and on the critical fundraising circuit – and may therefore not be an effective leader of a fractious conference.
The fact that party leaders can only lose four votes and still pass a bill on party lines has highlighted the huge splits inside the conference and underscored that there is no reliable Republican majority for any legislation in the House right now.
Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky, for instance, said the leadership crisis “shows that we’re not functioning as a majority. And when you lose that, you lose the ability to govern.”
How Americans could pay the price for the House’s dysfunction
The 2024 elections are still more than a year away, but the spectacle of a House brought low by its own divisions augurs poorly for the GOP. The party cannot enact its agenda, has no chance of showing voters it can be an effective majority, and cannot even use its power to jam Democrats into taking tough political votes that may come back to haunt them – as a majority party might generally do at this point in the political cycle.
But House Republicans are not just harming themselves. If the leadership limbo goes on much longer, the damage could spread countrywide and go global.
A government shutdown could harm countless Americans – including members of the armed services that could go without pay. And the paralysis in the House means that lawmakers cannot vote on sending emergency aid to Israel amid its war with Hamas. Biden’s request for a new $60 billion aid package for Ukraine is also not going anywhere. Domestically, vital appropriations bills on everything from farming to energy and foreign operations are stalled.
“I think House Republicans know that this is very detrimental to the country. Look at what is going on … over in Israel, what’s happening in Ukraine, and all the other things we know are happening in the world, including in our own country,” Rep. Larry Bucshon told CNN’s Brianna Keilar on Monday. The Indiana Republican also warned the party was hurting itself ahead of the critical funding showdown.
“I think it does put us at a disadvantage. We don’t have someone who is the speaker of the House to negotiate with the White House, with Senate Democrats who are in the majority. … It does put us at a political disadvantage.”
“Also practically for the country, it’s not a good thing.”",24/10/2023

Who, what, when and where? It can be valuable to take a step back from the day-to-day news and look with a wider lens at the election playing out.
Here are answers to some more general questions that can get lost at the end of the campaign.
When is Election Day?
US law requires a presidential election every four years. These general elections, since 1845, are required to occur on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. This year, that date is November 5.
States oversee their own elections, which means polling times vary from state to state. The first polls close on Election Day at 6 p.m. ET in some counties in Indiana and Kentucky, and the last polls close at 1 a.m. ET Wednesday, November 6, in Alaska. Waves of state polls close every hour in between. But many millions of Americans will vote early in person or by mail.
Get information about your state in CNN’s Voter Handbook.
Why does Election Day last more than one day?
Each state conducts their election a little bit differently. Some, like in Washington state, Oregon and Utah, are done almost entirely by mail, a process that stretches for weeks.
Every state has some form of early voting available, which opens the process to people who can’t get to the polls on Election Day and ensures as many people cast ballots as possible.
Who are the candidates this year?
The Democrat is Vice President Kamala Harris, who is on the ballot with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her vice presidential running mate.
The Republican is former President Donald Trump, who is running this year with Sen. JD Vance of Ohio.
There are other candidates, and the options vary by state. The Libertarian Party’s Chase Oliver is on most ballots, and the Green Party’s Jill Stein is an option in most states as well. The former Democrat Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is also on the ballot in many states. He had been running as an independent but has since endorsed Trump.
That said, the vast majority of Americans will vote for either Harris or Trump.
Why are Trump and Harris the main options?
The two major parties, Republicans and Democrats, each held primary elections across the country earlier in the year.
Despite the fact that many Republicans repudiated Trump after his supporters stormed the Capitol building following his loss in the 2020 election, the former president easily emerged from a crowded field of primary candidates to be the GOP nominee again this year. It’s the third straight election where Trump is the Republican nominee.
For Democrats, President Joe Biden dominated the primaries and faced only token opposition. But after the primary season, concerns about Biden’s age – he’s 81 – accelerated. After CNN hosted a debate in June in which Biden fared poorly against Trump, the president bowed to pressure and dropped out of the race before Democrats held their nominating convention.
Biden’s endorsement of Harris, his vice president, helped make her the consensus nominee despite the fact that she did not take part in primaries. No Democrats rose to challenge her at the convention in August.
When will we know who won?
It could take a while. CNN did not project a winner in 2020 until four days after Election Day. Multiple states were decided by incredibly close margins that year.
In 2016, Hillary Clinton conceded the day after Election Day even though counting was still happening in multiple states. She acknowledged she would not win.
Trump is unlikely ever to acknowledge defeat. If there are close margins in key states, it could take days to determine a winner. The good news is that many states have made changes since 2020 to make it easier for election officials to get a head start on processing mail-in ballots, which take longer to count.
In 2000, one of the closest elections in US history, the winner was not apparent until 36 days after the election when the US Supreme Court ended recounts in Florida. Things were complicated that year by flawed paper ballots in some Florida counties, something that should not be a problem this year.
It could also end up not being that close of an election at all, and networks like CNN could project a winner on election night. We shall see.
What are the main issues?
One overriding issue is the cost of living. Prices spiked after the Covid-19 pandemic, and Trump has capitalized on a nostalgia people have for a time when the cost of groceries was lower. His plan to impose across-the-board tariffs on foreign goods might spike prices further, according to economists, but he has an advantage over Harris on the economy, according to polling.
Trump voters are also motivated by immigration. He would deport millions of migrants who crossed the border illegally, and he would all but shut down the US border.
For Harris voters, the issue of abortion is key. After the Supreme Court, with a third of justices appointed by Trump, overturned Roe v. Wade, Harris has framed reproductive rights as matter of personal freedom and has pledged to protect those rights.
There are ballot initiatives in key states to enshrine abortion rights. The issue is helping drive a gender gap in the vote, according to polling.
There is also the key issue of democracy. Trump was accused by the Justice Department of election interference after he tried to overturn the 2020 election results. That’s a nonstarter for many Democrats. Republicans, meanwhile, have largely grown to accept Trump’s role in the effort to keep Biden from the White House after he won in 2020. And many of them, after years of Trump questioning the system, now doubt the 2020 results themselves.
Trump was convicted on felony charges in New York related to hush money payments before the 2016 election. His sentencing is set for late November, meaning it will be after Election Day. However, his felony convictions, or even the possibility of jail time, don’t make Trump ineligible to serve as president.
How is a president elected in the US?
More than 150 million people are likely to cast ballots for the office of president on or before Election Day. But it’s 538 electors who will choose the president in a process that snakes through December and January.
When voters cast ballots, they are actually selecting a slate of electors tied to the candidate who wins the popular vote in each state.
The electors will then cast votes for president and vice president in each state’s capitol on December 17. That meeting is also known as the Electoral College, and it’s required in the Constitution.
Those electoral votes will be counted in the chamber of the House of Representatives on January 6, 2025, with the new Congress looking on.
The new president takes office on January 20, 2025.
How many electoral votes does each state get?
The number is tied to the size of a state’s congressional delegation, with one electoral vote for each senator and member of Congress.
The smallest states – Alaska, Delaware, the two Dakotas, Vermont and Wyoming – each get three.
With each additional member of Congress, a state gets one more elector. The most populous states are California (54 electoral votes), Texas (40 electoral votes) and Florida (30 electoral votes).
These numbers can change every 10 years because the Constitution requires an official population count, or census, and the number of congressional seats is then reapportioned. The most recent census occurred in 2020, so the number of electoral votes has changed.
Voters in Washington, DC, also get three electoral votes thanks to the 23rd Amendment, but they have no voting representation in the House or Senate. Other US citizens who don’t live in a state, like Puerto Ricans, aren’t so lucky when it comes to electoral votes.
How many electoral votes are there, and how many does it take to win the White House?
There are 538 electors. That figure is equal to 100 senators and 435 members of Congress, plus three votes for Washington, DC.
A majority of electoral votes is 270. Winning the White House is a mapping exercise for presidential candidates. They must pair the states that are safely in their column with enough battleground states to get to 270.
What are the battleground states in 2024?
There are thought to be seven states that could conceivably be won by either candidate. As a result, the campaigns have focused their energy in these areas. They can be broken up into two general categories.
3 Midwestern battlegrounds, aka “the blue wall” – These are the manufacturing and union-heavy states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. They used to be more reliably Democratic but have shifted in recent years as their populations have changed and as Trump has appealed to White voters without a college degree.
When Trump won the White House in 2016, he won all three. When Biden won in 2020, he won all three. If Harris wins all three this year, she will likely have the electoral votes to be president. But polls suggest close races in all three. Turnout will be key, which for Harris means appealing to suburban women and Black voters. All three states have urban centers.
The blue wall states usually vote the same way. The last time they did not all go to the same candidate was in 1988 – notably also a year when California was red and West Virginia was blue. In those eight elections since 1988, the only time the blue wall states went to a Republican was in 2016, when they were won by Trump.
4 Sun Belt battlegrounds – These states with growing populations include Arizona and Nevada in the West and North Carolina and Georgia in the East. Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina used to be more reliably Republican. Trump won North Carolina twice, but the margins were close in 2020. The last Democrat to win there was Barack Obama in 2008. Biden was the first Democrat to win Georgia since Bill Clinton in 1992 and Arizona since Clinton in 1996.
1 vote in Nebraska is a battleground – 48 states award their electoral votes winner-take-all to the victor in their state. Nebraska and Maine do it differently, awarding votes by congressional district. The state of Nebraska is safe Trump territory, but the congressional district around Omaha is a battleground. That one vote could end up being very important in the event of a close race in the Electoral College.
Note: It’s the reverse situation in Maine, the only other state that does not award all of its electors to the statewide winner. Trump could pick up a single electoral vote in Maine.
What if there’s a tie?
The total number of electoral votes, 538, is an even number, which means a tie is conceivable. It’s happened once before, in 1800, although the rules were a bit different then. If no candidate reaches the 270 votes needed to win the election, the new Congress would pick the president and the Senate would pick the vice president in what’s known as a “contingent election.”
Each of the 50 states would get one vote (sorry, Washington, DC). Republicans currently control more House delegations. Even if they lose the overall House majority in November, Republicans would still probably control more than half of the congressional delegations. Delegations in which there’s an even split between Republicans and Democrats (currently there are two) would not be counted.
Bottom line: An Electoral College tie would likely result in a Trump presidency.
In the Senate, it’s a simpler process. Each senator would get one vote to select the vice president. Democrats have a slim majority at the moment, but they are defending more seats on Election Day and there’s a good chance Republicans will control the Senate come January.
How are members of Congress elected, and why is the balance of power key?
Every two years, every seat in the House, all 435 of them, is up for grabs. Most of those seats are relatively safe for either Republicans or Democrats, but there is always the possibility that the majority changes hands.
Democrats are favored in 208 races and Republicans are favored in 212, according to preelection House race ratings from Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. With just 15 races listed as toss-ups, it’s likely that neither party will have a very large majority next year.
Changes in the balance of power have actually happened more in recent elections. This year, Republicans are heading into the election with a small majority, and it’s entirely possible that Democrats win their own small majority for the next House even if they lose the White House and control of the Senate.
It’s important for either party to control the House. Presidents need control to enact their priorities. The out-of-power party wants control to block the president’s priorities. In an ideal world, the two sides would work together to find consensus on issues like immigration and the tax code.
How do things work in the Senate?
It’s a little bit different in the Senate, where only a third of the seats are up for grabs every two years. Democrats are on defense as they try to defend their slim Senate majority.
Of the 34 seats for which there is an election this year, Democrats are defending 20 and Republicans are defending 13. Two of those Democratic seats, in West Virginia and Montana, are likely to be won by Republicans, according to the Senate race ratings. Another one, in Ohio, is rated as a toss-up.
Democrats hope they can pick up an unexpected win in either Texas or Florida, but Republicans are on pace to have a slim majority in the Senate next year. Assuming Republicans hold all of the seats they currently hold, they can control the chamber if they flip one Democratic seat and win the White House (the vice president breaks ties in the Senate) or win two seats regardless of the outcome of the presidential race.
No matter who has control of the Senate, neither party is expected to have a supermajority. That’s important because senators generally abide by a custom of respecting the filibuster. It usually requires 60 votes to enact major pieces of legislation, although both Republicans and Democrats have found ways around that in recent years.
Republicans found a way to enact tax cuts under Trump without 60 votes. Democrats did the same thing with their Inflation Reduction Act, which, among other things, aims to transition the US to a greener economy.",29/10/2024
CNN,Steve Bannon is released from prison in time for the last-week push to Election Day | CNN Politics,"Steve Bannon was released from federal prison Tuesday, according to a source with knowledge, emerging just a week before Election Day to retake the helm of his weakened right-wing media platform.
Bannon, a right-wing podcast host and the chief executive of Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, has remained a strident supporter of the former president. Even as he reported to federal prison in Connecticut in July, Bannon insisted he would influence the presidential race from behind bars and that his “War Room” podcast would continue to energize the Trump base.
Bannon was met early Tuesday morning by his daughter Maureen. He is expected to host his radio program later Tuesday morning.
He was convicted in 2022 on two counts of contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with a subpoena from the House Select Committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. He is continuing to appeal his conviction.
While in prison, Bannon digitally kept in touch with a small group of loyalists, including some who served as guest hosts for the podcast, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Bannon would in part discuss news of the day and politics including topics he thought about for the show.
However, Bannon’s MAGA megaphone has suffered in his absence. “War Room,” which frequently appeared in Apple’s Top Podcasts before Bannon reported to prison, fell off the charts by early July, according to data from Podchaser. By another measure, the podcast was once near the top of the Apple political podcast charts and has since fallen out of the top 25, per Podchaser data.
There are some signs that it’s ticking up slightly as Bannon prepares to return.
“Though we’ve been seeing election denial activists coming on the show still as a central hub, you see that ‘War Room,’ it wasn’t able to sustain itself without Bannon,” said Madeline Peltz, deputy director for rapid response at Media Matters, a progressive nonprofit that does extensive media monitoring.
Peltz still predicted Bannon would be a prominent voice for election denialism if it appears Trump is coming up short after Election Day.
“I think it’s going to take some time to bring the audience back and to mobilize them,” Peltz said. “I don’t think the one-week period between now and the election is enough time to complete that, but I think really, you’ll see it kick into high gear in the post-election chaos that we’re all sort of anticipating.”
While Bannon’s show is mainly seen as an energizer for the Trump base, data from Edison Research’s podcast metrics found that nearly half of Bannon’s audience was made up of Republicans but about a third of listeners were independents.
On the “War Room” podcast, a cast of fill-in hosts cheered Bannon’s return.
Prominent election conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell offered a deal on his MyPillow products to celebrate Bannon’s release (free pillows, plus shipping and handling, with the relevant discount code.)
“It’s less than 24 hours until Stephen K. Bannon is back a free man and preaching the gospel of MAGA here in the ‘War Room,’” Natalie Winters, one of the podcast guest hosts said Monday.
Winters then turned her focus to the presidential race, claiming, “It’s not an election, it’s ballot warfare.” It’s the kind of incendiary rhetoric Bannon embraced and promoted as an early voice in the “Stop the Steal” movement in 2020.
In May, Bannon claimed on his podcast that “they’re going to do everything to steal this election,” as he reiterated the baseless claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.
“Bannon is one of the most talented broadcasters among his peers, in terms of taking current events, pulling out a kernel of truth from them, and then spinning an elaborate conspiracy theory on top of it, which then becomes the fuel for the action that’s taken by the grassroots in response to these lies,” Peltz from Media Matters said. “There’s really no one who has quite the same level of talent for that particular misinformation approach.”
To mark his release, Bannon’s team said he plans to hold a press conference Tuesday afternoon in New York.

CNN,Trump says it was ‘my honor to be involved’ in controversial Madison Square Garden rally | CNN Politics,"Donald Trump on Tuesday defended his controversial Madison Square Garden rally, telling supporters that the event was “an absolute lovefest” and that it was “my honor to be involved.”
The former president’s comments come amid backlash over disparaging and divisive remarks at his Sunday event in New York City, which included a comedian describing Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage.” Allies expressed worry the remarks could have political repercussions, especially given Puerto Ricans’ growing influence in battleground states, with about half a million residing in Pennsylvania alone. But Trump at his Mar-a-Lago rally did not directly address the criticism of that remark.
“I don’t think anybody has ever seen anything like what happened the other night at Madison Square Garden,” Trump told a crowd of supporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida as he addressed criticism of his rally for the first time. “The love in that room – it was breathtaking. And you could have filled it many, many times with people that were unable to get in.”
He claimed that veteran politicians told him there had “never been an event so beautiful.”
“It was like a lovefest, an absolute lovefest, and it was my honor to be involved,” he said.
CNN reported Monday that several of Trump’s allies expressed dismay at the language used by speakers at the event, particularly the Puerto Rico remark, which set the tone for an evening of disparaging and divisive comments. The violent and vulgar rhetoric at the rally has prompted finger-pointing within the former president’s inner circle and deep concern that his message was once again eclipsed by controversy.
In an interview that aired Tuesday night, Trump said that the comedian behind the offensive comments about Puerto Rico, Tony Hinchcliffe, probably shouldn’t have attended his Madison Square Garden rally.
“Yeah. I mean, I don’t know if it’s a big deal or not, but I don’t want anybody making nasty jokes or stupid jokes. Probably he shouldn’t have been there,” Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity.
Earlier in the day, Trump tried to cast himself as an ally of the island, saying at a roundtable in Pennsylvania, “No president’s done more for Puerto Rico than I have.”
He was responding to a woman who said she moved from Puerto Rico and told Trump, “I want you to know that Puerto Rico stands behind you, and Puerto Rico loves you.”
Trump said: “Well, we love it. I know it very well and we helped you through a lot of bad storms.”
In 2017, after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico and caused a humanitarian crisis, Trump was criticized by both Democrats and Republicans for being slow to respond to the crisis. The Trump administration ultimately deployed a Navy hospital ship to the island.
Puerto Rico Shadow Senator Zoraida Buxo spoke at Trump’s rally Tuesday night in Allentown, Pennsylvania.
Speaking at Mar-a-Lago, Trump mocked Democrats for drawing parallels between his rally and a Nazi rally held at Madison Square Garden in 1939. Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, said before the rally that Trump’s campaign knows “exactly what they’re doing there.”
“They started to say, ‘Well, in 1939, the Nazis used Madison Square Garden,’” Trump said. “How terrible to say, right? Because you know, they’ve used Madison Square Garden many times. Many people have used it. But nobody’s ever had a crowd like that. And I tell you what, right now, nobody’s ever had love like that. That was love in the room, and it was love for our country.”
The comments about Puerto Rico by Hinchcliffe, a comedian and podcast host, were swiftly condemned by Harris’ campaign, which used them in an advertisement portraying Trump as having “abandoned” the US territory in the wake of Hurricane Maria in 2017. Trump’s own campaign distanced the former president from the remark in a statement Sunday evening.
“These are fellow citizens he’s talking about,” former President Barack Obama said at a rally for Harris on Monday. “Here in Philadelphia, they are your neighbors. They are your friends, they are your co-workers. Their kids go to school with your kids. These are Americans.”
Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny signaled support for Harris moments after Hinchcliffe’s remarks, sharing a clip on social media of the vice president’s plans for the island.
Republicans have sought to brush off the backlash. Trump said Tuesday that he didn’t hear Hinchcliffe’s comments and that he didn’t know who the comedian was, despite the fact that Hinchcliffe kicked off the high-profile campaign rally.
“I don’t know him; someone put him up there. I don’t know who he is,” Trump told ABC News.
Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, on Monday described criticism of the joke about Puerto Rico as a “fake outrage cycle.”
“A comedian told a joke, and I don’t think that’s news worth making. I think what is news is that Americans can’t afford their groceries because Kamala Harris has been a terrible vice president,” Vance said at an event in Racine, Wisconsin.
Trump’s comments Tuesday downplaying the controversy over his Madison Square Garden rally came at a campaign event in which he criticized Harris and President Joe Biden for their administration’s handling of the economy and border security.
“We’re going to fight like hell for the next seven days,” Trump said, as the crowd chanted “fight,” the word he’d shouted moments after surviving an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania in July.

CNN,Analysis: It’s been 17 days without a speaker. Here’s what needs to happen in the House | CNN Politics,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.
It’s been 17 days since eight Republicans were able to bounce former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy from the top position in Congress and hit pause on all legislative business on Capitol Hill.
Having moved on from McCarthy and his No. 2, Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the third Republican choice, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, failed again Friday to perform the magic trick of uniting nearly every Republican behind him to get a House majority and reopen the chamber.
Jordan, by the way, was once labeled by a Republican former speaker as among a group of “political terrorists” for the way he thought they worked to tear apart Washington.
If Jordan ultimately can’t get enough Republican votes, some Republicans could join with some Democrats behind a separate option – giving interim Speaker Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina temporary power to pass legislation.
Here’s a look at what we know and what we can expect:
Why does it matter that there’s no speaker?
The House is essentially paralyzed until someone is chosen to preside over it.
A placeholder, McHenry, has the power to bring the chamber to order. But no legislation can pass until this is resolved. No government funding bills. No policy bills. To the extent that Congress is meant to address problems with legislation, that is not happening.
What legislation needs to pass and when?
First and foremost, the government essentially runs out of money in less than a month, on November 17. A speaker will need to be involved in negotiations with the White House and the Senate, both of which are controlled by Democrats.
There is momentum for a bill to give further aid to Israel after it was attacked by Hamas this month. And Ukraine is said to be running out of munitions, although support has dropped in Congress for continued aid to Kyiv.
President Joe Biden has asked Congress for a $105 billion package that will include aid for Ukraine and Israel.
What happened to the last speaker?
McCarthy was one of the shortest-serving speakers in US history. In order to get the job in January, he agreed to give any single Republican member the power to call for a vote to “vacate” him from the top spot.
That was his undoing. Far-right members were frustrated that McCarthy relied on Democrats to pass a short-term spending bill and avoid a government shutdown late last month.
McCarthy’s replacement will now have a month to tackle the larger problem of a yearlong spending bill before the government again faces the prospect of a funding lapse.
Does Jordan have momentum?
Jordan, the chairman of the House Judiciary, was chosen last week as the Republican nominee to be speaker. He got the support of a majority of Republicans in a secret ballot vote but not enough to become speaker. He’s lost three separate votes before the full House.
He can only afford to lose three GOP votes on the floor, but opposition to him appears to be growing, not shrinking.
Why is Jordan controversial?
A founder of the far-right Freedom Caucus, Jordan made his name as somewhat of a flamethrower on Capitol Hill. A 2020 election skeptic, Jordan was among former President Donald Trump’s most vocal defenders in Congress, fealty Trump rewarded with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in his final days in office.
That such a conservative lawmaker would be elevated to the top spot in the House speaks volumes about how the GOP has evolved in the age of Trump. Jordan earned Trump’s endorsement earlier this month when it was a two-way race with Scalise.
Jordan has also faced scrutiny over his position as assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University at the time that a team doctor, Richard Strauss, was sexually abusing male students. Some of the abused have publicly argued Jordan heard and ignored their complaints in the 1990s. The Ohio Republican has vehemently denied any wrongdoing or knowledge of the abuse. CNN reported on the issue in 2020.
Who once said Jordan was one of the ‘political terrorists’?
Jordan is among the conservative members whom one former speaker, retired Rep. John Boehner, described as “political terrorists” in his memoir.
“I just never saw a guy who spent more time tearing things apart – never building anything, never putting anything together,” Boehner told CBS News of Jordan in 2021.
Jordan told CNN’s Manu Raju he can unite the party.
“I think we are a conservative-center-right party. I think I’m the guy who can help unite that. My politics are entirely consistent with where conservatives and Republicans are across the country,” he said.
Jordan has used his position as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee to begin investigations into special counsel Jack Smith and Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who are both prosecuting Trump.
What is the math?
There are 221 Republicans and 212 Democrats in the House. Subtracting two vacant seats plus any absences from the normal total of 435 members means 217 or potentially fewer is the current threshold for a majority.
Democrats are unified behind their leader, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York.
What happens if no candidate gets a majority?
They vote again. And again. And again, until either one candidate gets a majority or there is a recess.
If this sounds familiar that’s because it took McCarthy 15 rounds of voting and multiple days to build a majority of Republicans in January.
What happens during the vote?
The clerk of the House will gavel in the chamber and call a quorum. Democrats will place Jeffries’ name into nomination, and Republicans will nominate Jordan.
Then the clerk will call the roll and each member will state the name of the person whom they are voting for. If no one amasses a majority of votes cast, it goes to a second ballot.
Are members required to vote for either Jeffries or Jordan?
There’s no rule that the speaker is a House member. Members can vote for anyone, and they can protest by skipping the vote or voting “present.” The vast majority will vote for their party’s leader.
Is there an alternative to Jordan for Republicans?
Not at the moment, but it’s important to note that Jordan is far from their first choice. All but eight Republicans had backed keeping McCarthy, but because Republicans’ majority is so small, he lost his job.
Then, Republicans nominated Scalise, the House majority leader. But Scalise was far from a universal choice, and rather than work to change the minds of his doubters by horse-trading for their votes, the Louisiana Republican withdrew his name from contention.
Anyone will face a difficult task in unifying a party that includes far-right members such as Rep. Matt Gaetz, the Florida Republican who engineered McCarthy’s ouster, as well as 18 members who represent districts that would have voted for Biden in 2020 under redrawn lines.
Will Republicans revisit the ‘motion to vacate’ rule?
It was McCarthy’s decision to give any Republican the power to call for a vote to remove the speaker at any time. There are voices in both parties who want to see that power controlled. A majority could change the rules Republicans adopted in January.
Jordan has not taken an official position but made clear the first order of business is selecting a speaker. They can revisit whether a speaker should be removed at a later date.
What about the temporary speaker option?
This makes a lot of sense to a lot of moderates. Giving McHenry power until the end of November or the end of the year would allow lawmakers to pass government funding bills and give Republicans a chance to figure out who their leader should be.
Democrats have indicated they are open to helping the plan get the majority vote it would need. But details can be difficult. Many Republicans oppose the perception of working with Democrats in a sort-of coalition government. Democrats have not entirely endorsed the plan.
It’s been 100 years
In the 200-plus years since the first two-year Congress met in 1789, such floor fights have occurred just 15 times, according to the House historian.
All but two of those multi-ballot speaker elections took place before the Civil War as the two-party system was evolving. Back then, floor fights were routine.
Until it took McCarthy 15 ballots in January, a floor fight had taken place only once since the Civil War, exactly 100 years ago, when it took nine ballots for Rep. Frederick Gillett of Massachusetts to be elected speaker in 1923.
The epic record for a floor fight
In 1855 and 1856, it took 133 separate votes for Rep. Nathaniel Banks of Massachusetts to be elected, again by a plurality and not a majority.
The process stretched over more than a month and included a sort of inquisition on the House floor of the three contenders, who answered questions about their view of the expansion of slavery. Read more from the House historian’s website.
It’s also interesting to read about Banks; his official House biography notes he was elected to office as a Republican, an independent, a member of the America Party and as a Democrat.

CNN,Analysis: How the ‘uniparty’ myth shut the House down | CNN Politics,"A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.
Republicans’ House speaker morass continued Tuesday with a little help from former President Donald Trump.
Yet another lawmaker with support from most House Republicans – Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, who was picked as their party’s nominee – failed to get the support of nearly all Republicans. He dropped out of the running Tuesday afternoon, leaving Republicans again back at square one. Late Tuesday, the GOP conference selected a fourth nominee, Rep. Mike Johnson, who faces a floor vote Wednesday.
Emmer, who supports military aid to Ukraine and who voted to certify the 2020 election, saw his chances fade in the most bizarre possible way hours after being picked.
Trump lobbied against Emmer with a social media post that hit while Emmer was trying to convince a few dozen skeptics on Capitol Hill and Trump was inside a New York courtroom facing civil fraud charges. Trump later told reporters outside the courtroom, “It looks like he’s finished.”
After one fired speaker and three failed candidates who got majority but not universal support, no one seems currently capable of uniting their tiny House majority – and the idea of getting help from Democrats remains, for now, unthinkable to both Republicans and Democrats.
A picture of parties divided
It’s a situation that highlights not only Republican divisions, but also the bright line between Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill.
But it’s important to note that it was born of a fringe protest meant to demonstrate there’s no difference at all between the two parties.
What is ‘uniparty?’
The term “uniparty” has been a favorite of people like Steve Bannon, the former Trump White House official turned podcaster. He’s been using it for years in conjunction with the similarly cynical idea of Washington as a swamp that needs to be drained or the belief in a deep state that needs to be rooted out.
Bannon’s goal is to mobilize support for dismantling the current version of the US government.
The term also features prominently in the more-conservative-than-Fox-News media environment – networks like One America News, known as OAN, and Salem Radio.
‘Guerilla war’
“Right now, we are governed by a uniparty,” Rep. Matt Gaetz, the Florida Republican, told the former Trump administration official Sebastian Gorka in a September interview on the right-wing Salem News Channel in which he argued then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy was in cahoots with President Joe Biden and the Democratic leader, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York. Gaetz posted the interview on his official House website.
“You’ve got a small band of House conservatives who are fighting, really, in a lot of ways, a political guerrilla war against that uniparty,” Gaetz said. In early October, it was Gaetz who moved to successfully oust McCarthy from the speakership.
The parties actually have very different priorities
It’s indisputable that government spending has ballooned in recent years and reasonably arguable that it is out of control. But blaming a perceived “uniparty” is oversimplified nonsense.
Republicans under Trump passed a tax cut bill all by themselves. Democrats under Biden passed a spending bill without help from Republicans.
Reforming costly programs seems impossible because the two parties rarely work together, not because they secretly collude.
If there is a uniparty, where is its speaker?
Multiple Republicans who supported McCarthy have argued Democrats are to blame for the current lack of a speaker because they did not break party ranks and support McCarthy.
There has been no substantive movement toward a unity speaker of some sort, although it is becoming hard to imagine any Republican getting enough support to become speaker without help from some Democrats.
The current math is that any Republican can lose the support of only four party comrades and become speaker without Democratic help.
Next funding deadline is November 17
Another lawmaker who voted to oust McCarthy is Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, who argued back in September that allowing the government to run out of money would not be that bad.
“Don’t let the DC uniparty scare you into thinking that a government shutdown is the end of the world,” Biggs said on social media in September, before McCarthy used Democratic votes to pass a funding bill.
This is a line of thinking that will get more attention, perhaps, when the government again faces a funding lapse November 17.
RELATED: The last time the government faced a funding lapse, just last month, CNN documented how a government shutdown could impact Americans.
Any potential speaker must find a way to both get the support of people like Gaetz and figure out how to fund the government in a little more than three weeks.
Emmer’s downfall is yet another cautionary tale. The majority of House Republicans backed Emmer, their fourth choice this year to be speaker, in both secret ballot voting and a behind-closed-doors roll call vote.
He had been working to convince holdouts when the post opposing him hit Trump’s social media account. For the fringe of the party, counts against Emmer include that he is a supporter of additional funding for Ukraine to repel Russia’s invasion. Foreign aid is a chief target of those who believe there is a uniparty.
A quarter of Americans don’t feel represented by any party
Politico noted back in 2017 that the term has roots on the American left, in the rhetoric of Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate turned Green Party presidential candidate.
While there is not much polling on the idea of a uniparty, there is a lot of polling about the two main political parties.
In a Pew Research Center survey published in September, just 10% of Americans said they saw “hardly any” difference between the parties. A larger portion of the country – 25% – does not feel either party represents the interests of people like them, but that sentiment is held by roughly equal shares of Republicans and Democrats.
Similarly, about a quarter of both Republican and Republican-leaning voters and Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters do not feel well-represented by their parties.
Interestingly, despite gripes about a uniparty by the Republican fringe, Republicans are less likely than Democrats to express an interest in more party choices, according to Pew’s survey.",24/10/2023
CNN,"Fact check: Trump, repeating the same lies, makes at least 18 false claims in Mar-a-Lago remarks | CNN Politics","Rinse and repeat.
As Election Day approaches, former President Donald Trump keeps telling the same lies at event after event – many about immigration, but many others about a variety of additional topics.
Here is a fact check of 18 false claims in his Tuesday remarks at his Mar-a-Lago club and residence in Florida. This is not intended as a comprehensive list of his false claims at the event.
Harris’ border role: Trump falsely claimed that President Joe Biden appointed Vice President Kamala Harris “as the border czar,” adding that, regardless of the term, “she was responsible for the borders, totally responsible.” Biden never made Harris “border czar,” a label the White House has always emphasized is inaccurate, and never put her in charge of border security, a responsibility of Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas. In reality, Biden gave Harris a more limited immigration-related assignment in 2021, asking her to lead diplomacy with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras in an attempt to address the conditions that prompted their citizens to try to migrate to the United States.
The people on the ICE non-detained list: Trump, referring to a list of immigrants with homicide convictions, repeated his false claim that Harris “let the more than 13,000 convicted illegal aliens – nobody would have let these people into our country.” In reality, the Department of Homeland Security and independent experts have noted that this figure is about people who entered the country over decades, including during Trump’s own administration, not just under Biden and Harris – and the figure includes people who are currently incarcerated in federal, state and local prisons and jails. You can read more here.
Migrants in Springfield, Ohio: Trump falsely claimed of Springfield, Ohio: “They dropped 32,000 illegal aliens. They tried to give them legal terminology, but – it’s not. Illegal aliens, 32,000 into a 50,000 person town, beautiful town, no problems, and now they don’t know what to do.”
This is false in more than one way. While we don’t know the immigration status of each and every Haitian immigrant in Springfield, the community is, on the whole, in the country lawfully. The Springfield city website says, “YES, Haitian immigrants are here legally, under the Immigration Parole Program. Once here, immigrants are then eligible to apply for Temporary Protected Status (TPS).” Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine wrote in a New York Times op-ed about Springfield in September that the Haitian immigrants “are there legally” and that, as a Trump-Vance supporter, he is “saddened” by the candidates’ disparagement of “the legal migrants living in Springfield.”
Second, nobody “dropped” the immigrants into Springfield; the city’s Haitian residents were not sent there by a government resettlement program. Rather, they independently decided to move to the city because of employment opportunities, affordable housing and the presence of a Haitian community, among other factors.
And while there is no official tally of the number of immigrants in Springfield, Trump’s “32,000” figure greatly exceeds local estimates. The website for the city of Springfield says there are an estimated 12,000 to 15,000 immigrants in the county that includes Springfield, where the total population is about 138,000. Chris Cook, the county’s health commissioner, said in July that his team estimated the best number was 10,000 to 12,000 Haitian residents in the county.
A gang and Aurora, Colorado: Trump falsely claimed that a gang from Venezuela has “literally taken over the town” in Aurora, Colorado, adding “they’ve taken over large sections of the town.”
The gang has members in Aurora and has caused problems in some apartment buildings, but it has not come close to taking over the city. Republican Aurora Mayor Mike Coffman said in a September joint statement, issued with the conservative chair of the city council’s public safety committee, that the gang “has not ‘taken over’ the city” and that problems with the gang “experienced at a select few properties do not apply to the city as a whole or large portions of it.” Coffman noted that the city’s police department had linked 10 people to the gang and arrested eight.
The number of migrants: Trump repeated his false claim that Harris “left 21 million aliens pour across our country,” meaning “let” rather than “left.” Through September, the country had recorded under 11 million nationwide “encounters” with migrants during the Biden administration, including millions who were rapidly expelled from the country; even adding in so-called gotaways who evaded detection, estimated by House Republicans as being roughly 2 million, there’s no way the total is “21 million.”
Foreign countries and jails: Trump repeated his false claim that foreign leaders around the world have emptied their jails to allow their criminals to migrate to the United States.
“I said, ‘I know what they’re going to do. They’re going to open up their jails and just dump them into the United States.’ And that’s what happened.” He said he was talking not just about countries near the US but “all over South America, all over the Middle East, all over Asia, all over Europe, all over Africa.”
There is no evidence for this claim. The recorded global prison population increased from October 2021 to April 2024, from at least about 10.77 million people to at least about 10.99 million people, according to the World Prison Population List compiled by experts in the United Kingdom.
“I do a daily news search to see what’s going on in prisons around the world and have seen absolutely no evidence that any country is emptying its prisons and sending them all to the US,” Helen Fair, co-author of the prison population list and research fellow at the Institute for Crime & Justice Policy Research at Birkbeck, University of London, said in June, when Trump made a similar claim.
Venezuela and jails: Trump repeated his baseless story about Venezuela in particular “emptying their jails into our country,” adding, “They’ve taken all their criminals, most of them – the rest are coming, they’re all coming – they’ve taken their drug dealers, and they’ve put them into the United States of America. Thank you very much, Kamala, appreciate it.”
There is no basis for the claim that Venezuela has somehow deliberately “put” criminals into the United States, and Trump has never corroborated the claim that it is emptying its prisons for migration purposes; experts have told CNN, PolitiFact and FactCheck.org that they know of no evidence for it.
“We have no evidence that the Venezuelan government is emptying its prisons or mental health institutions to send them outside the country, in other words, to the U.S. or any other country,” Roberto Briceño-León, founder and director of the Venezuelan Observatory of Violence, an independent organization that tracks violence in the country, said in an email to CNN in June, after Trump made similar claims.
Harris and “missing” or “dead” children: Trump falsely claimed that, under Biden and Harris, “325,000 children are missing, dead, sex slaves or slaves – 325,000 children who came in through the open border are now missing. Many of them are dead.”
Trump was grossly distorting federal statistics.
He appeared to be referring to an August report from the Homeland Security Department’s Office of Inspector General, which said ICE reported more than 32,000 unaccompanied migrant children failed to appear as scheduled for immigration court hearings after being released or transferred out of custody between fiscal years 2019 and 2023 – a period that, notably, includes two years and four months under the Trump administration. The report also said that 291,000 unaccompanied migrant children during this period were not given notices to appear in court.
The report said that ICE has “no assurances” these children “are safe from trafficking, exploitation, or forced labor.” But it did not definitively assert that any of them were being exploited – let alone that many are dead, a claim experts say is nonsense.
Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, told CNN in a message this summer: “Long story short, no, there are not 320,000 kids missing. 32,000 kids missed court. That doesn’t mean they’re missing, it means they missed court (either because their sponsor didn’t bring them or they are teenagers who didn’t want to show up). The remaining 291,000 cases mentioned by the OIG are cases where ICE hasn’t filed the paperwork to start their immigration court cases.”
FEMA and North Carolina: Trump repeated his false claim that the federal government has not responded to Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, saying, “They haven’t shown up. They’re not in North Carolina. The people of North Carolina have suffered incredibly and there’s just nobody to help them. “
This is not even close to true; the Federal Emergency Management Agency immediately responded to the disaster in North Carolina and said Friday that it had more than 1,700 staff deployed in the state. FEMA said on October 16 that it had approved more than $100 million in individual aid to North Carolina residents.
At a briefing in early October, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, said, “We’re grateful for the quick actions and close communications that we have had with the president and with the FEMA team.” State emergency management director Will Ray said at the briefing: “We’re grateful for the support not just from the 22 states that have sent teams to support us but also from our FEMA team and other members of the federal family.”
FEMA and migrants: Trump, still criticizing the hurricane response, said of FEMA: “They said that the money was spent on bringing illegal migrants into our country – they spent close to a billion dollars.”
FEMA did not spend its disaster relief money on undocumented people.
Congress appropriated the agency more than $35 billion in disaster relief funds for fiscal 2024, according to official FEMA statistics, and also gave FEMA a much smaller pool of money, $650 million in fiscal 2024, for a program aimed at helping communities shelter migrants. Contrary to Trump’s claims, these are two separate pots of funds.
Trump and the Nord Stream 2 pipeline: Trump repeated his false claim that he “ended” Russia’s Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to Germany. He did not end the project. In reality, he signed sanctions related to the pipeline into law about three years into his presidency, when the pipeline was already about 90% complete, and the state-owned Russian company behind the project announced in December 2020 that construction was resuming.
Veterans Choice: Trump revived one of the lies he told most frequently as president, falsely claiming he got the Veterans Choice program approved after others had “been trying to do this for 48 years.” The Veterans Choice program was actually signed into law in 2014 by his predecessor, President Barack Obama. Trump signed a law in 2018, the VA MISSION Act, that expanded and modified the program established under Obama.
Who pays tariffs: Trump repeated his frequent false claim that, through tariffs, “China paid us hundreds of billions of dollars.” US importers make the tariff payments, not China, and study after study has found that Americans bore the overwhelming majority of the cost of Trump’s tariffs on China.
Previous presidents and tariffs on China: Trump repeated his frequent false claim that no previous president had imposed tariffs on Chinese imports, saying, “No other president’s gotten 10 cents from China.” The US was actually generating billions per year in revenue from tariffs on Chinese imports before Trump took office; in fact, the US has had tariffs on Chinese imports since 1789. Trump’s predecessor, Obama, imposed additional tariffs on Chinese goods.
Inflation: Trump blamed Harris for causing “the worst inflation in our lifetime, maybe the worst inflation we’ve ever had, because I don’t think they’re – I mean, I know for a fact they’re not adding all of the numbers; if they did, I think it’s the worst inflation probably in our – the lifetime of the country.”
Aside from the claim about Harris’ role, it’s not true the US has had its worst inflation ever during the Biden administration or that the Bureau of Labor Statistics isn’t “adding all of the numbers”; Trump could fairly say that the US inflation rate hit a 40-year high in June 2022, when it was 9.1%, but that was not close to the all-time record of 23.7%, set in 1920. (And the rate has since plummeted. The most recent available inflation rate at the time Trump spoke here was 2.4% in September.)
The European Union and products: Trump made a subjective claim that the “European Union is taking advantage of us,” then repeated his false claim that “they don’t take our product.” While the European Union certainly has some trade barriers that make it harder for US companies to export products there, it’s a massive exaggeration to categorically declare “they don’t take our product.” The US exported more than $639 billion worth of total goods and services to the European Union in 2023.
The trade deficit with the European Union: Trump repeated another false claim about the European Union: “We have a deficit with them of over $300 billion, think of that.” The US goods and services trade deficit with the European Union was about $125 billion in 2023. Even counting goods trade alone and excluding services, the 2023 deficit was about $201 billion.
The formation of the European Union: Trump revived a false claim from his presidency, asserting that the European Union was created to take advantage of the US: “I mean, look, they united in order to take advantage of the United States. That’s why they united. That’s why they formed their coalition. And that was done to take advantage of the United States.”
Experts on the EU told CNN during Trump’s presidency that there is no basis for such claims, noting that US presidents had consistently supported European integration efforts. “The President’s claims are preposterous,” Desmond Dinan, a public policy professor at George Mason University who is an expert in the history of European integration, said during Trump’s presidency. “The European Communities (forerunner of the EU) were formed in the 1950s as part of a joint US-Western European plan to stabilize and secure Western Europe and promote prosperity, by means of trade liberalization and economic growth, throughout the shared transatlantic space.”",29/10/2024
CNN,"If you’ve been seeing more pro-Harris ads online lately, here’s why | CNN Politics","Democrats are mounting an unprecedented digital advertising campaign in the closing weeks of the presidential race, pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into a targeted effort that the party hopes will tip the balance in one of the closest elections in US history.
The effort is being steered by Future Forward PAC, or FF PAC, the largest single-candidate super PAC in the 2024 election. And the group is breaking from traditional political advertising by focusing half of its $450 million budget on digital platforms – including what it says is the largest political ad buy in YouTube history – crafting highly targeted content to capture and hold the attention of voters.
FF PAC’s approach, particularly in the campaign’s final weeks, has emphasized digital advertising aimed at non-political audiences, including younger voters, especially younger women, Black voters, Latino voters and other key demographics that Vice President Kamala Harris will need to form a winning coalition.
Super PACs are prohibited from directly coordinating with the campaigns they support. But leveraging its scale, FF PAC has produced and tested more than 1,000 unique ads, locking in on the economy and abortion as top messaging priorities. And in the closing stretch, the group is advising Democrats not to overemphasize attacks on Donald Trump’s character and fitness for office – such as recent messaging by the Harris campaign calling the former president a fascist – and remain focused on voters’ pocketbooks and reproductive rights.
The group’s staggering war chest is funded by some of the Democratic Party’s wealthiest supporters, taking advantage of loose campaign finance regulations that allow outside groups like FF PAC to raise and spend unlimited sums as they work to influence the outcome of elections.
It’s an effort that reflects some of the key dynamics at play in the 2024 race, characterized by big money, transforming media and analytics-driven campaigning. And countering Democrats is a network of Republican groups that are also breaking new ground in the American political arena.
Next week’s election will be a test for the powerhouse FF PAC and its digital investment, measuring the efficacy of some of the most cutting-edge tools and tactics available to modern campaigns.
FF PAC’s role this cycle
The Supreme Court’s 2010 decision in Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission transformed US elections, opening the floodgates to groups like FF PAC, which were allowed to accept unlimited contributions from wealthy megadonors and faced no limits on the amount they could spend influencing campaigns.
In the years since, those groups have proliferated and dominated political advertising, driving the cost of US elections to new heights. The 2024 election is poised to break the record set by the 2020 election and see $10.2 billion worth of campaign advertising, according to the ad tracking firm AdImpact.
Out of the large universe of outside groups, the Biden-Harris ticket selected FF PAC in July 2023 as its officially endorsed super PAC for the 2024 campaign. The group has taken on an unprecedented role in this year’s White House race, centralizing Democratic outside efforts in marked contrast to the balkanized network of pro-Trump outside groups.
From the start of 2023 through October 16, the end of the most recent FEC reporting period, FF PAC reported raising $394 million and spending $373 million – including $38 million before President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the race in late July. An aide with the group said its budget for the condensed general election between Harris and Trump totaled $450 million, primarily targeting seven key battleground states: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia.
The group has received a substantial portion of its funding from a Democratic dark money hub, Future Forward USA Action, which, as a nonprofit 501(c)(4) organization, faces no requirements to disclose its donors and is able to contribute huge sums to super PACs like FF PAC. Among those donors is billionaire former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who gave $50 million to the dark money network this year.
FF PAC had reported receiving $128 million from its dark money parent organization through October 16. Top-named donors to FF PAC include Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, who has given $38 million; LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, who has given more than $10 million; and Bloomberg, who has also given $19 million directly to FF PAC in publicly disclosed contributions.
The ad laboratory
With its massive war chest, FF PAC has faced the challenge of effectively and efficiently distributing its resources. Part of its response has been operating a massive advertising laboratory, at an unprecedented scale. The group has produced and tested more than 1,000 unique ads and measured their effectiveness at moving voters. And after surveying voters watching the ads, the group has honed in on messaging about the economy and abortion.
It’s a focus that the super PAC is urging Democrats to mirror as Harris delivers her closing message. An October 25 email from the FF PAC to Democrats with advice on messaging contained this cautionary note: “How effective is attacking Trump for being a fascist? This topic is not as persuasive as contrast messages featuring Harris’s economic plans, and her promise to protect reproductive rights.”
Those lines of attack – focused on Trump’s character and citing criticism from former administration officials – have featured prominently in late advertising coming from the Harris campaign, such as a spot that began airing over the weekend and included audio of Trump’s onetime chief of staff, retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, telling The New York Times that the former president “certainly falls into the general definition of a fascist.”
Appearing Monday on CNN, Harris campaign spokesperson Ian Sams responded to FF PAC’s argument, saying that “the American people are capable of processing numerous things at once, and there are a lot of people who have a lot of different concerns about the country and the future.”
As part of its strategy, FF PAC has launched waves of ads that feature the candidate discussing tax policy. The group had received positive feedback about ads that include Harris speaking, as opposed to the dramatic narrators who often accompany political spots.
Voter testimonials are another key tactic, and FF PAC has produced dozens of spots that feature voters reacting disapprovingly to clips of Trump praising his “rich as hell” donors, a sustained line of attack.
Additionally, reflecting its effort to reach key groups such as young women, FF PAC has run TikTok-style ads targeting the “MomTok” audience, touting Harris’ proposals to “cut taxes for families, up to $6,000 for your family.” (TikTok does not allow political advertisers to buy ad time on its platform.)
The super PAC’s ads have also emphasized abortion rights, a top issue for Democratic voters that is contributing to a yawning political gender divide. Many of those ads feature women and medical professionals warning against abortion restrictions and criticizing Trump, who appointed three of the five Supreme Court justices who voted with the majority to overturn Roe v. Wade.
A digital focus
Amid a transformed media landscape in 2024, TV advertising still draws the most dollars. Out of nearly $2.9 billion spent on advertising for the presidential race since the start of 2023, more than $2.2 billion has gone toward TV ads, according to data from AdImpact. FF PAC is spending hundreds of millions on TV, too, but it’s on digital platforms that the group hopes to make its mark.
“Our program has been about reaching voters where they are and on the screens they use,” Margit Westerman, FF PAC’s digital director, said in a statement. “That means a surround-sound approach where people see it while watching their favorite streaming show, looking at the latest YouTube clip and visiting their go-to website. We spent months understanding where people were and we’ve found the content that is persuasive as long as we make sure people see it.”
That includes a $44 million YouTube buy, targeting an audience that skews young and diverse. And the campaign has targeted high-profile live events, beginning with the Olympics late this summer and including the NFL’s “Sunday Ticket” through Election Day.
FF PAC has also bought ad time on popular gaming platforms such as Unity and Frameplay, targeting younger male voters, a key area of concern for the Harris campaign. And straining to reach screens, FF PAC also bought ad time on premium streaming TV platforms, including Hulu, Disney, Peacock, WB/Discovery/Max, and Univision. (Warner Bros./Discovery is the parent company of CNN.)
The group estimates it has delivered 3.71 billion high-quality video impressions so far. And it has done so by paying a premium: Many of FF PAC’s 30-second TV ads have 15- and 6-second versions designed for digital platforms’ unskippable slots.
On traditional TV too, FF PAC has been creative with its resources, spending millions on national ad buys that – while airing everywhere – still represent a cheaper way to reach swing states than buying ad time from local stations getting slammed in the race’s final sprint.
GOP countereffort
FF PAC’s commitment to digital advertising has enabled the group to blitz its Republican counterparts on leading platforms during the final weeks of the race.
In the first week of October, FF PAC spent $6.7 million advertising on Google and its affiliated platforms, including YouTube, while the leading pro-Trump advertiser spent about $1.5 million. The following week, FF PAC ramped its spending up to nearly $9 million, while the leading pro-Trump advertiser spent about $1.2 million. During the third week of October, FF PAC spent $10.5 million, while the largest pro-Trump advertiser spent about $2 million; and during the fourth week, FF PAC led with $12.3 million on Google platforms, while the top GOP advertiser spent $3.5 million.
While FF PAC has a singular role as the leading pro-Harris super PAC, Republicans have taken a divergent approach, deploying a network of large super PACs that each take on a share of the pro-Trump messaging.
Five of the largest groups – MAGA Inc., Preserve America, America PAC, Restoration PAC and Right For America PAC – have combined to raise $718 million and spend $709 million from the beginning of 2023 through mid-October. The largest, MAGA Inc., reported spending about $113 million before Trump had secured the GOP presidential nomination.
Each group has devoted a share of its spending to digital advertising, but FF PAC had exceeded their combined spending on Google platforms through October 27, $37.7 million to $11.4 million. On Facebook over the past 30 days, those pro-Trump groups collectively led FF PAC, about $4.8 million to $2.3 million (including about $700,000 in ad spending from a MAGA Inc. merchandise site).
One of the pro-Trump groups, America PAC, has received nearly $120 million from Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, and it has also taken an iconoclastic approach to its spending – though its efforts have differed from FF PAC’s.
Musk’s group has probed the limits of weakening campaign finance enforcement – including daily giveaways of $1 million that have drawn scrutiny from the Department of Justice and are the target of a civil lawsuit from the Philadelphia district attorney. America PAC is also engaged in an unprecedented on-the-ground effort, devoting more than $70 million to canvassing and field operations in battleground states, a huge lift for the Trump campaign.
Part of that is out of necessity – the former president’s campaign has been dramatically outraised by Harris’ team, leaving the Democratic nominee with significantly more campaign cash to spend on staff, door-knocking, phone banking and other turnout efforts.
FF PAC has not engaged in a comparable turnout effort, leaving that traditional campaign activity to the cash-flush Harris operation. But the super PAC is betting that its innovative and unprecedented digital advertising program will help Harris close what’s shaping up to be one of the closest elections in the country’s history.
CLARIFICATION: This story has been clarified to reflect that FF PAC’s TikTok-style ads do not run on the platform because it does not allow political ads.",30/10/2024
CNN,Analysis: Trump unveils the most extreme closing argument in modern presidential history | CNN Politics,"Donald Trump anchored his bid to win a second White House term next week on searing anti-migrant fear at a rally at Madison Square Garden, doubling down on his promise for a massive deportation program on Day 1 to reverse an “immigrant invasion.”
As the ex-president’s allies defend him against Democratic claims he is a “fascist” and an authoritarian in waiting, based in part on warnings by his ex-chief of staff John Kelly, Trump on Sunday delivered a screed that may augur the most extreme presidency in modern history if he beats Democratic nominee Kamala Harris on November 5.
“The United States is an occupied country,” Trump said, as Democrats projected messages on the exterior of the storied New York City arena, reading “Trump is Unhinged” and “Trump praised Hitler.”
The huge rally was billed as the launch of the final stage of Trump’s bid to pull off one of the greatest comebacks in American political history after trying to overturn the result of the last election and leaving office in disgrace in 2021. Before he spoke, some of the ex-president’s top supporters flung race-based and vulgar rhetoric. Former congressional candidate David Rem called Harris the “antichrist” and “the devil,” while others lashed out at Hillary Clinton, “illegals” and homeless people. Comedian Tony Hinchcliffe called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage.”
The Trump campaign later disavowed the line, with spokesperson Danielle Alvarez saying in a statement to CNN, “This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign.”
Much of Trump’s speech brimmed with falsehoods and exaggerations. It was exactly the kind of rhetoric that the Harris campaign believes could prompt moderate voters and disaffected Republicans to choose the vice president. But it also represents a bet from the Republican nominee that he can drive out a huge base turnout and activate voters who don’t normally cast ballots but who agree with his hardline politics.
If nothing else, it clarified the choice that voters face in the coming days, as Harris promises Americans they can move on from Trump’s extreme behavior that tested the rule of law and constitutional constraints on presidents during his first term.
The ex-president’s blistering anti-migrant rhetoric ranks alongside the most flagrant demagoguery by a major figure in any Western nation since World War II. But it was also complemented by a sharp economic argument that represented the second leg of Trump’s closing pitch and targeted the frustration of many Americans who are struggling with high grocery prices despite cooling inflation.
“I’d like to begin by asking a very simple question: Are you better off now than you were four years ago?” Trump asked. “I’m here today with a message of hope for all Americans: With your vote in this election, I will end inflation. I will stop the invasion of criminals coming into our country, and I will bring back the American dream.” He also said he would push for a tax credit for “family caregivers who take care of a parent or a loved one” – after Harris unveiled her own platform proposing that Medicare cover home health care.
“If Kamala Harris gets four more years, our economy can never recover. If I win, we will quickly build the greatest economy in the history of world,” he said.
The former president rooted his first presidential campaign in 2016 on inflammatory rhetoric about Mexican migrants. Eight years later, he is suggesting that migrants are directly to blame for citizens’ economic frustrations, in a conceit that has been used by far-right leaders throughout history.
A nation on edge
Trump’s dark appearance cranked up the palpable sense of tension blanketing the country a week before an election that may represent a national turning point. Supporters of each candidate harbor a sense of dread about what happens if their nominee loses, in a showdown that has highlighted two irreconcilable visions of the future — and what it means to be an American. The warnings from Trump that he envisages a presidency of all but unchecked power dedicated to “retribution” are bolstering a sense that a fateful moment is at hand.
Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz drew an allusion between Trump’s downtown Manhattan rally and a notorious 1939 pro-Nazi gathering at the previous arena on the same site, as Democrats now openly brand the ex-president as a “fascist.” The Minnesota governor said: “There’s a direct parallel to a big rally that happened in the mid-1930s at Madison Square Garden … and don’t think that he doesn’t know for one second exactly what they’re doing there.”
Sunday’s raucous event underscored how the 2024 presidential election is breaking the mold, since Trump is unlikely to be competitive in the state of New York next week. But the ex-president’s homecoming to a city where he built skyscrapers to reflect his outsize persona showed how candidates have sought headlines far from battleground states. Harris was in red-state Texas on Friday to highlight hardline GOP abortion policies she warns could spread countrywide if Trump wins. And on Tuesday, she’s holding an event in Washington, DC.
Both candidates are plunging into the final week of the campaign with polls showing a tied-up race in the swing states and nationally. The election is already underway, with 40 million Americans having voted early in person or by mail. The CNN Poll of Polls shows no clear leader nationally with Harris at 48% and Trump at 47%. The race will be decided across battlegrounds including the “blue wall” states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, as well as the Sun Belt states of North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada. The result could hinge on mere tens of thousands of votes, potentially setting the stage for tense counts over several days that will only fuel fears of a disputed election.
Harris plans her own closing argument — for a symbolic spot on Tuesday
Early voting explains why Harris will make her closing argument a full week ahead of Election Day, with a rally Tuesday evening on the Ellipse in Washington. The symbolism will be acute since it’s the site of Trump’s infamous gathering on January 6, 2021, when he told his crowd to “fight like hell” or they wouldn’t have a country before his mob smashed into the US Capitol to try to subvert the certification of President Joe Biden’s election victory. Harris’ rally will provide an emphatic exclamation point for an increasingly important theme of her campaign — that Trump represents an existential threat to American democracy.
That message was at the center of Biden’s campaign until he folded his reelection bid in July. Harris didn’t prioritize the same theme initially, but she’s increasingly warming to it. But some Democrats worry that the American people are more interested in how she can quickly improve their economic circumstances. “How effective is attacking Trump for being a fascist? This topic is not as persuasive as contrast messages featuring Harris’s economic plans, and her promise to protect reproductive rights,” read an October 25 email from Future Forward, the top super PAC supporting the Harris campaign, sent to Democrats that was first reported by The New York Times and obtained by CNN on Sunday.
Trump has in recent days played into claims by Democrats and Kelly that he is an aspiring authoritarian.
That left GOP vice presidential nominee, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, seeking to cherry-pick and redefine the ex-president’s on-the-record comments and blaming the media for reporting exactly what his boss has said. Vance insisted in a fiery interview with CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union” on Sunday that ex-president had not been referring to political opponents when he openly considered turning the military and the National Guard on the “enemy from within.” Trump, however, had however previously clarified he was talking about people such as former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and California Rep. Adam Schiff.
“He said that he wanted to use the military to go after far-left lunatics who are rioting, and … he also called them ‘the enemy within.’ He separately, in a totally different context, in a totally different conversation, said that Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff were threats to this country,” Vance said.
Both Trump and Harris are targeting strategic sectors of their core electorates in the final days. Harris, for instance, on Sunday made a fresh attempt to win over Black male voters, some of whom seem to be moving toward Trump. At a barber shop in West Philadelphia, an area where she needs big turnout to counter Trump’s advantage in rural Pennsylvania, the vice president took part in a discussion with Black men focused on providing better opportunities. And she underscored the vital nature of the commonwealth and its 19 electoral votes — which could block her path to the White House if it goes for Trump, as it did during his 2016 election triumph.
“We’re going to do it — victory runs through Philly and it runs through Pennsylvania,” Harris said.
The vice president is also targeting another constituency that could help her to the White House — women voters, as she tries to harness the already significant gender gap to her advantage. She appeared in Michigan on Saturday with Michelle Obama — a reluctant political figure who nevertheless is hugely popular among Democrats. In a powerful speech, the former first lady did not just appeal to women, but to the “the men who love us” — warning that Trump’s history of building the conservative Supreme Court that overturned the federal right to an abortion would have grave implications for women’s health.
“Please, please do not hand our fates over to the likes of Trump, who knows nothing about us, who has shown deep contempt for us,” Obama said. “Because a vote for him is a vote against us, against our health, against our worth.”",28/10/2024
CNN,Sen. Bob Menendez pleads not guilty to charge alleging he conspired to act as a foreign agent of Egypt | CNN Politics,"Sen. Bob Menendez pleaded not guilty in federal court Monday to a charge alleging he conspired to act as a foreign agent of Egypt.
The New Jersey Democrat personally entered his plea before district Judge Sidney H. Stein.
Menendez, his wife Nadine Arslanian Menendez, and three other co-defendants were indicted last month on corruption-related offenses and are accused of accepting “hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes” in exchange for the senator’s influence. Menendez and the others pleaded not guilty to those charges. A trial date has been set for May.
In a statement released by his office after his arraignment, Menendez dismissed the charge “as outrageous as it is absurd.”
“I have been, throughout my life, loyal to only one country — the United States of America, the land my family chose to live in democracy and freedom,” he said, adding later: “I will not litigate this case through the press, but have made it abundantly clear that I have done nothing wrong and once all the facts are presented will be found innocent.”
The additional charge unveiled early this month in a superseding indictment filed against Menendez, who was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at the time of the alleged actions, adds a new dimension to the case by alleging a US senator was working on behalf of another country.
Prosecutors allege Nadine Menendez and businessman Wael Hana failed to register as agents working on behalf of Egypt and conspired to have the senator act on behalf of Egypt. Nadine Menendez and Hana both pleaded not guilty to the superseding indictment last week.
Menendez stepped down as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee last month when he was initially charged but has rejected calls to resign as New Jersey’s senior senator.
It is illegal for a member of Congress or any public official to act as foreign agent.
The senator stressed his loyalty to the US in a statement earlier this month, arguing that the new charge goes against his “long record of standing up for human rights and democracy in Egypt and in challenging leaders of that country.”
The new charge carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. Menendez and his wife are now facing as much as 50 years in prison if convicted.

CNN,Biden seeks to clean up ‘garbage’ comment about Trump supporters denigrating Latinos | CNN Politics,"President Joe Biden on Tuesday tried to clean up comments he made earlier that sparked immediate backlash from many who interpreted them as referring to supporters of former President Donald Trump as “garbage.”
Speaking during a Voto Latino get out-the-vote call, Biden — in reaction to Trump’s offensive rally at Madison Square Garden on Sunday — said, “And just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico ‘a floating island of garbage.’ Well, let me tell you something … I don’t know the Puerto Rican that I know… or Puerto Rico where I’m – in my home state of Delaware – they’re good, decent, honorable people.”
“The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters,” Biden said, pausing for a moment before continuing. “His, his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable and it’s un-American. It’s totally contrary to everything we’ve done, everything we’ve been.”
Biden’s comments drew swift backlash online, with Republicans immediately connecting them to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 remark that half of Trump’s supporters were “deplorables.” Biden’s remarks came just as Vice President Kamala Harris was set to take the stage for a major rally in Washington, DC.
“Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage—which is the only word I can think of to describe it,” Biden posted on X later that evening. “His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation.”
When CNN asked for an explanation on the president’s comments, a White House spokesperson insisted that Biden had meant “supporter’s” rather than “supporters,” arguing that he had actually said this: “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter’s – his – his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American.”
“The President referred to the hateful rhetoric at the Madison Square Garden rally as garbage,” White House spokesman Andrew Bates said.
Trump was informed of Biden’s remarks during his rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania, when Florida Sen. Marco Rubio ran on stage, saying, “You might not have heard this. Just moments ago. Joe Biden stated that our supporters are garbage.”
Trump said, “Wow. That’s terrible. That’s what it says. That’s what it says. So you have, remember Hillary, she said ‘deplorable’ and then she said irredeemable, right? But she said deplorable, that didn’t work out. Garbage I think is worse, right?”
His campaign soon blasted out a fundraising email using Biden’s comments, with the subject line, “You are not garbage! I love you! You are the best our nation has to offer.”
And Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt responded in a statement claiming that Biden and Harris “despise the tens of millions of Americans who support him,” while Trump “will be a president for ALL Americans.”
Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance also seized on Biden’s comments. “This is disgusting. Kamala Harris and her boss Joe Biden are attacking half of the country. There’s no excuse for this. I hope Americans reject it,” the Ohio senator posted on X.
As CNN reported earlier Tuesday, Biden’s role in the final weeks of the election has been moved even further out of the spotlight as recent campaign trail gaffes prompted a range of responses – from eyerolls to outright anger – from some Harris campaign aides.
Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro — an ally of Harris — said he hadn’t heard Biden’s comments until asked to respond by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on “The Source,” but he added, “I would never insult the good people of Pennsylvania or any Americans even if they chose to support a candidate that I didn’t support.”
Responding to the White House’s attempt to explain the remarks, Shapiro said, “I think President Biden will decide what he wants to say. It’s certainly not words that I would choose, and I think it’s important that we remain focused on the contrast between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump and not attacking supporters of either candidate.”
On Tuesday’s call, Biden also criticized Trump’s character when trying to make the case for Harris.
“Donald Trump has no character, he doesn’t give a damn about the Latino community. He’s a failed businessman and he only cares about the billionaire friends he has,” Biden said, calling the former president “a true danger.”
“He’s a true danger, to not just Latinos, but to all people, particularly those who are in a minority in this country. You know, we have to vote to elect Kamala as president. Tim Walz as vice president. It’s never been more important,” Biden said.
In the days since his New York City rally, Trump’s campaign has tried to distance itself from comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who who made the remark about Puerto Rico. Hinchcliffe, like the other speakers, was an invited guest. “This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign,” Trump campaign spokesperson Danielle Alvarez said in a statement Sunday.
But the vulgar and racist rhetoric at the rally has prompted finger-pointing within the former president’s inner circle and deep concern that his message was once again eclipsed by controversy.

CNN,CNN Polls: Harris and Trump locked in close races in Arizona and Nevada as pool of persuadable voters shrinks | CNN Politics,"In the critical Southwest battlegrounds of Arizona and Nevada, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump run near even in the race for the White House, according to new CNN polls conducted by SSRS. The findings come as large numbers of voters report having already cast ballots and the pool of those open to changing their mind shrinks.
Harris holds 48% support among likely voters in Arizona, according to the poll, to 47% for Trump. In Nevada, 48% of likely voters support Trump and 47% back Harris. Those 1-point margins fall within each poll’s margin of sampling error, finding no clear leader in either state.
The surveys find voters’ views largely set on who would better handle top issues, while on a range of key attributes, neither candidate has convinced a critical mass of voters that they’re the better choice. Voters in both states have at best a narrow preference for which candidate cares more about people like them, shares their vision of the country or would put the country’s interests above their own self-interest.
The Nevada poll suggests little change in the state of the race there since late August, but in Arizona, the new results point to a shift in Harris’ favor. The new poll finds Harris improving there with core Democratic constituencies such as women, Latino voters and younger voters. The shift is notably concentrated among women, who now break for Harris by 16 points, while men continue to favor Trump by a 14-point margin.
Harris’ edge with women is a bit tighter in Nevada (51% support her, 46% Trump). That closer margin is largely driven by the relative lack of a gender gap among White likely voters in the state: Trump has a 15-point lead over Harris among White men (56% to 41%) and a 12-point lead among White women (54% to 42%).
Hispanic likely voters in Nevada split about evenly between Harris and Trump (48% support Harris, 47% Trump). Harris does hold a wide lead there among voters younger than 35, though: 53% support her versus 39% for Trump.
Independent voters in both states split roughly evenly between Harris and Trump. In Arizona, 45% support Trump to 43% for Harris, a 6-point improvement in support for the vice president since August. In Nevada, independent likely voters divide 46% Harris to 43% Trump, about the same as in August.
The Democratic nominees for US Senate in each state appear to have the upper hand. In Arizona, Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego bests Republican Kari Lake 51% to 43% among likely voters in the race to succeed retiring independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, and in Nevada, Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen leads in her reelection bid against Republican challenger Sam Brown 50% to 41% among likely voters.
Further down the ballot, a vote in Arizona to establish a fundamental right to an abortion in the state’s constitution has broad support: 60% of likely voters say they would vote in favor of it, and just 39% would oppose it.
Both states have robust early and mail-in ballot voting, and according to the poll, 55% of likely voters in Arizona and 42% in Nevada say they have already voted. In both states, more registered Republicans have cast ballots so far than registered Democrats. In Arizona, that still translates into a Harris advantage among those banked votes (53% of those who say they already voted support her compared with 44% for Trump), but in Nevada, those who’ve already voted tilt in the former president’s favor (52% Trump to 46% Harris).
Though both candidates are making late campaign stops across Arizona and Nevada, more than 9 in 10 likely voters in both states say they have already made up their minds about who they’ll support. In both states, 92% say they are locked in, with 8% potentially persuadable.
Likely voters in Arizona and Nevada are closely divided when asked to weigh the importance of the candidates’ stances on the issues against their leadership traits and approach to the presidency, with just over half prioritizing issue positions (53% in Nevada, 52% in Arizona), and just under half leadership traits (47% in Nevada, 48% in Arizona).
Harris supporters across both states largely say leadership traits are more important (55% in Nevada, 54% in Arizona), while most Trump backers (59% in Nevada, 58% in Arizona) say they prioritize the candidates’ stands on the issues that matter.
In both states, the polls find now-familiar divides on which issues each candidate is more trusted to handle, echoing trends that have been largely consistent in national and state polling throughout the fall. Likely voters trust Trump over Harris to handle immigration (by a 14-point margin in Arizona and 15 points in Nevada), the economy (by 11 points in Arizona, 9 points in Nevada) and foreign policy (by 8 points in Arizona, 7 points in Nevada). Harris is more trusted on abortion and reproductive rights in both states (by 16 points in Arizona, and 21 points in Nevada) and also holds a 5-point edge in Arizona on protecting democracy, with Nevada voters about evenly split (46% trust Harris, 45% Trump).
In Arizona, likely voters are split over which candidate cares more about people like them (45% say Harris does, 41% Trump). But the vice president has the advantage as more honest and trustworthy than Trump, 44% to 35%, and, by a narrow margin, on putting the country’s interests above her own (46% say Harris, 41% Trump). The former president holds narrow leads on bringing the change the country needs (45% Trump, 40% Harris) and sharing voters’ vision of the country (44% Trump, 39% Harris).
In Nevada, likely voters give Harris the advantage on honesty (44% to 36%) and caring about people like them (46% to 40%), and call Trump more likely to bring needed change (47% to 41%). They’re about evenly split on which candidate would put the country’s interests ahead of their own (46% say Harris, 44% Trump) and on who shares their vision (44% each).
Roughly one-fifth of voters in each state say that neither Harris nor Trump can be described as honest and trustworthy, higher than the shares who reject both candidates on any other issue or personal trait.
In both states, confidence that ballots will be accurately cast and counted has grown since late August. Roughly 8 in 10 likely voters in Nevada (81%, up 10 points since August) and three-quarters in Arizona (76%, up 8 points) say they are at least somewhat confident that ballot casting and counting will be done accurately. That increase comes more from Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (up 19 points in Nevada, 12 points in Arizona) than from Democrats and Democratic leaners.
Despite those increases, Republicans and Republican leaners remain far less trusting of the ballot process than are Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents in both states. In Arizona, 69% of Democratic-aligned likely voters say they are very confident in the system, but that drops to 21% among Republican-aligned voters. The gap is even wider in Nevada, where 71% of Democratic-leaning likely voters are very confident compared with 16% of Republican-aligned likely voters.
Interviews were conducted October 21-26, 2024, online and by telephone with registered voters, including 781 voters in Arizona and 683 in Nevada. Likely voters include all registered voters in the poll weighted for their predicted likelihood of voting in this year’s election. Results among likely voters in Arizona have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points; it is 4.6 points among likely voters in Nevada.",29/10/2024
CNN,Fact check: Trump revives his lie that schools are secretly sending children for gender-affirming surgeries | CNN Politics,"Former President Donald Trump continues to repeat his lie that US schools are sending children for gender-affirming surgeries without their parents’ consent — even though his own presidential campaign could not find a single example of this having happened.
Trump debuted the tale in late August. It was debunked by CNN and others in early September. But Trump, whose campaign has spent tens of millions of dollars on late-campaign attack ads related to transgender people, has revived the story in October as Election Day draws near.
Trump made the claim again last week while discussing education policy during a New York City barbershop discussion filmed by Fox News: “No transgender, no operations — you know, they take your kid — there are some places, your boy leaves for school, comes back a girl. Okay? Without parental consent.” He added, “At first, when I was told that was actually happening, I said, you know, it’s an exaggeration. No: it happens. It happens. There are areas where it happens.”
Trump didn’t name these supposed “areas.” But he made the claim once more during his Friday interview with prominent podcast host Joe Rogan: “Who would want to have — there’s so many — the transgender operations: where they’re allowed to take your child when he goes to school and turn him into a male — to a female — without parental consent.”
Facts First: Trump’s claim remains false. There is no evidence that schools in any part of the United States have sent children for gender-affirming surgeries without their parents’ approval, or performed unapproved gender-affirming surgeries on site; none of that is “allowed” anywhere in the country. Even in the states where gender-affirming surgery is legal for people under age 18, parental consent is required before a minor can undergo such a procedure.
Trump’s campaign and four conservative groups contacted by CNN in September about Trump’s claim were unable to find any evidence for it. Experts on health care for transgender people said the situation Trump described simply does not happen in this country.
Landon Hughes, a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and a co-author of a recent study on the prevalence of gender-affirming surgery in the US, said in a September email: “There are no instances of children receiving surgeries or access to surgeries from their schools.” Hughes added: “No provider in the US would perform surgery on a minor under the direction of a school, let alone without parental consent.”
“Of course everything in this statement is false,” Dr. Meredithe McNamara, an adolescent medicine physician at the Yale School of Medicine, said in a September email. “Of course surgery of any kind happens in a qualified medical center and not in a school. Of course parents are the medical decision-makers for their kids, especially when it comes to gender-affirming care.”
For minors, parental consent is also required in the US for non-surgical gender-affirming medical treatments such as puberty blockers and hormone therapy. Various guidelines and standards for medical care of transgender adolescents from entities including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health explain that parental consent is needed.
“Any gender-affirming medical care or surgical care would legally require the consent of (both) parents/legal guardians and assent of an adolescent under 18,” Dr. Laura Taylor, medical director of the gender-affirming care program at the University of Southern California, said in a September email. “This includes puberty blockers, hormones, and surgery.”
There are no definitive national figures on the number of minors who receive gender-affirming surgeries, which include breast or chest procedures, often called “top surgery,” and genital reconstructive procedures, often called “bottom surgery.” But the limited available data makes it clear that the vast majority of such surgeries occur among adults.
Taylor outlined a lengthy process before a minor might undergo a gender-affirming surgery.
“In adolescents, the decision to start hormones and/or have surgery would happen after consultation with an interdisciplinary team for a psychosocial assessment,” she said, the bold type hers. “The assessment includes understanding the dysphoria related to gender incongruence (the distress caused by the physical characteristics that do not match the person’s identity), how long it has been present, excluding other reasons to account for the dysphoria, and making sure the adolescent and family can provide informed consent.”
Asked in September for any evidence for Trump’s claim that schools are secretly obtaining gender-affirming surgeries for children, Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt provided none. Instead, she sent a series of articles on the broader debate over how schools handle gender identity issues.",26/10/2024
CNN,Maps and charts: Tracking the early votes in key states and how it compares to 2020 | CNN Politics,"CNN is monitoring who is casting pre-election ballots in the 36 states that offer early voting, as well as how early voting numbers compare with four years ago, when pre-election voting reached historic levels during the Covid-19 pandemic.
This page, updated daily, draws on data from Catalist, election officials and Edison Research.
Democrats held a wide advantage over Republicans in early voting four years ago, but the gap could be narrower this time as top Republican officials urge supporters to embrace voting before Election Day on November 5.
Voters register by party in four of the seven president battlegrounds and in each of those four, Democrats have cast a smaller share of pre-election ballots this year than at this point in 2020. Registration data by party is not available for the battleground states of Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin.
The overall downtick in interest in early voting so far shouldn’t be surprising.
The 2020 election featured historic levels of pre-election voting during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some voters were wary to vote in-person with guidelines from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention recommending social distancing. Four years later, with the country out of the pandemic, more voters could be heading back to the ballot box for in-person voting either before or on Election Day.
Another measure evident in the data so far is that older voters have made up a larger share of people casting ballots in battleground states, compared with this point in 2020.
The data also show early voting trends by racial and ethnic groups, offering clues about the makeup of the electorate. In some battleground states, a greater share of White voters have cast pre-election ballots than at this point in 2020.

CNN,Liz Cheney ties House GOP chaos to Trump’s behavior | CNN Politics,"Republican former Rep. Liz Cheney on Sunday tied the “dangerous” House GOP chaos to former President Donald Trump’s behavior and the Republicans supporting him.
“I wish that it were surprising. You know, what we’ve seen is a result of really the leadership decisions that Kevin McCarthy made back after the 2020 election and certainly after January 6. And, you know, looking the other way in the face of the kind of assault on our democracy that we’ve seen from Donald Trump and his allies in the House,” Cheney told CNN’s Jake Tapper on “State of the Union.”
Her comments come amid the House GOP’s high-stakes speakership battle after McCarthy was ousted more than two weeks ago. Rep. Jim Jordan on Friday became the latest to exit the race, prompting a crowded candidate field to seek the speakership.
Frustrations and divisions have only intensified within the conference as Republicans search for a way to resolve the impasse. That, along with the GOP’s narrow majority, has made it increasingly unclear whether any candidate will be able to secure the 217 votes needed to win the gavel on the House floor.
Cheney, who was one of Trump’s strongest critics in Congress, said Sunday she has also “been watching the extent to which political violence and the threats of violence have now reared their head once again. Those have become part of our politics in a way that certainly they never should.”
Several Republicans who opposed Jordan’s House speakership bid said they experienced angry calls, menacing messages and even death threats since casting their votes.
“Now, that kind of acceptance of violence is completely inappropriate and dangerous in our politics. So, I – we need people who are serious and who recognize and understand the dangers that we’re facing globally, as well as from Donald Trump and those who support him,” she said.
Trump, Cheney added, “is the single most dangerous threat we face” as a nation.
“He cannot be the next president. If he is, all of the things that he attempted to do but was stopped from doing by responsible people around him at the Department of Justice, at the White House Counsel’s office, he will do. There will be no guardrails and everyone has been warned.”

CNN,How voter purge disputes have fueled the GOP ‘narrative’ of noncitizen voting | CNN Politics,"The letter that Jona Hilario, a mother of two in Columbus, received this summer from the Ohio secretary of state’s office came as a surprise. It warned she could face a potential felony charge if she voted because, although she’s a registered voter, documents at the state’s motor vehicle department indicated she was not a US citizen.
But Hilario – who immigrated to the US from the Philippines two decades ago and now works to empower Asian and Pacific Islanders in her community – was naturalized in 2022; she just had not renewed her driver’s license since 2021. So, she had to submit proof of her citizenship to remain on the voter rolls ahead of the November election.
“You feel like a second-class citizen,” Hilario told CNN in an interview. “It makes me really just upset and angry. I became a citizen because I wanted to be able to have a voice in this process.”
The episode underscores the perils of a wide-ranging campaign by Republican officials and conservative groups to highlight voting by noncitizens – a problem that voting experts say is virtually nonexistent. The debate is raging from Ohio to Texas, and the US Supreme Court could rule as soon as Tuesday on a legal battle in Virginia over an eleventh-hour effort by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin to remove nearly 1,600 suspected noncitizens from the rolls ahead of next week’s election.
This issue is certain to transcend this year’s presidential contest. Next week, voters in eight states – including the presidential battlegrounds of Wisconsin and North Carolina – will decide whether to add language reaffirming citizen-only voting to their state constitutions. Twelve states have citizen-only voting laws on their books, according to Americans for Citizen Voting, which is pushing the constitutional amendments.
Republican officials around the country claim they have uncovered thousands of noncitizens on voter rolls and are filing new lawsuits alleging the Biden administration is withholding key information that allows them to verify that only US citizens are casting ballots.
But those claims have not always stood up to scrutiny, and eligible voters – including naturalized citizens such as Hilario – have often been found among those identified by Republicans as suspected noncitizens. Two thousand people had their registrations reactivated by Alabama officials from an initial August purge list of 3,200 suspected noncitizens after further investigation confirmed their citizenship – and that was before a court order reversing the purge program.
Voting rights activists who sued over Virginia’s purge program said that within a day of getting their hands on the list of removed voters, they were able to confirm that 18 of them were in fact citizens.
Courts in those cases, which were brought by the Biden administration and outside groups, blocked those programs because of a federal law that prohibits “systematic” purges too close to an election.
That hasn’t stopped former President Donald Trump and his allies from accusing a “weaponized” Justice Department of trying to let noncitizens vote.
Cases of noncitizens actually voting – which is a crime for federal elections – are extremely rare. A recent Georgia audit of the 8.2 million voters on its rolls found just 20 noncitizens who were registered to vote in the state – and that only nine of them had actually cast ballots.
“None of the issues that any of these states are raising are new because they are not actually trying to do anything to improve the accuracy of their voting rolls,” said Jonathan Diaz, director of voting advocacy and partnerships at the Campaign Legal Center, which has represented voters in the Alabama and Virginia cases.
Rather, Diaz argued, the recent flurry of activity in Republican-led states is “about setting up a scapegoat to point at if their candidates lose, and it’s about drumming up fear among the American people about whether or not our elections are secure.”
Ohio controversies
In Ohio – home to a hotly contested US Senate race – uproar has erupted over efforts by the state’s Republican secretary of state, Frank LaRose, to identify potential noncitizens on the voter rolls.
Naturalized citizens often get caught up in purges relying on state records or federal government databases because those can be outdated and not reflect a person’s current citizenship status.
LaRose, however, blames the federal government for not giving state officials access to data that he says he needs to definitively determine whether noncitizens are on the rolls. He recently sued the Biden administration over what he characterizes is a lack of assistance in vetting voters. Florida and Texas have filed similar lawsuits.
LaRose told CNN his office has identified more than 700 noncitizens on the rolls out of 8 million registered voters in the state and has directed local boards to remove them and, in some cases, referred them to the state attorney general for prosecution.
LaRose also has forged ahead with another controversial move: requiring suspected noncitizens to provide proof of citizenship at the polls before they are allowed to cast regular ballots – despite a 2006 federal court ruling that deemed that requirement unconstitutional.
Early voting already has begun in the state, and the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio and other groups have gone to court, seeking to block LaRose’s new requirement.
Asked about the conflict with the 2006 ruling, LaRose said a citizen-only voting amendment to the state constitution approved by Ohioans in 2022 compels him to act. “I have the duty to make sure only citizens register to vote,” he said.
Noting that laws enacted since 2006 also mandate photo ID to vote, he said that requiring the presentation of naturalization papers will resolve a quandary for poll workers who are presented with drivers’ licenses from voters that state they were noncitizens at some point.
Kayla Griffin Green, the Ohio state director of the voting rights group All Voting is Local, said her organization has been trying to gain access to the lists of voters flagged as potential noncitizens by the Ohio secretary of state and has alerted the US Justice Department to its concerns about LaRose’s recent moves. She said federal officials have begun making inquiries.
A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment Monday.
Griffin Green said she fears “this narrative that we have noncitizens on the rolls is allowing people to start calling into question whether the vote is accurate before we even get to Election Day.”
Scrutiny of purge claims
When courts or outside groups have examined claims that Republicans have found thousands of noncitizens on the voter rolls, those sweeping numbers have not always held up.
An investigation by ProPublica, the Texas Tribune and Votebeat into Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s claim that 6,500 noncitizens had been removed from the state’s rolls found that number to be likely inflated. The Texas secretary of state’s office had given the governor a much smaller number of people – 581 – who had been identified as likely noncitizens, according to the report, and the thousands others who were cited by Abbott were people who did not respond to letters questioning their citizenship. The outlets were able to confirm the citizenship of at least nine of those removed, having attempted to contact 70 of them.
In Alabama, the pre-election purge program was relying in part on state Department of Labor forms where a person checked a box indicating his or her citizenship status. Additional inquiry found that 93.8% of those whose form indicated noncitizenship had documents in government files confirming their citizenship, illustrating that confusing form design can cause people to make paperwork mistakes.
Six hundred of the 1,600 people Virginia had tagged for removal under its now-blocked purge program were flagged for checking the noncitizenship box on a DMV form there.
In both cases, federal judges ordered the reinstatement of anyone removed during the so-called quiet period laid out in the National Voter Registration Act, or the NRVA, which requires that states complete “systematic” list maintenance programs 90 days before a federal election.
Youngkin, the Virginia governor, rolled out an executive order demanding more aggressive actions to cull noncitizens from the rolls – resulting in the 1,600 removals – exactly 90 days before the election. US District Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles, when she reversed the program, said it was “not happenstance that this executive order intensifying these efforts was announced exactly on the 90th day.”
The state, which is asking the Supreme Court to intervene, says the program is not the “systematic” kind of purge covered by the NVRA, while arguing the NVRA’s quiet period does not apply to removals of noncitizens.
Trump and others have seized on the dispute to express outrage at the “weaponized” Justice Department and the “radical” judge.
“Trump: THE OCTOBER SUPRISE… THOUSANDS of illegals are back on the voter rolls!” a mass fundraising text message sent Saturday from the former president’s campaign said.
A Fox News chyron falsely described the decision as “Judge rules that suspected noncitizens can vote,” when in fact, under her order, letters will be sent to those affected by the last-minute purge program reminding them that noncitizens can’t vote, even if their registrations were being restored.
Also unmentioned was that a Trump-appointed judge in Alabama halted its pre-election purge program on same grounds. Alabama has not appealed that ruling.
Disputes over government databases
When not fending lawsuits challenging purge protocols, GOP-led states and conservative groups have filed lawsuits alleging that election officials are not being given access to government databases that would help them verify the citizenship of those on the rolls.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said, when announcing his recent lawsuit against the Biden administration, that the state needed the data to confirm the citizenship of nearly half a million voters who lack citizenship records in the state’s databases.
The federal government offers a database known as the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, to help states vet registered voters. But not every state has entered into agreements with the Department of Homeland Security to use that system. And using it requires specific identification numbers – such as a Social Security number or what is known as an alien ID number – that are not available for every suspected noncitizen on the voter rolls.
In letters to state officials, DHS leaders have declined to use another citizenship database that does not require those ID numbers for the purpose of verifying voters, arguing that it’s both too cumbersome and not accurate enough to be used for voter purges.
“Those bureaucracies don’t always speak the same language,” Jason Snead, the executive director of Honest Elections Project, a conservative group focused on voter policies, told CNN. However, he pointed to bureaucratic pitfalls of using government databases to verify citizenship as a reason states should require documents proving citizenship to register to vote.
Doing so would likely require cover an act of Congress, as under Supreme Court precedent, voters without documentary proof of citizenship must be allowed to cast ballots in federal elections as long as the generic federal form used for voter registration does not include the requirement.
The recent spate of lawsuits seeking access to the federal data will take several months or even years to resolve.
The timing of the lawsuits – coupled with the attempts at last-minute purges – have some suspicious that the Republican moves are aimed at provoking headlines and press releases that propel their campaign messaging.
“Everyone knows that the National Voter Registration Act says you don’t do list maintenance in the last 90 days because the risk is too great, you’re going to screw up,” said Justin Levitt, a Loyola Marymount law professor who noted that such programs inevitably sweep up eligible citizens.
“The fact that states were asking to do this, knowing that they couldn’t, shows that they’re not serious about cleaning up the rolls,” said Levitt, who served in the Obama and Biden administrations. “It’s about producing a press release.”
LaRose said the last-minute nature of his lawsuit is the result of the federal government recently denying his data request. He said he still will need access to the federal databases for future elections.
LaRose acknowledged that noncitizen voting and other forms of voter fraud are “relatively rare” but said he has a responsibility to act.
“It’s my duty as the chief elections officer of the state to identify things that could cause problems with our election, things that are causing voters concern and that we address those proactively,” he said.",29/10/2024
CNN,House Oversight Committee launches investigation into Coast Guard after CNN report | CNN Politics,"The House Oversight Committee has launched an investigation into the US Coast Guard’s “mishandling of serious misconduct” — including sexual assault, racism and hazing — after CNN exposed that its leaders concealed reports documenting those problems from its workforce, the public and Congress.
The inquiry is the latest in a string of government probes announced in the wake of CNN’s reporting, which revealed the existence of a yearslong investigation that found rapes and other sexual abuse at the Coast Guard Academy had been ignored and, at times, covered up by high-ranking officials. Dubbed “Operation Fouled Anchor,” the internal probe was kept confidential by Coast Guard leaders for years until CNN started making inquiries into the report earlier this year.
Last week, CNN exposed that Coast Guard leaders suppressed yet another report, this time a “Culture of Respect” review from April 2015, that documented racial and gender discrimination and assault across the service.
In a letter sent Friday to the Coast Guard’s leader, Commandant Linda Fagan, House lawmakers lambasted the agency, saying that the Coast Guard “may have obstructed the ability of Congress to carry out constitutionally mandated oversight authority and legislation to address these issues,” “prevented actionable change within the agency” and “likely put more people at risk.”
“[The Coast Guard] only notified Congress about Operation Fouled Anchor and its April 2015 Report when existence of these reports was going to be in the press,” wrote committee Chairman Rep. James Comer and Rep. Glenn Grothman, chairman of the Subcommittee on National Security, the Border, and Foreign Affairs. “The Committee has serious concerns that congressional committees would not have been notified of these reports, and the serious allegations contained within them, if it had not been for the threat of public reporting.”
The announcement comes on the heels of the Coast Guard’s own acknowledgment of past failures in a rare and highly critical internal report issued this week that also orders a series of changes to how the agency handles sexual assault. A number of congressional lawmakers and assault survivors were not satisfied, however, saying the agency still needs to hold past perpetrators and the leaders who covered up their dangerous and criminal behavior accountable – rather than only looking to the future.
The committee requested a litany of documents and information “to assist the Committee in investigating these reports, the withholding of information from Congress, and the inaction of senior leadership to combat misconduct,” including a list of Coast Guard officials involved in the handling of sexual misconduct cases from the time of Fouled Anchor to present.
CNN’s reporting showed that, over the years, alleged perpetrators weren’t being held accountable for misconduct. Many of the problems documented in the Coast Guard’s reports continue to plague the agency, according to interviews with current and former service members.
Meanwhile, a probe by the Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General remains ongoing, as does a Senate inquiry – with a hearing scheduled next week where multiple whistleblowers and survivors of sexual assault and harassment will testify.

CNN,‘Change is necessary’: Coast Guard pledges reforms after mishandling reports of sexual assault | CNN Politics,"The US Coast Guard, rocked by allegations that its leaders for years concealed damning information about sexual assaults and other serious misconduct, released a highly critical report Wednesday acknowledging it had “failed to keep our people safe,” while vowing to make reforms that would better protect them.
After spending 90 days speaking with hundreds of service members, reading through more than 170 written comments and “sifting through a mountain of data,” an internal review team said it had heard a resounding message from the workforce that “these failures and lack of accountability are entirely unacceptable” and that leaders “must do something about it.”
“Too many Coast Guard members are not experiencing the safe, empowering workplace they expect and deserve (and) trust in Coast Guard leadership is eroding,” the authors wrote in the roughly 100-page report, noting that they had heard from victims of sexual assault and harassment stretching from the 1960s to the current day who “expressed deep rooted feelings of pain and a loss of trust in the organization.”
The scathing internal review was launched after CNN exposed a secret criminal investigation, dubbed Operation Fouled Anchor, which found that serious misconduct had been ignored and, at times, covered up by high-ranking officials. It wasn’t until CNN started asking questions about Fouled Anchor this spring that Coast Guard leaders rushed to officially brief Congress on the scandal — leading to outrage on both sides of the aisle, multiple government investigations and proposed legislation.
CNN’s coverage of Fouled Anchor and subsequent reporting revealing that Coast Guard leaders declined to prosecute a retired officer for sexual misconduct “have led people to experience feelings ranging from disappointment to outrage,” the report said.
“For so many victims, there are even deeper levels of broken trust: in leaders who failed them in preventing and responding to sexual violence; in a military justice system with antiquated legal definitions of rape; in non-existent support programs for those impacted prior to 2000,” it stated. While the report outlined a number of changes made in the last two decades, it also acknowledged that reforms to date have not been enough to prevent assaults and properly support victims.
The review did not seek to hold past perpetrators or officials involved with the Fouled Anchor cover-up accountable, saying multiple government investigations launched by Congress remained ongoing.
Instead, it looked to the future and focused on preventing future assaults and other misconduct, describing the report as a “road map aimed at improving” the agency’s culture.
Along with the report’s findings, the Coast Guard announced a series of actions directed by the agency’s leader, Commandant Linda Fagan, through recommended changes to everything from training and victim support services to strengthening processes for holding perpetrators accountable.
“This report acknowledges the Coast Guard’s failures and uses them to inform a way ahead, rebuild trust, and set the baseline for organizational growth,” the document states, noting that many of the actions require additional funding and authority to implement.
Among the reforms are the creation of a mentorship program for victims to help them navigate the aftermath of a sexual assault, the development of a “safe to report” policy so that victims are not penalized for collateral minor misconduct (such as alcohol use at the time of an incident), more secure locks on Coast Guard Academy bedrooms and improved oversight of the school and its cadets – including a new chain of command for the academy head.
Fagan also directed officials to better keep tabs on the academy’s hallmark “Swab Summer” training program, which is run by upperclassmen at the academy, and to consider strengthening policies that allow the agency to reduce pension payments for those found to have committed misconduct.
The report was the Coast Guard’s most expansive response to the growing criticism of its handling of misconduct. And while it was being released publicly, and members of Congress had been briefed on its contents earlier, the report was specifically addressed to “U.S. Coast Guard workforce, past and present.”
“You made it clear that you want and expect our Service to confront this issue and make it better. You want our Service to deliver meaningful change,” the report stated. “Whether you’re a member who has a story to share — or the shipmate standing beside them — this is our time. Let’s get it right.”
While the Coast Guard is focused on the future, members of Congress are still determined to get answers about past failures as well.
“This new report still does not hold anyone accountable for past failures—particularly those at the Coast Guard Academy,” said Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, where the Coast Guard Academy is located. Murphy and other lawmakers have continued to slam the agency for its failure to be transparent about sexual assault and other misconduct. “It does lay out a modest plan to improve oversight, training, and support for survivors, but a report is nothing more than paper until concrete steps are taken.”
Democratic Senators Maria Cantwell and Richard Blumenthal also criticized how, despite calling this effort an “accountability” review, the Coast Guard still failed to hold anyone to task for the mishandling of sexual assault cases. Cantwell reiterated the importance of an independent investigation, saying she is looking forward to seeing the results of the probe currently being conducted by the Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General.
Earlier this year, CNN reported how former Commandant Karl Schultz and his second-in-command, Vice Commandant Charles Ray, failed to act on plans to share the findings of Fouled Anchor with Congress and the public. Ray resigned from his position at a Coast Guard Academy leadership institute soon after, but no other current or former Coast Guard officials have publicly faced any consequences.
“Current Coast Guard personnel are being told to trust their leadership, but their leaders aren’t holding predecessors accountable,” K. Denise Rucker Krepp, a former Coast Guard officer and former chief counsel of the Maritime Administration wrote in a recent letter to Congress, describing how she had attended a “community healing” event sponsored by the Coast Guard Academy Alumni Association last month.
“Before my first cup of coffee I learned about a woman who was raped shortly after joining the service. She never told her parents about the crime,” she wrote. “While washing my hands in the bathroom, another woman shared that she was raped while attending the Coast Guard Academy in the late 1990s. Another woman shared that she was gang-raped by three students at the school and had spent two-thirds of her life on medication because of the crimes that occurred almost 40 years ago.”
Next week, more survivors of sexual assault and harassment at the Coast Guard Academy are slated to share their experiences publicly in a Congressional hearing. The hearing, announced just yesterday, is part of an ongoing Senate probe launched in reaction to the Fouled Anchor cover-up.

CNN,Uncertainty looms for future aid to Ukraine and Israel as speaker drama continues | CNN Politics,"As the search for a speaker continues, some House Republicans are already casting doubt over the future of the administration’s $105 billion security supplemental request for aid to Ukraine, Israel, the southern border and Taiwan, a major issue that any future speaker will have to contend with.
A number of Republican rank-and-file members in the House have made clear that the administration’s request won’t survive their chamber without changes and many House Republicans have already said that additional funding for border security isn’t enough without a policy overhaul, which would likely be a red line for many Senate Democrats.
“This is a hell no. And no one in the House GOP should support it. It’s asinine, unpaid for, ineffective and dangerous,” Rep. Chip Roy of Texas posted on X about the supplemental request.
Other Republicans who support parts of the request blasted the administration for trying to tie Israel funding to funding for Ukraine, which has seen cratering support in recent months.
“Israel deserves to have a conversation that is devoted to them right now,” Republican Rep. Mike Garcia of California, a defense appropriator, told CNN. “We need to strip out the Ukraine funding and we need to give the Israeli partners the respect they deserve.”
Even those who have backed Ukraine aid and have pledged to support it in the future want to understand why the administration is asking for so much.
“It seems like a lot,” Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska said. “I’d like to see the breakout of the needs. I want to support it, but that seems like a lot of money.”
There is broad bipartisan support for Ukraine, but funding the military efforts there has become a flashpoint for conservatives and an issue that will likely bedevil a future speaker just as it had former Speaker Kevin McCarthy. The administration’s request included more than $60 billion in assistance for Ukraine with over $14 billion for Israel. The Israel funding will likely move quickly in the House, but it’s very likely that the future speaker would decouple the requests so they are voted on individually.
The tightrope any future speaker will walk is that the Republican conference is divided over sending additional aid to Ukraine. On the one hand, hardliners derided McCarthy for his support of the country early on in the war and McCarthy had remained publicly noncommittal about putting a future aid package on the floor. But there are some members for whom support Ukraine is an essential issue.
“I support Ukraine and Israel. I think we should do both,” Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania said. “I think we should do whatever gets both of them across the finish line, whatever strategy works best. I don’t want to hold back one for the other. I support both.”
To this point, the supplemental request has been overshadowed by a chaotic search for House speaker, but it may come into focus soon as the Senate prepares to take up the request quickly.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has made clear he hopes to take up the supplemental request as soon as possible.
“This legislation is too important to wait for the House to settle their chaos. Senate Democrats will move expeditiously on this request, and we hope that our Republican colleagues across the aisle will join us to pass this much-needed funding,” Schumer said.
The Senate Appropriations Committee has scheduled a hearing for October 31 to review the request and will hear from Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who are expected to testify and make the case for why the money is necessary.
But the House cannot begin to consider the legislation on the floor in any form until a speaker is selected.",23/10/2023
CNN,"Elon Musk keeps up pro-Trump spending spree as Harris continues to dominate money race, new filings show | CNN Politics","Elon Musk plowed nearly $44 million in October into a super PAC working to restore Donald Trump to the White House – pushing the billionaire’s total donations to the group he established to benefit the former president to nearly $119 million, new campaign finance reports show.
The last-minute burst of spending by the world’s richest man comes as Trump’s Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, continues to lap the former president in fundraising, bringing in about $97 million – six times the amount collected by Trump in the first 16 days of October, according to reports the campaigns filed late Thursday night with the Federal Election Commission.
But both candidates and their aligned political operations went on a spending spree this month – burning through more than half a billion dollars combined during the first half of October as they jockey for advantage ahead of Election Day.
Here are some key takeaways from the filings:
Harris spent more than Trump, but heads into the election with more cash
Harris’ principal campaign committee spent nearly $166 million between October 1 and 16, exceeding the Trump campaign’s $99.7 million in expenditures during the same period. Roughly $130 million of Harris’ campaign spending went toward media expenses.
And the blistering fundraising pace Harris set after ascending to the top of the Democratic ticket at the end of July has given her a bigger financial cushion in the final days of the race. The nearly $119 million remaining in her campaign’s coffers is more than three times the dollars that Trump had remaining in his.
And data from AdImpact, which tracks political advertising, underscores how Harris has put that financial advantage to work on the airwaves in battleground states. Her campaign has spent about $488 million on advertising since President Joe Biden withdrew from the race, including on ads slated to run through Election Day. By contrast, Trump has spent about $284 million over the same period.
Musk aids Trump and Senate Republican candidates, too
Musk has emerged as a major financial figure in this year’s election – underwriting an unorthodox get-out-the-vote effort on Trump’s behalf in key battleground states – a role that the former president has largely ceded to outside groups. In recent days, Musk also offered splashy, $1 million daily sweepstakes for swing-state voters that has drawn scrutiny from the US Justice Department.
The new filings show the tech magnate made four donations totaling $43.6 million to his America PAC in the first half of October. He also wrote checks totaling $12.3 million to other super PACs mostly supporting efforts by Republicans to take control of the Senate.
Before this election, the Tesla CEO and X owner had made relatively modest donations to federal candidates, backing a mix of Democrats and Republicans. But he is deeply engaged in helping Trump win the presidency this time and has joined the Republican nominee on the campaign trail.
Thursday’s filings show that Musk’s super PAC drew other donors in October. Billionaire businessman Nelson Peltz gave $1 million to America PAC and members of the Michigan-based DeVos family, including Trump’s Education secretary, Betsy DeVos, also made six-figure donations.
Other big Trump donors
Other large donors backing Trump include Midwestern packaging magnate Richard Uihlein, who contributed another $6.5 million this month to the super PAC he steers – Restoration PAC, which has been spending heavily in support of Trump’s candidacy. Uihlein, whose family helped found Schlitz Brewing, has long backed conservative, anti-establishment candidates and has emerged as one of the biggest financial backers to pro-Trump efforts this cycle.
Uihlein’s wife, Elizabeth, donated $3 million in October to another pro-Trump group, Preserve America, which has been largely funded by billionaire Miriam Adelson, a physician and widow of casino mogul Sheldon Adelson. Ronald Cameron, who oversees poultry-producing giant Mountaire Farms, donated $2 million to Preserve America.
WhatsApp co-founder Jan Koum, meanwhile, became one of the latest tech figures to support Trump’s campaign, giving $5 million worth of stock in social media giant Meta to Make America Great Again, Inc., the main super PAC backing Trump, the new filings show. He had previously donated to a super PAC supporting Nikki Haley’s failed bid for the Republican presidential nomination.
MAGA, Inc., also took in $1 million apiece from Arkansas-based investor Warren Stephens and pharmaceutical heir Woody Johnson, who co-owns the New York Jets and served as Trump’s ambassador to the United Kingdom.
Big checks back Harris, too
Top donors to Future Forward, a super PAC supporting Harris, include Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, who gave $25 million to the group in the first half of October, bringing his total giving to the group to $38 million.
But a substantial portion of the nearly $90 million collected by the pro-Harris super PAC over the period – a total of $40 million – came from Future Forward’s nonprofit arm, which does not disclose its donors, obscuring from the public the identity of some of Harris’ backers.
The new filings also show that Liz Cheney, the former Wyoming congresswoman who has broken with her fellow Republicans to back Harris, isn’t just campaigning with the vice president. Cheney’s political action committee, Our Great Task, donated $2.5 million on October 8 to American Bridge 21st Century, a leading Democratic research and rapid response group working to help Harris.
Legal fees
Even as Trump raises money for his presidential campaign, his political operation continues to underwrite the former president’s legal bills.
Between October 1 and 16, Save America, the former president’s leadership PAC, spent $3.9 million on “legal consulting,” records show. The lion’s share of the money, nearly $3.3 million, went to Robert & Robert. Clifford Robert, the firm’s principal, is one of the lawyers representing Trump in his appeal of his civil fraud judgment in New York.",25/10/2024
CNN,Fact check: Trump makes at least 11 false claims in foreign policy interview | CNN Politics,"Former President Donald Trump did a Monday interview focused on foreign policy. And he repeated a bunch of his regular false claims on that subject and others – while sprinkling in some new inaccuracy for good measure – making at least 11 false claims in all.
In the interview with conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt, Trump also made an assertion that he has been to Gaza. Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt insisted to CNN that the claim is true, but she could not provide a single detail about Trump’s supposed Gaza visit, and CNN and other media outlets have found no evidence that Trump ever went; he certainly did not go as president. You can read more here.
Below is a quick fact check of Trump’s 11 provably false claims in the interview.
Terrorist attacks: Trump repeated his false claim that “we didn’t have one terrorist attack” during his presidency. There were multiple terrorist attacks during his presidency, including some he has spoken about himself.
The defeat of ISIS: Trump repeated his false claim that although others said it would take years to “get rid of” the ISIS terror group, “I got rid of it in a month.” Leaving aside the fact that Trump certainly doesn’t deserve sole credit, the ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency.
Iran and funding for terror groups: Trump repeated his false claim that Iran did not fund terror groups during his presidency: “They weren’t giving any money, because they had no money.” Iran’s funding for entities designated by the US government as terror groups, like Hezbollah and Hamas, did decline in the second half of his presidency, in large part because his sanctions had a major negative impact on the Iranian economy, but the funding never stopped – as Trump’s own administration acknowledged in 2020.
China’s oil purchases from Iran: Trump repeated his false claim that he successfully pressured Chinese leader Xi Jinping into ending oil purchases from Iran; Trump claimed, “He said, ‘I’ll pass.’ He passed. Everybody passed. They did no business.” China’s oil purchases from Iran briefly plummeted in 2019, but they never stopped, and they quickly rebounded while Trump was still president – back up to hundreds of thousands of barrels per day.
Nuclear weapons: Repeating a false claim he made during his presidency, Trump said, “I rebuilt our entire nuclear force.” He simply did not do so, though he did undertake efforts to modernize the US arsenal. “Long story short: then, as now, Trump’s nuclear braggadocio is utter fantasy, wholly divorced from reality,” said Stephen Schwartz, an independent expert on US nuclear weapons policy. “And not only did he not rebuild ‘our entire nuclear force,’ on his watch the total operational nuclear stockpile of warheads and bombs actually decreased by about 100 weapons!”
Global warming and sea levels: Trump delivered another version of his usual false claim about global warming, minimizing the threat by saying it will cause the ocean to rise merely “1/8th of an inch in the next 500 years.” Sea levels are currently rising more than an eighth of an inch per year.
Harris, immigrants and crime: Trump repeated his false claim that Vice President Kamala Harris, his opponent in the presidential election, let in 13,000 murderers and 425,000 criminals over the border. The statistics he was referring to are not specifically about people who entered the country during the Biden-Harris administration; rather, they cover numerous presidential administrations, including his own, over the span of decades – “over the past 40 years or more,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a September statement to CNN. You can read more here.
Pelosi and a stock sale: Trump falsely claimed that the former speaker of the House, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, sold stock in Visa “the day before the lawsuit” that was filed against the company by the Justice Department in September. An official disclosure shows the stock was actually sold by Pelosi’s husband more than two and a half months before the Justice Department filed the lawsuit.
Biden and foreign income: Trump repeated his false claim that President Joe Biden “gets a lot of money from China, or he got a lot of money from China, tremendous amount of money.” After years of investigation by House Republicans, there is still no evidence Biden has received any payments from China.
Chris Wallace in 2020: Trump repeated his false claim that journalist Chris Wallace, now of CNN and formerly of Fox News, tried to stop him, during a presidential debate Wallace moderated in 2020, from asking Biden about a supposed payment from the mayor of Moscow’s wife (which actually went to a company connected to Biden’s son Hunter Biden, not to the president); Trump claimed, “And Chris Wallace wouldn’t let me ask. (Biden) couldn’t answer the question. Chris Wallace stepped in and said, ‘Well, we’re not going to be talking about that.’”
Wallace never said anything like that. As the transcript shows, Wallace interjected during this debate exchange to try to get Trump to allow Biden to answer Trump’s question about the money, not to stop Trump from talking about the subject.
Military equipment surrendered to the Taliban: Trump repeated his false claim that $85 billion in US military equipment was left to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal from Afghanistan under Biden and Harris. Trump’s figure is a massive exaggeration; the Pentagon has estimated that this equipment was worth about $7.1 billion – a chunk of the roughly $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021.

CNN,Judge Aileen Cannon defends her judicial independence and says she’s never met Trump | CNN Politics,"Judge Aileen Cannon is refusing to recuse herself from the criminal case against the man accused of trying to assassinate Donald Trump, saying she has no relationship with the former president who nominated her to the federal bench and that she doesn’t control what he says about her.
In her ruling Tuesday, Cannon said she has never spoken with Trump or met him, and she has no concerns over the “political consequences of my rulings.”
Attorneys for Ryan Routh, who prosecutors say set up a sniper’s nest outside of Trump’s golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, argued that Cannon’s dismissal of the criminal case against Trump over his handling of classified documents could create the appearance of partiality in their client’s case where Trump is the alleged victim.
Routh’s attorneys noted the many instances when Trump has praised Cannon by name for her decision to toss the documents case, including during his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention this summer.
“I have no control over what private citizens, members of the media, or public officials or candidates elect to say about me or my judicial rulings,” Cannon wrote Tuesday.
Defense attorneys argued that if Trump were to win the 2024 presidential race, he could elevate Cannon to a higher court, something that might influence her in this case.
But Cannon insisted she is not “concerned about the political consequences of my rulings or how those rulings might be viewed by ‘some in the media.’”
“I have never spoken to or met former President Trump except in connection with his required presence at an official judicial proceeding, through counsel,” Cannon wrote. “I have no ‘relationship to the alleged victim’ in any reasonable sense of the phrase. I follow my oath to administer justice faithfully and impartially, in accordance with the Constitution and the laws of this country.”
Cannon said she would not entertain the “speculation” from Routh’s attorneys and noted that the case was randomly assigned to her, just like Trump’s classified documents case.
“This case, like the prior cited cases involving former President Trump, were randomly assigned to me through the Clerk’s random case assignment system. Period. I will not be guided by highly inaccurate, uninformed, or speculative opinions to the contrary,” Cannon wrote.
Special counsel Jack Smith is currently appealing Cannon’s dismissal of the documents case.
Cannon also rejected the defendant’s attempt to call into question her relationship with one of the prosecutors on the case, noting that despite attending the prosecutor’s wedding, she currently has no personal relationship with him.
“I maintained a professional friendship with the stated prosecutor during my time as a prosecutor (2013–2020), as I did with other colleagues within the United States Attorneys’ Office. As part of that professional friendship, I attended his wedding nearly a decade ago. I maintain no ongoing personal relationship with the prosecutor, nor have I communicated with him in years,” she said.
Routh’s trial is currently set for February.",29/10/2024
CNN,Political art mysteriously pops up in DC ahead of Election Day | CNN Politics,"Two political statues have mysteriously popped up in Washington, DC, drawing crowds of onlookers, just a week before Election Day.
Last week, an unknown artist placed a bronze replica of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s desk – topped with an emoji-like poop, the size of a basketball – along the National Mall near the US Capitol.
“This memorial honors the brave men and women who broke into the United States Capitol on January 6th, 2021 to loot, urinate and defecate throughout those hallowed halls in order to overturn an election,” a plaque below the statue reads. “President Trump celebrates these heroes of January 6th as ‘unbelievable patriots’ and ‘warriors.’ This monument stands as a testament to their daring sacrifice and lasting legacy.”
Pelosi’s desk was at the center of one of the most iconic images of the January 6 insurrection, when a Donald Trump supporter who stormed the Capitol was infamously photographed with his feet on the desk.
On Monday, a bronze statue of a tiki torch appeared in Freedom Plaza, just a couple of blocks from the White House.
The statue, called “The Donald J. Trump Enduring Flame,” appears to mock the former president’s defense of the marchers who attended a White supremacist rally in 2017 that left a woman dead.
“This monument pays tribute to President Donald Trump and the ‘very fine people’ he boldly stood to defend when they marched in Charlottesville, Virginia,” a plaque below it reads. “While many have called them white supremacists and neo-Nazis, President Trump’s voice rang out above the rest to remind all that they were ‘treated absolutely unfairly.’ This monument stands as an everlasting reminder of that bold proclamation.”
While the artist – or artists – behind the statues remains unknown, a largely redacted permit approved by the National Park Service shows Civic Crafted LLC and Julia Jimenez-Pyzik requested permission to display the statues. CNN has reached out to Civic Crafted LLC and Jimenez-Pyzik for comment.
Groups of tourists and passersby have gathered at the statues to read the artist’s tongue-in-cheek messages and snap photos of the works.
“I think they’re very thought-provoking,” Maryland resident Grace Denman said of the statues. “It reminded me how angry I was about January 6 and the deaths in Charlottesville because of the White supremacists, so it brought back some of that energy and anger that has faded over time as we’re coming into a really contentious and possibly dangerous election.”
But not everyone seems to love the statues.
DC resident Paige Muller said she’s “overheard lots of people who aren’t from here, or maybe aren’t as politically engaged, and some people thought it was inappropriate.”
But Muller sees the art as “great reminder of what’s at stake,” saying: “We have to do our part to make sure that another January 6 doesn’t happen.”
Since the statues’ sudden appearance, Pelosi’s nameplate has gone missing from atop the desk.
The statue – titled “The Resolute Desk”– represents the heart of democracy, according to the permit. “When rioters broke in to destroy these ideals, this desk stands firm, so too must the principles of equality, justice, and freedom that it represents,” it states.
National Park Service spokesperson Mike Litterst told CNN in a statement that permits issued by the agency “spell out the specific conditions under which the event will take place to ensure public safety, the protection of park resources and to maintain a commemorative atmosphere where appropriate.”
“The National Park Service does not consider the content of the message to be presented,” he said.
The statues won’t make it to Election Day. The desk is scheduled to be removed Wednesday and the torch a day later.",29/10/2024
CNN,Trump ally Mike Johnson elected House speaker three weeks after McCarthy ouster | CNN Politics,"The Republican-led House elected Rep. Mike Johnson as the new House speaker on Wednesday – a major leadership change that comes three weeks after the historic ouster of Kevin McCarthy. Johnson, a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump and a key congressional figure in the failed efforts to overturn the 2020 election, will now take the reins of the bitterly divided House Republican majority and faces the looming threat of a government shutdown next month.
Johnson’s elevation puts an end to the paralysis the House had been stuck in after McCarthy was pushed out by hardline conservatives – an unprecedented move that plunged the chamber into uncharted territory. Republicans tried and failed three separate times to coalesce behind a new speaker nominee before ultimately uniting around Johnson, a conservative lawmaker who has so far had a relatively low profile on the national stage. In a remarkable show of unity following weeks of fierce GOP infighting, the Louisiana Republican was elected with 220 votes and no Republican defections.
The new speaker will now face a litany of pressing issues. Government funding is set to expire on November 17, and the GOP-controlled House will need to work with the Democratic-led Senate to avert a shutdown, setting up an early leadership test for Johnson. Lawmakers must also decide whether to send further aid to Ukraine as it fights a war against Russian aggression as well as aid to Israel in its war against Hamas. There is widespread bipartisan support for aid to Israel, but many House Republicans are opposed to sending additional aid to Ukraine.
Hours after the speaker election, the House passed a resolution in support of Israel in its war against Hamas. The measure passed with overwhelming bipartisan support by a vote of 412 to 10.
Johnson, fresh off his victory on the House floor, said he will pursue an “aggressive schedule” in the weeks ahead and alluded to the chaos that had paralyzed the House and distracted from the GOP agenda.
“You’re going to see an aggressive schedule in the days and weeks ahead. You’re gonna see Congress working as hard as it’s ever worked and we are going to deliver for the American people,” he said.
“We’ve gone through a little bit of suffering. We’ve gone through a little bit of character building, and you know what has produced more strength, more perseverance and a lot of hope, and that’s what we’re about to deliver to the American people,” he said.
Johnson was first elected to the House in 2016 and has previously served as vice chairman of the House Republican Conference. A Trump ally, he supported objections to Electoral College results when Congress met to certify Joe Biden’s presidential win on January 6, 2021 – the day a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol seeking to overturn the results of the election. He also lobbied fellow House Republicans to support a Texas lawsuit seeking to overturn the election. A reporter was loudly booed by House GOP members for asking Johnson after he became the speaker-designate if he stands by his decision to support overturning the election.
New speaker takes over following weeks of chaos
The fight for the speaker’s gavel has opened new rifts among House Republicans and deepened old ones. Republicans rallied around Johnson in a display of unity, but it remains to be seen how long that will hold.
Johnson secured the nomination for the speakership late Tuesday evening in a vote that capped off a chaotic day that started with Republicans picking Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer to be their latest nominee only for him to drop out hours later after facing stiff resistance from the right flank of the conference and a rebuke from Trump. After winning the party nomination, Emmer faced swift opposition from the right flank of his conference as well as a rebuke from Trump. In a post on Truth Social, Trump called Emmer a “Globalist RINO,” and said that voting for him “would be a tragic mistake.”
Emmer was the third Republican to win the GOP nomination only to then exit the race after failing to lock up the necessary votes to win the gavel, following Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and Steve Scalise also of Louisiana.
Jordan, who is known as Trump ally and a fierce conservative agitator, took his fight for the speakership to the House floor in a bid to put members on the record – but failed to secure the gavel in three separate rounds of voting that saw him lose more support with each ballot.
Some Republicans who opposed Jordan decried what they described as a pressure campaign against them by allies of the Ohio Republican. And several Republicans who opposed Jordan’s speakership bid said they experienced angry calls, menacing messages and even death threats since casting their votes. Jordan condemned the threats.
Even as he faced stiff resistance, Jordan vowed repeatedly to continue his fight. But after his third failed floor vote, the House GOP conference voted internally to push him out of the race in a dramatic turn of events. Jordan’s failure to win the gavel highlighted the limits of Trump’s influence in the speaker’s race after the former president endorsed Jordan.
As Republicans failed to coalesce around successive candidates, frustration and tensions within the conference intensified and frequently spilled out into public view as members lamented the impasse and questioned whether anyone could secure enough support to win the gavel given the GOP’s narrow majority.
Johnson emerges as new GOP leader
Johnson has a background as a staunch conservative Republican and an ardent Trump supporter.
After the election was called in favor of Joe Biden on November 7, 2020, Johnson posted on X, then known as Twitter, “I have just called President Trump to say this: ‘Stay strong and keep fighting, sir! The nation is depending upon your resolve. We must exhaust every available legal remedy to restore Americans’ trust in the fairness of our election system.’”
Johnson serves on the Judiciary Committee and the Armed Services Committee. He is also a former chair of the Republican Study Committee.
As CNN’s KFILE has reported, Johnson has a history of harsh anti-gay language from his time as an attorney for a socially conservative legal group in the mid-2000s.
In editorials that ran in his local Shreveport, Louisiana, paper, The Times, Johnson called homosexuality an “inherently unnatural” and “dangerous lifestyle” that would lead to legalized pedophilia and possibly even destroy “the entire democratic system.”
In another editorial, he wrote, “Your race, creed, and sex are what you are, while homosexuality and cross-dressing are things you do. This is a free country, but we don’t give special protections for every person’s bizarre choices.”
At the time, Johnson was an attorney and spokesman for Alliance Defense Fund, known today as Alliance Defending Freedom, where he also authored his opposition to the Supreme Court ruling in Lawrence v. Texas – which overturned state laws that criminalized homosexual activity between consenting adults.
In 2022, Johnson also introduced a bill that some have described as a national version of what critics have called Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” bill.

CNN,House GOP Whip Tom Emmer moves to lock in support for speakership amid crowded field | CNN Politics,"House speaker candidate Tom Emmer, the GOP whip, has moved to lock in support across the ideological and geographic spectrum in the conference, giving him what many House Republicans believe is an advantage heading into a secret-ballot election to nominate their candidate Tuesday, according to Republican sources.
But it’s hard to assess his chances fully since it’s a crowded field, with at least seven candidates working the phones all weekend to win a majority of support within the conference.
Even if Emmer were to win the nomination, Republican sources are uncertain he can get 217 votes on the floor, as he could face resistance from members of the hardline House Freedom Caucus skeptical of the GOP leadership team.
House Republicans are searching for a new GOP speaker nominee after Rep. Jim Jordan on Friday became the latest exit from the race. The chamber has been without a speaker for more than two weeks after Kevin McCarthy’s historic ouster this month.
Emmer, of Minnesota, said in a letter to colleagues Saturday that he was seeking the speakership with the goal of delivering “historic change.” McCarthy has endorsed Emmer for speaker, delivering an early boost for his candidacy.
McCarthy on Sunday urged his House colleagues to elect Emmer but stopped short of ruling out another speakership run himself.
“He’s been in the room with all of our successes,” the California Republican said of Emmer. “He sets himself head and shoulders above all those others who want to run.
“This is not a time for a learning experience as speaker. Tom would be able to walk into the job and do it on Day 1,” McCarthy said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”
McCarthy once again demurred when asked about returning to wield the gavel.
“I don’t need the title. I’m going to help in any way I can,” he said. “I’m supporting Tom Emmer, but I’m going to tell you, I’m still a member of Congress, and I’m going to lead in any capacity I can to help to protect America.”

CNN,Biden comes to grips with a diminished role on the campaign trail | CNN Politics,"President Joe Biden’s role in the 2024 presidential campaign in the final weeks of the election has been moved even further out of the spotlight as recent campaign trail gaffes prompted a range of responses – from eyerolls to outright anger – from some Harris campaign aides.
Planning for a range of Biden events had been up in the air late last week as the campaign worked to reassess how best to use the incumbent, who now plans to make several solo stops this week, including an infrastructure speech in Baltimore and an address to union members in Philadelphia and an appearance in his hometown of Scranton..
Biden’s impromptu attack on former president and GOP nominee Donald Trump in New Hampshire spurred a flurry of coverage outside the scope of the event, raising concerns among Harris aides and allies about singular comments getting amplified in the final stretch of the race.
“We got to lock him up,” Biden had said, while speaking off the cuff to campaign workers in Concord, New Hampshire, before quickly pivoting to try to clarify his remarks. “Politically lock him up. Lock him out. That’s what we have to do.”
Then, speaking in Arizona on Friday, Biden referred to former Rep. Gabby Giffords, who survived being shot in the head at a 2011 campaign event, in the past tense, suggesting she was no longer alive.
While aides have previously brushed off such slips as “vintage Biden,” noting the president’s proclivity to misspeak, they also acknowledge there’s no room for error amid the frenzied news cycle and fragile balance of the race that has raised the stakes for each event in the final days.
“We’re in ‘Do No Harm’ mode,” said one official involved in discussions of Biden’s role.
As the campaign entered the post-Labor Day home stretch, Biden’s senior-most aides acknowledged that his role would be diminished, both due to the need to familiarize voters with Harris and to distance her from an outgoing president whose approval rating has been underwater for much of his term. But they express surprise at just how little Biden has been utilized in a race that’s become something of a referendum on his presidency.
A Harris’ campaign spokesman said the vice president is thankful for what Biden has done for her so far.
“Vice President Harris is grateful for President Biden’s support and appreciates that he is campaigning for her,” said Ian Sams, a Harris campaign spokesman.
Andrew Bates, senior deputy press secretary at the White House, said Biden’s best role in the Harris campaign is “demonstrating leadership as president” while Harris is on the trail.
“As President Biden has said himself, he knows that every President needs to ‘cut their own path’ and he will continue to coordinate with the campaign on where and how he can be helpful, like he has done in recent days mobilizing the labor unions he has worked with for decades,” he said.
After so long in politics, Biden is fully aware of the delicate decisions that govern campaign seasons. He has long said – usually as a joke – that he’s willing to campaign for or against his favored candidate, “whichever will help the most.”
With days until voting closes, the president’s schedule this week doesn’t reflect a surrogate in high demand. After suggesting in September he would be on the road regularly for Harris in the final months, Biden has been largely absent from the campaign trail in the closing stretch. A tour of Pennsylvania alongside Gov. Josh Shapiro, which Biden teased earlier this fall, doesn’t appear to have materialized. An event Biden helmed with union workers over the weekend was not promoted by the Harris campaign, which omitted the appearance from its top surrogate recaps, though it was approved and supported by the Harris operation.
Biden has a few “campaign calls” scheduled this week, where he hopes to rally various groups telephonically behind Harris. He’ll attend a union event on Friday in Philadelphia, the hometown of his wife, for an official White House appearance rather than a campaign rally.
Such is the existence of an unpopular incumbent on the way out. He joins a club that includes Bill Clinton and George W. Bush as presidents mostly kept off the campaign trail as their party looks to turn a page.
Soul searching
As he’s watched from the sidelines of the race that he was in a little more than three months ago, Biden has embarked on some soul-searching, those close to him say, reflecting on both the long arc of his career and its abrupt end – his decades as a beloved party operative and, more recently, persona non grata.
Biden, these people say, remains firm in his view that he would be able to defeat his predecessor in November if he remained at the top of the Democratic ticket.
But if the president’s tone has shifted at all since July on anything, it has been on the issue of his own age.
Once defiant on his mental and physical fitness in the face of questions from reporters, concerns within his own party and a blistering critique by former special counsel Robert Hur, Biden has become much more circumspect on his abilities, multiple sources told CNN.
In private conversations, the president in recent weeks has more readily acknowledged that self-reflection about his age – and everything that is required of the presidency – had indeed been a part of his decision-making process over the summer. First lady Dr. Jill Biden, who had supported Biden staying in the race until the end, recently admitted in an interview with ABC’s “Good Morning America” that exiting the race was “the right call.”
Biden himself has hinted more at the role that his age played in his decision-making – at times sheepishly and with an injection of humor – including recently in an interview with the hosts of ABC’s “The View.”
“I stepped down because I started thinking about it,” he said. “It’s hard for me to even say how old I am. I’m serious. I give my word. It’s like – ‘Holy God, that can’t be right. This can’t be right.’”
Diminishing role
While the president has largely stuck to White House events and travel, the campaign has utilized another Biden on the road – the first lady.
In the past week, Jill Biden has traveled to Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, including stops with fellow educator Gwen Walz.
Asked Monday by reporters whether he would appear with Harris on the campaign trail this week, the president acknowledged he’s taking direction from the campaign.
“We talk all the time, and they’re asking me to be where they think I should be,” he said.
Biden said he’s done “a lot of surrogate stuff,” but chalked up his absence from the trail to his day job.
“The fact of the matter is that I’ve also had to be president at the same time. So, I’ve been to all the battleground states, I’ve been campaigning, but I also have to continue my job as president,” he said.
A long, emotional good-bye
People close to the president say he has not yet come to terms with his popularity as a politician, which deteriorated markedly during his time in office as the cost of living soared. Before dropping out of the 2024 race, Biden’s approval rating hit 36%, according to Gallup.
During his participation in White House events, Biden has appeared wistful – a descriptor used often by his aides – and at times has choked up at the magnitude of the office.
While presenting the National Medal of Arts and National Humanities Medals to several dozen creatives, he teared up while recounting the lyrics to “My Country Tis of Thee.” Ashley Biden, the president’s daughter, and Jon Meacham, presidential historian who has helped write some of most consequential speeches, could be seen wiping their eyes in the East Room as they looked on.
Biden’s core belief, one longtime aide says, is that he’s served as “a damn good president.”
But privately, this aide says, Biden has struggled with the question that’s plagued his West Wing: Why hasn’t it mattered to voters?
With his final months in office, Biden is expected to try to reframe that narrative through a series of speeches on issues like the economy and a series of summits with world leaders that affirm the US’ relationship with key allies. He’ll greet heads of state in Peru at the APEC summit and G-20 leaders in Brazil in late November. And in December, he’ll visit Africa to highlight efforts to counter China’s inroads there.
The post-election burst of activity is expected to release Biden’s kinetic energy that’s been under wraps as Harris has stepped into the spotlight. When Biden has tried to share that spotlight during the height of the campaign, wires and messages have gotten crossed.
In early October, Biden made a spontaneous inaugural visit as president to the White House Press Briefing room – something that sources said he had expressed interest in doing to his team weeks ago – to tout unexpectedly good jobs data and the end to a port worker strike. But Biden’s surprise appearance took place at the exact moment Harris was taking the stage at a campaign rally in Detroit, leading major television networks to change their feed from her remarks to the president.
White House officials insist there was no malice involved.
“He was just excited,” one official said.

CNN,Trump was doing historically well among Hispanic voters before Madison Square Garden rally backlash | CNN Politics,"Donald Trump’s Sunday rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City featured numerous instances of speakers making racist or bigoted remarks. Perhaps none more notoriously so than comedian Tony Hinchcliffe’s offensive comments about Puerto Rico.
What makes those remarks – which the former president’s campaign has sought to distance itself from – so noteworthy is they come at a time when Trump seems to be making inroads with Hispanic voters. In fact, he seems to be on his way to doing better with this group than any GOP presidential nominee since George W. Bush in 2004.
Consider an average of recent polling data on Hispanic voters: Kamala Harris is ahead of Trump by just 13 points. That’s well off an average of post-election and exit poll data from 2020, when Joe Biden carried Hispanic voters by 26 points.
What’s remarkable is that this 26-point deficit, itself, was an improvement for Trump from 2016. Trump lost Hispanic voters by 39 points to Hillary Clinton, according to an average of exit poll and post-election data.
The polling data and 2020 outcome represent a big reason why the Trump campaign has made a concerted effort to win over more Hispanic voters. It helps to explain why the former president held a massive rally in the heavily Hispanic Bronx earlier this year and visited a barbershop in that same New York City borough this month.
Trump’s improvement with Hispanic voters also helps to explain the current electoral map. Harris’ best path to securing the 270 electoral votes needed to win seems to run through the Great Lakes battlegrounds of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. She has been basically even with Trump in polling of these states, if not running slightly ahead.
Meanwhile, in Arizona and Nevada, two Southwest battlegrounds with larger Hispanic populations, Trump has been doing well.
He has consistently held a margin-of-error advantage in Arizona surveys. In fact, it’s been Trump’s best polling state of any that Biden won in 2020. The polling from Nevada has been limited, but it too has moved more toward the former president than what polling averages indicate in the Great Lakes battleground states.
Both Arizona and Nevada have more Hispanic voters than any of the other five battleground states, which also include Georgia and North Carolina.
Trump has been doing particularly well among Hispanic men, as well as Hispanic voters without a college degree.
Will a rally like Sunday’s make a difference in that support? It’s unclear.
What is notable, however, is that such rallies hark back more to the rhetoric the Trump campaign used during the 2016 cycle, when he performed far worse with Hispanic voters.
Still, I would be hesitant to think too much will change after Sunday.
For one thing, most Hispanic voters are not from Puerto Rico, especially in the battleground states. For another, Hispanics are not one-issue voters.
According to a recent New York Times/Siena College poll, the No. 1 issue for Hispanic voters was the economy (29%). That matches the 27% of all likely voters who said the economy was their top issue in deciding their vote this year.
Immigration ranked third for all likely voters, at 12%, which, again, mirrors the 15% of likely Hispanic voters who felt the same way.
Of course, one could argue that Sunday’s rally could have turned off non-Hispanic voters. We already know that Harris is doing historically well for a Democrat among White college-educated voters. They’re the ones who have been moving most to the left since Trump entered the political scene, in no small part because of his rhetoric.
White college-educated voters are of paramount importance to Harris in the suburbs of Philadelphia and Detroit and the areas around Madison, Wisconsin. Given how close the contests in those states are, any movement could make all the difference in the world.
If nothing else, the Madison Square Garden rally seems to have focused people’s attention on Trump (see Google searches), but for a negative reason.
I doubt the Trump campaign likes that.",28/10/2024
CNN,"Up to 35 ISIS operatives killed in US strikes in Syria, US military says | CNN Politics","Up to 35 ISIS operatives were killed in US strikes against multiple ISIS camps in Syria on Monday evening, the US military announced on Wednesday.
“US Central Command forces conducted a series of strikes against several known ISIS camps in Syria, in the early evening of Oct. 28, resulting in up to 35 ISIS operatives killed,” the release, posted on X, said. “The strikes targeted multiple ISIS locations in the Syrian desert, targeting multiple ISIS senior leaders.”
It is unclear if the targeted senior leaders were included in the 35 operatives killed. There are “no indications” of civilian casualties, CENTCOM said.
Monday’s strikes are the latest in what appears to be an uptick of operations against ISIS in the Middle East, which have now resulted in dozens of operatives being killed. Asked this month if the seemingly increased operations translated to ISIS regrouping in the region, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said their footprint “has spread to other parts of the world” but that it didn’t mean there was a resurgence, only “that they still remain a threat.”
Less than a week ago, US and Iraq forces carried out an operation against ISIS operatives in Anbar province in Iraq; two days earlier, a separate raid and strikes on multiple ISIS locations in central Iraq killed at least seven operatives and left two US service members wounded.
The two wounded Americans have since been transferred to Walter Reed Medical Center for follow-on care. A third US service member was being assessed for traumatic brain injury.
Earlier this month, Iraqi Security Forces killed four ISIS members, including a senior leader. And in August, 14 militants were killed in a joint US-Iraqi forces raid, including four ISIS leaders.

CNN,RFK Jr. said Trump promised him ‘control’ of HHS and USDA | CNN Politics,"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told supporters on Monday that former President Donald Trump has promised to give him “control” of several public health agencies, including the US Department of Health and Human Services and the US Department of Agriculture, if he wins a second term in November.
Kennedy, who suspended his independent presidential campaign in August and endorsed Trump, said during a livestreamed organizing event that Trump told him he’d oversee a vast public health portfolio if the former president returns to the White House, and added that he’d prioritize his agenda for “making America healthy.”
“The key that I think I’m – you know, that President Trump has promised me is – is control of the public health agencies, which are HHS and its sub-agencies, CDC, FDA, NIH and a few others, and then also the USDA, which is – which, you know, is key to making America healthy. Because we’ve got to get off of seed oils, and we’ve got to get off of pesticide intensive agriculture,” Kennedy said, according to video of the event obtained by CNN.
CNN has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment.
Trump has previously told CNN he would consider appointing Kennedy to a role in a potential second administration. Following Kennedy’s endorsement in August, Trump committed to including Kennedy on a panel that would investigate the rise in diagnoses of chronic diseases should he return to the White House. Kennedy serves on Trump’s transition team and has been campaigning as a surrogate for him in key battleground states since exiting the presidential race.
On Sunday, Trump said during a campaign rally in New York that he would let Kennedy “go wild on food” and “go wild on medicines” if he wins in November.
Kennedy has been one of the leading proponents of anti-vaccine conspiracy theories in the United States. He made false attacks on the safety and efficacy of vaccines and sharp criticisms of public health and agriculture policy a centerpiece of his presidential campaign.

CNN,Trump floats ending the federal income tax. Here’s what that would mean | CNN Politics,"After promising to eliminate taxes on tips, Social Security benefits and overtime pay, former President Donald Trump is taking aim at the largest levy of them all — the federal income tax.
With Election Day around the corner, Trump talked about his interest in ending the federal income tax in two high-profile interviews this week, harking back to the late 19th century, when the US relied on tariffs to fund federal spending. The former president has vowed to broadly impose tariffs, arguing they can generate trillions of dollars in revenue.
Speaking with barbers in the Bronx, New York, in a segment aired on Fox News on Monday, Trump said, “There is a way, if what I’m planning comes out.”
“When we were a smart country, in the 1890s … this is when the country was relatively the richest it ever was. It had all tariffs. It didn’t have an income tax,” Trump said after a barber asked whether it would be possible to jettison the federal income tax. “Now we have income taxes, and we have people that are dying. They’re paying tax, and they don’t have the money to pay the tax.”
A few days later, podcaster Joe Rogan asked Trump whether he was serious about replacing federal income taxes with tariffs.
“Yeah, sure, why not?” Trump said during his interview Friday on “The Joe Rogan Experience.”
Trump, who also floated the idea of ending the federal income tax in June, has not said whether he would eliminate federal corporate income and payroll taxes or just the individual income tax — which raises about half of the nearly $5 trillion in revenue that the federal government collects.
By contrast, tariffs bring in about 2% of federal revenue.
Eliminating the income tax could be a future “aspirational goal,” Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters Saturday, noting that the former president’s top priorities would be extending the expiring provisions of his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and implementing the targeted tax cuts that Trump has rolled out.
‘Mathematically impossible’
Sweeping tariffs are a cornerstone of Trump’s economic platform for a second term, if he is elected. He has called for an across-the-board tariff of either 10% or 20% on all imports into the US, as well as a tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports.
The former president argues that tariffs, which he imposed to a lesser extent during his first term, would pay for his pricey array of proposals. He has repeatedly denied that American consumers would bear the brunt of the tariffs, inaccurately claiming that foreign countries would pay the levies.
Many federal budget experts, however, have poured cold water on the notion that tariffs could replace income taxes.
“It’s an absurd idea for many reasons, the biggest being that it is mathematically impossible to replace the income tax with tariffs,” Erica York, senior economist and research director at the right-leaning Tax Foundation, told CNN. “Imports are a much smaller tax base than taxable income, and there’s no way to squeeze enough revenue from taxing imports to fully replace taxing income. A swap like this would hike taxes on working-class taxpayers and invite harmful retaliation against US exports.”
Increasing tariffs would likely prompt Americans to purchase fewer imported goods, canceling out at least part of the hoped-for revenues, Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the right-leaning Manhattan Institute, told CNN.
“At first blush, fully replacing $2.4 trillion in income taxes would require a 75% tariff on America’s $3.2 trillion in annual imports,” he said. “However, even that unrealistically assumes that Americans continue purchasing the same imports at nearly double the price.”
What’s more, Trump had to spend part of the revenue raised from the tariffs he imposed in his first term bailing out industries, including agriculture, that were hurt by other nations’ retaliatory actions, Riedl said.
“So even the new revenues from Trump’s next round of tariffs may not provide much net budget savings,” he continued.
Even without eliminating the federal income tax, Trump’s economic package would increase the national debt by $7.5 trillion over a decade, according to a recent analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The nonpartisan watchdog group estimates that his tariffs proposal would bring in $2.7 trillion over 10 years.",26/10/2024
CNN,Democratic divisions over Israel heat up over Gaza hospital blast controversy | CNN Politics,"Democrats on Capitol Hill are furious over Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib’s refusal to retract or add new context to her statements blaming Israel for the deadly blast that devastated a Gaza hospital, killing hundreds of people and setting off a regional backlash against the US and Israel.
Tlaib’s initial social media posts reflected the early Hamas-sourced reports out of Gaza. But those reports are now at odds with initial American intelligence, which subsequently concluded that the Israel Defense Forces were not responsible for the explosion.
The dispute has laid bare long-standing and increasingly passionate disagreements among congressional Democrats over the party’s relationship with Israel – and, now, how to position the party as the deadly conflict in Israel and Gaza escalates.
Mainstream Democrats, led by President Joe Biden, continue to insist on staunch support for Israel, while some progressive House members are becoming more insistent that the US aggressively push for a ceasefire and hold Israel accountable for alleged war crimes against Palestinians. And within the progressive bloc too, high-profile members such as New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have occasionally diverged, at least rhetorically, from their ideological allies and have spoken in more cautious, conciliatory tones. The political director for Rep. Ro Khanna, another influential progressive, resigned because the California Democrat did not sign a resolution calling for a ceasefire.
Tlaib, a Palestinian American and a longtime advocate for Palestinian rights, has been the most outspoken critic of Israel in Congress since her election in 2018. Her insistence on blaming Israel for the blast, which the US believes was struck by an errant rocket launched by extremist group Islamic Jihad, has roiled colleagues determined to present a united front at a harrowing time.
“That’s a vile position to take,” Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz told CNN, suggesting that Tlaib should review intelligence made available to House members. “She should at least pull those tweets down, instead of remaining entrenched in a position that is dangerous and unacceptable.”
Democrats have mostly been measured in their public comments about Tlaib, expressing frustration with her unyielding position in light of the conflicting reports and new evidence that Israel was not responsible for the hospital blast while also blaming the media over its coverage of the tragedy.
“When Israel makes statements, they have to show satellite imagery and all sorts of video. But when Hamas says something, the entire media world ran with it.” Florida Rep. Jared Moskowitz said. “It caused riots in all sorts of countries. It caused meetings to be canceled for the president. And so everyone has to be careful before they just react, and wait for things to be confirmed.”
But the effort to project unity could soon become untenable – and the divisions are becoming more personal.
According to a source with knowledge of the complaints, some Jewish Democrats have privately complained to Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries’ team about comments from Tlaib and Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, who initially echoed reports blaming Israel for the hospital attack before posting additional context about the hospital explosion and acknowledging the US intelligence assessment. (Jeffries has embraced the US and Israeli intelligence conclusions and a spokesperson said in a statement that Jeffries, like Biden, backs Israel’s “unequivocal right to defend itself against Hamas under the established rules of war and strongly disagrees with any effort to blame President Joe Biden or the policies of his administration.”)
Tlaib’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the matter, but the Michigan Democrat appeared at a Wednesday rally on Capitol Hill and continued to blame Israel.
“That’s what’s been really painful – just continue to watch people think it’s OK to bomb a hospital, where children,” Tlaib said. “What’s so hard sometimes is watching those videos and the people telling the kids, ‘Don’t cry.’ But like, let them cry. And they’re shaking, and somebody – you know this – they keep telling them not to cry in Arabic. They can cry, I can cry, we all can cry. If we’re not crying, something is wrong.”
“People are furious,” one House Democrat told CNN about the reaction to Tlaib’s comments. “The intelligence that we’ve received is clear. Do you believe Hamas’ intel or do you believe the United States’ intelligence?”
There’s now a push among some House Democrats to convince Tlaib to get an intelligence briefing on the hospital strike, according to the source.
Another House Democrat felt that Tlaib’s comments were frustrating but not entirely unexpected and that her colleagues are taking different approaches to addressing them. Some have been speaking out publicly while others are giving Tlaib space to walk back her comments.
Some Democrats pointed to a social media post by Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman as summing up the way a lot of them are feeling right now.
“It’s truly disturbing that Members of Congress rushed to blame Israel for the hospital tragedy in Gaza,” Fetterman wrote. ” Who would take the word of a group that just massacred innocent Israeli citizens over our key ally?”
Another Democratic aide, though, argued that the pushback against Tlaib and Omar undermined the Democratic Party’s brand.
“Part of being a ‘diversity party’ and a ‘big tent party’ includes bringing new voices who have been marginalized into the party,” the aide said. “And Muslim Americans have been some of the most marginalized people in American life for the past two decades.”
“No one in Congress is denying the horror of Hamas or the horror of the thousands of Israelis killed and the largest attack on Jews since the Holocaust,” the aide said, adding that the frustration among Muslim Americans – and some Jewish Americans – lies in “one side with very little political power receiving all of the outrage.”
Former House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, downplayed the discord in the caucus.
“Name me more than four people,” Hoyer told CNN, in an apparent reference to the original “squad” of Tlaib, Omar, Ocasio Cortez and Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley. “Do we have some people that have a different view? We do. But it’s not the position of the party.”
But the ranks of the dissenters have grown since then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi first offered a similarly dismissive assessment of the squad members in 2019. Progressives now make up a growing share of the House Democratic Caucus. More than a dozen Democratic members have so far publicly called for a ceasefire, including those who signed a proposed resolution by Missouri Rep. Cori Bush, a newer squad member.
“I am grieving for every Palestinian, Israeli, and American life lost to this violence, and my heart breaks for all those who will be forever traumatized because of it,” Bush said in an accompanying statement. “War and retaliatory violence doesn’t achieve accountability or justice; it only leads to more death and human suffering.”",20/10/2023
CNN,Donald Trump campaign manager shared posts in 2021 saying Trump’s lies caused the violence on January 6 | CNN Politics,"In the immediate aftermath of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, a number of conservatives and Republicans broke ranks with then-President Donald Trump and blamed him for the violence that day. Among them was Trump’s current campaign manager, Chris LaCivita.
In a series of reposts on X – formerly Twitter – LaCivita shared comments calling January 6 an “insurrection” that was fueled by Trump’s baseless election lies. Some of those posts have since been deleted from LaCivita’s feed, but CNN was able to review them on the Internet Archive WayBack Machine, which archives internet webpages.
On January 6, 2021, LaCivita reposted several posts that harshly condemned Trump, suggesting that even some of his closest allies once viewed the deadly outcome as a direct result of Trump’s lies.
In a statement to CNN, Lacivita said his likes and retweets on January 6 were not supportive statements.
“Retweets and likes are not endorsements. I’m focused on winning the election two weeks from now, and not distractions from CNN,” he said.
LaCivita’s shared posts included a statement on January 6 from former President George W. Bush, who expressed “disbelief and dismay” at the violent assault on the Capitol, calling it “a sickening and heartbreaking sight.”
“I am appalled by the reckless behavior of some political leaders since the election and by the lack of respect shown today for our institutions, our traditions, and our law enforcement,” read the statement by Bush that LaCivita shared. “The violent assault on the Capitol – and disruption of a Constitutionally-mandated meeting of Congress – was undertaken by people whose passions have been inflamed by falsehoods and false hopes.”
The post, which was shared on the evening of January 6, was later deleted from LaCivita’s feed.
CNN also reviewed a video showing a screen recording of posts that LaCivita liked on January 6, including one from Republican former Rep. Barbara Comstock of Virginia, who called for Trump’s Cabinet to remove him from office via the 25th Amendment.
“Twitter locked @realDonaldTrump for 12 hours. Now the Cabinet needs to lock him down for the next 14 days. #25thAmendmentNow,” Comstock wrote on the evening of January 6.
Although X has since removed the ability to view likes, a user whose tweet was liked by LaCivita confirmed to CNN that his post had indeed been liked by Trump’s campaign manager on January 6.
The 25th Amendment allows the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet to declare the president unfit for office, temporarily transferring power to the vice president.
Another post shared by LaCivita was a stark message from a Republican Senate aide, which John McCormack, then a reporter for the conservative magazine National Review, shared on X.
“Text message from a GOP Senate aide: ‘This is a disgusting tragedy. Someone literally lost their life because of a lie that Trump told, Cruz/Hawley capitalized on, and fringe media echoed. This is in no way shape or form sustainable.’”
Another since-removed post from LaCivita’s feed included a comment calling those who stormed the Capitol “thugs.” The comment from a GOP political staffer linked to a CNN tweet reading, “Pro-Trump protesters have stormed the US Capitol, where members of Congress were meeting to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s win.”
“They are not protestors. They are thugs,” the post read.
The shared comments by LaCivita, the top staffer for Trump’s quest to retake the White House this November, are notable as the former president in the closing weeks of the campaign has sought to recast the events that day.
On social media, Trump has shared unfounded conspiracies suggesting the riot was an inside job perpetrated by the federal government. He has also called the rally and events preceding it as a day of “love and peace,” and suggested that if he regains the White House, he will pardon January 6 rioters convicted of violent acts that day.
During a Univision town hall last week, Trump defended his supporters’ actions, claiming they stormed the Capitol because they believed the election was “rigged.” He continued to mischaracterize the day’s events, stating, “That was a day of love from the standpoint of the millions.”
Last week, on Truth Social, Trump also shared a post calling January 6 “the day the government staged a riot.”
The unfounded conspiracy theory that the federal government staged the January 6 attack has been widely debunked as baseless.
LaCivita, a longtime Republican political strategist with a career working on high-profile campaigns throughout Virginia and nationally, has served in the role of co-campaign manager for Donald Trump’s third presidential bid with fellow seasoned political operative Susie Wiles since 2023.
He first gained national recognition during the 2004 presidential election for his role in the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth campaign, the group that sought to undermine and attack Democratic nominee John Kerry’s military record.",23/10/2024
CNN,New House speaker once partnered with so-called ‘ex-gay’ conversion group | CNN Politics,"Speaker of the House Mike Johnson closely collaborated with a group in the mid-to-late 2000s that promoted “conversion therapy,” a discredited practice that asserted it could change the sexual orientation of gay and lesbian individuals.
Prior to launching his political career, Johnson, a lawyer, gave legal advice to an organization called Exodus International and partnered with the group to put on an annual anti-gay event aimed at teens, according to a CNN KFile review of more than a dozen of Johnson’s media appearances from that timespan.
Founded in 1976, Exodus International was a leader in the so-called “ex-gay” movement, which aimed to make gay individuals straight through conversion therapy programs using religious and counseling methods. Exodus International connected ministries across the world using these controversial approaches.
The group shut down in 2013, with its founder posting a public apology for the “pain and hurt” his organization caused. Conversion therapy has been widely condemned by most major medical institutions and has been shown to be harmful to struggling LGBTQ people.
At the time, Johnson worked as an attorney for the socially conservative legal advocacy group, Alliance Defense Fund (ADF). He and his group collaborated with Exodus from 2006 to 2010.
For years, Johnson and Exodus worked on an event started by ADF in 2005 known as the “Day of Truth” – a counterprotest to the “Day of Silence,” a day in schools in which students stayed silent to bring awareness to bullying faced by LGBTQ youth.
The Day of Truth sought to counter that silence by distributing information about what Johnson described as the “dangerous” gay lifestyle.
“I mean, our race, the size of our feet, the color of our eyes, these are things we’re born with and we cannot change,” Johnson told one radio host in 2008 promoting the event. “What these adult advocacy groups like the Gay Lesbian Straight Education Network are promoting is a type of behavior. Homosexual behavior is something you do, it’s not something that you are.”
In print, radio and on television, Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, frequently disparaged homosexuality, according to KFile’s review. He advocated for the criminalization of gay sex and went so far as to partially blame it for the fall of the Roman Empire.
“Some credit to the fall of Rome to not only the deprivation of the society and the loss of morals, but also to the rampant homosexual behavior that was condoned by the society,” Johnson told a radio host in 2008.
Johnson’s office did not respond to a CNN request for comment asking about his work with Exodus.
A close collaboration
Exodus International joined ADF’s Day of Truth event in 2006 and the groups worked together on promotional material for the event, including a standalone website which pointed users to Exodus’ conversion ministries. Documents on that website cited the since-repudiated academic work in support of conversion therapy. Exodus Youth, the group’s youth wing, promoted the event within its blogs.
Videos put out by Exodus and ADF on their standalone Day of Truth website featured two Exodus staffers speaking about how teens didn’t need to “accept” or “embrace” their homosexuality. The videos featured testimonials of a “former-homosexual” and “former lesbian.”
Documents on the website were not archived online but were saved by anti-conversion therapy groups such as Truth Wins Out in 2007 and 2008. The website featured a FAQ on homosexuality provided by Exodus and sold t-shirts saying, “the Truth cannot be silenced.”
One video featured Johnson, who was later quoted in a press release on Exodus International’s website ahead of the event, saying, “An open, honest discussion allows truth to rise to the surface.”
Johnson promoted the event heavily in the media – through radio interviews, comments in newspapers, and an editorial. In interviews, he repeatedly cited the case of a teen who went to school after the Day of Silence wearing a shirt that read, “Be ashamed. Our school has embraced what God has condemned” and “Homosexuality is shameful.” The teen was suspended and ADF represented him in legal action over the incident. The case was dismissed because the teen graduated, and the court found he no longer had standing to challenge the dress code.
“Day of Truth was really established to counter the promotion of the homosexual agenda in public schools,” Johnson told a radio host in 2008.
Those who worked to counter ADF and Exodus at the time, said the event was dangerous to confused youth.
“This directly harmed LGBTQ youth,” Wayne Besen, the executive director of Truth Wins Out and an expert on the ex-gay industry, told CNN. “This is someone whose core was promoting anti-gay and ex-gay viewpoints. He wouldn’t pander to anti-gay advocates, he was the anti-gay and ex-gay advocate.”
Randy Scobey, a former executive vice president at Exodus, who worked on the Day of Truth in the organization’s collaboration with ADF, called the event one of his biggest regrets.
“It was bullying those who were trying to not be bullied,” said Scobey, who now lives openly as a gay man. “That was one of the public ways that the Alliance Defense Fund worked with us.”
Ties between Exodus and ADF extended beyond the event.
ADF, which has since changed its name to the Alliance Defending Freedom, touted Exodus International in promotional brochures in 2004, crediting it as an organization that “played an instrumental role in helping thousands of individuals come out of homosexual behavior.”
Scobey recalled Johnson as quiet, but firm in his beliefs that homosexuality was wrong. He said Johnson and ADF provided crucial legal advice to Exodus and its “member ministries.”
“We worked with them behind the scenes a lot,” Scobey told CNN, saying the group offered them legal guidance over their ex-gay counseling. “They were very important to us as far as helping us to feel more secure legally and politically.”
Exodus International stopped sponsoring the Day of Truth event in 2010, saying it became adversarial and counterproductive.

CNN,Analysis: What is the ‘red mirage’ or the ‘blue shift’ and will it happen this year? | CNN Politics,"A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.
It’s been called the “red mirage” or the “blue shift.”
It’s the recent phenomenon by which an apparent Republican lead early after polls close on election night is erased by the counting of mail-in ballots later in the evening or in the days after Election Day.
Former President Donald Trump has pointed to the red mirage to back up his baseless allegations of election fraud, when in fact it has been a function of the rise of mail-in voting and the often-peculiar rules about when those ballots can be counted.
What happened in 2020?
When most Americans went to bed on election night in 2020, on November 3, the end result was far from clear.
The contest between then-President Trump and now-President Joe Biden was still too early to call in the key states of Arizona, North Carolina, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Maine, Georgia and Pennsylvania.
The following days would include dramatic hours spent watching the counting of votes in these states. The vote count didn’t reflect a Biden lead in Georgia until early in the morning of November 6, when, as CNN’s Phil Mattingly showed viewers on the Magic Wall, small batches of votes were being counted and affecting the very close election.
CNN was able to project that Biden would win the election four days after Election Day, on November 7, but counting would continue. An analysis by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that counties won by Biden counted slower, on average, than counties won by Trump.
There was also a blue shift in 2016, but it was not decisive. As CNN’s Marshall Cohen wrote, when Hillary Clinton offered her concession and admitted her loss to Americans the day after Election Day, she was still behind in the popular vote. While the trickle-in of ballots was not enough to get her the White House, it was more than enough to give her an edge of millions of ballots in the popular vote.
In 2020, the slowest-counting states were places like California, which are heavily Democratic and where every registered voter is sent a mail-in ballot. That means a blue shift in the popular vote could still occur even if it does not delay figuring out the presidential election results.
It’s important to remember that while news networks like CNN might project a winner when it is clear who will win, the races are not officially certified until later. Certification deadlines vary from state to state, but they all have until December 11, 2024, to complete recounts, if needed, and settle disputes around presidential results.
How long will it take this year?
There is some indication that things could go quicker in some key states.
In Georgia, a new election law means more people will vote early in person rather than by mail, which could speed up the process of counting mail-in ballots. North Carolina no longer accepts mail-in ballots if they arrive after Election Day.
The Brennan Center for Justice, which tracks election-related laws, has a rundown of potential choke points.
Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, said recently on CBS’ “Face the Nation” that he expects the vast majority of ballots to be processed and counted in the hours after polls close.
“All early votes and all early accepted ballots, they all will have to have their results reported by 8 p.m. That’s 70, maybe even 75% of all the vote totals will be reported no later than 8 p.m. on election night,” he said. But if the election in Georgia is as close in 2024 as it was in 2020, the outcome may still not be clear.
Raffensperger was asked if it could take a week to determine the winner in Georgia.
“Absolutely not,” he said. “What we will be waiting for is the overseas ballots that come in no later than Friday, and so those will then be the final numbers. And we’ll just see if that makes the difference in the total vote totals.”
Other states, like the key battlegrounds of Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, have not made it possible for election officials to process any ballots before Election Day. But the count could be faster in those places as well, with more experience and fewer ballots to handle when compared with the pandemic-era 2020 election. The Center for Election Innovation & Research has a rundown of the various rules and timelines for processing mail-in ballots.
In Michigan, another key state where processing of ballots can occur before Election Day, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson was also asked by CBS about how long it will take to count ballots. Benson, a Democrat, said she hopes to know the outcome by the end of Wednesday, November 6, a day after polls close.
“We will always prioritize accuracy and security over efficiency,” she said.
Close elections can take time to figure out
In the event of tight margins, it could still take days.
The top elections official in Pennsylvania is Republican Al Schmidt, who told NPR recently that people need to trust the system in the period after polls close.
“In 2020 … we saw that window of time between the polls being closed at 8 p.m. on election night and the race being called as a period of vulnerability where people were seeking to undermine confidence in the results,” he said, noting that in the end, after all the votes were counted, the Pennsylvania results were not that close.
The closest elections can take time, as anyone who is old enough to remember 2000 can attest. A close election in Florida was paired with a flawed punch-ballot system that left some ballots with “hanging chads” up for debate.
The outcome of the election that year dragged on for more than a month – 36 days until the US Supreme Court halted a partial Florida recount and essentially handed the election to George W. Bush. Then-Vice President Al Gore conceded on December 13 and then became one of just three vice presidents to oversee the counting of electoral votes in their own defeat. Harris could be the fourth. Or the first since George H.W. Bush to oversee their own victory.
In the same way that no one knows who will win the 2024 election, it’s also not entirely clear how long determining the winner this year will take.",27/10/2024
CNN,"Chinese hackers targeted Eric Trump’s and Jared Kushner’s call data, sources say | CNN Politics","US officials believe Chinese government-linked hackers targeted Eric Trump’s and Jared Kushner’s call and text data as the scale of a sweeping cyber-espionage campaign targeting senior figures in both the Republican and Democratic parties comes into focus just days before the US election, with dozens of people believed to be impacted, three people familiar with the matter told CNN.
Former President Donald Trump’s son and son-in-law join a growing list of top political figures whose phone communications US officials believe were targeted by the elite Chinese hacking team. Other targets include Trump himself, his running mate JD Vance and people affiliated with the Harris-Walz campaign, CNN previously reported. The hackers also targeted prominent Democrats including the staff of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, another source briefed on the matter told CNN.
The scope of the hack is “way worse than the public knows” and officials are still sifting through the intrusions to determine the impact, another source familiar with the intelligence told CNN.
In some cases, the hackers may have had access to the call and text data of their targets for many months, the two sources said. The FBI has been notifying those whose phone data was targeted.
The New York Times was first to report that Eric Trump and Kushner had been targeted.
US officials investigating the hacking campaign, which came via intrusions at US telecom firms AT&T, Lumen and Verizon, consider it to be among the most concerning national security-related hacks in recent memory and more serious than initial press reports suggested.
And the timing of the revelations means the FBI is carrying out a high-stakes and delicate investigation into hacking aimed at both the Trump and Harris campaigns days from a hugely consequential election.
The hackers do not appear to be trying to influence the election itself, as the Iranians who breached the Trump campaign earlier this year attempted to do, according to US officials. But they are trying to collect intelligence on the private communications of senior officials from both parties that would be of keen interest to Beijing.
Investigators believe the hackers are also likely searching for other sensitive national security information, including, in some cases, information on wiretap warrant requests made by the Justice Department, CNN previously reported.
‘Real-time wiretapping’
“It’s real-time wiretapping,” one of the sources told CNN, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive and ongoing investigation. “They flat-out hacked the system that the Department of Justice requires [telecom firms] to maintain for lawful access.”
“We might as well let Huawei come into the network,” the source added, referring to the Chinese telecommunication giant that the US has imposed restrictions on banned from federal networks over spying concerns.
Eric Trump regularly appears with his father on the campaign trail and has served as one of the most prominent surrogates for his father, holding campaign events across the country. Eric’s wife Lara was tapped as co-chair of the Republican National Committee earlier this year.
Kushner has been barely visible this campaign cycle. Two years ago, his wife Ivanka Trump announced she and Kushner would be taking a step back from politics to focus on their family.
“Does this surprise anyone? Under Kamala and Biden, China has walked all over our country,” Eric Trump said in a statement to CNN.
There are no indications anyone was able to access data related to Jared Kushner or his devices, a person familiar with the matter told CNN.
CNN has asked the Trump campaign for comment. The Chinese Embassy in Washington, DC, has denied that Beijing-backed hackers have breached US telecom firms, calling that information “a distortion of the fact.”
The FBI declined to comment. In a statement last week, the FBI and US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency confirmed they were investigating “unauthorized access to commercial telecommunications infrastructure by actors affiliated with the People’s Republic of China,” but did not specify who was targeted.
The Trump campaign is operating under the assumption that the hackers could still have access to the phone communications they targeted that belong to Trump and Vance, two of the sources said. The campaign has changed some security protocols, including by rotating the use of phones, to try to evade the surveillance, one of the sources said.
Evicting hackers has proved difficult
Evicting the hackers from the telecom networks has proved difficult. The hackers are blending in with benign internet traffic in routers and switches, making them difficult to find, multiple other sources familiar with their techniques told CNN.
The FBI was watching the Chinese hackers operate in the telecom networks after US officials first learned of the intrusions, one of the sources familiar with the matter said. After the Wall Street Journal first reported on the seriousness of the hack this month, the hackers took additional steps to try to elude US investigators, according to the source, who likened it to a game of cat and mouse.
The White House has convened an interagency team to oversee the response to the hack, a move typically reserved for major cybersecurity incidents, three US officials familiar with the matter told CNN. The Washington Post first reported on that process being activated.
Meanwhile, a Department of Homeland Security-led group of cybersecurity experts that probes major hacking incidents plans to investigate the root causes of the Chinese hacking campaign, a DHS official told CNN.
On Capitol Hill, the alleged Chinese hack is such a sensitive matter that normally garrulous lawmakers clam up at the mention of it.
“This is a very serious breach that the committee is monitoring on a daily basis,” Sen. Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat who chairs the intelligence committee, told CNN earlier this month. He repeated the same sentence when asked for more details and said he couldn’t share anything more.
Given how pervasive the Chinese hacking campaign has been in US telecom networks, some US allies are checking their own computer networks for signs of compromise. Officials in the United Kingdom, for example, have been on high alert for evidence of any impact in the UK from the hacks but so far have found none, a UK official familiar with the matter told CNN.
The ongoing Chinese hacking campaign means that the next administration — whether Trump or Harris wins — will likely inherit another major cybersecurity incident with big implications for national security. When President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, the US government was still dealing with the fallout of a sophisticated hack by Russian intelligence that infiltrated software made by the tech firm SolarWinds to breach multiple US government agencies.

CNN,Analysis: How ‘brat summer’ set up Kamala Harris’ remarkable run | CNN Politics,"Editor’s Note: This is the third of a five-part series that tells the story of the closing months of the 2024 presidential campaign, starting with the June debate between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. Read the first and second installments.
“It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your president.”
Joe Biden is out.
More than five decades after he won a county council seat in Wilmington, he is less than two hours away at his Delaware beach home when he gives up his fight to hold the Oval Office. His decision is made on a weekend spent with his family and closest advisers, and in such secrecy even people close to him are telling CNN’s MJ Lee just hours earlier there is no way he will quit. They were not deceiving her, she will conclude, they just didn’t know.
“The inner circle that was always really small got even smaller,” she says of the endgame.
The tipping point appears to have been a talk with House Speaker Emeritus Nancy Pelosi, in which she predicted a Biden loss would produce an avalanche of defeats for other Democrats fighting for control of Congress. As Lee puts it, “She said to him, per our reporting, the polling shows you’re going to lose and you’re going to bring the House down with you.” Months later, Pelosi will tell The Guardian that she and Biden have not spoken since and that some of his allies have not forgiven her.
Biden announces his decision on social media on July 21, then talks about it on television a few days later.
“I revere this office. But I love my country more,” he says from the White House, which he will now have to vacate at the start of the new year. By all accounts, it has been a tortuous decision for this man who suffered publicly through the deaths of his first wife and daughter in an auto accident in the 1970s and the loss of a beloved son to cancer almost 10 years ago.
As Biden speaks, it is easy to see another grief piling atop the grandeur of his life. “America’s going to have to choose between moving forward and moving backward, between hope and hate, between unity and division,” he says in a parting shot at Donald Trump. “We have to decide if we still believe in honesty, decency, respect, freedom, justice and democracy.”
Any hope Democrats had that such appeals to principle would triumph have so far been fruitless. Trump’s preening, divisive words at the Republican National Convention have cost him nothing. He did not get much of a “convention bounce” in the polls. Candidates rarely do anymore. But his numbers are still firm, the attempt on his life has slightly boosted his approval ratings, and Team Trump remains confident it has the race in hand. Sort of.
A bold headline in The Atlantic in early July had proclaimed, “Trump is Planning on a Landslide Win.” That possibility, however, was anchored in the predictability of the race against Biden, whose departure has dismantled the Trump team’s careful plans. “They were pretty surprised and unpleasantly surprised,” Atlantic writer Tim Alberta tells NPR’s Michel Martin, “because this was who they wanted to run against. Make no mistake, Joe Biden was the optimal target, they felt, for Donald Trump in this campaign.”
Biden’s withdrawal is almost Trumpian in that it is unexpected, unprecedented and has released unpredictable forces. Chief among them, the person the outgoing president tapped to replace him on the ticket, Vice President Kamala Harris.
“Joe Biden’s legacy of accomplishment over the past three years is unmatched in modern history,” she says in her first stop in front of cameras after he steps aside, “and we are deeply, deeply grateful for his service to our nation.” Focusing on a note of thanks rather than a campaign message is a gracious move in the eyes of some White House watchers, but it is also tactical.
For weeks, plenty of possible heirs to the nomination have been floated. Governors including California’s Gavin Newsom, Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer, Illinois’ J.B. Pritzker, Kentucky’s Andy Beshear, Maryland’s Wes Moore and Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro. Sens. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Joe Manchin of West Virginia were bandied. Biden’s transportation secretary, Pete Buttigieg, has been in the mix.
Some politicos speculated that the mix of oversize egos and opportunity could explode into a vicious floor fight at the Democratic National Convention less than a month away. Yet the ascension of Harris, coupled with her praise of Biden, produces no discernable dissent. Biden paved the way by choosing her. Harris helps herself by reaching out to influential and powerful Democrats, saying she is not just asking for their support but is committed to winning it.
At the vice president’s residence and office on the grounds of the Naval Observatory, Harris (who learned Biden was stepping aside shortly before he told the nation) goes into a marathon of 100 straight calls. “She just sat there and did one phone call after another,” Lee says. The pieces come together and are welded tight by party leaders who recognize skipping over a Black woman in such a natural seat of succession could be perilous.
Ashley Etienne previously served as a communications director for Harris and Pelosi, and she was a special assistant to former President Barack Obama. “People understood that if you didn’t choose Kamala Harris, you’d have a big problem with your base voters,” Etienne says. “You would almost have a civil war within the Democratic Party.”
Less than two days after Biden withdraws, Harris has the firm commitment of enough delegates to know the nomination is hers. Democrats breathe a sigh of relief. Republicans do not. In his infamous golf cart takedown of Biden weeks earlier, Trump had dismissed Harris’ chances with the bravado of a duffer about to hook his ball into the deep woods. “She’s so bad,” he growled. “She’s so pathetic. She’s so f**king bad.”
The Harris team seamlessly takes over the Biden organization, the campaign rakes in $126 million in donations over the first couple of days, and more than 100,000 new volunteers sign up for duty. Democratic organizers in states that seemed all but lost start recalibrating their party’s chances. Where no official campaign yard signs for Harris can be found, fans are making them. Coconuts are in vogue based on a lesson about community the new candidate says she learned from her mother: “She would give us a hard time sometimes and she would say to us, ‘I don’t know what’s wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree? You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.’”
Charli XCX posts on X, “Kamala IS brat.” The term was spun out of the British pop star’s hot new album, and she says it means “that girl who is a little messy, and likes to party, and like maybe says some, like, dumb things sometimes… is very honest, is very blunt, a little bit volatile… that’s brat.” Young women flood social media with pro-Harris “brat” memes.
“I’ve never seen energy like this, this time in an election cycle,” says Ron Bieber, head of the AFL-CIO in battleground Michigan.
Harris storms into Wisconsin for her first rally since becoming the Democratic candidate, where she paints Trump as little more than a common criminal. She says as a prosecutor she “took on perpetrators of all kinds: Predators who abused women; fraudsters who ripped off consumers; cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain,” adding, “so hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump’s type.”
The crowd explodes with cheers and chants of “Lock him up!” Alternating between broad smiles and fervor, Harris talks about building up the middle class, shutting down conservative fantasies about Project 2025, and Trump’s many failings in the eyes of her party.
Much of it is strikingly like Biden’s message, but Harris brings fresh energy and her audience plugs in, taking up the call and response when she shouts, “We’re not going back!”
The intensity of the moment seems to catch Team Trump off guard. “They say they were prepared with opposition research on everybody who could have replaced him (Biden), but it was clear that whatever they had was not sufficient in the days after she ascended to the top of the ticket,” says CNN’s Kristen Holmes, who is covering the Trump campaign.
“They had no roadmap for this,” says CNN’s Phil Mattingly about the chaotic days in Trump land after the switch on the Democratic side. “Do you know any presidential campaign built to be a multibillion-dollar enterprise (that) can all of a sudden immediately pivot out of that? Every campaign would have had a similar type of response. You have to kind of rebuild the plane while it is in the air.”
Trump’s instinct is to counterstrike, calling Harris a “radical crazy person,” a “danger to democracy,” a “socialist” and “ultraliberal.” He insists she is a champion of open borders, and an economic naif with no plan for the economy. His allies say she is afraid to submit to hard interviews – an interesting charge coming from the camp of a candidate who generally sits only for the most ingratiating media hosts. He and his supporters allege she stole the nomination, slept her way to the top, and, as a “mediocre vice president,” has advanced only because she is a minority woman being given unfair advantages.
That last slur spurs CNN political commentator Van Jones to say Trump could quickly lose some of the modest gains he’s had with Latino and Black men. “You start insulting Black women, you‘re going to see something you haven’t seen before. Black men are not going to put up with that.”
If Trump hears the warning, he doesn’t let on. At the annual convention of the National Association of Black Journalists, the former president drops jaws with a shocking claim about his opponent. “She was always of Indian heritage,” he says, “and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago, when she happened to turn Black, and now she wants to be known as Black. So I don’t know, is she Indian or is she Black?”
Harris’ father was born in Jamaica, her mother in India. She has long and publicly identified as Black and attended Howard University, a renowned name among historically Black colleges and universities.
Trump’s attack conjures memories of the way he went after Obama for five years saying the first Black president was not born in the United States and was therefore ineligible to hold the office. Only under immense pressure in the 2016 race against Hillary Clinton did Trump finally admit he was wrong.
Many of the other claims from Trump and his allies about Harris are also false, but the truth is clear: Team Trump is doing anything it can to respond to the unexpected speed and power of the Harris freight train. While repeatedly (and plenty of political observers would say purposely) mispronouncing her name, Trump tries out one of his favorite tricks for demeaning opponents. He cycles through a series of nicknames, finally landing on “Lyin’ Kamala” and “Comrade Kamala” as his favorites.
Trump does not seem to fully grasp that Harris is a formidable foe. But Democratic insiders know of her powers via what was in effect a secret weapon. Though every vice president struggles for attention in the shadow of their chief executive, in a prescient move years earlier, Harris had begun sending newsletters to top Democrats coast to coast, updating them on her accomplishments. “So although it wasn’t covered nationally,” the former aide Etienne says, “people were getting that information in their inbox. So they had no question within the caucus whether the vice president was doing anything.”
On the trail, CNN’s Alayna Treene notices Trump pining for the past. “He always says, ‘I won that first debate with Joe Biden.’ There is definitely no question that he still longs (for that time) and occasionally forgets that he’s not running against Joe Biden.”
CNN’s Jeff Zeleny puts a finer point on Trump’s reaction to his new opponent. “I don’t know that he detests Biden as much as he clearly, viscerally detests her. … This is like interlaid with sexism, racism and other stuff. He’s had plenty of women who worked for him over the years, but there was no one who looked like Kamala Harris and there was no one in a position of authority. So for sure, I think he’s had a very hard time getting his head around her as an opponent.”
When Harris picks Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance leaps into the fray. A Marine veteran, Trump’s vice presidential nominee criticizes Walz for retiring from his 24-year career in the Army National Guard not long before Walz’s unit deployed to Iraq. “When the United States Marine Corps, when the United States of America, asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it,” Vance says.
The Ohio Republican never saw combat, and Walz was not certain his fellow troops would either. Still, Walz had implied in at least one speech that he had carried a weapon in war, which was untrue. Questions also come up about Walz claiming a higher rank at retirement than the records show.
Other veterans invoke the notion of “stolen valor,” but within a few weeks Trump himself runs indirect interference for Walz. Visiting Arlington National Cemetery to honor service members killed in the chaotic US departure from Afghanistan in 2021 (which Trump is using as an election talking point), his staff gets into a confrontation with a cemetery worker. The Pentagon says Trump’s team was explicitly told it could not shoot video for political purposes on the hallowed grounds, and yet witnesses say Trump photographers tried to force their way in. Trump calls the controversy a “made up story” as pictures emerge of him grinning and giving a thumbs-up over the graves of troops.
The broader problem for the Trump-Vance ticket is that none of their attacks on the Harris-Walz team appear to be sticking with undecided, moderate voters key to victory in the deeply divided electorate. Then again, maybe that is not who Trump is seeking. In 2020, roughly a third of all eligible voters, 80 million of them, did not vote. One theory of 2024 is that Trump can win if he activates enough of those folks on the distant right to offset the voters he may not be able to reach in the middle.
It’s a risky strategy to carry into the general election, when not just Republicans are voting. But CNN’s Edward-Isaac Dovere says of Trump’s crude calculation, “He believes there is a way to get those people who want to stick it to the system.”
The voters Harris wants to add to her tally are apparent from the start: young people who were not excited about Biden, minority groups, anyone who thinks Trump is too deceitful or chaotic, disaffected Republicans if she can get them, and women. Especially women.
Roughly 57% of female voters in 2020 backed Biden. Trump had 53% of men, but that wasn’t enough to make up the difference. Trump is courting young men again, especially those with lower educational levels, by appearing at sporting events, on podcasts angled toward male audiences and by constantly pushing his “strongman” image.
By contrast, Harris is thrashing Trump over abortion rights. Biden tried to exploit Trump’s vulnerability on the issue, but Harris connects squarely. It echoes through her first, rousing commercial backed by Beyoncé’s “Freedom.” As the music builds over images of smiling Americans, Harris says, “We choose freedom. The freedom not just to get by, but to get ahead. The freedom to be safe from gun violence. The freedom to make decisions about our own body.”
In a nation where polls consistently show a large majority of voters believe abortion should be legal everywhere with only some exceptions, the issue has proved a powerful motivator. When it is put up as a ballot measure even in deeply red states, voters have chosen the abortion rights side time and again.
That puts Trump in a bind. On one hand, his evangelical followers love it when he takes credit for dismantling Roe. On the other, Trump knows that this part of his record is electoral poison to some women. His standard move when pressed is to dodge responsibility. “Every Democrat, every Republican,” he tells Fox News, “everybody wanted Roe v. Wade terminated and brought back to the states.” In person and in social media posts, he insists all legal scholars wanted it back in the hands of the states too. Those claims are not true.
To make it worse, in Alabama, where he won 62% of the vote in 2020, the state Supreme Court started 2024 by pulling the pin on a grenade and handing it to the former president. The court ruled embryos created via in vitro fertilization should be legally considered children. Health care providers and women’s rights advocates tore into the ruling, and once again questions came barreling in for Trump. Now with Harris tapping into that anger and outrage, Trump sees the thing his team fears most: movement for her in the polls.
The advantage Trump held over Biden is melting. In some places Trump and Harris are even. In others she is pulling ahead. In a few, either candidate might have the edge. But more and more, Trump is on the trailing side of the numbers just as Biden was. And pollsters are finding Harris is drawing more voters who actually like her, not just dislike Trump.
He is also about 20 years older than Harris. All the questions and smirking innuendoes about Biden’s age are now swirling around Trump as he meanders through speeches, mangles words and suffers occasional memory lapses.
And Harris is pressing for a debate of her own. Almost as soon as she began this sped-up campaign, she said she wanted to go ahead with the debate already planned for ABC News in the waning days of summer. “I think that the voters deserve to see the split screen that exists in this race on a debate stage and so, I’m ready. Let’s go,” she said.
When Trump waffles, her surrogates accuse him of being afraid. Her campaign posts video of him overlaid with the sound of a clucking chicken. Trump, who so often delights fans by bullying his opponents, is on the unfamiliar receiving end and uncharacteristically unable to flip the script.
Under building pressure, he finally agrees to share the stage with Harris. Same rules as before. On September 10, the two presidential hopefuls will meet. Or as some might see it, the brat and the bully will have a showdown.

CNN,Fact-checking Harris’ CNN town hall in Pennsylvania | CNN Politics,"Vice President Kamala Harris joined CNN’s Anderson Cooper for a town hall in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania on Wednesday night, where she faced questions directly from persuadable and undecided voters less than two weeks before Americans head to the polls on Election Day. Former President Donald Trump was invited but declined to participate in a CNN town hall.
Here is a fact check of some of the remarks made by Harris:
Harris on Trump’s tariff plan
Vice President Kamala Harris said that former President Donald Trump has a plan to put in place a “national sales tax of at least 20% on everyday goods and necessities” that would cost American consumers an additional $4,000 a year.
Facts First: The claim is reasonable enough, but it’s worth explaining that Harris is referring to Trump’s proposal to implement new tariffs if he returns to the White House.
Trump has repeatedly said he plans to impose an across-the-board tariff of either 10% or 20% on every import coming into the US, as well as a tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports. He’s also floated a 100% or 200% tariff on cars made in Mexico or on products made by companies that move manufacturing from the US to Mexico.
Together, a 20% across-the-board tariff with a 60% tariff on Chinese-made goods would amount to about a $3,900 annual tax increase for a middle-income family, according to the Center for American Progress Action Fund, a liberal think tank.
If the 20% tariff was just 10%, as Trump sometimes suggests, the total impact for middle-class families could be $2,500 a year, according to CAP.
Separate studies estimate that the impact of Trump’s proposed tariffs would also raise prices for families, but by a lower amount. The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimated the new duties would cost the average middle-class household about $1,700 annually. And the Tax Policy Center said the impact could be $1,350 a year for middle-income households.

Harris on her fracking record
In a back-and-forth with CNN’s Anderson Cooper on Wednesday, Vice President Kamala Harris said, “No, Anderson, I pledged that I would not ban fracking,” when she was campaigning as the vice presidential nominee in 2020.
Facts First: This is false. Harris did not make her personal position on fracking clear during her only debate in 2020, the general election’s vice presidential debate against then-Vice President Mike Pence. Harris never explicitly stated a personal position on fracking during that debate.
Rather, she said that Joe Biden, the head of the Democratic ticket at the time, would not ban fracking if he was elected president. Harris said during the 2020 vice presidential debate: “Joe Biden will not end fracking,” and “I will repeat, and the American people know, that Joe Biden will not ban fracking.”
When Harris did reference her own views on fracking earlier in the cycle during the Democratic presidential primary in 2019, she went so far as to say that “there’s no question I’m in favor of banning fracking.”
It made sense that Harris was addressing Biden’s plans at the time given that the president sets administration policy. But contrary to her claim on Wednesday, neither of her 2020 debate comments made clear that she personally held a different view on the subject than she had the year prior.

Harris claims Trump only built 2% of border wall
At CNN’s town hall with Kamala Harris on Wednesday, the vice president claimed that only 2% of the US-Mexico border wall was built during former President Donald Trump’s administration.
“How much of that wall did he build? I think the last number I saw was about 2%,” she said.
Facts First: This claim is exaggerated. According to a 2021 report from the US Customers and Border Protection and the Army Corps of Engineers, nearly 52 miles of “new primary wall” and 33 miles of “new secondary wall” were built during the Trump presidency. More than 370 miles of broken-down or outdated primary and secondary wall was also replaced.
During his campaign and throughout his presidency, Trump pledged to build a wall with parameters evolving from 1,000 miles to over 500 miles. Using the “new primary wall” numbers from the 2021 report, one could estimate that 5.2% of his 1,000-mile promise was met or 10.4% of his 500-mile goal was completed.
Harris’ running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, made a similar claim earlier this month at the CBS vice presidential debate.
The entire US-Mexico border is roughly 2,000 miles. The 52 miles of new primary wall would amount to 2.6% of that total length, but as CNN has previously reported, Trump had pledged to build more wall, not a new wall across the entire southern border.

Harris’ claim on Trump’s tax cuts
Vice President Kamala Harris slammed her opponent former President Donald Trump for putting in place policies that benefitted the wealthy during his first term.
“Donald Trump, when he was president, gave tax cuts to the richest, to billionaires and big corporations,” she said at CNN’s town hall.
Facts First: This claim needs context. While the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which Harris is referencing, benefited the rich far more than others, it did reduce taxes for most people, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.
The 2017 law made many changes to the tax code, including temporarily lowering many individual income tax rates, notably the top rate from 39.6% to 37% for the highest earners.
The Tax Policy Center took a look at whom the law would help the most. It found that taxes would decline, on average, for all income groups.
Middle-income taxpayers earning between about $49,000 and $86,000 were expected to see a tax cut of about $800, on average, or 1.4% of their after-tax income, according to the analysis.
Still, more than 60% of the benefits were expected to go to those whose incomes are in the top 20%. More than 40% of the benefits were expected to go to those in the top 5%.
Those making between $500,000 and $1 million were expected to get an average tax cut of about $21,000, lifting their after-tax incomes by 4.3%, according to the center’s estimates. Those who earn $1 million or more would enjoy an average tax cut of about $70,000, raising their after-tax incomes by 3.3%.
Only a little more than a quarter of those in the lowest-income households would see their taxes reduced. Their tax cut would be about $200, on average. However, most would see little or no benefit.

CNN,23 Nobel Prize-winning economists call Harris’ economic plan ‘vastly superior’ to Trump’s | CNN Politics,"More than half of the living US recipients of the Nobel Prize for economics signed a letter that called Vice President Kamala Harris’ economic agenda “vastly superior” to the plans laid out by former President Donald Trump.
Twenty-three Nobel Prize-winning economists signed onto the letter, including two of the three most recent recipients.
“While each of us has different views on the particulars of various economic policies, we believe that, overall, Harris’ economic agenda will improve our nation’s health, investment, sustainability, resilience, employment opportunities, and fairness and be vastly superior to the counterproductive economic agenda of Donald Trump,” the economists write in the letter obtained by CNN.
The letter serves as a stamp of approval for Harris less than two weeks from Election Day on the issue voters consistently rank as the most important in surveys: the economy. Voter struggles with inflation and an overall dour view of the state of the US economy have long served as a clear vulnerability for the Democratic candidate in the race, with incumbent President Joe Biden struggling for months to highlight his administration’s economic policy before he stepped aside and Harris coalesced party support to become the party nominee.
The letter was spearheaded by Joseph Stiglitz, a Columbia University professor and 2001 winner of the prize, and marks the second major foray into the campaign by a group of Nobel laureates.
Stiglitz also led an effort in June, with 15 fellow Nobel winners, to highlight what the signatories said would be a “destabilizing effect” of a second Trump term on the US economy. The group said at the time that then-candidate Biden’s economic agenda was also “vastly superior.”
Trump dismissed the group’s letter at the time, and his campaign slammed those who signed on as “worthless out of touch” economists.
But the new letter, which began to come together after Harris detailed her economic vision late last month, includes seven new signatories and represents a wide cross-section in the field in terms of areas of expertise and approach to economics.
The expanded group includes two of the three most recent laureates – Simon Johnson and Daron Acemoglu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. They received the prize, along with James Robinson of the University of Chicago, last week for their research into how institutions shape which countries become wealthy and prosperous.
The letter is intentionally brief at just 228 words, which reflects both an effort to secure consensus across a broader spectrum of economists and a desire to elevate that consensus with precision, according to a person familiar with the process. The letter was drafted to incorporate feedback from the initial effort.
It also marked an effort in the final days of the campaign to elevate what those involved viewed as an acute risk posed by Trump both in his economic proposals, but also, in their view, of the potential instability he would pose in an area where certainty and stability are paramount.
The letter points to Trump’s tariff and tax policies as inflationary and likely to balloon the federal deficit – a widely held view among economists. But it also issues a stark warning.
“Among the most important determinants of economic success are the rule of law and economic and political certainty, and Trump threatens all of these,” the economists write.
Despite the warnings and forecasts from economists across the political spectrum, Trump has been steadfast in his pledge to wield threats of sweeping tariffs as a cornerstone of his economic agenda.
Trump, in a recent Bloomberg interview at the Economic Club of Chicago, said his tariff plans would “have a massive effect, a positive effect.”
“The most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff,” Trump said. “It’s my favorite word.”
Trump has promised broad tax cuts beyond his 2017 tax law and promised to abolish taxes on tips, overtime and social security benefits, which analysts say would cost trillions, all as he pointed to tariffs and economic growth as the way to pay for the loss in revenue.
Economists view tariffs as effectively a tax on consumers who buy imported goods.
He has pledged large-scale de-regulation and, as part of the effort, unleash a surge in oil and gas drilling. He has also pledged to deport all illegal immigrants in the US in the “largest deportation operation” in the country’s history.
Trump has long held an edge when it comes to which candidate voters believe would best handle the economy as voters grapple with widespread discontent over the state and direction of the US economy.
Trump and his allies have sought to press that advantage in campaign events and in their advertising with a specific focus on the high prices that have weighed down American consumers for much of the last few years.
But Harris has steadily chipped away at Trump’s advantage on the issue in recent weeks, according to polling, and Harris campaign advisers see an opening to cut into Trump’s strength on the issue in the closing days of the campaign.
Those efforts have been bolstered by a steady stream of economic data that has boosted the confidence among US economic policy makers that they have successfully tamed inflation without pushing the broader economy into a recession.
The Federal Reserve has started cutting interest rates. Employment data for September showed hiring picked up, a dropping unemployment rate and strong wage growth.
Retails sales also remain durable.
The economic picture, at least based on the macroeconomic data, is one that appears robust.
Harris, as part of her economic agenda, has moved to address voter concerns about prices, the cost of housing, the cost of child and elder care and pushed for tax cuts targeting middle-and lower-income Americans.
She has also signaled support for the industrial policies championed by Biden designed to bolster US manufacturing for critical industries.
The contrast between the two candidates on the economy is central to the messages both campaigns are pushing in the final days of the race.
For the signatories of the letter, Harris’ message is the clear preference.
“Simply put, Harris’s policies will result in a stronger economic performance, with economic growth that is more robust, more sustainable, and more equitable,” the economists write.",23/10/2024
CNN,Special counsel probe into Biden’s handling of classified documents appears to be nearing end | CNN Politics,"Special counsel Robert Hur’s interview of President Joe Biden is a sign that the classified documents investigation is nearing conclusion after casting a wide net that included dozens of witnesses during the ten-month long probe, multiple sources told CNN.
The White House announced this week that Biden was questioned by Hur and his team over two days in a voluntary interview that CNN has reported was scheduled weeks earlier. While the White House has declined to discuss details of the questioning, including whether Biden invoked executive privilege, the interview is the first public development in months.
One source told CNN that investigators have indicated they hope to wrap by the end of the year. As of now, it’s unclear if the probe will result in charges being filed, but sources familiar with the investigators’ line of questioning said they got the impression that’s unlikely, and there has been no discernible grand jury activity.
The Justice Department has said that Hur will produce a final report explaining his findings from the investigation, a standard part of a special counsel’s work.
“The breadth and depth of Hur’s work suggests that he is going to compile a detailed report to explain exactly how he conducted this investigation,” one source familiar with the investigation told CNN.
Hur was appointed in January to investigate after classified documents were found at Biden’s former office at the Penn Biden Center in Washington, DC, and at his Wilmington, Delaware, home.
Compared to special counsel Jack Smith’s investigation into classified materials found at former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence, including the indictment handed down in June, Hur’s probe into Biden has continued to operate quietly behind the scenes.
Still, the protracted length and exhaustive nature of the investigation has frustrated top Biden aides who expected it to wrap up months ago given the relatively small number of classified documents involved, according to a person familiar with the White House’s thinking.
That person said some Biden aides believe Attorney General Merrick Garland was overly cautious in selecting Hur, an appointee to two top Justice Department roles during the Trump administration, to ensure the investigation was politically unassailable.
Investigators working for Hur have interviewed a broad spectrum of witnesses — from longtime advisor and current counselor Steve Ricchetti, to former White House legal and communications aides, to a former low-level aide who helped pack up the vice president’s residence at the end of the Obama administration, sources familiar with the matter tell CNN.
Hur’s team also has reached out to people who worked in the Senate during the time Biden served in that chamber, sources said. That’s because some of the documents with classified markings date back to Biden’s time in the Senate, according to a statement from Biden’s personal attorney.
As part of the investigation, Hur has sought to examine the handling of classified documents during Biden’s time in the Senate, a period before many of the strict procedures now used for handling classified documents, according to sources.
That has caused Hur to confront the delicate issues of the Senate’s constitutional speech or debate protections, which limit the Justice Department’s ability to interview Senate staff without coordination with Senate lawyers, people briefed on the matter said.
It’s unclear whether and how the Senate and Justice Department’s discussions over Senate-related interviews have been resolved. A special counsel spokesman declined to comment on the idea of no charges or on any discussions with the Senate.
One person familiar with the investigation described members of Hur’s team as being professional but tedious in the level of detail they have sought in witness interviews. Investigators have asked about where staffers sat in the office, where they stored briefing books, and how they operated an office safe.
Another person described a lengthy interview with FBI agents and lawyers focused on understanding everything surrounding specific documents. Investigators appeared to be following a process that identified meetings connected to specific classified documents or notes recovered from Biden properties, the person familiar with the interview said. Everyone who attended a meeting or briefing connected the document is being interviewed, the person said.
Investigators appear to be trying to establish a chain of custody for the documents and the circumstances surrounding them to discern how the classified documents ended up in Biden’s office and home.
Another source said: “The central question in this case is: Did the vice president of the United States intentionally take classified documents for personal use?”
The challenge for investigators is how they assess culpability and the circumstances surrounding how the documents got to the Penn Biden Center and the president’s house in Delaware, the source said.
A lawyer for one witness also described Hur’s process as being slow and methodical. Investigators interviewed this lawyer’s client earlier this year, but recently came back and asked his witness for additional documents.
“They are certainly being sufficiently thorough, and there is a temptation to think they are doing some things twice,” the lawyer said.
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to say Tuesday if the president answered all questions posed to him or invoked executive privilege during the interview with Hur. Jean-Pierre also wouldn’t say if the Biden administration requested that the interview be postponed following Hamas’ attack on Israel over the weekend.
“He’s been very much focused on the issues of the – you know – horrific events that we have seen in Israel,” she said. “As president, he has to do multiple things at once, and that’s what you saw him do this weekend.”",11/10/2023
CNN,"Harris tries to paint contrast with Trump, arguing ‘it doesn’t have to be this way’ at Ellipse rally | CNN Politics","Kamala Harris on Tuesday night warned Americans that Donald Trump would open up a floodgate of vengeance against his political rivals, including ordinary citizens, while promising that she’d work tirelessly for every American.
“In less than 90 days, either Donald Trump or I will be in the Oval Office,” Harris said from the Ellipse in Washington, DC, pivoting to the visage of the White House behind her as she delivered what her campaign had billed as a “closing argument” speech.
“On day one, if elected, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list. When elected, I will walk in with a to-do list full of priorities on what I will get done for the American people.”
Standing where Trump told his supporters on January 6, 2021, to “fight like hell,” shortly before they ransacked the US Capitol, Harris described the election as an existential choice between the liberties she promised to protect and the “chaos and division” that she said would follow Trump back into the White House.
“Donald Trump intends to use the United States military against American citizens who simply disagree with him. People he calls ‘the enemy from within.’ This is not a candidate for president who is thinking about how to make your life better,” Harris said. “This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power.”
Speaking for about a half-hour from the Ellipse, Harris measured her policy plans against Trump’s, casting herself as the former president’s foil – a president who would expand Medicare to cover home health care, where Trump would try to cut the program; a president who would back women’s reproductive rights, where Trump would further restrict them; a president who would prize compromise, where Trump feasts on conflict.
“Our democracy doesn’t require us to agree on everything. That’s not the American way,” Harris said. “We like a good debate. And the fact that someone disagrees with us, does not make them ‘the enemy from within.’ They are family, neighbors, classmates, coworkers.”
“It can be easy to forget a simple truth,” she added. “It doesn’t have to be this way.”
One hundred days after President Joe Biden announced he would not run for reelection, Harris in her remarks continued to keep him at arm’s length. Serving as Biden’s vice president, Harris said, has been an “honor.” But it would not define her administration or her objectives in office.
“My presidency will be different because the challenges we face are different,” Harris said. “Our top priority as a nation four years ago was to end the pandemic and rescue the economy. Now our biggest challenge is to lower costs, costs that were rising even before the pandemic, and that are still too high.”
Shortly after she concluded her remarks, Biden was forced to clean up comments he made earlier that evening on a get-out-the-vote call that sparked immediate backlash from many who interpreted them as referring to Trump supporters as “garbage.”
Harris tried on Tuesday to connect her personal story to how she’d lead the country – a reflection of the fact that many Americans still say they want to know more about the vice president, who’s running a campaign on an incredibly compressed timeframe, and her plans.
And while her speech didn’t deliver more policy specifics, she once again argued that her background – a child of immigrants who became a prosecutor – had prepared her to deliver on her promises.
“For as long as I can remember, I have always had an instinct to protect. There’s something about people being treated unfairly, or overlooked, that just gets to me,” Harris said. “It is what my mother instilled in me. A drive to hold accountable those who use their wealth or power to take advantage of other people.”",29/10/2024
CNN,There’s no such thing as a guaranteed Supreme Court vacancy | CNN Politics,"Supreme Court justices do not go easily.
With the presidential election nearing a climax, speculation has grown over new appointments to the country’s highest court. But imminent vacancies are far from guaranteed.
The power to decide the nation’s law is difficult to relinquish.
“The great ones get their backs up,” observed Georgetown Law professor Brad Snyder, author of a Felix Frankfurter biography and a scholar of the 20th century court, referring to retirement pressure. “They say ‘No one can do this job as well as I can.’”
The historical pattern endures. Of the last dozen vacancies, dating to 1990, more than half were caused by a death or illness. Two of the last four justices to leave the bench died while serving – Antonin Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg – and most of the last dozen were at least age 80.
“I’m getting old and coming apart,” Justice Thurgood Marshall told reporters when he announced in June 1991 that he would be retiring. He was about to turn 83.
For that liberal civil rights trailblazer, the first Black justice, the vicissitudes of personal health overcame any reluctance to leave while Republican George H.W. Bush was in office and could name his successor. Bush chose Clarence Thomas, an ardent conservative whose approach to the Constitution and civil rights remedies has been the opposite of Marshall’s.
Now age 76, Thomas is the oldest of the current nine justices, followed by Samuel Alito, 74, and Sonia Sotomayor, 70. Chief Justice John Roberts will turn 70 in January.
While the three have passed the average retirement age, they are still in their prime at the Supreme Court, an institution that reveres seniority.
Thomas and Alito are part of a dominant right-wing bloc overhauling the law in America, including the reversal of abortion rights. That bloc has also ended racial affirmative action in college admissions and diminished the authority of federal regulators to set workplace, consumer and environmental policy. It has also changed the court’s direction on multiple culture war issues involving religion.
In short, Thomas and Alito hold formidable positions on the coalition that is reshaping the legal landscape.
Sotomayor, a liberal, falls on the losing side, to be sure, but she is in a position of seniority giving her the authority to assign a dissenting opinion and take the lead for the left wing.
Even with the frustrations that come from internal dissent or growing public criticism, justices are loath to surrender the role.
“They are trying to keep power, and they are trying to stay relevant,” Snyder said. “They are also trying to stay alive. These are people who live to work. You take away their job and they are no longer living to work.”
Not all presidents get vacancies
Yet new presidents eagerly anticipate openings so that they can make their mark with a life-tenured appointments. President Joe Biden, who named the first Black woman to the bench in 2022 (Ketanji Brown Jackson), predicted in June, “The next president is likely to have two new Supreme Court nominees.”
But such talk is just that. Talk.
Despite election-season predictions to the contrary, President George W. Bush saw no vacancies in his first four-year term, and Barack Obama had none during his second, even after a subtle overture to Ginsburg during a 2013 lunch at the White House. Jimmy Carter, who served only a single term, never had the opportunity to appoint a Supreme Court justice.
Trump filled a vacancies, however, in his single term, two of those arising from deaths of conservative and liberal icons: Scalia, who died unexpectedly in 2016 while at a Texas hunting ranch, and Ginsburg, who died in 2020 of pancreatic cancer.
Chief Justice William Rehnquist similarly died while in office, after nearly a year fighting thyroid cancer and resisting retirement. After his September 2005 death, he was succeeded by the like-minded Roberts.
Ginsburg’s forestalling of retirement produced more significant consequences. When she died at age 87, Trump replaced her with Amy Coney Barrett (four decades younger) and secured a conservative supermajority.
The Ginsburg situation subsequently accelerated liberal pressure on her fellow octogenarian Stephen Breyer to retire while Democrat Biden occupied the White House.
Breyer, then 83, was still enjoying the job when he announced he would retire in 2022. He understood the reality of life in his 80s. As his predecessor, Justice Harry Blackmun, had remarked when he retired in 1994 at age 85: “It’s not easy to step aside, but I know what the numbers are, and it’s time.”
Shortly before Breyer retired, he told CNN in an interview that his primary consideration would be the state of his health. Breyer has since explained justices’ interest in longevity by emphasizing the judicial long game, that cases build on cases, and that justices become more confident with the years.
“You learn that the applause dies away very fast when you’re there,” he has said. “After two or three years, I was at some kind of meeting when a young student came up to me and said, ‘Oh, judge, I love your opinions. Would you sign my program?’ I said sure. I signed it. Then he turned to his friend and held up four fingers and said, ‘That makes four!’”
Why justices quit
Justices have made it clear over the years that they favor likeminded successors – even former law clerks, as has been a pattern in recent years. (Breyer, for example, was succeeded by Jackson, his former clerk; four years earlier, retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy was succeeded by Brett Kavanaugh, who had clerked for him.)
So the politics of who holds the White House matters.
With today’s bench, that means that if Republican Trump were to win, Alito and Thomas would be more inclined to consider leaving; if Democrat Kamala Harris wins, Sotomayor. Friends of the three say those justices have, at times, mused about election forecasts and individual retirements but suggested a tenor reflecting casual thoughts rather a concrete plan.
The more obvious determinant is individual health.
Current justices resist sharing health information or explaining sudden absences from oral arguments or other public events.
The current nine appear healthy, but it is difficult for any outsider to really know their personal situations. In 2022, Thomas was hospitalized for a week with what court officials described as an infection. In 2020, Roberts was hospitalized for a head injury after a fall at a Maryland country club; a court official said that the fall, which became known only after The Washington Post received a tip, was unrelated to epileptic seizures Roberts had previously suffered, the first reportedly in 1993.
Sotomayor, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age 8, has spoken at times, particularly to audiences of children, about managing the condition; in 2018, paramedics were called to her home for what a court official said were “symptoms of low blood sugar.”
Justice John Paul Stevens, a 1975 appointee who for years was the subject of retirement rumors, held out until 2010. After stumbling over the words of a dissenting opinion (in the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission case) he was reading from the bench in January that year, he knew his time had come.
Stevens later disclosed in his memoir that he learned he “had suffered a mini stroke.” The justice then told Obama he would leave at the end of the annual session, in June.
Stevens was age 90 when he retired. Twenty years earlier, in 1990, Justice William Brennan made a more abrupt retirement announcement after he had a small stroke while vacationing. He was 84 when he notified President George H.W. Bush he would immediately retire.
Justice Sandra Day O’Connor was only 75 in July 2005 when she announced her plans to leave the bench. But she said her husband was suffering from Alzheimer’s disease and she wanted to spend more time with him.
Justice David Souter is a modern exception.
He retired in 2009 at the relatively youthful age of 69. The erudite New Hampshire bachelor had never quite adapted to the ways of Washington.
His brief resignation letter offered no reason for his departure. And for the next decade, Souter occasionally heard US appellate court cases. He declined to respond to CNN’s recent queries regarding his thoughts on why most justices hold on to the job longer.
Perhaps revealing of Souter’s mindset, a few weeks after he informed Obama, Souter told an audience at a legal conference, “For most of us, the very best work that we do sinks into the stream very quickly. We have to find satisfaction in being part of the great stream.”",30/10/2024
CNN,Analysis: Obama again feels the ‘fierce urgency of now’ as Trump eyes return to power | CNN Politics,"Several political lifetimes ago, Barack Obama followed Bruce Springsteen onstage at a huge rally beneath the Cleveland skyline and declared, “A rising is coming.”
That promise, riffing off one of the rock icon’s hits, came true days later, when Obama won the 2008 presidential election.
The band was back together Thursday night, in Georgia. The former president, now 63 and still the Democratic Party’s most compelling figure, and the Boss were trying to push Democratic nominee Kamala Harris over the line in the critical swing state.
Springsteen, before strumming “Land of Hope and Dreams,” declared that Harris “is running to be the 47th president of the United States. Donald Trump is running to be an American tyrant. He does not understand this country, its history or what it means to be deeply American.”
Obama seized on recent interviews in which John Kelly, the Republican nominee’s former White House chief of staff, described the 45th president as an aspiring dictator and said he’d expressed a desire to be served by generals like those who surrounded Adolf Hitler. Trump on Thursday denied the report. “I never said that,” he said in Las Vegas.
But Obama warned, “Just because he acts goofy does not mean his presidency wouldn’t be dangerous.” He went on: “I want to explain that in politics a good rule of thumb is – don’t say you want to do anything like Hitler. … But it is useful because it gives us a window into how Donald Trump thinks.”
Harris reminisced before the huge crowd in Clarkston, a suburb of Atlanta, about her trip to Obama’s first presidential campaign launch in Springfield, Illinois, in 2007.
“I went there to support this brilliant young senator who was running for president of the United States,” she said. “Millions of Americans were energized and inspired not only by Barack Obama’s message but by how he leads, seeking to unite rather than separate us.”
But the sense of imminent change dancing in the frigid air that February morning is missing this year in the grueling slog for every last vote, amid Democratic dread that Obama’s nemesis, Trump, is about to reclaim power.
And Obama’s return to center stage is raising the question of whether, 12 years after his last election win, he has the political muscle to take the once and possibly future president down.
Obama is fired up and ready to go
Obama is feeling “the fierce urgency of now” again. The 44th president is logging more miles on the campaign trail than at any point since leaving the White House nearly eight years ago. He’s implored voters from Pittsburgh to Tucson to Las Vegas to back Harris, and by week’s end, his campaign blitz will have touched down in all seven top battleground states.
“We do not need to see what an older, loonier Donald Trump looks like with no guardrails,” Obama said this week in Detroit. “America’s ready to turn the page. We’re ready for a better story.”
Trump is bristling at Obama’s savage mockery and has taken to claiming that the once-youthful prophet of hope is “exhausted” and “looking a bit older.” That’s rich coming from a 78-year-old about a gym rat rival.
But the nation’s first Black president, who once hailed his generation of voters as a “people of improbable hope,” is sounding far less optimistic as Americans prepare to render a verdict for the third straight time on Trump.
The controlled fury of his speech Thursday night and his intense engagement this week shows that November’s election is more than merely a race for Harris: It’s a battle that will show whether anyone is still listening to him.
It’s been said often that Obama’s legacy is on the line in this election – and it’s true that in a new term, Trump might take another dig at overturning the Affordable Care Act and eradicating the reforms in economic and climate policy that Obama’s onetime vice president, President Joe Biden, put into place as the next step of a Democratic project spanning parts of three decades.
This election may represent the final showdown between Obamaism – a racially diverse and multi-generational movement for grassroots change – and the backlash politics of Trumpism.
But even more than that, Obama these days is sounding desperate to convince his audiences that his life’s project – political change – is even possible and that democracy is still the vessel to effect it.
“Who you vote for matters, not because it’s going to change every problem we’ve got. No president, no vice president, no senator, no governor is going to solve every problem,” Obama said in Madison, Wisconsin, this week. “We’re not going to eliminate poverty overnight. We’re not going to change race relations right away. We’re born into history, and change takes time.”
The man who once told swooning crowds that “we are the change that we seek” delivered a far more pragmatic pitch, warning: “Sometimes I think we expect so much, and then we’re disappointed when everything’s not immediately solved.”
Obama’s voters are taking Harris on trust
Obama’s caustic roasts of Trump, his gift for framing the stakes of an election and the way he has made a far more compelling case for Harris’ election than she has yet managed for herself, shows that his political skills are undiminished. He is paying it forward in the same way former President Bill Clinton did in 2012 to help lift Obama’s reelection bid.
That’s helped his fans to accept Harris – only three years younger than Obama at 60 – as the next recipient of his torch.
Kristen Roland, a high school teacher from Oakland County, Michigan, was awash in nostalgia as she waited to see Obama in Detroit and wore a black 2008 campaign shirt to mark the moment.
“He instilled in America a hope that maybe didn’t exist before,” Roland said. “I think he set the stage for someone like Kamala coming in and maybe completing some of the promises that he made.” Roland doesn’t know if Harris can beat Trump in battleground Michigan but said she was more hopeful than at any point this election season when she saw thousands of people waiting in line to see Obama.
“If he trusts her,” Roland said, “other people should trust her, too.”
In the rallies, Obama makes an affirmative case for Harris, whom he first met two decades ago, but spends the bulk of his time making a defiant case against Trump.
He returns time and again to one of his classic lines: “Don’t boo, vote,” as he seeks to make sense of this moment.
“I get why people are looking to shake things up. I understand that, but what I cannot understand is why anybody would think that Donald Trump will shake things up in a way that is good for you, because there is absolutely no evidence that this man thinks about anybody, but himself,” Obama said Thursday night in Georgia, as he has at his other rallies for Harris.
Obama’s words carry his familiar lecturing tone, which is just fine with Janavus Davis, a Detroit barber, who came to see Obama to remember a now-passed political era.
Davis hears plenty of the skepticism about Harris but believes Obama’s message will allay any fears or concerns about electing the first female president.
“We still listen to him, that’s why all these people are here,” Davis said. “When he was the president, I felt like he kept the people calm. With Kamala now, it’s time for a Black woman. I think it’s possible. I think it should happen.”
Yet for all his political skills, Obama has sometimes been unable to transfer his idiosyncratic appeal to other leaders. He couldn’t make Hillary Clinton president despite campaigning for her in the final days of the 2016 race. And the fact that he is still the Democratic Party’s prominent political rock star, 16 years after his first election as president and eight years after handing over the White House to Trump, says as much about his party as it does about Obama’s aura.
Harris is facing a far more challenging environment than then-Sen. Obama encountered in 2008. He was the insurgent after an eight-year Republican presidency marred by George W. Bush’s failures in Iraq and New Orleans, which left the country desperate for change. This year’s Democratic nominee is an incumbent in an unpopular administration. Obama’s young voters intoxicated by hope in 2008 are entering middle age with the same struggles with high grocery prices and mortgage rates that Trump’s voters are experiencing. And while Springsteen is America’s poet of the working class, many blue-collar voters have deserted Democrats in recent elections for Trump’s populist GOP.
Then there’s the question of whether heavyweight endorsements from ex-presidents and celebrities like Springsteen – and Beyoncé, who will line up with Harris in the closing stretch – really make a difference. Springsteen is no political newbie – he headlined a massive rally for John Kerry in Madison, Wisconsin, in 2004, before the Democratic nominee lost to Bush. So while big event’s like Thursday flash back to the rock and political anthems of yesteryear, there’s no guarantee they work politically.
CNN political commentator and Republican operative David Urban, who choreographed Trump’s critical win in Pennsylvania in 2016, remembered a star-studded rally in Philadelphia for Clinton on election eve that year, with Obama, Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi.
“The next day, guess what happened? We whooped Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania. … If I was (in Georgia), I might go hear Bruce Springsteen tonight, but I don’t think it matters squat for November 5,” Urban told CNN’s Erin Burnett.
Still, the likelihood that this election will be decided by thousands of votes in a few states means that even if Obama and Springsteen get a few people to the polls, it could make a difference. And the former president is about to be upstaged by the biggest political star in his family. Former first lady Michelle Obama – who has become a female icon – will campaign with Harris on Saturday in Michigan.
At this point, marquee events are more about driving a party’s voters to the polls than changing minds. That’s a message Obama learned 16 years ago. And he drummed it out Thursday in his first moments onstage.
“Go vote, return your absentee ballots,” he cried.",25/10/2024
CNN,House nears third week without speaker as eight Republicans vie for gavel | CNN Politics,"A crowded field of Republicans are vying to earn the support of their conference to wield the gavel, throwing the chamber into even more uncertainty after three weeks without a speaker.
The conference is searching for a new speaker nominee after Rep. Jim Jordan on Friday became the latest to exit the race. The chamber has been without a speaker since House Republicans ousted Rep. Kevin McCarthy earlier this month.
Eight House Republicans are running for the position, including GOP Whip Tom Emmer, who is endorsed by McCarthy. Emmer has moved to lock in support across the ideological and geographic spectrum in the conference, giving him what many House Republicans believe is an advantage, according to GOP sources. He could face an uphill battle, however, against allies of former President Donald Trump who have been quick to criticize Emmer for voting to certify the 2020 election.
The speaker hopefuls spent the weekend working the phones to win their conference’s support ahead of a candidate forum Monday evening and secret-ballot election Tuesday.
Emmer spoke with Trump by phone over the weekend, a source familiar with the matter told CNN, and Emmer touted his “strong working relationship” with the former president on social media Monday.
“Thank you, Mr. President,” Emmer posted on X, alongside a video clip of Trump saying he’s “always” gotten along with Emmer. “If my colleagues elect me Speaker of the House, I look forward to continuing our strong working relationship.”
Texas Rep. Pete Sessions, another candidate for speaker, said Monday that he also spoke with Trump about his bid.
“He called me and we had a polite conversation. I believe that the president is interested in having somebody he can work with, and I think I’m one of those people,” he told CNN’s Manu Raju, adding that he did not ask for Trump’s endorsement.
These are the other GOP representatives running for speaker:
- Jack Bergman of Michigan, a retired 40-year veteran of the US Marines.
- Byron Donalds of Florida, a second-term member of the far-right Freedom Caucus.
- Kevin Hern of Oklahoma, chair of the conservative group known as the Republican Study Committee – which wields a large bloc of GOP members.
- Mike Johnson of Louisiana, the vice chairman for the House Republican Conference.
- Gary Palmer of Alabama, the chairman of the Republican Policy Committee.
- Austin Scott of Georgia, the seven-term ally of McCarthy who quickly dropped out of a last-minute challenge to Jordan last week.
Rep. Dan Meuser of Pennsylvania had also been in the running but dropped out of the race Monday evening.
Speaking to reporters, Meuser said, “I felt that it was in the best interest in the end.”
“We have great candidates, and I wrote up a plan of how to improve the speaker’s office – making it a members-first office, which in the end is a people’s first office – and a few of the candidates up there have adopted some of my ideas,” he said.
Frustrations and divisions have only intensified within the conference as Republicans search for a way to resolve the impasse. That, along with the GOP’s narrow majority, has made it increasingly unclear whether any candidate will be able to secure the 217 floor votes needed to win the gavel.
The House, meanwhile, remains in a state of paralysis amid the threat of a government shutdown next month and the Israel-Hamas war.
The government runs out of funding in less than a month, after narrowly avoiding a shutdown with a stopgap funding bill last month. A speaker will need to be involved in negotiations with the White House and the Senate, both of which are controlled by Democrats.
And there is momentum for a bill to give further aid to Israel’s war against Hamas. President Joe Biden has asked Congress for a $105 billion package that will include aid for Israel and Ukraine, which is said to be running out of munitions in its fight against Russia’s invasion.
The showdown over the speakership kicked off earlier this month when a bloc of hardline conservatives voted to oust McCarthy, a historic move that plunged the House into unprecedented territory. Then, in the aftermath of McCarthy’s ouster, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise’s speakership nomination met a swift downfall when the conference failed to come together on his bid.
On Friday, Republicans pushed Jordan out of the race after he failed to win the gavel for the third time in a floor vote earlier in the day.

CNN,House remains paralyzed with no end in sight for speakership battle after Jordan’s exit | CNN Politics,"There is still no end in sight for the high-stakes speakership battle after House Republicans ousted Kevin McCarthy more than two weeks ago.
The search is on for a new GOP speaker nominee after Rep. Jim Jordan on Friday became the latest exit from the race, and it’s already shaping up to be a crowded candidate field.
Frustrations and divisions have only intensified within the conference as Republicans search for a way to resolve the impasse. That, along with the GOP’s narrow majority, has made it increasingly unclear whether any candidate will be able to secure the 217 votes needed to win the gavel on the House floor.
The House, meanwhile, remains in a state of paralysis as Republicans struggle to coalesce around a speaker candidate, with the chamber effectively frozen amid the threat of a government shutdown next month and conflict unfolding abroad.
House Republicans are expected to hold a candidate forum Monday evening and more candidates are likely to throw their names into the running before then.
The showdown over the speakership kicked off earlier this month when a bloc of hardline conservatives voted to remove McCarthy, a historic move that plunged the House into unprecedented territory. Then, in the aftermath of McCarthy’s ouster, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise’s speakership nomination met a swift downfall when the conference failed to come together on his bid.
On Friday, Republicans pushed Jordan out of the race after he failed to win the gavel for the third time in a floor vote earlier in the day. The Ohio Republican fared worse in the vote than he had in previous failed rounds.
Here are some of the candidates now vying to become the next GOP speaker nominee:
- Rep. Tom Emmer, who serves as majority whip, said in a letter to his colleagues shared on Saturday that he was seeking the speakership with the goal of delivering “historic change.” McCarthy is backing Emmer for speaker, sources tell CNN, delivering an early boost for his candidacy.
- Rep. Kevin Hern told CNN on Friday that “yes” he plans to run for speaker. When asked how he plans to get 217 votes, Hern said he’ll work “hard” to get people on his side.
- Rep. Jack Bergman is running for the speaker role, his spokesman told CNN.
- Rep. Austin Scott, who launched a last-minute bid against Jordan last week, but quickly dropped out and then supported Jordan, is now running for speaker again now that the field is wide open, his spokesperson told CNN.
- Rep. Byron Donalds, a Freedom Caucus member, announced on X that he’s seeking the speakership to advance a “conservative vision for the House of Representatives and the American people.”
- Rep. Mike Johnson, the House Republican conference vice chairman, also announced a run for speaker in a letter to his Republican colleagues Saturday, saying “after much prayer and deliberation, I am stepping forward now.”

CNN,Nebraska’s high court says people with felony records can register to vote | CNN Politics,"Nebraska’s top election official had no authority to declare unconstitutional a state law that restored the voting rights of those who have been convicted of a felony, the state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday in a decision with implications for the approaching election.
In July, Secretary of State Bob Evnen ordered county election officials to reject the voter registrations of those with felony convictions, citing an opinion issued by Attorney General Mike Hilgers. That opinion, which Evnen had requested, deemed as unconstitutional a law passed this year by the Legislature immediately restoring the voting rights of people who have completed the terms of their felony sentences.
Evnen’s order could have kept 7,000 or more Nebraska residents from voting in the upcoming election, the American Civil Liberties Union said. Many of them reside in Nebraska’s Omaha-centered 2nd Congressional District, where both the race for president and Congress could be in play.
In an otherwise reliably Republican state that, unlike most others, splits its electoral votes, the district has twice awarded an electoral vote to Democratic presidential candidates — once to Barack Obama in 2008 and again to Joe Biden in 2020. In a presidential race shown by polling to be a dead heat, a single electoral vote could determine who wins.
Given the Omaha district’s history, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and Democratic groups have spent millions in the district in the hopes of securing the electoral vote — far more than former President Donald Trump and Republican groups.
The last day to register to vote for the 2024 general election in Nebraska is October 25 and must be done in person at a voter’s county election commission office. Election Day is November 5.
Hilgers′ opinion had said the new law violates the state constitution’s separation of powers, saying only the state Board of Pardons under the control of the executive branch can restore voting rights through pardons.
Pardons are exceedingly rare in Nebraska. Evnen, Hilgers and Gov. Jim Pillen make up the three-member Board of Pardons. All three are Republicans.
The opinion also found unconstitutional a 2005 state law that restored the voting rights of people with felony convictions two years after they complete the terms of their sentences.
The ACLU is representing advocacy group Civic Nebraska and two Nebraska residents, a Republican and an independent, who would be denied the right to vote under Evnen’s directive. Because Evnen’s move came only weeks ahead of the November election, the ACLU asked to take the lawsuit directly to the Nebraska Supreme Court, and the high court agreed.
Restoring the voting rights of former felons has drawn national attention in recent years. In Florida, lawmakers weakened a 2018 voter-approved constitutional amendment to restore the voting rights of most convicted felons. Following that, an election police unit championed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis arrested 20 former felons. Several of them said they were confused by the arrests because they had been allowed to register to vote.
In Tennessee, lawmakers killed a bipartisan bill this year that would have let residents convicted of felonies apply to vote again without also restoring their gun rights.
Dozens of states allow people living with felony convictions to vote, either for those not currently in prison or upon completion of their sentences. Two states, Maine and Vermont, allow everyone, even those in prison, to vote. But despite a recent trend toward restoration of rights, felony disenfranchisement laws prevent around 5.85 million people across the country from voting, according to the ACLU.
Felony disenfranchisement laws date to the Jim Crow era and mainly targeted Black people, according to experts. Black registered voters have an overwhelmingly positive view of Harris, according to a recent poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",16/10/2024
CNN,Harris distances herself from Biden’s ‘garbage’ comment as Democrats are privately exasperated by the president | CNN Politics,"Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday distanced herself from President Joe Biden’s comments that seemingly referred to Donald Trump’s supporters as “garbage,” setting off a political firestorm a week before Election Day.
Harris told reporters that she “strongly” disagrees with criticizing people based on who they vote for. Asked if she has spoken to the president about his comments, Harris said that Biden called her Tuesday evening but that the president’s comments “didn’t come up.”
“Listen, I think, first of all, he clarified his comments, but let me be clear: I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for. You heard my speech last night and continuously throughout my career. I believe that the work that I do is about representing all the people whether they support me or not,” Harris said on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews.
The vice president also repeated what she has said on the trail, including that she will “represent all Americans” if elected.
“I am sincere in what I mean: When elected president of the United States, I will represent all Americans, including those who don’t vote for me, and address their needs and their desires,” Harris said.
The president inadvertently injected himself into the home stretch of the campaign on Tuesday night when he was attempting to criticize Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden over the weekend. Biden mentioned Puerto Rico, which was referred to as a “floating island of garbage” by a comedian at Trump’s event on Sunday night.
“And just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico ‘a floating island of garbage.’ Well, let me tell you something … I don’t know the Puerto Rican that I know… or Puerto Rico where I’m – in my home state of Delaware – they’re good, decent, honorable people,” Biden said during virtual remarks in a Voto Latino get-out-the-vote call meant to help Harris.
“The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters,” Biden said, pausing for a moment before continuing. “His, his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable and it’s un-American.”
Biden had attempted to explain away his comments on Tuesday night.
“Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage—which is the only word I can think of to describe it,” Biden posted on X later that evening. “His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation.”
When CNN asked for an explanation on the president’s comments, a White House spokesperson insisted that Biden had meant “supporter’s” rather than “supporters,” arguing that he had actually said this: “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter’s – his – his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American.”
“The President referred to the hateful rhetoric at the Madison Square Garden rally as garbage,” White House spokesman Andrew Bates said.
Harris’ campaign was quick to try to publicly defend or explain those remarks publicly. But in private, both inside and around the campaign, plenty of Democrats were quietly buzzing with frustration and concern about the president’s remarks.
Senior campaign officials were fielding messages of exasperation from supporters – some of whom suggested that perhaps the president should find a way to disappear from public view altogether in the final six days leading up to Election Day, sources said.
“The Biden gaffe yesterday is just so infuriating,” one former administration official said. “Nobody wants him out there.”
Biden’s remarks have undeniably become an unwelcome distraction. Trump and his allies quickly seized on them to accuse Harris and her campaign, by extension, of looking down on Americans who back the former president.
Democrats are forcefully making the point that Biden is not the presidential nominee, and Harris has been abundantly clear that she has respect for all voters – regardless of whether they support her. They also have lashed out at what they see as a double standard, given Trump’s long history of racist, misogynistic and offensive remarks.
“We won’t lose a single voter because of it,” said one adviser to the campaign, dismissing the significance of Biden’s comments.
As CNN has reported, there had been growing wariness among Harris campaign aides about Biden’s propensity for gaffes, at a moment when the campaign does not want to take any unnecessary political risks. Tuesday night’s “garbage” comments from Biden only ended up confirming those existing concerns for many Democrats.
Earlier on Wednesday, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris’ vice-presidential running mate, said in an interview with CBS News that Biden’s comments a response to the “frustration with Donald Trump’s rhetoric of division,” and rejected the argument that they undercut a central message of the Harris campaign to unify the country.
“I think there’s– the frustration we’ve seen since January 6, the frustration with Donald Trump’s rhetoric of division, it does fire passions, and I think … President Biden was very clear that he’s speaking about the rhetoric we heard at that. So, it doesn’t undermine it,” Walz said.
In an interview with ABC News, Walz said that Harris’ remarks in Washington, DC, on Tuesday should be the message voters focus on, noting that Harris is the candidate at the top of the Democratic ticket, not Biden.
“The president’s clarified his remarks, but let’s be very clear. The vice president and I have made it absolutely clear that we want everyone as a part of this. Donald Trump’s divisive rhetoric is what needs to end. He called this a garbage country, and continues on from ‘the enemy within,’” he said. “What you heard Vice President Harris say, and what I say is, there’s a place for all of us here, and I think that’s the one– she’s running for president, she’s making the message, and she delivered that speech on the Ellipse that showed what we can be as a country.”",30/10/2024
CNN,"In race for Congress, Democrats burn through cash while outraising Republicans in final election sprint, new filings show | CNN Politics","Staring down the prospect of losing the Senate and amid a tight race for the House, Democrats are burning through cash in the final sprint to Election Day, new federal filings show.
The pre-general election reports, which cover the first sixteen days of October, are the last opportunity before November 5 to see just how much congressional campaigns have raised and spent. Democrats are defending a razor-thin majority in the Senate, while Republicans are trying to maintain their own narrow edge in the House.
In almost all the key races, Democratic candidates brought in more than their Republican opponents between October 1-16. At this point in the race, neither side has a significant overall cash-on-hand advantage, with campaigns spending all the resources they can to win.
With no clear leader in the presidential election according to the most recent CNN Poll of Polls, the battle for Congress will be crucial to determining whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump will have a supportive first branch of government to help implement the new president’s policies.
Senate Democrats’ final stand
Democrats face daunting odds to retain their narrow Senate majority. With Republicans almost certain to flip West Virginia’s Senate seat, they would need Harris to win the White House while not losing any of the other seats held by Democratic senators or senators who caucus with the party.
But Senate Democrats have had a massive money advantage all cycle. According to a CNN analysis of campaign finance reports filed with the Federal Election Commission, Democratic candidates in Senate races rated as competitive by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales have thoroughly outspent their Republican opponents.
With less than two weeks until Election Day and early voting well underway, Democratic Senate candidates in 10 key races – not counting Nebraska, where Democrats don’t have a nominee – spent about $76 million altogether in the first 16 days of October while raking in nearly $49 million, according to the latest filings. Republicans combined to raise about $28 million, while spending more than $39 million over 11 races. Those totals did not include Ohio GOP nominee Bernie Moreno, whose filings were not available on the FEC site as of publication time.
The most vulnerable Democratic incumbents are up for reelection in states that Trump twice carried comfortably – Jon Tester in Montana and Sherrod Brown in Ohio.
Brown raised $7.8 million between October 1 and 16, spent $7.9 million and entered the final two weeks of the campaign with $4.4 million in the bank. More than $500 million has been spent on the Ohio race through Thursday, the most of any Senate contest in 2024. Inside Elections currently rates the Ohio race as the only Toss-up on the Senate map.
In Montana, Tester, the last remaining Democrat in statewide elected office, raised more than $9 million in the first half of October, spent more than $12 million and had just over $4 million on hand for the final dash to Election Day. His Republican opponent, retired Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, raised nearly $2.4 million, spent $2.5 million and had a similar amount left to spend. Inside Elections rates the Senate race in Montana as Tilts Republican.
The battle for the House
In the 30 House races currently rated as Toss-ups or tiling toward one party by Inside Elections, Democratic candidates have combined to outspend their GOP opponents, $190 million to $117 million over the course of the cycle through October 16.
Three Democratic candidates – Alaska Rep. Mary Peltola, Washington Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, and Virginia challenger Eugene Vindman – have spent over $10 million on their campaigns. Peltola and Gluesenkamp Perez represent districts that would have backed Trump in 2020, and Vindman is running for a competitive seat outside Washington, DC.
The battle for the House majority could come down to nine fiercely contested seats in deep-blue California and New York, which were key to Republicans winning control of the chamber two years ago. In these seats alone, Democrats have outspent Republicans, $58 million to $43 million this cycle. In the pre-general election period, the Democratic candidates in these seats outspent their GOP opponents, on average, $1.7 million to $1.3 million, though the average Republicans began October 17 with a slight cash-on-hand advantage.
Big donors, big dollars
Hundreds of millions of dollars have already been spent in the battle for Congress, and ultrawealthy donors are still pouring money into super PACs.
Elon Musk donated $10 million to the Senate Leadership Fund, the GOP super PAC aligned with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Musk has already spent nearly $120 million on the presidential election through America PAC, the super PAC he helped form to support Trump. Senate Leadership Fund also received $5 million from hedge fund manager Paul Singer, and $2 million from investment banker Warren Stephens.
The fund’s Democratic counterpart, Senate Majority PAC, received a $25 million donation from Majority Forward, the group’s dark money nonprofit arm, which is not required to disclose its donors.
The Congressional Leadership Fund, the top House GOP super PAC, received another $2 million check from billionaire hedge fund manager Ken Griffin in October. Griffin, who hasn’t donated to Trump this cycle, has donated $16 million to the fund so far this cycle. The group also received $4.5 million from insurance executive Patrick Ryan and his wife, Shirley, as well as $2 million from Singer.
On the Democratic side, House Majority PAC received a $2 million donation from billionaire businessman and former 2020 presidential candidate Tom Steyer, $1.8 million from philanthropist Marilyn Simons and $1.1 million from the Sixteen Thirty Fund, a Democratic-aligned nonprofit that is not required to disclose its donors.
In Michigan, the Great Lakes Conservative Fund, which has spent over $20.5 million in the Senate race in support of Republican Mike Rogers, received $1.2 million in donations from the DeVos family – including $125,000 from Trump’s former Education secretary, Betsy DeVos.
And in Pennsylvania, Keystone Renewal PAC, which has spent $48 million supporting Republican nominee Dave McCormick, received another $1 million from Pennsylvania-based billionaire Jeff Yass.",25/10/2024
CNN,An EV plant bolstered by Biden’s climate law sparks hope in northeast Ohio – but not a revival of its Democratic roots | CNN Politics,"For this long-beleaguered region of Northeast Ohio, a gleaming new 2.8 million-square-foot manufacturing plant symbolizes something that has been fleeting in recent years: hope.
Hope that years of promises – so often broken or deferred – have been replaced by action in the form of 2,200 employees at the Ultium Cells electric vehicle battery plant, which sits at the forefront of cutting-edge green technology and manufacturing.
Hope in the shadow of the hulking former General Motors Lordstown plant that closed its doors in 2019, forcing workers like George Goranitis to leave the only jobs and homes they knew.
“All the mills shutting down, packers shutting down – the last thing here for a good-paying job was General Motors Lordstown,” Goranitis said.
The collapse of the lone remaining cornerstone of a manufacturing powerhouse cut to the heart of a proud community.
“Members, you know, weren’t able to handle some of the news,” Goranitis recalled. “And, you know, the situations they were in at that time, they took their own lives. There was divorces because of it. You know, families were ripped apart.”
The story of the GM plant closure in Mahoning Valley in Northeast Ohio isn’t new.
Nor is the story of how Donald Trump tapped into the anxieties within those communities with his bold promises to bring back the manufacturing prowess of old.
Here in Trumbull County, for decades a Democratic stronghold filled with union workers, President Barack Obama crushed Republican nominee Mitt Romney by 23 points in 2012.
Four years later, Trump flipped the county – the first Republican to do so in more than four decades – in a dramatic demonstration of strength among White blue-collar voters in the industrial Midwest.
He went on to win Trumbull County by an even greater margin in 2020, as Ohio, once the premier bellwether state, cemented its shift firmly into Republican hands.
Trump is once again the GOP nominee.
And he’s once again centering his campaign on big promises of a Midwestern manufacturing renaissance.
“We are going to bring so many auto plants into our country,” Trump boomed at an event this month in Michigan. “You’re going to be as big or bigger than you were 50 years ago.”
It’s a pitch that demonstrates his keen awareness that union voters – especially auto workers – hold the keys back to the White House in the critical states that form a political firewall through Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.
It’s also one that highlights why the story of Lordstown – and the new electric vehicle battery plant located here – is such a critical window into this political moment.
Lordstown today represents singular convergence of political pledges broken and delivered, the pain and promise of economic transition, and the evolving tumult inside unions across the country that have experienced clear wins at the same moment rank-and-file members are shifting away from their long-standing support for the Democratic Party.
“Our plant, honestly, is a Trump plant,” Goranitis, who spearheaded the effort to organize the new Ultium plant where he now works, said of his union worker colleagues in a wide-ranging interview behind his UAW Local 1112 headquarters in nearby Warren.
Trump’s 2017 promise
When Trump arrived in nearby Youngstown in his first year as president, the Lordstown GM plant was already under clear signs of stress. That made Trump’s bold declarations all the more resonant with the community.
“Don’t move,” Trump said as he pledged to bring jobs back to the region. “Don’t sell your house.”
Many of the plant’s workers took Trump’s words literally, according to David Green, who served as the local UAW president during Trump’s term in office.
Seventeen months later, GM announced that the plant would be idled. Employees who wanted to hold on to their pensions would be required to relocate to other GM facilities. Houses were sold. Many moved. Others were forced to commute each week to the new locations, leaving their families to do so.
Trump railed against the GM leadership on Twitter and urged some kind of deal to reopen the plant.
But Green said his letters to the White House pleading for help were ignored – at least until he appeared on Fox News to make his case.
Trump was watching.
Shortly after, he fired off a tweet aimed squarely at Green.
“Democrat UAW Local 1112 President David Green ought to get his act together and produce,” the president wrote. “G.M. let our Country down, but other much better car companies are coming into the U.S. in droves. I want action on Lordstown fast. Stop complaining and get the job done!”
It was a heady moment for Green, who like so many others had followed his father onto the GM Lordstown factory floor and had spent his whole career there until the plant closed.
“I ignored it because my mama told me, ‘Don’t give it any credibility, and it goes nowhere,’” Green said. “The reality is my daughter got bullied over that. And I didn’t know until just a couple of years ago when she told me. She was a senior in high school, and kids were blaming me and mad at her and bullying her.”
Trump then eagerly touted the start-up Lordstown Motors as the savior he was instrumental in delivering.
He dispatched his vice president, Mike Pence, to tour the facility in 2020 with cameras in tow.
A few months before that fall’s election, Trump held a major promotional event on the South Lawn of the White House, flanked by prototypes of what the company pledged would be the first all-electric commercial pickup truck.
“The area was devastated when General Motors moved out, and then we worked together, and we made the deal on the plant,” Trump said as he stood beside the company’s chief executive.
The company would go on to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy three years later.
The executive who stood beside Trump would eventually settle with federal regulators over claims that he misled investors about demand for the first all-electric commercial pickup truck. He did not admit any wrongdoing.
Ultium breaks ground
Given the past several years, there was an understandable skepticism in the community when the new joint venture between GM and South Korea’s LG started construction on its planned electric vehicle battery manufacturing plant, which opened in 2022.
Standing inside that plant this summer, Josh Ayers was candid about when he came to believe what the future could hold.
“Probably when they actually broke ground. I mean, honestly,” Ayers said. When Ayers left the GM plant and his hometown, he never expected to find an opportunity to return to either.
“This gives people in the Valley another chance,” Ayers said as he ticked through the reasons people from here so deeply value the community, from friends and family to the familiar (and highly recommended) local restaurants such as Wedgewood Pizza and the Hot Dog Shoppe.
That Ayers was standing inside a cutting-edge technological plant like Ultium was one thing.
That he was standing next to Kareem Maine, the plant director who for many months had sat across from him during intense negotiations over the plant’s union contract, was another.
The ratification of their agreement in June marked just the latest critical development inside a plant that in many ways has laid the groundwork for an expanding industry.
“It’s easy to get caught up in the day-to-day like you look around, but you really have to take the time, step back and say, ‘Hey, we accomplished a lot in a short period of time,’” Maine said.
Those accomplishments have been closely watched by the current Oval Office inhabitant, who was quick to congratulate Ayers and his team after the agreement.
“Five years ago, the previous administration made false promises to Lordstown workers – and then stood by as the community lost jobs and faced economic devastation,” President Joe Biden said in a statement. “Today, Lordstown is a comeback story and it didn’t happen by accident.”
The Ultium plant started production just two weeks after Biden signed into law a sweeping clean energy investment package.
A record of results
The Biden administration has utilized its major legislative wins to bolster Ultium’s efforts to the tune of billions of dollars in grants and funding assistance.
Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are also unapologetically pro-union, with Biden regularly touting his view that he’s the most “pro-union president in history.”
“I agree with that,” Green said.
While UAW leaders, both national and local, pressed Biden and Harris for more aggressive action on the union’s behalf throughout the past several years of negotiations, their role in the eventual results drove emphatic national endorsements.
And the results are real, bolstering UAW President Shawn Fain’s strike strategy that led to a historic agreement with the Big Three automakers.
But it was the Ultium plant’s inclusion in that agreement – once viewed as a nonstarter in the negotiations – that was truly game-changing here in Northeast Ohio.
In total, wages for the plant’s workers were nearly doubled over the length of the agreement.
Safety standards that would serve as the barometer for all future agreements were locked in.
Most importantly, the GM Lordstown employees who were forced to transfer in 2019 had a clear path back home.
“I teared up quite a few times having these conversations with my brothers and sisters that I used to work with here in Lordstown,” said Goranitis, who started with GM out of high school and spearheaded the organizing effort at the new plant. “They never thought it was going to happen.”
Fain was given a prime speaking slot at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, where the story of Lordstown was elevated.
The UAW endorsed Harris and aggressively pushed out video of her appearance on the picket line as a senator and Democratic presidential hopeful in 2019 and her support of unions.
But on the ground here, that record of results hasn’t had a dramatic effect with rank-and-file workers.
“A lot of the members that I do speak with, they say at the time that Trump was in office that just our economy at that time, the jobs were better at that time and businesses were booming,” Goranitis said.
Goranitis, thrust into a leadership position after his efforts over the last few years, is now grappling with the complexities many in UAW leadership are confronting in the months before Election Day.
He won’t tell his members how to vote, but he is trying to explain his view that Harris and Democrats have been better for his members. The results here are, at least on their face, clear-cut.
And yet.
“It’s a hard time right now, right? Because, you know, the unions have always backed Democrats,” Goranitis said. “Always have. And it does look like it’s starting to take a turning point.”",25/9/2024
CNN,Jordan hits campaign trail for House GOP as he looks to shed firebrand reputation | CNN Politics,"A lot has changed for Jim Jordan since he lost his speakership bid last October.
In the year since, Jordan has been traveling the country and trying to make inroads with colleagues who once told him they couldn’t back him for House Republicans’ top job. And if House Republicans lose their majority next week, all eyes will be on whether Jordan is prepared to challenge a sitting member of leadership to lead Republicans in the next Congress.
Recently, the House Judiciary chairman has hit six states in seven days as he works to soften his hardline image and curry favor with more traditionalists within the party after 17 years in the House, according to interviews with roughly two dozen Republican lawmakers and aides.
Jordan told CNN he is refusing to discuss his political future if Republicans lose the House, saying he remains focused on the extremely close battle to keep their majority. Even so, Jordan’s fans and detractors alike expect the conservative heavyweight to mount a bid for House minority leader if Republicans lose control of the chamber – setting up a high-profile fight as at least one other prominent Republican, Steve Scalise, is widely expected to vie for the leadership job. The GOP’s current leader, Mike Johnson, could also try to keep the top slot.
Perhaps the most obvious shift for Jordan is fundraising. The Ohio Republican spent years donating mostly small sums to party groups and, in at least one instance, in early 2023 before he ran for speaker, asking a fellow member to contribute a cut of a fundraiser he hosted for them, according to two people familiar with the efforts.
Now, Jordan is showing up to help with no strings attached. In the run-up to the November elections, he has helped numerous GOP incumbents who face primary threats from the right and he’s cutting checks for dozens of members in tough districts, including members who opposed him for speaker last year, such as Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska and John James of Michigan.
In an interview with CNN, Jordan credited his failed speaker bid with helping him to appreciate the dynamics that his fellow Republicans face in competitive swing districts.
“I got to know so many of my colleagues in the course of that campaign, and it was a good thing even though I didn’t win,” Jordan told CNN, speaking just before a political event for vulnerable GOP Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia — another one of the roughly 20 Republicans who opposed Jordan during the speaker’s race. He recalled promising his fellow members at the time that he “would do everything I could to help us keep the majority and expand the majority.”
If Republicans keep the House, Jordan said his only leadership aspirations are to keep his gavel on the House Judiciary Committee. But pushed repeatedly about whether he’d rule out challenging a sitting GOP leader if Republicans lose their majority, Jordan would only say that House Republicans won’t lose.
“We are going to win. You can feel it.”
Republicans across the conference are closely watching Jordan’s moves and said his trek to Kiggans’ Virginia Beach swing seat is further proof that he’s learned key lessons from last year’s ugly leadership battle. They say the one-time Freedom Caucus leader’s rebranding effort has won over some of his critics. Other Republicans told CNN they are far more open to him leading the party as House minority leader — a role that emphasizes attack-dog messaging over governing — rather than speaker.
“Jim is working pretty hard to mend fences,” said one GOP lawmaker who voted for Jordan for speaker last year and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the early leadership jockeying. The Republican member said Jordan has “stepped up involvement in the last six months,” including sending out supportive mailers to help this member, and other conservative Republicans, avoid a far-right challenger in a primary this cycle.
Jordan’s team-player approach is a far cry from the last time he lost a leadership race and after his earlier failed bid against Kevin McCarthy for minority leader six years ago.
And if the House does flip, several Republicans said they believed Jordan would have a real chance of winning the post of minority leader. Unlike in Jordan’s ill-fated bid for speaker last year, he would only need a simple majority of Republicans to elect him minority leader. Other potential GOP candidates aren’t yet clear if Republicans lose the chamber, but most Republican lawmakers believe Scalise, the current House majority leader, will almost certainly run for the No. 1 spot. Johnson is the wildcard: It’s not clear whether he would attempt to remain atop the party.
Bad blood from the speaker’s race
Jordan would still need to overcome a feeling of resentment among some members from last year’s brutal race. Multiple members who voted against Jordan said they still remember how their offices were inundated with angry calls from his supporters and some of the nasty and personal threats they received.
Those outside threats were a key reason Jordan couldn’t win the gavel during last October’s leadership fight. In one meeting among Jordan and his detractors, he asked members point-blank how he could earn their support. One by one, those members — which included GOP Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart, Carlos Gimenez, Steve Womack and others — made clear they would not support Jordan under any circumstance, voicing frustrations about what they saw as a pressure campaign orchestrated by Jordan allies to convince them to vote for Jordan on the floor.
While Jordan and his team maintained they never encouraged those kinds of threats, members who were the subject of those calls have not entirely let it go.
“I think he did himself a great deal of damage in that there is a persona, the outside appearance, of Jim Jordan, and then there is the other side. He showed us the other side, and I don’t like it,” one GOP member told CNN. “Maybe this quest got the better of him in that occasion. I’m willing to look at that. But you know, the best indicator of future behavior is what you’ve done in the past.”
Other long-serving Republicans said they still feel stung by the weeks-long saga, where they argue Jordan dragged out the drama by forcing the House GOP to go to the floor for multiple rounds of ballots that he lost. That’s particularly true among senior Republicans known as the “old bulls,” who still question whether Jordan has truly evolved from the burn-down-the-house Freedom Caucus leader who battled with former Speaker John Boehner nearly a decade ago.
“Obviously the Freedom Caucus is always going to be a part of who Jim Jordan is,” said Rep. Kelly Armstrong, who has worked closely with Jordan for years but was elected to the House after the bruising Tea Party fights in the Obama era. “The people I know who are skeptical, I think a lot of it still comes from before I got to Congress. And you know what, Jim probably earned some of that,” Armstrong said with a chuckle.
“He hasn’t mellowed. I don’t think anybody would accuse him of being a cupcake,” Armstrong added. But he said Jordan’s bulldog-style of messaging — which resonates strongly with the GOP base — would be an enormous asset to any party in the minority, particularly if they’ll be working with a President Donald Trump.
“If Trump wins the White House and we somehow lose the House, who’s the No. 1 guy?” Armstrong said. “I don’t know anybody better.”
Jordan’s evolution as a party fundraiser
Republicans say there’s one other memorable exchange during last year’s speaker race that has remained on their minds this year: How far Jordan is willing to go to help the team financially.
During last year’s GOP candidate forum for speaker, Jordan was asked a question from Rep. Ann Wagner of Missouri about his willingness to lend his own fundraising skills to support vulnerable Republicans. His answer, according to multiple people in the room: It wasn’t his job to raise money for members in tough seats.
Some Republicans recalled an instance when members asked Jordan — with his powerful conservative credentials — to help them fundraise, they were told a portion raised would be expected to contribute to Jordan’s own fundraising groups. Jordan’s team said his fundraising groups were set up to largely benefit the House GOP campaign group, the National Republican Congressional Committee.
While it’s not entirely unusual for GOP surrogates to ask other campaigns to offset travel costs and provide a cut of the fundraising if an event is highly successful, some Republicans privately scoffed at a GOP chairman using that practice.
But since then, Jordan’s mindset on fundraising has shifted dramatically. Campaign spending records show his campaign donated to roughly 50 incumbents in the last quarter, including a half dozen Republicans who opposed him on the floor last year. And not all of that cash went to incumbents in tough races: He gave $2,000 each to safe-seat Republicans, Rep. Victoria Spartz and Doug LaMalfa, who both opposed Jordan last year.
He’s also contributing widely to GOP candidates looking to flip critical blue seats in places like Maryland, Michigan, Alaska and Virginia next month. And he’s not just building ties to incoming Republicans in swing seats: Jordan phones any Republican who wins a primary to congratulate them, according to two people familiar with the conversations.
While some Republicans pointed to Jordan’s substantial campaign chest — a total of $7.3 million on hand, according to the latest financial disclosure in mid-October — others have lauded his multi-million-dollar checks this cycle. That includes $1.5 million in direct cash transfers to the NRCC this cycle. Jordan’s team says the congressman has raised an additional $1 million for the NRCC through events and other means like direct mail.
It’s a significant haul this cycle. Over his career, Jordan has given or raised $4.2 million for the NRCC and Jordan’s team says the congressman has given $2.2 million directly to candidates during his time in Congress.
One Republican who opposed Jordan for speaker last year credited the Ohio Republican’s willingness to contribute to his one-time detractors.
“When he was asked, ‘Do you want to support these guys financially,?’ He could have easily said ‘f off’ but he didn’t,” that Republican said.",29/10/2024
CNN,Milwaukee’s Black voters expose cracks in Democratic foundation for Harris | CNN Politics,"Devonta Johnson is going door to door, clipboard in hand, wearing a bright yellow vest and a seemingly permanent smile.
“How do you feel about Kamala Harris?” Johnson asks when a woman answers the door and steps out onto the porch.
“I think she is great,” the woman says, and Johnson’s smile gets even bigger.
“How do you feel about Trump?” he asks.
“Not so great,” is the quick response.
The conversation lasts another minute or so, as Johnson runs through early voting opportunities and asks for a phone number so he can check back and make sure supporting Harris translates into voting for her. Then a pleasant goodbye, and Johnson turns back to the sidewalk and heads to the next knock.
Johnson and his colleagues from Black Leaders Organizing for Communities walk these streets year-round. But their steps are now a bit quicker and the falling leaves add a little color and crunching sound. The Halloween decorations on the lawn tell us the calendar is moving. So does the new script the canvassers are carrying.
“I just wanted to remind you that early voting starts on October 22,” one says to a man who steps out to talk.
It is turnout time, and any path to a Democratic victory in Wisconsin – which flipped from Trump to Joe Biden four years ago – begins in these overwhelmingly Black neighborhoods on Milwaukee’s north side.
“There’s a lot of momentum,” says Angela Lang, a veteran organizer who is the BLOC executive director. “Generally speaking, people feel pretty good about where we are at.”
The energy and activism among Black women is obvious. Plus, Lang says, her conversations with other organizers suggest perhaps a few surprises in the Wisconsin count.
“You can’t win a statewide election here without going through the heart of Milwaukee and in some cases that runs through this office and the work that our team does,” Lang said in an interview. “But we are also seeing folks in heavily red areas that are getting together with other women at coffee shops without their husbands knowing, for example, and starting to have those conversations.”
We first visited Lang and BLOC a year ago, in the early weeks of our CNN project – “All Over The Map” – to track the 2024 election through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds or are members of crucial voting blocs.
It is obvious that Harris is in better shape now than Biden was during that first visit last October.
Back then, even Johnson, then 21, said he was not sure who he would vote for, describing Biden and Trump as too old and disconnected from his generation. Now, he is as excited to vote for Harris as he is to knock doors organizing for her and other Democrats.
“At the time, I was like kind of iffy, feeling like everybody else, kind of undecided,” Johnson said of his choices before Harris got in the race. “But now that Kamala got the ball and she rollin’ with it, I feel like oh yeah. … She’s making a good image for herself and for the Democrats.”
A year ago, Lang was blunt about Biden’s struggles in Milwaukee’s Black neighborhoods. Now she says there is energy around Harris and myriad efforts to find creative ways to generate high turnout.
“It’s extremely different,” Lang said.
Cracks in the Democratic coalition
Yet she candidly discussed cracks and concerns in the Democratic foundation, which were on clear display as we walked with the canvassers and sat in on the meeting in which they share notes about what they call being “on doors.”
Some who answer don’t plan to vote.
“Because they say it isn’t going to change anything,” one of the canvassers said at the meeting.
Young Black voters are harder to motivate.
“We still got a job to do,” one of the canvassers told her colleagues. “They have a lot of questions that’s not answered.”
But by far the biggest worry is Black men.
Two things come up the most.
“People are, like, ‘I think I had more money in my pocket when Trump was in office because of the stimulus checks during the pandemic,’” Lang said.
She tells canvassers to point out Congress passed that funding and that Trump initially opposed the idea, though he in the end had his signature printed on the checks.
The second concern is about how Harris got her start in politics: as a county prosecutor and later as California’s attorney general.
“It makes sense why people may have a little bit of a pause,” Lang said of the vice president’s background in law enforcement. “I myself did as well.”
Now she tells canvassers that a key Harris priority as a prosecutor were programs designed to reduce recidivism.
‘They look at a man as being a leader’
Brian McMutuary says he is open to listening in the final days. He was a lifelong Democrat until he voted for Trump in 2020.
He disagrees with Trump on abortion rights and immigration. But he likes the former president’s take on cryptocurrency and remembers being better off when Trump was president.
“When I go to the grocery store, I get what I need, not so much what I want or what the kids want,” McMutuary said in an interview in Menomonee Falls, a Milwaukee suburb. “We need to make it each week. We have a budget, you know. It is tight.”
McMutuary also says he worries Russia’s Vladimir Putin and China’s Xi Jinping would not treat Harris as an equal.
“They look at a man as being a leader,” he said.
He said he had no problem with a woman president.
“Nope, not at all,” McMutuary said. “It’s about doing the right thing for the country.”
Eric Jones says he has heard that and more as he makes the rounds getting coffee, going to the barbershop or in his real estate business.
“If I were a gambling man, I would probably put my money on Harris,” Jones told us in an interview at Confectionately Yours, a new Black-owned coffee shop and bakery on Milwaukee’s Martin Luther King Jr. Drive.
“Things are getting better,” Jones said. “The numbers are better. The energy is different. It’s a lot different from when we were here last time, especially in terms of the election.”
Still, he sees the same cracks and doubts relayed by the BLOC community organizers, especially among Black men.
“They’ll say, ‘I had more money when he was the president,’’’ Jones said.
Harris’ work as San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general might help woo suburban voters but, at a minimum, raises questions here.
“Law enforcement has not been kind to Black people historically,” Jones said. “District attorneys have not been kind to Black people historically.”
Jones also says abortion and transgender rights have come up in some recent debates at stops in the community.
“The good old party feels they have a monopoly on the Christian vote,” Jones said. “The Democratic Party feels they have a monopoly over the Black vote. The problem is there are a lot of Blacks that are Christians and the Black church is one of the strongest institutions in the Black community, right?”
“So you have this tug of war in a city that I’m pretty sure the Black folk will decide who wins that city, and more than likely, the presidency.”",11/10/2024
CNN,Trump stokes voter fraud fears in Pennsylvania as counties investigate and state urges patience | CNN Politics,"Former President Donald Trump on Tuesday claimed two Pennsylvania counties are experiencing voter fraud despite both officials there maintaining they’re still investigating potential issues related to voter registration applications.
A week from Election Day, the former president and the Republican National Committee appear to be laying the groundwork to challenge voting results if Trump loses. The former president did not wait for the results of the York and Lancaster county investigations before stoking fears on social media about allegedly fraudulent voter registration applications, even as Pennsylvania’s secretary of state asked the public for patience. And, in a separate instance, the RNC joined the Trump campaign in pushing claims of “voter suppression,” as election officials in the critical battleground pushed back.
“Wow! York County, Pennsylvania, received THOUSANDS of potentially FRUADULENT Voter Registration Forms and Mail-In Ballot Applications from a third party group,” Trump wrote Tuesday in a post on X that received over 1 million views in just a few hours.
“This on top of Lancaster County being caught with 2600 Fake Ballots and Forms, all written by the same person. Really bad ‘stuff.’ WHAT IS GOING ON IN PENNSYLVANIA??? Law Enforcement must do their job, immediately!!! WOW!!!” he continued.
Trump and RNC officials have increasingly floated claims about potential issues with mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania in the lead-up to November 5, as the former president’s allies also target mail-in ballots in court.
State and county officials, meanwhile, have sought to reassure voters that they are investigating any alleged issues with the mail-in ballot process and that they are seeking to protect the integrity of the election process at this early stage.
Pennsylvania Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on “The Source” Tuesday night that the allegations are “more of the same” from Trump, adding that as the state’s attorney general he defeated 43 challenges to the 2020 vote count from the former president “and his allies.”
“I understand that Donald Trump wants to again use the same playbook where he tries to create chaos and stoke division and fear about our system. But again, we will have a free and fair, safe, and secure election in Pennsylvania, and the will of the people will be respected and protected,” Shapiro added.
Suspected voter registration fraud under investigation
Last week, law enforcement and election officials in Lancaster County announced they had identified “incidents of suspected voter registration fraud.” The suspected fraud, according to the bipartisan board of elections and the county’s district attorney, likely stemmed from “a large-scale canvassing operation” that submitted registration applications with duplicate handwriting and inaccurate or unverifiable addresses.
The officials said “approximately 2,500 voter registration forms have been contained and segregated” to be reviewed and investigated but did not say how many of those have been found to be fraudulent.
While announcing the suspected fraud, Lancaster officials said at least two other counties may have also received fraudulent voter registration applications.
On Tuesday, York County spokesperson Greg Monskie would not confirm to CNN whether it had received fraudulent voter registration applications and couldn’t speak to any connection with the issues alleged in Lancaster County.
In a statement, York County President Commissioner Julie Wheeler said the county had received a “large delivery containing thousands of election-related materials from a third-party organization,” and that “those material appear to include completed voter registration forms, as well as mail-in ballot applications.”
CNN has reached out to the Lancaster County Board of Elections for an update following Trump’s latest claims.
“As with all submissions, our staff follows a process for ensuring all voter registrations and mail-in ballot requests are legal. That process is currently underway,” Wheeler said. “If suspected fraud is identified, we will alert the District Attorney’s Office, which will then conduct an investigation.”
Pennsylvania Secretary of State Al Schmidt, a Republican, acknowledged the ongoing investigations in York and Lancaster in a video briefing Tuesday.
“The department has been in touch with these counties from the very beginning to provide guidance to them as they conduct their investigations and will continue to support them as needed,” he said.
Election officials push back on claims of ‘voter suppression’
In Delaware County, officials are pushing back on earlier claims from the Trump campaign and the RNC that “voter suppression” occurred after an incident Monday at a local polling site where county officials say a woman was removed because she was “disruptive, belligerent, and attempting to influence voters waiting in line.”
RNC Chairman Michael Whatley shared a video of the woman in handcuffs on X, claiming that “a supporter of President Trump’s was arrested today for encouraging people to stay in the early voting line and cast their ballots freely in Pennsylvania.”
“This is voter suppression from the left. Don’t let them turn you away,” he wrote.
The Trump campaign later amplified the incident in a press release.
The interaction took place at the Voter Service Center in Media, Pennsylvania, the seat of the suburban Philadelphia county.
According to a statement from a county spokesperson, a woman was arrested and removed from the building after she, “according to multiple eyewitnesses, was disruptive, belligerent, and attempting to influence voters waiting in line.”
“Her behavior prompted several complaints from those in line. Delaware County Park Police — who provide security for the Government Center Building — were on-site and responded promptly to the disturbance,” the statement continued.
Val Biancaniello, the woman who was detained, appears to be one of the GOP certified electors this cycle, according to the Pennsylvania Department of State. CNN has reached out to Biancaniello for comment.
After the incident, Biancaniello posted on X, “They arrested me and I didn’t break any laws. I encouraged people to stay in line and vote because the Democrats were discouraging voters from in person voting today in Delaware County.”
In response, Delaware County Council Chair Monica Taylor said in a statement to CNN that the county takes “voting rights very seriously,” adding: “Voters have a right to participate in our democracy without being harassed or intimidated, and we applaud our Park Police for calming the disturbance and allowing voting to continue without disruption.”
The Delaware County district attorney’s office confirmed to CNN that Biancaniello was “briefly detained” and said she “will be receiving a citation for disorderly conduct (a summary offense similar to a traffic ticket).”
Linda Kerns, an attorney who represents the RNC and the Trump campaign, told CNN on Tuesday that her team was still attempting to gather information about the incident in Media.
A lack of clarity about the incident in Media has not stopped Republican operatives and pro-Trump influencers from seizing on the video and claiming it is an example of “voter suppression from the left.” Meanwhile, the RNC is continuing its legal battle over Pennsylvania’s mail-in ballots and has filed an emergency petition to the Supreme Court.

CNN,Michigan autoworkers see more enthusiasm for Harris — but also more sexism and racism | CNN Politics,"Tonya Rincon just retired and is “learning to cook again.” But most new hobbies need to wait. Election Day is near, and Rincon is trying to help her union and Vice President Kamala Harris win the blue-collar battle for Michigan.
“I think it’s still about 50-50 among union autoworkers,” said Rincon, a member of United Auto Workers Local 900 and a 30-year Ford assembly worker.
Rincon long ago lost patience with supporters of former President Donald Trump in the Ford assembly plant just across the road from her union hall.
“They think the Democrats are going to mandate all electric vehicles and it is going to kill our jobs,” Rincon said in an interview near her home in Wayne. “They think they are going to benefit from the Trump tax cuts even though we don’t make enough money to benefit from the Trump tax cuts.”
With time running short, her focus as she volunteers to knock on doors is on workers who are open to voting for a Democrat. She says many see things differently since the dramatic July shift from President Joe Biden to Harris atop the Democratic ticket.
“There’s a little bit more enthusiasm among some of my female colleagues,” Rincon said. “Couple of my male co-workers are pretty ambivalent about Harris. We may have lost a tiny margin of support, because sexism is a real thing, you know. I don’t think they are going to switch to Trump. I think they just may stay home.”
Rincon is participating in our All Over the Map project, an effort to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in battleground states and are part of critical voting blocs.
We first met in June and learned quickly that Rincon speaks bluntly. Back then, she was candid about a low level of enthusiasm even among those planning to support Biden.
Now, as she volunteers to help elect Harris, she takes issue with male colleagues who would vote for Biden but are wavering about Harris.
“They are just sexist,” she said. “They are like, you know, ‘I’m not sure she can do it. I don’t think the country is ready for a female president.’”
Trying to win them over is critical for Harris in a state that’s so close and so crucial to her path to victory. It’s also important because the United Auto Workers leadership — which endorsed Harris over the summer — is trying to get more members to make voting decisions based on the issues that are key to labor.
“It’s a pretty easy decision to make if you compare the policies side by side,” Rincon said.
Rincon’s door knocking gives her unique insight on why the math of this campaign is so different and unpredictable.
At one house, she meets a younger voter who voted for Biden in 2020 but is supporting the Green Party’s Jill Stein this year because of anger at how the White House has handled the Israel-Hamas conflict.
“People got to go somewhere with their grief and anger,” Rincon said. “I can have a conversation. That’s all I can do.”
Then, a voter Rincon expects to be Republican but who shares support for Harris.
“There are some people who are just tired of the drama,” Rincon said. “People are just, ‘I want this to be over. I want to make politics boring again.’”
Her take two weeks out: “It’s really, really close.”
New energy for Harris — but also more division
Walter Robinson Jr. agrees it is close — and says there is more emotion on both sides since the July switch to Harris.
“It’s more energy and it’s probably more division,” said Robinson. He sees a net plus for Harris since the switch. In June, with Biden as the candidate, he shared Rincon’s view the Wayne plant was split 50-50.
“Right now, I would probably say it is about 60-40” for Harris, Robinson said. “More people have more energy about the Democratic candidate now.”
The tone of debate, he says, has taken a turn for the worse.
“They have been saying some very disparaging things about the vice president,” Robinson said of Trump supporters. Just about every day, Robinson said, he has to decide how much to push back.
“They parrot what (Trump) puts out there,” he said. “The sexist and the racist things. I call them out, but I’m not going to spend too much time because I know that I’m not going to change their mind.”
Robinson helps with UAW organizing just about every weekend, knocking on doors at labor households in the Detroit suburbs. As time runs short, he sometimes thinks about what it would mean to elect a woman of color as president.
“That’s another ceiling that shows we are kind of moving toward a more inclusive nation,” said Robinson, who is Black. “That would be good to see. If she wins, hopefully all hell doesn’t break loose.”
A Trump voter who doesn’t believe everything he says
Our return visit with 30-plus-year Ford worker Bill Govier was a reminder the Democratic ticket switch was not the only big candidate news this year. In June, Govier said he was intrigued by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
But Kennedy has now ended his third-party campaign and endorsed Trump.
“RFK joining Trump, effectively, I couldn’t script it any better,” Govier said. “I love the idea of Donald Trump being the commander in chief. I love the idea of how Donald Trump handles the nefarious characters in the world.”
Govier voted twice for Barack Obama but has turned anti-establishment in recent years. If Trump wins, Govier voiced hope he would bring Kennedy and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii into his administration. Both are former Democrats who frequently wander into conspiracy theories.
Govier said he has a hard time taking Harris seriously, saying, among other things, she laughs too much.
“What is it?” he said of the Harris message. “You’re the incumbent who wouldn’t do anything different or are you the underdog who wants change?”
Govier also supported Trump in 2016 and 2020. From the beginning, he says Trump critics have overreacted to what Govier insists are exaggerations, not outrages.
“He does it for effect,” Govier said. “I don’t believe that Trump really believes someone’s eating cats and dogs. I don’t believe that he’s going to call the National Guard out and, at gunpoint, round up every migrant and force them across the border. I don’t believe that for a second. But I do believe he sensationalizes things. That’s how he’s always talked. He’s always been that way.”
Why a longtime Democrat is voting Trump
Joseph Knowles has always been a Democrat. Until now.
“I’m independent now,” Knowles said in an interview at his home in Clinton Township, part of blue-collar Macomb County north of Detroit.
Knowles, who is Black, attended a Trump rally earlier this year.
“I took it from my mom, my auntie, my cousins, my sister — they came at me,” Knowles said. Relatives mentioned how Trump treats women, demeans Black people and conducted himself on January 6, 2021.
But Knowles said none of that matters to him.
“All I care about right now is how am I going to be able to take care of my wife and kids,” Knowles said.
Knowles is one of 1,100 UAW members recently laid off by Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler and Jeep.
He blames corporate greed and said the company is breaking a promise it made in contract negotiations with the UAW last year.
But he assigns “second blame” to Biden and his administration.
“Because of the EV mandates,” he said.
The Biden administration, which has laid out future electric vehicle sales targets for new cars, has not mandated anyone buy them. And there are currently more automobile manufacturing jobs in the United States than at any point of the Trump presidency. But his union supporters here routinely parrot Trump in saying the industry is devastated because of Biden administration clean-energy policies.
Knowles echoes another Trump line in voicing his support for mass deportation of undocumented immigrants.
“If it is done legally and they cross correctly, I have no problem with it,” Knowles said. “But if you do it the wrong way, I think you should get rounded up and just thrown out. I have no problem with that because it jeopardizes my way of providing for my kids if they take jobs.”
He has never voted Republican before. But he finds himself in a new place: struggling to explain being laid off to his four sons and ignoring or deflecting criticism from family members who are harshly critical of his plans to vote Trump.
“I’m desperate,” Knowles said. “So, I’m wanting to try anything right now to make sure I can fulfill my responsibility and to take care of my wife and kids. That’s all I care about.”",21/10/2024
CNN,Analysis: The electorate is changing. Here’s what that means for Trump and Harris. | CNN Politics,"There’s a reason Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are intensifying efforts to reach beyond their party’s traditional supporters in the final weeks of this razor-thin campaign.
Extending a pattern that stretches back decades, White voters without a college degree, the cornerstone of the modern GOP coalition, have declined by a little more than 2 percentage points as a share of eligible voters since 2020, falling below 40% of the eligible voting pool for the first time ever, according a new analysis of the latest Census Bureau data by demographer William Frey shared exclusively with CNN.
While those working-class Whites are shrinking, Frey found that both Whites with at least a four-year college degree and voters of color have each increased since 2020 by about a single percentage point as a share of eligible voters. Those increases also continue long-term trends that have seen well-educated Whites grow to represent more than 1-in-4 eligible voters and people of color rise past 1-in-3.
These trends help explain why the former president has devoted so much effort to reaching beyond his traditional base of White voters without a college education to attract more Black and Latino voters, especially men. And, in turn, the trends help explain the emphasis the vice president is placing on attracting more college-educated White voters who have previously leaned toward the GOP — a priority she underscored by barnstorming across populous white-collar suburbs outside Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee with GOP former Rep. Liz Cheney on Monday.
The impact of these incremental shifts in the composition of the major voter groups can easily be outweighed by changes in the preferences of those groups. Trump, for instance, is counting on gains among Latino voters, especially men, to neutralize the anticipated benefits for Democrats as Latinos increase their share of the vote, particularly in closely contested Arizona and Nevada.
But the cumulative impact of these shifts in the electorate’s basic composition is undeniable. Trump, for instance, in each of his two presidential campaigns won nearly as big a share of White voters without a college education as Ronald Reagan did in 1984, according to exit polls. Yet because those working-class Whites had fallen from about two-thirds of voters in 1984 to around two-fifths now, Trump only won about 47% of the total vote in each of his two campaigns, while Reagan captured nearly 59%.
Even this year, in a race so close, small shifts in the electorate’s composition across the most competitive states could make a difference. For instance, the fact that non-college Whites, according to Frey’s analysis, have fallen as a share of the eligible electorate since 2020 considerably more in Michigan and Wisconsin than in Pennsylvania may help explain why most analysts consider the Keystone State more difficult than the other two for Harris.
Shifts in racial and educational levels are not the only important changes Frey, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Brookings Metro think tank, has tracked in the make-up of eligible voters between 2020 and 2024. He also found that women will comprise nearly 52% of all eligible voters, which should help Harris. But his analysis shows that number actually represents a very small shift in the eligible electorate since 2020 toward men, which at the margin might benefit Trump. Frey also finds that Generation Z will make a big jump in their share of eligible voters, from about 1-in-10 last time to more than 1-in-6 this year. That increase underscores the stakes in Harris’ attempt to max out her support among younger women and Trump’s determined attempts to court young men.
Frey’s analysis finds that the White voters without a college degree are declining as a share of eligible voters not only in the nation overall but specifically across almost all of the seven battleground states. (North Carolina is the sole swing state where he found that they had increased as a portion of eligible voters since 2020.)
That decline is rooted in an ongoing process of generational replacement. Compared to younger generations, America’s older cohorts are much more heavily White and also much less likely to hold at least a four-year college degree. As those older Whites age out of the electorate, and more diverse and better-educated generations grow into it, the composition of the eligible voter pool inexorably transforms.
“Whites are a shrinking part of the population and a part of that population which is shrinking even more are the people who don’t have college education,” said Frey.
While these blue-collar Whites are receding in both the Rustbelt and Sunbelt electorates, different kinds of voters are replacing them across the two regions, Frey found.
These blue-collar Whites represent a much larger share of the total electorate in the Rustbelt than the Sunbelt: Frey found that in 2020 they comprised around half of eligible voters in both Michigan and Pennsylvania and nearly three-fifths in Wisconsin.
But Frey found that since 2020, they have declined more rapidly than almost anywhere else in Michigan (falling by nearly 3 percentage points) and Wisconsin (dropping by more than 3 percentage points). In Michigan, he found a slight increase in minority voters among the eligible voter pool, while in Wisconsin those non-White voters, who were already a smaller share of eligibles than in the other Rustbelt battlegrounds, actually declined even further.
In both states, the big gainers since 2020 are Whites with at least a four-year college degree: Frey found they increased more than 2 percentage points as a share of eligible voters in Michigan and over 4 points in Wisconsin.
In Pennsylvania, the shift isn’t as dramatic: Frey found that the non-college White share of eligible voters dropped since 2020 by about 1.5 percentage points, about half as much as in the other two former “blue wall” states. A small increase in the minority population made up most of that difference, with college-educated Whites increasing only very slightly.
Across the Sunbelt battlegrounds, blue-collar Whites are a smaller share of the eligible voters: about 1-in-3 in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada and just over 2-in-5 in North Carolina. Arizona and Georgia saw big increases since 2020 in the minority share of their eligible voter population, Frey found, while non-Whites actually declined somewhat in North Carolina and remained almost unchanged in Nevada. College-educated Whites increased as a portion of eligible voters in Nevada and Arizona, while falling slightly in Georgia and essentially holding steady in North Carolina.
After these shifts, the minority share of the eligible voting population will remain much higher in the Sunbelt than Rustbelt states, with voters of color representing about one-third of the eligible voter population in North Carolina, a little more than two-fifths in Arizona and more than 45% in both Nevada and Georgia.
In both the Rustbelt and Sunbelt, the winning modern demographic formula for Democrats since the 1990s has been to maximize their support among non-White voters and grow their support among college-educated Whites, while holding down their losses among the blue-collar Whites, with a particular focus on women in each group. In the Trump era, the dominant GOP demographic strategy has been to maximize their support among working-class voters without a college degree, particularly men. That strategy has broadened from a nearly exclusive focus on White working-class voters in Trump’s 2016 race to his more panoramic attempt this year to attract non-college-educated Black and Latino voters as well, especially men.
Manuel Pastor, director of the Equity Research Institute at the University of Southern California, says the contrasting strategies of Harris and Trump in the campaign’s final days illuminate “the task of reinvention that each party faces” as a result of the electorate’s ongoing racial and educational reconfiguration.
Trump, Pastor notes, has responded to the relentless increase in the electorate’s diversity by stressing “really a more male-leaning, masculine approach that is helping to make inroads with Latino males and, to a lesser extent, Black males.” (Trump is devoting a comparable effort to courting younger White men, especially those without college degrees, appearing on podcasts and other media sources where they congregate.)
And while Harris is expending enormous defensive effort on holding as many Latino and especially Black men as possible, she’s also accepting the shifting composition of the party’s coalition more explicitly than President Joe Biden did in 2020 and throughout his presidency, Pastor believes.
Biden, he notes, embodied an almost nostalgic desire to hold onto the Democrats’ mid-20th century base of White working-class voters, but Harris, the daughter of two academics herself, has leaned more comfortably into the party’s modern identity as a coalition primarily of often economically struggling minorities and more comfortable college-educated suburbanites.
“Where Democrats have made inroads is with college-educated Whites who are offended by Trump’s language around immigrants, around his dalliance with right-wing neo-fascist groups and language, with the threats around ‘the enemy within’ — all of the stuff Harris is trying to make sure to get into the conversation” in these final days, Pastor said.
Patrick Ruffini, a Republican pollster who specializes in demographic trends, said the offsetting gains of Democrats with well-educated Whites and Trump with blue-collar non-Whites should be understand as inextricably linked components of the same dynamic. “Trump doing better among working class minorities is a function of Democrats doing better among college educated voters,” Ruffini, the author of the recent book “Party of the People” about the shifting GOP coalition, wrote in an email. “As the electorate polarizes on education, the nonwhite working class will not be immune from these trends and will gravitate towards Trump more than your standard issue Republican. I think he is broadening the coalition, not necessarily with a lot of intentional effort, but because of natural dynamics in the electorate,” he added.
Democrats need to remain at least competitive among working-class White voters, particularly in the Rustbelt battlegrounds, where historically they have been able to win a significantly higher percentage of them than in the South (where far more of those voters are staunchly conservative evangelical Christians). But anywhere in the country, the most realistic goal for Democrats among these working-class Whites — especially against Trump’s formidable appeal to them — is to hold down their losses.
The groups that Harris needs to give her winning margins are the non-White and college-educated White voters (especially women in each case). The fact that both of those groups are increasing in the electorate, while Trump’s best cohort is shrinking, may give Harris a small swell in her sails. “The growing parts of the population are leaning Democrat, even in this time” when so many voters are discontented with conditions in the country, Frey said. The fact that women are likely to cast more ballots than men in all the swing states, he believes, will provide a small lift to Harris as well.
But many analysts point out these demographic changes can easily be overcome if Trump can reduce the Democratic margins among the groups she’s likely to win, or expand his own lead among his best groups. For instance, the fact that members of Gen Z are growing in the electorate should benefit Harris, given that Democrats have won big majorities among young people in every election since 2004, the first when millennials entered the electorate in large numbers. But while Harris is posting huge advantages among Gen Z women, Trump may somewhat blunt the impact of this generational transition if he can run as well among Gen Z men as polls show is now possible.
Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute and author of the recent book “The Politics of Gen Z,” says almost everything about Trump’s messaging on cultural, racial and gender issues profoundly alienates the vast majority of Gen Z women. “I think Gen Z women, including White women, are very committed to an inclusive democracy,” she said.
But while young men may not entirely endorse Trump’s most vituperative and vitriolic messages about racial and cultural change either, she said, they are less likely to find such statements disqualifying amid their concerns about their economic prospects. (Among younger generations, far more women than men are earning four-year and post-graduate college degrees.) Some younger men may also find Trump’s swaggering persona attractive, she noted, viewing him almost as an “anti-hero.”
“For young people in general, there are huge amounts of economic anxiety,” Deckman said. “But I think the difference is that Gen Z women are more likely to prioritize social issues whereas Gen Z men tend to vote more on pocketbook issues.”
These cross-currents among the electorate’s youngest cohort underscores a larger point: At such a fluid moment in US politics, the shift in the electorate’s composition doesn’t so much portend the result of this year’s election as define the assignments that each side faces in attempting to assemble a winning coalition.
One other factor is critical to any discussion of how demographic change may influence the balance of power between the two parties this year. The composition of the actual voters who turn up on Election Day is shaped not only by the share of eligible voters each group represents, but also, of course, by their turnout rates.
College-educated White voters consistently turn out at much higher rates than any other group. In the 2020 election, nearly 9-in-10 eligible White adults with at least a four-year college degree voted, compared to just under 2-in-3 Whites without a college degree and about 3-in-5 non-White voters, according to calculations from Census data provided to me by Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political scientist who studies voter participation.
As a result, the college-educated Whites tend to comprise a slightly larger share of the actual than eligible electorate while the relationship is reversed for the other two groups. Analyzing Census data, Frey and McDonald both found that in 2020 college-educated Whites cast just over 3-in-10 votes, while people of color cast just below 3-in-10. The White voters without a college degree remained the electorate’s largest group, but they cast slightly less than 40% of all votes — the first time they had fallen below that threshold among actual voters. (Census data indicates that these blue-collar Whites fell below a majority of the nation’s electorate for the first time in 2008, when Barack Obama was elected the nation’s first Black president.)
A similar pattern is evident along gender lines. Eligible female voters have turned out at a higher rate than eligible male voters in every election since 1980, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. (Before that, men voted at higher rates than women.) That gap can be substantial: using Census data, Frey has calculated that in the presidential elections since 2004, turnout among eligible women has always exceeded the rate among men by at least 3.3 percentage points, reaching as much as 4 points in some cases.
As a result, according to Frey’s analysis of Census data, in all of the seven swing states, women in 2020 comprised a larger share of actual than eligible voters. They represented about 52% of actual voters last time in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Nevada, 54% in North Carolina and around 55% in both Arizona and Georgia, he found. (Nationwide, Frey’s analysis of Census data showed women casting 53% of all ballots, slightly more than their 52% share of the eligible electorate.) One rule of thumb among Democrats is that they usually triumph when they win women by at least as large a margin as Republicans win men; these data indicate Harris could survive even if Trump wins men by slightly more.
Young people, of course, consistently turn out at much lower rates than older voters, even though their participation has trended upward in the Trump era. Potentially worrisome for Trump is that the gender gap in turnout rates is even greater for young women and men than it is among the older generations, the Rutgers Center has found. Younger non-White men, who have expressed the most receptivity to Trump in minority communities, have an especially meager turnout record.
Other sources of data about the composition of the electorate in 2020 paint slightly different pictures than the Census data Frey uses. The Pew Research Center’s validated voters study put Whites without a college degree at 42% of all voters, while the analysis by Catalist, a Democratic targeting firm, figured them at 44%. Each of those analyses placed both the college-educated Whites and non-Whites just a tick lower than the Census data. Pew, the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN, and the AP/VoteCast project with NORC found that women represented just a slightly smaller share of all voters last time than the Census did; Catalist concluded they represented even more.
Still, all these data sources agree on the same basic pattern over the differing periods that they cover. Consistently they find Whites without a college degree shrinking as a share of actual voters at a rate of about 2 percentage points every four years, with non-Whites posting the greatest gains and college-educated Whites increasing more slowly, though also steadily growing. And they agree that women now consistently cast the majority of votes in presidential elections.
No one, of course, can entirely predict how many voters from each of these groups will turn out this year. But this history clearly shows it is likely that the changes in the composition of the eligible electorate Frey has documented will closely track the shifts in the configuration of the actual electorate. Most of the experts I spoke with believe it’s a good bet that, just as with the eligible population, Whites without a college degree will continue to shrink as a share of actual voters by about 2 percentage points, while people of color and college-educated Whites will each slightly rise.
These glacial shifts in the nature of the American electorate typically leave their mark over decades, rather than from election to election. But this may be a butterfly effect election where even the smallest flutter in the environment could tip the balance between two political coalitions that are utterly antithetical in their vision for America’s future, but also almost exactly equal in size.",22/10/2024
CNN,Supreme Court declines to intervene in Louisiana congressional map dispute | CNN Politics,"The Supreme Court on Thursday declined to intervene in a Louisiana congressional map dispute, potentially delaying the implementation of a new map that could create a district that boosts the power of Black voters in the state.
The brief order will come as a disappointment to critics who say conservative-led states are trying to stall court orders requiring new maps that would impact the balance of power in the House of Representatives next fall.
There were no noted dissents.
Liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote a brief concurrence saying she agreed with the court’s denial but that the decision was temporary and leaves open the possibility that the court could intervene at a later date.
In June 2022, a district court judge ordered that Louisiana’s map – with only one Black-majority district out of six in a state with a 33% Black population – should be redrawn with a second Black-majority district.
After months of litigation, the district court had scheduled a hearing slated to discuss proposals for the new map. But a federal appeals court issued an order canceling that hearing in order to give the state more time to propose new maps.
The NAACP Legal Defense Fund asked the justices to lift that order, but they declined to do so on Thursday.
The case is one of several that has come before the justices in recent months concerning race and congressional representation that could impact which party controls the House after next year’s elections.
The court previously ordered Alabama to redraw its congressional map to account for the state’s 27% Black voting population, which was introduced this month.
Earlier this month, the justices considered whether South Carolina engaged in impermissible racial gerrymandering.
Louisiana process
The Louisiana challenge is currently continuing on two tracks. The district court is seeking to remedy a Voting Rights violation, while a federal appeals court is already considering whether to put that ruling on hold.
In August, the district court judge overseeing the case ordered a hearing for early October in order to select a new congressional map in the state. It came after expansive discovery and a five-day preliminary injunction hearing. While the state chose not to propose new remedial maps, the challengers, including the NAACP-LDF, proposed their own. At the hearing the court was expected to select a new map.
But Republican officials went to a federal appeals court asking for a delay. The panel of judges on the appeals court agreed to delay the hearing, holding that the state hadn’t had enough time to propose new maps.
Lawyers for the civil rights group urged the justices to step in and reverse the order from the panel of judges on the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals.
“While the panel’s principal rationale for issuing the writ was that the Louisiana Legislature should be afforded an opportunity to enact a new map in compliance with the district court’s injunction, the Legislature has already had multiple opportunities to enact a new map and has not done so,” Stuart Naifeh of the NAACP-LDF told the justices in court papers.

CNN,"Who is Rep. Mike Johnson, the new House speaker? | CNN Politics","Rep. Mike Johnson, the new speaker of the House, has been a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump and was a key congressional figure in the failed efforts to overturn the 2020 election.
The Louisiana Republican was first elected to the House in 2016 and serves as vice chairman of the House Republican Conference, as well as GOP deputy whip, an assistant leadership role. An attorney with a focus on constitutional law, Johnson joined a group of House Republicans in voting to sustain the objection to electoral votes on January 6, 2021. During Trump’s first impeachment trial in January 2020, Johnson, along with a group of other GOP lawmakers, served a largely ceremonial role in Trump’s Senate impeachment team.
Johnson also sent an email from a personal email account in 2020 to every House Republican soliciting signatures for an amicus brief in the longshot Texas lawsuit seeking to invalidate electoral college votes from multiple states.
After the election was called in favor of Joe Biden on November 7, 2020, Johnson posted on X, then known as Twitter, “I have just called President Trump to say this: ‘Stay strong and keep fighting, sir! The nation is depending upon your resolve. We must exhaust every available legal remedy to restore Americans’ trust in the fairness of our election system.’”
Although Trump said he wouldn’t endorse anyone in the speaker’s race Wednesday, he leant support to Johnson in a post on Truth Social.
“In 2024, we will have an even bigger, & more important, WIN! My strong SUGGESTION is to go with the leading candidate, Mike Johnson, & GET IT DONE, FAST!” Trump posted.
Johnson serves on the Judiciary Committee and the Armed Services Committee. He is also a former chair of the Republican Study Committee.
After receiving a degree in business administration from Louisiana State University and a Juris Doctorate from the Paul M. Hebert Law Center, Johnson took on roles as a college professor and conservative talk radio host. He began his political career in the Louisiana legislature, where he served from 2015 to 2017, before being elected to Congress in Louisiana’s Fourth District.
Rep. Kevin Hern, an Oklahoma Republican who chairs the influential Republican Study Committee, dropped out of the race for speaker Tuesday evening and backed Johnson.
“I want everyone to know this race has gotten to the point where it’s gotten crazy. This is more about people right now than it should be,” he said. “This should be about America and America’s greatness. For that, I stepped aside and threw all my support behind Mike Johnson. I think he’d make a great speaker.”
Johnson’s win in the secret-ballot race for the House Republican Conference’s nominee for speaker followed Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer’s decision to drop out of the race hours after Republicans chose him to be the nominee following resistance from the right flank of the conference and a rebuke from Trump. Reps. Steve Scalise and Jim Jordan have also dropped out after earlier seeking the speaker’s gavel.
Johnson joined the speakership race in a Saturday post on X, formerly known as Twitter.
“I have been humbled to have so many Members from across our Conference reach out to encourage me to seek the nomination for Speaker. Until yesterday, I had never contacted one person about this, and I have never before aspired to the office,” he said in a posted letter. “However, after much prayer and deliberation, I am stepping forward now.”

CNN,In pictures: Trump running mate JD Vance | CNN Politics,"Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump’s vice presidential pick, formally accepted the nomination in July during his keynote speech at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.
“Tonight is a night of hope — a celebration of what America once was and, with God’s grace, what it will soon be again,” Vance said.
Vance was announced as Trump’s running mate earlier in the week. The 40-year-old is in his first term as a senator from Ohio.
The venture capitalist and author of the best-selling memoir “Hillbilly Elegy” was elected in 2022 after receiving a boost from Trump in a contentious Republican primary.
It was a reversal from just six years earlier. Vance was a key voice in the “Never Trump” movement during the 2016 election and has a well-documented history of opposing Trump publicly. But he earned Trump’s endorsement in 2022 after a concerted yearlong effort to embrace a new image as a leading MAGA proponent.",15/7/2024
CNN,In pictures: A historic race for the White House | CNN Politics,"In a span of just one month, the presidential election changed dramatically in the United States.
President Joe Biden pulled out of the race on July 21, a few weeks after a disastrous debate performance that had Democratic allies wanting him to step aside and “pass the torch” for the good of the party and the country. He threw his support behind Vice President Kamala Harris, who has secured the Democratic nomination and is looking to become the nation’s first-ever female president.
Eight days before Biden dropped out, former President Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The shooting shocked the world and unified many Republicans around their nominee, who lost to Biden four years ago.

CNN,"American Battleground: Christianity and chokeholds, the powerful forces propelling Trump | CNN Politics","Editor’s Note: This is the second of a five-part series that tells the story of the closing months of the 2024 presidential campaign, starting with the June debate between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. Read the first here.
It’s a warm Saturday afternoon, there’s a threat of rain, and the neighbors are being noisy. A hundred protesters are shouting in front of the White House, telling the man who lives there they admire him, they appreciate what he’s done, and now he needs to get out.
“Hey hey, ho ho, thank you, Joe, it’s time to go!”
The success of former President Donald Trump’s campaign is becoming a catastrophe for sitting President Joe Biden. The pressure on him to step out of the race has been growing inversely to his fading performance since the Fourth of July. Every few days another incremental creep in the polls pushes him toward that undetermined edge at which his chances of winning reelection will go from long to lost.
Trump’s coalition is drawing tighter by the day, and White evangelical Christians are a key component. If any group in Trump land embodies his ethos of feeling besieged, it is this one. In the early 1970s, 90% of Americans identified as Christian. By 2020 it was 64%. And the Pew Research Center notes, “If recent trends in religious switching continue, Christians could make up less than half of the U.S. population within a few decades.”
So when Trump delivered their long-awaited destruction of Roe v. Wade, they celebrated. And when he promises to bring them back to political power, they listen. “We have to bring back our religion,” he told the National Religious Broadcasters group earlier this year. “We have to bring back Christianity in this country.”
A shrewd breakdown by Shadi Hamid in The Washington Post notes after Trump nodded to Christian nationalism in 2016 and evangelicals helped him win, membership in evangelical churches grew – fueled by Trump supporters looking for a home. “They became evangelicals because of what it meant politically,” he wrote. “Among White Trump supporters who were not evangelicals in 2016, 16 percent began to identify as evangelical by 2020, suggesting again that politics rather than religion was the driving factor.”
For Biden, the committed Catholic, it would seem a particularly bitter pill, especially now as his team and journalists following him are tracking his fortunes by the day – sometimes by the hour – through an agony of indecision.
“There were so many ups and downs,” CNN’s MJ Lee says. “And I remember thinking to myself, ‘Am I going to sound like I’m over the top if I go on the air saying Democrats are panicked?’”
Biden does not admit any weakness publicly, but his team is sandbagging against a rising river of that panic, much of it from powerful Democrats questioning whether he is still the right person to take on Trump. Trying to recover from the disastrous debate, Biden sits down with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos and mentions he had a cold. “I was sick,” Biden says. “I was feeling terrible.”
With NBC’s Lester Holt, Biden acknowledges he had a “bad, bad night,” but bridles at the notion of stepping aside. “Fourteen million people voted for me to be the nominee in the Democratic Party, OK? I listen to them.”
Allies, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, take to the media circuit. “Joe Biden has confronted and had to come back from tragedy, trials, from tribulations throughout his entire life,” the New York Democrat says, “so the moment that we’re in right now is a comeback moment.”
Sen. Chris Coons, from Biden’s home state of Delaware, is unequivocal on ABC’s “This Week”: “The only Democrat who has ever beaten Donald Trump is Joe Biden. He is our candidate for November.”
It is Biden’s most compelling argument. In the grinding, Covid-haunted 2020 race, he was the wise, old warrior who drew suburban voters, women and young people to his side. His long-standing ties to the working class and organized labor helped nudge him across the finish line to a narrow but clear victory. But now, the tightening vise squeezes Biden into the highly unusual position of sending a letter to congressional Democrats. “I want you to know that despite all the speculation in the press and elsewhere,” he writes, “I am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump.”
He also keeps hammering Trump’s vulnerabilities – the former president’s criminal record, the myriad cases still hovering, the January 6, 2021, riot, the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade – hoping to crack the mogul’s gathering edge in the polls. One potential weakness in particular draws Biden’s attention.
“Project 2025 is the biggest attack on our system of government and our personal freedom that has ever been proposed,” the president bellows during a fired-up rally in Detroit. “It is a project that was built for Trump!”
Launched by the Heritage Foundation, a staunchly conservative DC think tank, Project 2025 is a 900-page plan for action to be set into motion the moment Trump wins reelection. With ideas from hundreds of conservative leaders, it calls for quickly and vastly expanding presidential powers, replacing tens of thousands of government workers with right-wing ideologues, weaponizing the Justice Department to pursue political foes, establishing a nationwide abortion ban, rolling back LGBTQ rights, trashing many environmental regulations, outlawing pornography and much more.
For some conservatives, it is a definitive strategy for draining the swamp. For some Democrats, it is a blueprint for totalitarianism. The explosive document bubbles quietly under the surface of other campaign news for a while, but Biden drags it into the light and, at least on this issue, Trump is on the run.
“I know nothing about Project 2025. I have no idea who is behind it,” the former president says in his ceaseless string of social media posts. “Some of the things they are saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal.”
The problem he faces is in the document’s pedigree. According to a CNN review, at least 140 people who formerly worked in the Trump administration helped craft the plan, including many whom Trump still talks to on a regular basis: Ben Carson, Ken Cuccinelli, Mark Meadows, Stephen Miller, Peter Navarro. As much as Trump insists Project 2025 is foreign to him, the ties look suspicious.
What’s more, CNN’s Phil Mattingly says, the document is linked behind the scenes to an army of loyalists lined up by conservative coordinators to step into those government jobs immediately with Project 2025 as their battle plan. “What they’ve been doing in concert with the policy operation,” Mattingly says, “is they’ve been collecting thousands of names, resumes, mapping out exactly where those people would go. You get a bunch of true believers in there, you’re going to actually implement the stuff.”
Biden is also benefiting from other moves Trump cannot easily disown. Just two days after the assassination attempt against the former president in Pennsylvania, on the sleepy first day of the Republican National Convention in battleground Wisconsin, Trump announces his pick for a running mate.
“After lengthy deliberation and thought, and considering the tremendous talents of many others,” Trump writes on Truth Social, “I have decided that the person best suited to assume the position of Vice President of the United States is Senator J.D. Vance of the Great State of Ohio.”
The words are surprisingly effusive considering Vance once called Trump a “moral disaster,” repeatedly suggested he believed Trump had committed sexual assault and was wondered whether he was “America’s Hitler.” But Vance had backtracked as he prepared to run for Senate, telling Fox News in 2021, “I did say those critical things and I regret them, and I regret being wrong about the guy.” Now, with the winds blowing in his favor, Trump has found in the contrite politician a running mate and an eventual heir to the MAGA throne.
But if Republicans are ready to forgive and forget Vance’s former positions, Democrats are not. “Vance will do what Mike Pence wouldn’t on January 6,” Biden campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon crows, referring to Trump’s former vice president who stood firm against demands he upend the 2020 election process.
A fundraising appeal from the Biden campaign says, “How does a guy who used to say that Donald Trump and his policies were ‘reprehensible,’ become Donald Trump’s running mate? Through years of being a rubber-stamp for Donald Trump’s extreme, MAGA agenda. You might even say he’s the poster child for Project 2025.”
Vance is attacked over his flipflops, his stand against abortion rights, his attitude toward women — and then the cat lady thing happens.
Three years earlier, as he was vying for the GOP Senate nomination in Ohio, the future VP candidate served up a nugget for the Fox News audience. He griped that the country was being run by “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.” Then he added, “You look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC — the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. And how does it make any sense that we’ve turned our country over to people who don’t really have a direct stake in it?”
When the clip resurfaces, the outcry is instantaneous. Women voters, whom the Trump campaign desperately needs, start posting cat memes sharply critical of Vance’s views. Late-night comedians have a field day.
Trump says his running mate is “not against anything. He loves family, it’s very important to him.” Vance tries to spin the old clip — and others in which he refers to “childless sociopaths” — as sarcasm. The whole mess goes viral anyway, and Trump’s VP pick starts looking like a punchline.
Still, CNN’s Alayna Treene says, with so much good news for Trump, the internal concern over his running mate is muted. “The reporting in the stories about them second-guessing whether they were going to pick somebody else and try to replace Vance was not true,” she says, “(but) they definitely thought it was a bad rollout.”
Public scrutiny of Vance, however, does not take pressure off Biden, and there is little time for laughter at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Biden’s attempts to quiet the mutiny in his party are crumbling. Calls for him to step out of the race are ricocheting from pundits to major Democratic donors including movie star George Clooney, who had just headlined an event for Biden.
And the stumbles keep coming. At the NATO summit Biden calls Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky “President Putin.” Zelensky laughs it off, but the seriousness of such errors is intensifying. More than two dozen House Democrats are now asking Biden to end his reelection bid. Former President Barack Obama and House Speaker Emeritus Nancy Pelosi are not telling Biden to abandon his run, but they are voicing concerns. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer shares his firsthand account of the unrest among his caucus when he visits Biden at his beach house in Delaware where the president is recovering from what is reported to be a case of Covid.
At the center of the issue is math. It is an axiom of presidential elections that when a Democrat and a Republican are tied in national polls, the Democrat is often losing. Democratic voters are more heavily clustered in urban areas where they can help their party win a state by huge margins. Republicans, who are more spread out, may win their states by smaller raw numbers, but they collect all the electoral votes in those states anyway. The polling models are adjusted after each election to account for imperfections, so perhaps this time will see the electoral field releveled. But recent history tells a simple story: Biden tallied a 4-percentage point edge in the popular vote against Trump in 2020 and won. Hillary Clinton secured a popular lead of roughly 2 percentage points in 2016 and lost. The polls suggest Biden is trailing her numbers now.
Make no mistake, Biden is a hero for many Democrats; the guy who emerged from what they saw as the chaos of Trump’s first term, pushed the MAGA leader out of the Oval Office, and took the nation back toward something that felt more normal. And Biden, who still traces so much of the turn in his fortunes to that cursed debate, is not surrendering. Not yet.
“What I call Biden’s ‘stubborn Irish’ kicked in,” CNN’s John King says, parroting the president’s defense. “‘It was just one night. It wasn’t as bad as you think. We can recover.’”
Yet each time Biden has a strong speech, a quick joke or a firm stride, he invariably sputters in his next appearance with misstatements, forgotten names and the shuffling gait of advanced age. Some in the party say the lack of consensus on whether Biden should stay or go is turning into a “doom loop” weakening his bid through sheer uncertainty.
“People see and feel the walls closing in,” a senior Democratic player says.
And Trump is steaming toward the biggest night of his convention looking confident, strong and perhaps unbeatable.
Trump’s crowning night in Milwaukee
“Let Trump-a-mania run wild! Let Trump-a-mania rule again!”
Wrestler Hulk Hogan is hyping the crowd at the Republican National Convention. Tearing off a black T-shirt emblazoned with an American flag to reveal a red Trump-Vance shirt beneath, he invokes an oddly apt phrase for fans and foes alike to describe the former president’s approach to government.
“Let Trump-a-mania make America great again!”
For days, the RNC has been pure celebration. Speaker after speaker has competed to raise the highest praise for Trump and the worst damnation of Democrats. The official party platform reads less like the dry policy documents of old, and more like a Trump speech packed with grandiose claims and questionable facts. Few in the room betray the slightest doubt that in the final rounds of the election, Trump will fling Biden from the ring like a rag doll.
For Trump, his dominance over Biden in the past three weeks has clearly sweetened everything about this convocation. Teamsters President Sean O’Brien is head of a labor union that had endorsed Hillary Clinton and Biden in past years, but mindful of the rising tide of Trump supporters in his organization, he takes the stage to salute the former president as “one tough SOB.” Trump’s former primary challengers have been bowing before him and disavowing their own criticism from just months before: South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, and the last holdout, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. She infuriated the Trump faithful earlier in the year by refusing to quit the race and calling him “toxic.” At the convention, her defiance turns to abject surrender as she says, “Donald Trump has my strong endorsement, period.”
Beaming from his seat in Milwaukee’s Fiserv Forum, Trump takes in the spectacle of the Grand Old Party entirely within his thrall. With a large white bandage over the ear injured in the assassination attempt, he looks happy in the moment and deeply pleased that Hogan is sharing it with him.
The perennial wrestling all-star was a key figure when Trump first fell in love with the melodrama and money tied to professional wrestling. Trump brought it all to Atlantic City in the late 1980s, launching a decadeslong relationship with the spectacles of sweat and spandex. Sometimes he took part: strutting around arenas as crowds cheered and booed, luxuriating in the “extra” of it all. He landed a spot in the celebrity wing of the World Wrestling Entertainment Hall of Fame, alongside Mr. T, Ozzy Osbourne and the late comedian, Andy Kaufman. Trump’s affection for the exhibitions is understandable. Pro wrestling is athletic, but not really a sport. It has winners and losers, but they are predetermined. Champions are anointed mainly based on fictional storylines, not the hard facts of their prowess.
As Chauncey DeVega wrote for Salon in 2015, Trump’s first presidential bid was deeply rooted in the “outsize characters and operatic storylines” of pro wrestling. Good versus evil. Ultimate victory or ultimate defeat. Champions and chumps.
As the crowd cheers Trump to the podium for his centerpiece speech on the RNC’s final night, it is easy to see how those black-and-white paradigms resonate against the gray uncertainty of the times. In the eight years since he won the White House, Trump has forced the Republican Party to embrace his view that anything except complete loyalty is betrayal; anything short of absolute domination is failure; and God-fearing Americans will lose everything they love about their county if he is not putting his feet up on the Resolute Desk again next January.
“Four months from now, we will have an incredible victory and we will begin the four greatest years in the history of our country,” he says, launching into an address that defeated candidates seldom get to make. But tonight, he is no loser. In this hall, the adoring crowd believes he won the last election. They believe they were cheated. They know Biden is on the ropes.
Some of those evangelical Christians admit his multiple marriages, alleged sexual escapades, profane language, brutish behavior, lies and crimes are troubling. But they are also spellbound by how he weathers the scandals, financial setbacks and criminal prosecutions. Persecutions, he has said, invoking a word with deep resonance in the Christian faith. As he stands before them, many see not a man, but a leader sent from heaven to rule a nation created by God. This is not the acceptance of a nomination. This is the acclamation of his coming victory.
“Together we will launch a new era of safety, prosperity and freedom for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed,” Trump says. “The discord and division in our society must be healed. … We rise together, or we fall apart. I am running to be president for all America, not half of America.”
For almost 10 minutes he follows the script of unity and reconciliation promised by his campaign in the wake of the assassination attempt, and the folks in the crowd — including dozens wearing their own ear bandages in solidarity — nod along. Then he will ramble off into another hour and 20 minutes of accusations, grievances and falsehoods leaving even stalwarts looking at their watches.
But before he spins into that untethered space, he tells the story no showman could resist. A beautiful afternoon filled with bullets and blood. An audience not running from the mortal threat but standing firm as their leader sank. That leader rising — unbowed.
“I’m not supposed to be here tonight. I’m not supposed to be here,” he says solemnly.
“Yes, you are!” the crowd shouts back again and again.
“Thank you, but I’m not,” Trump says, shaking his head and shifting from wrestler to penitent. “I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of almighty God.”
He and his fans seize the passion. They bask in the pageantry. But even though Trump is casting himself as the martyr, within days it will seem he was playing the prophet.

CNN,"Elon Musk’s super PAC awards $1 million prizes to 2 registered voters, despite DOJ warning | CNN Politics","Elon Musk’s super PAC awarded two $1 million prizes to registered voters in Michigan and Wisconsin on Thursday, after being warned by the Justice Department that the payments might be illegal.
These are the first giveaways by the pro-Donald Trump super PAC after news broke Wednesday that the Justice Department had sent a letter to the group, warning that its “daily” sweepstakes might violate federal election laws against paying for voter registrations.
Musk, the CEO of Tesla and the richest man in the world, launched the sweepstakes on Saturday and his super PAC had named a winner each day – until Wednesday. No winner was announced then, but two winners were announced Thursday on X, the social media platform that Musk owns.
The group has not provided any public explanation for the apparent one-day pause, and a spokesperson for the super PAC declined to comment on Thursday. It’s not clear when Musk received the Justice Department’s letter.
A source familiar with the PAC’s efforts said Friday that “the program never stopped.”
Asked about the lack of an announced winner for Wednesday, the source suggested that it was caused by logistical challenges and not due to the Justice Department’s warning. The super PAC has been referring to the daily winners as “spokespeople” and has framed the $1 million prize money as a salary for their public pro-Trump messaging.
“The spokespeople the PAC selects are real people with real lives and sometimes they are busy. They aren’t going to penalize anyone for not being home when they try to deliver a check,” the person familiar with the super PAC’s efforts said.
Nonpartisan election law experts immediately raised concerns about the sweepstakes after Musk’s initial rollout on Saturday during a pro-Trump campaign event in Pennsylvania.
To win the $1 million prize, people must sign a petition affirming their support for the rights to free speech and bear arms. However, the fine print on the super PAC’s website specifies that only registered voters in seven battleground states are eligible to sign the petition – which experts said is the crux of the potential illegality.
Those controversial requirements have not been changed as of Thursday night and are still on the super PAC’s website.
Federal law makes it a crime for anyone who “pays or offers to pay or accepts payment either for registration to vote or for voting.”
Legal experts previously told CNN that they believe the main problem with Musk’s giveaway was making voter registration a prerequisite to entering the sweepstakes. The problem could be solved if the sweepstakes was offered to any American, regardless of registration status.
In response to a post claiming Musk was “paying to register Republicans,” the tech magnate said winners “can be from any or no political party and you don’t even have to vote.” He has also criticized Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat and former state attorney general, for questioning the legality of the sweepstakes.
Federal filings show Musk has given nearly $119 million – including about $44 million in October – to America PAC, the super PAC he helped form to reelect Trump. He has said he hopes the sweepstakes will boost registration among Trump voters. He recently hit the campaign trail in Pennsylvania, holding events advocating on Trump’s behalf, promoting his petition and spreading conspiracy theories about the 2020 election.
America PAC also received about $3 million in October from members of the influential DeVos family, including $250,000 from former Trump administration Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who quit in the wake of the January 6, 2021, insurrection.
These additional donations in October have enabled Musk’s group to continue spending tens of millions of dollars on canvassing and field operations in key battleground states, helping the Trump campaign keep pace with Kamala Harris’ record-breaking fundraising and massive campaign spending.

CNN,Johnson vows health care overhaul if Republicans win: ‘No Obamacare’ | CNN Politics,"House Speaker Mike Johnson told a group of supporters on Monday night that Republicans will seek “massive reform” to the Affordable Care Act if Donald Trump is reelected — previewing a major piece of the GOP’s legislative plans for next year.
During a campaign swing in Pennsylvania, the GOP speaker vowed that overhauling the 14-year-old health care law would be part of a “very aggressive” first 100-days agenda if Republicans win back control of the White House, according to a video of the event obtained by CNN. Johnson was speaking at a GOP campaign event at Trump’s volunteer headquarters in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.
At one point, an attendee asked Johnson directly: “No Obamacare?” And the speaker, wearing a personalized Trump-Vance jacket, responded: “No Obamacare.”
Johnson’s comments on the landmark 2010 health care law known as Obamacare — which has been a perennial GOP punching bag — come as both parties are making their closing arguments to voters. And it’s particularly notable after the Republican party’s high-profile failure to repeal key parts of the health care law during Trump’s first term in office.
“Health care reform is going to be a big part of the agenda,” Johnson said at the event. It was Johnson’s third time visiting the critical swing seat in the Lehigh Valley in eastern Pennsylvania as he looks to help GOP challenger Ryan Mackenzie unseat Democratic Rep. Susan Wild.
Republican leaders attempted to dismantle Obamacare when they had full control of Washington in 2017, but were stymied by then-Sen. John McCain, who opposed the GOP’s effort because the party didn’t have a substantive plan to replace the law. Since then, Republicans have shifted focus away from health policy, especially as they eye a big tax overhaul early next year.
But Johnson made clear this week that the GOP isn’t giving up on targeting the law.
“The ACA is so deeply ingrained; we need massive reform to make this work. And we got a lot of ideas on how to do that,” Johnson said.
The speaker offered no specifics of the GOP’s legislative plans but noted that a group of Republican physicians in the House, known as the GOP Doctors Caucus, has been drafting potential legislative ideas.
And he said it wouldn’t just be health care getting a massive “free market” overhaul.
“We need this across the board. And Trump’s gonna go big. I mean, he’s only gonna have one more term, right?” Johnson said.
House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, the top House Democrat, also seized on the comments in a campaign trek across Michigan.
“Just yesterday, the top Republican in the House said one of the first things they’ll do is repeal and get rid of the Affordable Care Act as we know it. This is still on their mind,” Jeffries said at a union hall in Lansing, Michigan, according to video obtained by CNN. “We know they’ll do it because I’m convinced that if Roe v. Wade can fall, then anything can fall.”
The once-contentious health care law has not been a major theme of the 2024 campaign. That’s in part because of the popularity of several provisions, including protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
There’s also the political reality: Republicans in Congress have failed to do much more than chip away at the edges of the law, while the Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld the legislation.
Taking a different tact than his previous campaigns, Trump himself has stressed to voters that he wouldn’t eliminate the health care law.
In a video posted to Truth Social in April, Trump said he is “not running to terminate the ACA” as Democrats have alleged.
Instead, he said: “We’re going to make it much better, much stronger.”
Even so, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris warned in a recent health care ad blitz that Americans could risk losing their Obamacare protections if Trump wins.
Johnson’s remarks were first reported by NBC News.",30/10/2024
CNN,"KFile: Kamala Harris pledged to prosecute oil companies over emissions. Now, she’s praising their record US production. | CNN Politics","When Kamala Harris ran for president in 2019, she repeatedly warned oil companies they should be prepared to face hefty fines and even criminal prosecution under a future Harris administration for their role in contributing to climate change.
Now, as the Democratic nominee, Harris is highlighting the country’s record oil and gas production. She rarely talks about climate change, and, despite having been a vigorous supporter of the Green New Deal, her campaign’s website is light on climate policy details.
It’s a stark shift that illustrates the delicate politics of energy — but also how Harris has abandoned a number of progressive positions she held before joining Joe Biden’s ticket in 2020.
As a presidential candidate in 2019, Harris pledged to eliminate the filibuster in order to pass a Green New Deal, with strict deadlines for reducing fossil fuel use. She also signed a pledge to hold all future energy projects accountable to a “climate test” and promised to cancel two pipeline construction projects opposed by environmental activists. She pledged to ban fracking and signed on to niche environmental proposals such as banning plastic straws. And she ran numerous ads on Facebook touting her plans to “take on” the oil lobby and pass a Green New Deal.
“You should be really prepared to look at a serious fine or be charged with a crime,” Harris said in November 2019 when a South Carolina town hall attendee asked whether she would investigate companies such as Chevron and Shell for their role in contributing to climate change.
Harris went on to compare the actions of major oil companies to Big Tobacco, accusing them of knowingly profiting from environmental damage while concealing the harm caused by their products.
“And, not unlike the tobacco companies, after years — ’cause they’d done the research — they knew the harm that their product was causing. They were making so much money that they kept that secret — same thing with these big oil companies. And they need to pay the price,” she said. “So yes is the answer.”
Harris made a similar promise when speaking with the liberal Mother Jones magazine a month earlier, saying, “Let’s get them not only in the pocketbook, but let’s make sure there are severe and serious penalties for their behaviors.”
Harris’s shift on energy and climate began after joining the Biden ticket in August 2020 as the vice presidential pick. That year, she reversed her position on wanting to ban fracking, something she’d staked out in a 2019 CNN town hall.
In August of this year, a few weeks after Biden ended his bid for reelection, the Harris campaign said she no longer supports the Green New Deal. She says that she would not ban fracking and that she no longer wants to ban plastic straws.
In a local interview last month in Pennsylvania, Harris once again was forced to defend her record on wanting to ban fracking when asked about a Republican ad that highlighted her past comments.
“So let me start by saying that that ad as you described it is absolutely a mischaracterization, which I think is intended to make people afraid,” Harris replied. “I will not ban fracking. I did not as vice president.”
Record US oil production
Campaigning in Philadelphia last month, Harris pointed to the Biden administration’s record on increasing domestic oil production, telling voters, “We have had the largest increase in domestic oil production in history because of an approach that recognizes that we cannot over rely on foreign oil.”
The US energy industry is currently producing more oil than any country in history, though energy advocacy groups have said the surge is driven by market forces, not Biden’s policies.
Meanwhile, the Biden administration has imposed regulatory fines on oil companies for environmental violations, including a $241.5 million settlement with Marathon Oil and a $40 million settlement with BP for air pollution charges. The actions target specific issues, such as methane emissions, but were driven more by regulatory enforcement than by the sweeping prosecutions Harris once proposed
At the same time, climate change is not a top priority for many voters. According to Gallup, only 50% of voters view climate change as “extremely” or “very important” to their vote, making it one of the least prioritized issues in this election cycle.
Mia Ehrenberg, a Harris campaign spokesperson, highlighted the Democratic presidential nominee’s support addressing for climate change and while also praising American energy production hitting record levels.
“As president, Kamala Harris will be pragmatic to address the threat of climate change and ensure America does not forfeit the clean energy economy and industries of the future. She is proud to have been the tie-breaking vote on the largest climate action in American history, while seeing American energy production of all kinds hit record levels. As Attorney General of California, she took on polluters to protect our environment and will do the same as president.”
A climate hawk
Archived material from Harris’s 2020 campaign found more than a dozen mentions of prosecuting Big Oil either for pollution or climate change. Citing climate change as an urgent threat, Harris said aggressive action was imminently needed.
In one November 2019 campaign event in Iowa, Harris blamed the fossil fuel industry for the climate crisis, comparing it to Big Tobacco companies’ history of pushing misinformation despite knowing the harm they were causing.
“They had done the studies and they knew of the harm that their product was creating, but they still pushed their product ’cause they were making a ton of money. That’s the same thing with Big Oil. They’ve known for a long time what they’ve been doing that is destroying this God-given planet,” she said.
At times, Harris highlighted her track record as California’s attorney general, pointing to legal actions she claims she took against oil companies.
During a CNN town hall on climate change in 2019, asked whether she would sue ExxonMobil, Harris responded, “I have sued ExxonMobil.”
However, this claim was incorrect. While Harris did initiate an investigation into ExxonMobil for allegedly misleading the public and shareholders about the risks of climate change, she never filed a lawsuit against the company.
As her campaign clarified to CNN, Harris’ legal action during her tenure as California attorney general did result in settlements with other oil companies.
For example, she secured a $14 million settlement from BP and Atlantic Richfield Company and an $11.5 million settlement with Phillips 66 and ConocoPhillips over violations related to underground fuel tanks. But a lawsuit against ExxonMobil was never filed, and her successor did not pursue one after she left office to join the Senate in 2017.",15/10/2024
CNN,"Fact check: Trump, on a lying spree, made at least 40 separate false claims in two Pennsylvania speeches | CNN Politics","Former President Donald Trump is on a lying spree.
As Election Day draws nearer, the Republican presidential nominee has made false claim after false claim on a dizzying variety of subjects. He has both come up with new falsehoods on pressing issues, most notably the federal response to Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton, and repeated old favorites about subjects he has been railing about since his 2016 presidential campaign.
We went through the speeches Trump made at his two Wednesday campaign rallies in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania, one in Scranton and one in Reading. In those two addresses alone, he uttered at least 40 separate false claims.
Here is a fact check.
FEMA and migrants: Trump falsely claimed of the Federal Emergency Management Agency: “They have no money. You know where they gave the money? To illegal immigrants coming in.” He also said, “They spent all their funds; they have no funds to take care…”
This is false in two ways. FEMA does have money for the immediate responses to Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton, though a string of recent disasters has depleted its disaster relief fund; the fund had about $11 billion remaining as of Wednesday. And FEMA did not give all of its disaster relief money to undocumented people; rather, as mandated by Congress, FEMA also administers an entirely separate pool of money for sheltering migrants.
FEMA and employees: Trump added another false claim about FEMA, saying: “They have no workers, they have no nothing.” FEMA has more than 20,000 employees.
Harris and the response: Trump falsely claimed that as desperate people tried to survive Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, Vice President Kamala Harris “didn’t send anything or anyone at all” to help them. There were extensive federal and state rescue and relief efforts in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Helene. It’s true that some residents died and others were stranded for days, but the state was not ignored by Harris or the Biden administration; North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, has repeatedly thanked President Joe Biden for his assistance.
Schools and transgender children: Trump told a slightly vaguer version of his usual false story about schools supposedly obtaining or performing gender-affirming surgeries for transgender children behind their parents’ backs, saying, “Your child go goes to school, and they take your child. It was a ‘he.’ And comes back a ‘she.’ And they do this…And often without parental consent.”
There is no evidence that US schools have sent children into gender-affirming surgeries without their parents knowing or performed gender-affirming surgeries on site; Trump’s own presidential campaign could not provide a single example of any of this ever happening. Even in states where gender-affirming surgery is legal for people under age 18, parental consent is required before a minor can undergo such a procedure.
Trump’s opponents and the election: In Reading, Trump falsely claimed of his election opponents: “They are cheatin’ dogs, I will tell you that.” In Scranton, he falsely claimed, “Their first meeting is: ‘How do we cheat?’” This is all nonsense. There is no basis for the claim that Trump’s opponents are election cheaters.
Harris’ previous presidential campaign: Trump repeated his false claim that, when Harris ran for president in 2020, “she was the first one to drop out, of like 22 people” in the Democratic primary. In fact, 13 other Democratic candidates dropped out of that primary before Harris exited in December 2019 – including the sitting or former governors of Washington, Montana and Colorado; the sitting mayor of New York City; and sitting or former members of the House of Representatives and Senate.
Harris and the press: Trump falsely claimed of Harris: “She doesn’t do any interviews.” Trump is entitled to argue that Harris has not done a sufficient number of interviews as the Democratic presidential nominee, but the assertion she doesn’t do “any” is wrong; Harris has done multiple interviews in recent weeks. Notably, Harris did an interview with the CBS News show “60 Minutes,” which aired Monday, while Trump backed out of his own interview with the show.
Harris-Walz and the Supreme Court: After correctly noting that Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, recently expressed support for getting rid of the Electoral College, Trump falsely claimed, “They want to add… they’re thinking about – first time I heard this number – 25: they want to have 25 Supreme Court justices.” There is no basis for the claim that Harris or Walz is pushing for a 25-justice Supreme Court.
Walz and menstrual products in schools: Trump disparaged Walz as “Tampon Tim,” then said, “You know why they call him that? ’Cause they sell tampons, with special legislation, in boys’ locker rooms.” Trump’s claim is false. The law Walz signed in 2023 requires schools to provide free menstrual products in bathrooms, not the sale of menstrual products in locker rooms – and all 18 public school districts that responded to CNN’s questions about the law say they do not provide the products in boys’ bathrooms. You can read more here.
Wind power: Trump repeated a familiar nonsensical story about how the use of wind power means people “can’t watch” television if “there’s no wind tonight.” Using wind power as part of a mix of power sources does not cause power outages when the wind isn’t blowing, as the federal Department of Energy explained on its website even during the Trump administration.
The Biden administration and electric vehicles: Trump falsely claimed that under a Biden administration electric vehicle mandate, “everybody’s got to have an electric car almost immediately.” There is no Biden administration requirement that consumers must buy an electric car or give up their existing gas-powered cars, “almost immediately” or otherwise. The Biden administration has made a push to get automakers to reduce emissions and adopt electric vehicles, but there is not a mandate for consumers; the tailpipe rules for automakers that were unveiled by the administration earlier this year aim to have electric vehicles make up 35% to 56% new vehicles sold in 2032.
The Paris climate accord and emissions: Trump repeated his false claim that under the Paris climate accord, the US “had to pay a trillion dollars” while some other countries didn’t have to pay.
Trump’s “trillion” figure is a wild exaggeration. Under the Obama administration, the US paid $1 billion of a $3 billion commitment it originally made in 2014. After Trump pulled the country out of the Paris accord, the US paid nothing to the global finance goal. And while Biden pledged $11.4 billion annually from the US, this level of funding hasn’t materialized. That’s because Congress, responsible for appropriating the nation’s budget, has allocated only a fraction of that – roughly $1 billion in 2022.
Harris’ comments on fracking: Trump said, “Listen to Kamala in her own words very recently,” then played two video clips in which Harris said she was in favor of banning fracking. But those clips are from 2019, beyond any reasonable definition of “very recently.” Harris has said during the 2024 campaign that she no longer favors banning fracking.
Venezuela, prisons and migration: Trump falsely claimed, “In Venezuela, many countries, they’re emptying their prisons into our country.” This is false. Trump has never corroborated this claim about Venezuela, let alone “many countries,” and experts have told CNN, PolitiFact and FactCheck.org that they know of no evidence for it.
“We have no evidence that the Venezuelan government is emptying its prisons or mental health institutions to send them outside the country, in other words, to the U.S. or any other country,” Roberto Briceño-León, founder and director of the Venezuelan Observatory of Violence, an independent organization that tracks violence in the country, said in an email to CNN in June, after Trump made similar claims.
Venezuela, criminals and migration: Adding another colorful story about Venezuela, Trump falsely claimed that “they take the criminal gangs from Caracas off the streets and they bus them into the United States and drop them.” This is false. There is no evidence of Venezuelan authorities somehow busing gang members into the US.
The world prison population: Trump repeated his false claim that “the prison population all over the world is down, because they put them in our country.” The recorded global prison population increased from October 2021 to April 2024, from at least about 10.77 million people to at least about 10.99 million people, according to the World Prison Population List compiled by experts in the United Kingdom.
“I do a daily news search to see what’s going on in prisons around the world and have seen absolutely no evidence that any country is emptying its prisons and sending them all to the US,” Helen Fair, co-author of the prison population list and research fellow at the Institute for Crime & Justice Policy Research at Birkbeck, University of London, said in June, when Trump made a similar claim.
The number of migrants: Trump, speaking about migration, falsely claimed that “21 million people – plus – came into our nation” under the Biden-Harris administration. Through August, the country had recorded about 10.3 million nationwide “encounters” with migrants during the Biden-Harris administration, including millions who were rapidly expelled from the country; even adding in so-called “gotaways” who evaded detection, estimated by House Republicans as being roughly 2 million, there’s no way the total is “21 million.”
Harris, migrants and criminals: Trump, criticizing Harris on immigration, again wrongly described a set of statistics that was released in September. He falsely claimed in Scranton, “You saw that last week: 13,099 murderers allowed to come in, through them.” He falsely claimed in Reading that “as we speak she has – and this was just announced last week – 13,099, so over 13,000 illegal alien convicted murderers, roaming free in our country.”
This 13,099 figure includes people who are incarcerated in federal, state and local prisons and jails – and it includes people who entered the country over decades, including during Trump’s administration, not just under Biden and Harris. You can read more here.
Harris’ record as attorney general: Trump falsely claimed that when Harris was attorney general of California, “she said under no circumstances” will people be prosecuted for the crimes of child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon or the rape of an unconscious person. Harris did not say anything like that; Trump was grossly mischaracterizing a debate over the language Harris’ office used to summarize California ballot initiatives.
Trump’s border wall: Trump repeated his false claim that “I built over 500 miles of wall” on the southern border. Official government data shows 458 miles were built under Trump – including both wall built where no barriers had existed before and wall built to replace previous barriers.
Trump’s crowds: Trump falsely claimed of his rallies: “We never have an empty seat.” There have been empty seats at numerous Trump rallies over the years – including hundreds at this very rally in Reading. And at many Trump rallies, some once-filled seats empty out during his speeches when supporters leave.
Trump’s crowd in Butler: Trump falsely claimed there were “over 100,000 people” at the rally he held Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania, at the same site where a gunman had attempted to assassinate him in July. CNN affiliate KDKA in Pittsburgh reported that the Secret Service put the crowd at 24,000 people, while the Trump-supporting sheriff of Blair County, Pennsylvania, James Ott, said in his speech at the rally itself (more than three hours before Trump took the stage) that he was looking out at “21,000-plus people.”
Trump’s response to the assassination attempt: Trump, speaking of his response to the attempted assassination in July, falsely claimed, “I said as I was getting up – before I even got up – I said, ‘How many people were killed?’ Because, you know, it was wall to wall people, and I said, ‘How many people were killed?’ They said, ‘We think three, sir,’ and I said, ‘That’s not good.’”
Trump’s rally microphone picked up what was said by Trump and Secret Service agents while he was on the ground and just after, and he did not ask, before or after he got up, how many people were killed. It’s possible he did so after he was whisked off stage (and, of course, possible he was genuinely misremembering what happened in such a traumatic moment).
Trump and firefighters: Trump falsely claimed, “We got the firefighters endorse us, you probably heard.” But the actual recent national news was that the International Association of Firefighters had decided not to endorse any candidate in the race; while Trump is free to argue that this was a victory for him, given that the union endorsed Biden in 2020, it was not an actual endorsement. And while there were some people in the Scranton crowd holding “Scranton Firefighters for Trump” signs, the Scranton chapter of the union also has not issued an endorsement. The president of the chapter told the Scranton Times-Tribune that none of the people he saw holding the signs were active or retired local firefighters.
Trump and classified documents: Speaking of the criminal case against him over his post-presidency retention of classified documents, Trump repeated his false claim that “I had the Presidential Records Act; I was totally allowed to do it.” The Presidential Records Act says that, the moment a president leaves office, the National Archives and Records Administration gets custody and control of all presidential records from their administration. (Trump’s case was dismissed by a federal judge in July on other grounds, that the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith was unconstitutional; Smith has appealed.)
The New York Times and the Russia investigation: Trump, calling claims about his 2016 campaign’s connections to Russia a “scam,” repeated his false claim that The New York Times “admitted they were wrong” about the coverage that won its journalists a Pulitzer Prize along with journalists from The Washington Post.
“The claim is completely false,” Times spokesperson Charlie Stadtlander said in an email to CNN in 2023, when Trump made a similar claim; Stadtlander noted that “the award was upheld by the Pulitzer Prize Board after an independent review” and said the Times’ reporting “was also substantiated by the Mueller investigation and Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee investigation into the matter.”
The New York Times and the 2016 election: Trump repeated a false claim he made during his presidency, saying of The New York Times’ coverage of the 2016 election: “Remember in 2016 they had to do an editorial apologizing to their readers because they said, ‘He’s going to lose’…and then I won?”
As the Times noted in 2017 in response to such Trump claims, it did not apologize for its 2016 election coverage. It did publish a post-election letter, from then-executive editor Dean Baquet and publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr., that said the election had raised several questions, including this: “Did Donald Trump’s sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters?” But the letter did not include an apology, to Trump or anyone else.
Trump and the defeat of ISIS: Trump repeated his false claim that “we defeated ISIS in four weeks; it was supposed to take four or five years.” The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency.
Military equipment surrendered to the Taliban: Trump repeated his false claim that “we gave $85 billion worth” of US military equipment to the Taliban. Trump’s figure is a massive exaggeration; the Pentagon has estimated that the equipment abandoned to the Taliban by Afghan forces upon their 2021 collapse was worth about $7.1 billion – a chunk of the roughly $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021.
Biden and foreign income: Trump repeated his false claim that “Biden got a lot of money from China.” After years of investigation by House Republicans, there is still no evidence Biden has received any Chinese money.
Chris Wallace and a question about the Biden family: Trump told his familiar false story about how he had asked Biden at a 2020 presidential debate why the wife of a mayor of Moscow had paid Biden $3.5 million – in fact, the money was sent to a firm connected to the president’s son Hunter Biden, not to the president – but moderator Chris Wallace, then of Fox News and now of CNN, had interjected to say, “Well, please don’t ask him that question.” Wallace never did that. As the transcript shows, Wallace interjected during this debate exchange to try to get Trump to allow Biden to answer Trump’s question about the payment, not to stop Trump from asking.
Inflation: Trump repeated his false claim that inflation under Biden and Harris is “the worst inflation in the history of our country.” Trump could fairly say that the US inflation rate hit a 40-year high in June 2022, when it was 9.1%, but that was not close to the all-time record of 23.7%, set in 1920, and the rate has since plummeted; the most recent available inflation rate at the time Trump spoke here was 2.5% in August.
Mortgage rates: Trump falsely claimed that young people can’t buy a house because interest rates are higher than 10%: “It’s not 10%, it’s 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 percent.” This is false. The average rate on a standard 30-year fixed mortgage was 6.12% in the week ending October 3, according to mortgage financing provider Freddie Mac, and 6.32% in the week ending October 10.
Trump’s tax cut: Trump repeated his false claim that “I gave you, as you know, the largest tax cut in the history of our country.” Expert analyses have found that his 2017 tax cut law was not the largest in US history, either in percentage of gross domestic product or in inflation-adjusted dollars.
Tariffs on China: Trump repeated two of his regular false claims about tariffs on imported Chinese products. He falsely claimed that China “paid hundreds of billions of dollars” in these tariffs during his presidency, then falsely claimed that before his presidency, “nobody ever brought in 10 cents, not one other – not 10 cents, you check those records.”
We’ve checked, and the truth is that the US was generating billions per year in revenue from tariffs on China before Trump took office; in fact, the US has had tariffs on Chinese imports since the 1700s. Second, US importers pay these tariffs, not China, and study after study has found that Americans bore the overwhelming majority of the cost of Trump’s tariffs.
The 1890s and tariffs: Touting the supposed benefits of tariffs, Trump falsely claimed that in the 1890s, when the US had very high tariffs, “Our country was the richest it ever was.” The US is far richer today than in the 1890s; per capita gross domestic product is now many times higher than it was then.
The trade deficit with China: Trump repeated his frequent false claim that the US trade deficit with China has averaged “$500 billion” per year. The US has never had a $500 billion trade deficit with China even if you only count trade in goods and ignore the services trade in which the US traditionally runs a surplus with China; the all-time record, about $418 billion, was set under Trump in 2018.
Harris and taxes: Trump played a deceptively edited video showing “The View” co-host Meghan McCain saying to Harris in 2019, “Everything from a 70 to 80% tax rate,” and Harris responding, “I think that’s fantastic.”
This video cuts out key words from the exchange; Harris was not specifically endorsing high tax rates when she made the “fantastic” comment.
Here’s the transcript of the 2019 exchange:
McCain: “Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the new darling of the party. She officially has more Twitter followers than Nancy Pelosi. She was on ‘60 Minutes’ this weekend proudly calling herself a radical. And she’s promoting policies like saying that every single carbon emission in the country, every car, should be eliminated within the next 11 years, everything from a 70 to 80 percent tax rate. Do you agree that she could possibly – and this ideology, of the socialist left – could splinter your party?”
Harris: “No. You know, I think that she is challenging the status quo. I think that’s fantastic. I think that – you know, I used to teach, before, especially before – in the last few years – and the thing that I always loved about teaching was when you teach, it requires you to defend the premise. And it requires you to re-examine the premise. And question, is it still relevant? Is it – does it have impact? Does it have meaning? And I think that she is introducing bold ideas that should be discussed. And I think it’s good for the party, I frankly think it’s good for the country. Let’s look at the bold ideas. And I’m eager that we have those discussions. And when we are able to defend status quo, then do it, and if there are – you know, if there’s not merit to that, then let’s explore new ideas.”
Biden’s documents case: Trump falsely claimed in Reading that, in an investigation into Biden’s handling of classified documents, “Biden was essentially convicted” and in Scranton that “they ruled on him, they said he’s guilty.” Biden was not convicted, “essentially” or not, and was not found guilty; in fact, Biden was not even charged with a crime. The special counsel in the case, Robert Hur, wrote in his public report that “the evidence does not establish Mr. Biden’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,” adding that “several defenses are likely to create reasonable doubt as to such charges.”
A supposed Biden gaffe: Mocking Biden’s gaffes, Trump falsely claimed, “But the worst was when he was in New Hampshire and he said, ‘It’s great to be in Florida.’ That’s palm trees.” This never happened. Biden has certainly made various geographic gaffes, as has Trump, but he never said he was in Florida when he was actually in New Hampshire.",10/10/2024
CNN,The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2024 | CNN Politics,"With just over a month until Election Day, the same competitive races continue to dominate the Senate landscape, but there are a few significant changes to the order of CNN’s ranking of the seats most likely to flip.
And in the final weeks, the degree to which these 10 races – which are mostly playing out in states Donald Trump either won or narrowly lost in 2020 – move in the same direction as the presidential contest will likely determine which party wins control of the Senate.
Republicans – who are virtually a lock to pick up the West Virginia seat and would need to either win the White House or pick up one more seat for the majority – have an incentive to nationalize many of their targeted races. Well-funded Democratic incumbents, for the most part, are touting statewide and local accomplishments and their support for abortion rights.
Two states that are part of the Democratic “blue wall” – and also key White House battlegrounds – move up on this month’s rankings, which are based on reporting, as well as fundraising, polling and advertising data. Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are now in the middle of the pack of flippable seats, along with Michigan, which remains at No. 4.
The oddity of this year’s fight for the Senate is that Democrats have consistently led in the public polling of key races, but it’s Republicans who are poised to gain seats and, potentially, control of the chamber.
That’s a reflection of the Senate map – but also increasingly some post-Labor Day tightening as GOP spending picks up and voters get to know their candidates. Still, no public general election polling that meets CNN standards has shown the Republican nominee ahead in any of the seats that Democrats are defending, save for West Virginia.
And two GOP targets – Arizona and Nevada – are moving down the list because Republicans have not kept the races as competitive as elsewhere. Earlier this year, those two states were Nos. 4 and 5. Now, they’re at 7 and 8.
At the same time, Democrats are trying to expand the map in hopes of mitigating potential losses. As CNN first reported last week, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is making multimillion-dollar TV investments in Texas and Florida. DSCC Chairman Gary Peters has insisted that this is extra spending that won’t take money away from their defensive priorities. Texas remains at No. 9 on CNN’s ranking, while Florida fell off the list earlier this year in favor of the race in deep-blue Maryland.
Nebraska is a new state generating political buzz, but it hasn’t earned a place on the ranking. Still, independent Dan Osborn’s challenge to GOP Sen. Deb Fischer has prompted the National Republican Senatorial Committee to start spending here, and elections analysts have moved the race out of the solid Republican category.
There remain lots of unknowns in Nebraska, but we’ll be watching to see how that race – and the 10 others – develop over the next month.
1. West Virginia
West Virginia is essentially out of reach for Democrats, who had little chance of holding this seat without Sen. Joe Manchin running for reelection. Manchin, now an independent who caucuses with Democrats, is likely to be succeeded by Republican Jim Justice, the state’s two-term governor.
Justice has had his share of negative headlines, but in a state poised to back Trump by a significant margin, it’s hard to see a world in which Republicans don’t pick up this open seat.
2. Montana
Democrat Jon Tester, who’s running for a fourth term in a state Trump has twice carried by double digits, remains the most vulnerable Senate incumbent this year. Republicans feel confident their nominee, Tim Sheehy, has an edge – and both Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales and the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter have shifted their rating of the once toss-up race toward the GOP.
Democrats still see a path to victory for Tester, who has a proven history of defying the partisan lean of his state by communicating both what he’s done for Montanans and painting a contrast with his opponents.
Democrats are trying that playbook against Sheehy, trying to define the wealthy businessman and retired Navy SEAL, who moved to Montana in 2014, as an out-of-state carpetbagger who cannot be trusted. Recently unearthed audio recordings of Sheehy using racist stereotypes to refer to Native Americans has played into that message, with Democrats arguing that he’s alienating a crucial demographic in the state. In a debate earlier this week, Sheehy acknowledged his comments were “insensitive,” saying, “I come from the military as many of our tribal members do. You know, we make insensitive jokes and probably off-color sometimes.”
Tester’s campaign is now leaning into abortion rights on the airwaves – an issue that’s on the ballot in Montana this year. A recent ad features a self-described “life-long” Republican woman arguing that Sheehy “wants to take away personal freedoms.”
But Republicans are invoking transgender issues in an attempt to cast Tester as a liberal who’s been changed by his years in Washington, while Sheehy is trying to tie Tester to Kamala Harris – especially on immigration. Tester – who has not endorsed in the presidential race – tried to meet those attacks during their debate by pointing out that Sheehy would not have supported this year’s bipartisan border bill that Republicans blocked.
3. Ohio
Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is facing his toughest reelection in a state that has twice backed Trump by 8 points. Public polling still shows the three-term senator ahead of GOP nominee Bernie Moreno, although that is expected to tighten as more Republican voters come home to Moreno. Brown was at 47% to Moreno’s 43% in a late September New York Times/Siena College poll among likely Ohio voters – not far outside the margin of error. But the reassuring news for Democrats: Brown was winning 10% of Trump voters.
Democrats have seized on Moreno’s recent comments at a town hall suggesting that some suburban women were single-issue voters when it comes to abortion and questioning why women over 50 would care about the topic. Brown pointed to the remarks as evidence that his opponent is out of step with the 57% of Ohio voters who last year approved a ballot measure protecting reproductive rights. WinSenate, a Democratic outside group, also launched a new ad with a woman talking about the emergency abortion she underwent at 25 for an ectopic pregnancy, saying, “Our lives don’t belong in Bernie Moreno’s hands.”
(Moreno’s campaign said in a statement that he was “clearly making a tongue-in-cheek joke about how Sherrod Brown and members of the leftwing media like to pretend that the only issue that matters to women voters is abortion,” and that Moreno believes women “care just as much about the economy, rising prices, crime and our open southern border as male voters do.”)
The Senate contest in Ohio ranked as the most expensive congressional race on record, as of October 3, with total ad spending from both parties this cycle, including future reservations, exceeding $446 million, according to AdImpact. Brown – who announced raising $30.6 million in the third quarter – has continued to tout his work to pass the PACT Act to help veterans exposed to burn pits, while Moreno tries to nationalize the race by tying Brown to Harris and inflation and linking himself to Trump. The Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC tied to GOP leadership, is attacking Brown over transgender issues to try to cast him as out-of-step with the partisanship of the state.
4. Michigan
Michigan remains the most competitive open seat on this list. Democrat Elissa Slotkin has held a narrow edge in the race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow, but the absence of an incumbent and the competitiveness of the presidential race in the Wolverine State makes it one that could come down to the wire.
Slotkin, a third-term congresswoman, led Republican former Rep. Mike Rogers 47% to 42% among likely voters in a late September New York Times/Siena College poll, with Slotkin drawing 6% of likely voters who also said they would vote for Trump. Slotkin has a strong fundraising record – her campaign announced raising $18 million in the third quarter – but Republicans are pouring more money into this state, with the Senate Leadership Fund recently announcing a $22.5 million investment.
Slotkin has been running ads on abortion – an issue that has helped propel recent Democratic victories in the state. Her spots claim that Rogers’ past support for abortion restrictions makes him untrustworthy on the issue now. “I’m scared that Mike Rogers will continue to take away my rights,” says one woman in a spot who says she needed an abortion to save her life.
Rogers has been responding on air, speaking directly to camera while holding hands with his wife in one new spot, saying he respects Michigan voters’ decision on abortion rights and “won’t do anything to change it” in the Senate.
Rogers, the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, scored the endorsement of the state Farm Bureau’s PAC, which had previously backed Stabenow (the chair of the Senate Agriculture panel). Rogers, whom Democrats have attacked for living in Florida after he left Congress a decade ago, is running spots that tout his Michigan roots and public service. Rogers and Republicans are also attacking Slotkin and the Biden administration over plans to support the building of electric vehicles, using the misleading term “mandate.”
5. Pennsylvania
Democratic Sen. Bob Casey’s race against Republican challenger Dave McCormick moves two spots up on the list in light of heavy GOP outside spending, some tighter polling and the competitiveness of the presidential race in a state that is part of Democrats’ so-called blue wall of must-win states.
September polling from Marist, Quinnipiac University, the New York Times/Siena College/Philadelphia Inquirer, Franklin & Marshall, CBS News/YouGov and Fox News all gave Casey anywhere from a 5- to 9-point lead among likely voters. Polls from CNN and The Washington Post around the same time, however, showed no clear leader.
The two candidates, who met on the debate stage for the first time Thursday night, have been hitting the airwaves with competing messages, as have their allied outside groups. Democrats are going after McCormick on abortion, including one ad that features footage of him referring to himself as “pro-life.” The Senate Leadership Fund, which is adding $28 million to GOP sending here, and the pro-McCormick Keystone Renewal PAC have been attacking Casey over inflation and immigration.
McCormick’s tenure as the CEO of FreeMarkets – a Pittsburgh-based software company – has also been featured in ads on both sides. The Democratic group WinSenate is accusing him of outsourcing jobs and pointing to his management of the company to argue that “Connecticut Dave” – he owns a home in the Nutmeg State – “wants to buy our Senate seat.” McCormick is running ads featuring former FreeMarkets employees praising him and touting the company’s hiring policies.
6. Wisconsin
Wisconsin also moves up two spots on the list amid signs that some Republicans could be drifting home toward their party’s nominee, Eric Hovde, in his challenge to Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin.
The two-term senator maintained a modest edge over Hovde in a Marquette University Law School poll released this week – 51% to 45% among likely voters when third-party candidates are included and 53% to 46% in a head-to-head matchup. Baldwin had a similar 7-point lead in a New York Times/Siena College survey of the two-person race taken around the same time.
While Baldwin has repeatedly outraised Hovde, the Senate Leadership Fund is also pouring funds – $17 million – into the Badger State, and Hovde has plenty of his own money to pay for ads at the lower candidate rate if he chooses. (We’ll be eying his third-quarter fundraising filing for details about how much the Sunwest Bank CEO had loaned his campaign through September.) Ads from Hovde – whose campaign recently underwent a shakeup – have sought to tie Baldwin to Harris, attacking her over border security, fentanyl and transgender rights.
But Baldwin, who’s made an effort to visit the red, rural parts of Wisconsin, has a well-defined brand. She picked up the endorsement of the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation this week – a notable get for a Democrat running statewide. Much of Democratic advertising has played up Hovde’s past controversial comments and sought to cast him as a California carpetbagger – he owns property in Laguna Beach, even though he was born and raised in Wisconsin and his family’s company is a prominent state brand.
7. Arizona
Arizona is a conservative-leaning purple state, where Republicans should ordinarily be able to pick off a Senate seat – especially an open one. But in the race to replace retiring Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, Republican candidate Kari Lake seems to have hit a ceiling.
The 2022 gubernatorial nominee is well known in the state, but not necessarily for the right reasons. She still refuses to accept her loss for governor and, despite tethering herself to Trump, is underperforming his polling numbers.
Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego led Lake by 10 points among likely voters in a Marist poll and 13 points in a Fox News survey, both from mid-September. Lake was polling behind Trump in both surveys by 6 points and 8 points respectively.
Lake and the NRSC are blaming Gallego for inflation and immigration – pointing to his support for what they’re calling the “Kamala Inflation Act.” (Harris cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate for the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.) And while the Senate Leadership Fund hasn’t spent here, a Club for Growth-affiliated group is also airing attacks on the congressman. Gallego, a former member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, was on the airwaves for months introducing himself to voters statewide as a Marine veteran and is touting his support from law enforcement and Republican voters. He announced raising $21.7 million in the third quarter.
8. Nevada
Nevada moves down two spots on the list as Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen appears to be in a stronger position against Republican opponent Sam Brown in a state where Democratic prospects seem to have picked up since Harris ascended to the top of the ticket.
Rosen, who appeared at a Harris rally in Las Vegas earlier this week, led Brown by 10 points in a CNN poll in late August. Like Lake in Arizona, Brown – an Army veteran who first ran for office in Texas and lost the GOP primary for Nevada’s other Senate seat last year – also appears to be running up against a ceiling.
Rosen and Democrats are hitting Brown over his previous stances on abortion – which is on the ballot this year in Nevada. Brown, who says he supports current state law legalizing the procedure up to 24 weeks, has said he’d “close the door” on backing a national abortion ban.
Rosen has had a fundraising edge over her opponent, and this week, national Republicans canceled their remaining independent expenditures in the state in favor of running hybrid ads with Brown, which allows them to benefit from the lower candidate rate in the ultra-pricey Las Vegas media market — a strategy they’ve employed in races across the country to try to compete with well-funded Democratic candidates on the airwaves.
9. Texas
National Democrats’ decision to invest TV resources in Texas was the first major signal the party is putting money where its mouth is on the competitiveness of the Lone Star State this year. Democrats see Republican Sen. Ted Cruz as unpopular and his Democratic challenger, Rep. Colin Allred, as the man to beat him, even in a state that is still comfortably red at the presidential level.
The first hybrid ad between Allred and the DSCC features Kate Cox, the woman who had to leave the state to seek an abortion after her fetus had been diagnosed with a deadly condition, and Amanda Zurawski, who sued the state after she was denied an abortion when experiencing complications. “If you’re experiencing pregnancy complications in Texas, you’re in danger,” Zurawski says in the ad, “and it’s Ted Cruz and the anti-abortion extremists’ fault.”
Allred has also tried to flip the script on Republicans by accusing Cruz of “doing nothing to secure the border.” Cruz, in turn, is attacking Allred over a vote related to the inclusion of transgender athletes in women’s sports. “Boys and girls are different,” is how another ad from the Republican opens. “This election is about keeping Texas Texas,” Cruz has said.
Cruz only beat Democrat Beto O’Rourke by 3 points in 2018. But Democrats hope that Allred, a former NFL player who flipped a Dallas-area House seat the same year, is a more formidable challenger and can turn out more minority voters. (Allred would be the state’s first Black senator if he wins.)
Even Republicans acknowledge that Allred is running a good race, and the NRSC is investing here to help Cruz and the state party. Still, Democrats have not won a statewide election in Texas since 1994, so this remains an uphill battle for Allred.
10. Maryland
The race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin remains in tenth place this month as Angela Alsobrooks fights to keep this seat in party hands. Joe Biden won Maryland by 33 points in 2020, but Republican nominee Larry Hogan – a popular former two-term governor – has a supportive super PAC committing $18 million to tout his independence.
Alsobrooks, the Prince George’s County executive, led Hogan by 11 points in a recent Washington Post/University of Maryland poll. She’s become better known statewide and has made gains among voters who say they care about Democrats maintaining control of the Senate. The argument that Hogan would be another vote for Senate Republicans has been Democrats’ central pitch in deep-blue Maryland, especially on abortion rights and Trump.
Voters in the Post survey were split over whether Hogan would back his party’s leaders in the Senate. He’s winning nearly half of independents, as well as 18% of Democrats. And as he tries to combat Democratic attacks over abortion rights, he’s run ads about being “the ultimate girl dad” and “one of the few Republicans who never caved” to Trump. Hogan rejected the former president’s endorsement earlier this year, but Democrats quickly seized on Trump saying that he’d like to see Hogan win.
Maryland’s Future, the super PAC backing Hogan, is trying to localize the race by attacking Alsobrooks for improperly taking advantage of tax breaks she did not qualify for, as first reported by CNN. (Her senior adviser told CNN that she was unaware of the problem and that her attorneys are working with both the District of Columbia and Prince George’s County to resolve the issue.)

CNN,Analysis: House GOP circus embarrasses senior party leaders as the country and the world wait for a speaker | CNN Politics,"House Republicans on Monday open the next act of their Washington farce, desperately searching for a speaker after ousting the incumbent and rejecting two would-be replacements while still clueless about how to dig out of the crisis.
Congress has seen impeachments, fiscal cliffs, government shutdowns and even an insurrection, but the modern Republican Party is surpassing itself with a debacle that is embarrassing senior party leaders and threatens to damage the House GOP’s hopes of saving and expanding upon its tiny majority in 2024. Far from tackling critical bills needed to fund the government, the leaderless House can’t do the basics, like pass a resolution condemning the Hamas attacks in Israel.
At least nine new candidates have signed up to run for speaker ahead of a new selection process this week after Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan folded his futile bid for the job on Friday, following Majority Leader Steve Scalise the week before. The uprising that began nearly three weeks ago with the toppling of Speaker Kevin McCarthy has now weakened three of the most powerful figures in the House GOP. Perhaps a newcomer can change the calculations of the extremists who opposed McCarthy and Scalise and the more moderate battleground district members who doomed the bulldozing Jordan. But there’s no sign yet any of them can win the 217 votes needed in the full chamber to claim the top job. And more importantly, for whoever eventually wins the gavel, the task of making the House a functional legislative body looks impossible after weeks of GOP infighting that cultivated fresh grievances and demands for vengeance.
“You know, getting 217 is obviously going to be very difficult and is the sort of Rubik’s Cube of the answer to all of this,” Ohio Rep. Mike Turner, chairman of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday.
Twisting colored squares together in the right order seems simple by comparison with attempts to unite a House Republican conference unable to comprehend how clownish it looks. Republicans, determined to fight a civil war over fractures in the conservative movement, seem oblivious to the degenerating global stability all around them or the shutdown threat directly in front of them.
The vacuum is rendering one branch of the US government inoperable, since the Senate can’t pass laws without the other chamber. “We need (a speaker) because the House can’t do anything without a speaker,” Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” Sunday.
The imbroglio is far more serious than the classic congressional drama wherein lawmakers procrastinate and work through their political rituals, and then finally get their acts together. In a practical sense, the absence of a speaker means the House cannot support Israel in accordance with a new aid request from President Joe Biden. A critical and bitter debate over new Ukraine funding – $60 billion of which was requested by Biden last week – cannot begin. Before long, the blocked US lifeline could have grave consequences in Ukraine’s war for survival and boost Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is betting US resolve will wane – not a bad wager considering increasing GOP resistance to defending the democratic government in Kyiv.
But forget reverberations overseas. The House meltdown could soon begin to harm millions of Americans. The GOP has wasted three of the precious weeks that it had to solve a spending showdown that could shut down the government by the middle of November. Even if the party suddenly moves quickly toward choosing a new leader, it’s unlikely much serious work gets done this week either.
What the vacant speakership says about the GOP
The empty speaker’s chair offers an eloquent metaphor for how internal political chaos is compromising American leadership. It’s also threatening the more-than-two-centuries-long experiment in self-government by the people that relies ultimately on no one getting everything they want but accepting incremental change. That’s a concept that the modern GOP seems to reject – as evidenced by the claims of Donald Trump and many of his acolytes in the House that they have the right to rule even though the former president’s bid for a second term was rejected by voters in 2020.
The House Republican conference is showing that it cannot even compromise with itself, let alone construct a unified position before eventually accepting the trade-offs that will be needed in dealing with a Democratic-run Senate and White House. Whichever Republican finally wins the speakership will face similar questions to the ones that eventually cost McCarthy his dream job – namely whether to indulge far-right Republicans with extreme spending cuts that the White House and the Senate will never accept, or to avert a government shutdown by advancing stopgap funding with some Democratic votes. Unless a new speaker can change the dynamic, their tenure risks being even shorter than that of the California Republican.
A new speaker will also be hampered by the reality that chaos and a neutered government are a welcome outcome for many grassroots Republicans in a party transformed by Trump. Many of these lawmakers have perfected the extremism that hedges against primary challenges and the cacophony that pleases the ratings-driven demands of conservative media. Influence in the GOP is no longer bought by years of service that paves the way for committee chairmanships. Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, who led the eight Republicans who voted to can McCarthy, understands the equation well – which is one reason why senior figures bemoaning the need to “govern” aren’t persuading rabble-rousing members. The most obvious representative of this style of stunt politics Republicanism is Trump – who, despite being impeached twice, falsely claiming the 2020 election was stolen and facing four criminal trials, is the runaway front-runner for the GOP’s 2024 presidential nomination.
Embarrassed GOP leaders plea for an end to the mess
Sheer fatigue in the House GOP may create an opening for a candidate who could become a weak speaker with no national name recognition but who could attract the least rancor from across the divided conference. Until then, serious Republican legislators in the House only have the power to express dismay as America’s enemies delight in watching US democracy founder.
“This is probably one of the most embarrassing things I’ve seen because if we don’t have a speaker of the House, we can’t govern. And every day that goes by, we’re essentially shut down as a government,” House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, said on ABC News’ “This Week.”
McCarthy, who supported Jordan but is now backing House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, warned on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that the situation cannot be allowed to endure much longer. “This is embarrassing for the Republican Party. It’s embarrassing for the nation, and we need to look at one another and solve the problem,” the former speaker said.
Emmer is among nine GOP candidates seeking to lock down votes ahead of an expected secret ballot to pick a speaker nominee on Tuesday. The Minnesota Republican’s problem, however, is much like McCarthy’s – he is likely to struggle to win the support of the far-right House Freedom Caucus that reviles the GOP leadership team.
The other members throwing their hat into a ring that does not include a single woman are Reps. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma, who chairs the influential Republican Study Committee; Jack Bergman of Michigan, a mainstream conservative and Marine veteran; Austin Scott of Georgia, who launched a last-minute bid against Jordan last week but quickly dropped out; Byron Donalds of Florida, a rising star Freedom Caucus member and one of the few Black Republicans in Congress; Mike Johnson of Louisiana, the GOP conference vice chairman; Pete Sessions of Texas, a congressional veteran who lost his seat in 2018 and soon returned to represent another one; Dan Meuser, a former Pennsylvania secretary of revenue and member of the Problem Solvers Caucus; and Gary Palmer of Alabama, who chairs the Republican Policy Committee.
Newt Gingrich – a former Republican speaker who is credited with inventing back in the 1990s the highly partisan style of hardball governing preferred by today’s GOP – said party leaders must choose anyone who can get to a House majority regardless of who they are, or the charade could go on for weeks. And he warned with critical government funding and budget bills looming, the GOP doesn’t just have to unite on a new speaker but on a new period of unified governance.
“That 217 has to be committed not just to elect a speaker, but to stick together for the next five or six months. They got big decisions coming down the road,” Gingrich told Fox News. “There’s a very real danger that they’ll elect somebody, and three or four or five weeks from now, you’re going to have a group of people blow up and decide to go back into the same mess.
“So they need to pick somebody to get stability.”
Putting aside the irony of those words coming from the firebrand Georgia Republican, the House GOP has shown over the last three weeks that stability is the last thing the party is able, or even wants, to deliver.",23/10/2023
CNN,Analysis: Why experts are skeptical of Elon Musk’s lofty pro-Trump predictions based on early vote data | CNN Politics,"Tech billionaire Elon Musk has issued a series of political predictions this week, based on strong Republican showings in early voting turnout data, that former President Donald Trump is “trending toward a crushing victory” in Pennsylvania and that Vice President Kamala Harris should even be “worried about losing Virginia.”
Musk’s predictions are based on publicly available analysis of ballots returned so far in pre-election voting, which won’t be tallied until Election Day. But voting experts say that because of gaps in the data, this isn’t a statistically sound method to game out election winners – and could sow confusion and doubts about the eventual results when ballots are counted.
“Based on all credible data, this race is going to be extremely close,” said David Becker, an expert on voting procedures who runs the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation and Research. “No rational person should be surprised if either candidate wins.”
This isn’t a Musk-only phenomenon. Partisans from both sides routinely cite early voting data to promote their candidates and express optimism or try to juice turnout based on supposedly weak numbers. Social media sites are flooded with prognostications from Democratic consultants, right-wing pundits, journalists and self-styled voting experts.
Musk, the richest man in the world, endorsed Trump and has given $118 million to his own pro-Trump super PAC. He also has a long history of promoting false and misleading information about elections.
Some experts worry that Musk’s grandiose predictions of a “crushing” Trump win in Pennsylvania – where polls are tight – and other states could prime his legions of diehard followers to question the legitimacy of the results if Trump loses. Other pro-Trump figures and outlets have pushed similar narratives about the inevitability of a Trump victory.
Like many political observers, including at CNN, Musk has noticed the better-than-2020 GOP performance in early voting in North Carolina, Nevada and other key states. But Musk has gone farther into a mathematically unsupported space to claim the data is paving the way for Trump blowouts in swing states and might even put blue states like New Jersey and Virginia in play.
Early voting data only describes people who vote ahead of Election Day – it doesn’t provide insights into the voting intentions of tens of millions of voters who will go to the polls next Tuesday itself.
It also doesn’t tell us who people are voting for. At best, it can provide snippets of information like party registration, age and race.
“Early voting totals don’t tell us anything about who’s winning, and people should be extremely wary of claims that one side, or the other, is pulling away with this race,” Becker said. “We don’t know if these are people who would’ve voted anyway on Election Day or if they are new voters. We don’t know if this is a net plus for either side.”
A spokesman for Musk’s super PAC declined to comment.
While Musk posted his predictions to his X platform, Trump was stoking baseless fears of widespread voter fraud in Pennsylvania. Trump seized on a real incident of potential voter registration fraud to inaccurately claim that thousands of “fake ballots” were being cast.
Comparisons to 2020
Musk’s specific prediction that Trump will win Pennsylvania in a landslide is based on a comparison of current 2024 vote-by-mail turnout to turnout levels from this point in the 2020 race. Musk’s post on X has been viewed more than 54 million times as of Wednesday morning.
It’s true that turnout among registered Republicans isn’t as far behind the Democrats this year as it was in 2020, but experts say it’s irresponsible to make lofty predictions of victory based on this single datapoint.
Registered Republicans make up about 32% of the early vote in Pennsylvania so far, up from 21% at this point in 2020. Democrats made up 68% of the preelection vote at this point in 2020; so far this year they account for 58%. This data comes from Catalist, a company that provides data, analytics and other services to Democrats, academics and nonprofit advocacy groups.
The improved GOP position in early voting that Musk highlighted is happening in other states as well. In North Carolina, Republicans account for about 34% of the preelection vote, nearly 4 percentage points higher than at this point in 2020. And in Arizona, Republicans make up 42% of the vote, up more than 5 percentage points from this time in 2020.
“This is the braggadocio of a partisan who is claiming a lot of credit, but people need to take it with a really big grain of salt,” veteran GOP election lawyer Ben Ginsberg said. “He’s a partisan wishing for a result at a stage in the process where you just can’t know.”
Ginsberg, a CNN contributor, said the “irresponsibility on both sides of the aisle” around early voting turnout data certainly “feeds” potential post-election distrust in the results.
Trump attacked mail-in voting almost every day during the 2020 campaign, which was conducted amid the Covid-19 pandemic. This time around, Trump and the Republican National Committee have tailed their messaging to encourage supporters to vote-by-mail, even as Trump continues to question the integrity of the overall system.
A large chunk of voters also aren’t affiliated with either party, and it’s unknown how they’ll break for Trump and Harris. Not all registered Republicans will vote for Trump, and not all registered Democrats will back Harris.
“Musk either doesn’t understand this, which is good reason to ignore his commentary,” Isaac Saul, who writes a nonpartisan political newsletter, tweeted on Tuesday. “Or he does understand and he is ignoring it.”",30/10/2024
CNN,A survey asked what Americans were hearing most about the candidates. One of the most common words for Trump was ‘liar’ | CNN Politics,"With time ticking down until Election Day, public impressions of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have not fully coalesced around any singular enduring news story or political issue, according to The Breakthrough, a CNN polling project that tracks what average Americans are actually hearing, reading and seeing about the presidential nominees.
For the second week in a row, the lion’s share of attention from Americans was on each nominee’s activity on the campaign trail, found the poll, conducted by SSRS and Verasight on behalf of a research team from CNN, Georgetown University and the University of Michigan and fielded from October 18-21.
The top activity mentioned for the vice president was sitting for an interview on Fox News, while the former president drew the most attention – though not by an overwhelming margin – for swaying to music onstage for more than 30 minutes at a Pennsylvania rally and for speaking at the Al Smith dinner, a Catholic fundraiser in New York. By contrast, in 2020, the coronavirus pandemic overshadowed any other topic in the final month of the campaign.
The most persistent theme of the 2024 election may be mentions of words such as “lie” and “liar” in conjunction with Trump, who has made numerous false claims over the course of the presidential campaign, including onstage during his debate with Harris and in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. Those references have ranked among the top two words mentioned about him for four consecutive weeks. The relative consistency around Trump is a departure from 2016, when the news recalled about him ricocheted among a series of different topics, while the single word “emails” dominated much of the conversation about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton throughout the majority of the election season.
“Donald Trump lies about almost everything,” one respondent wrote in the latest survey.
While “campaigning” was a prominent topic for both Harris and Trump, what that means breaks down differently for each candidate. In the most recent week of data, nearly half of the mentions of campaigning for Harris related to interviews she’d given, compared with about 13% for Trump, who saw more attention on his rallies.
The economy has also emerged as one of the five most frequently mentioned topics for Harris in every week dating to mid-August, although the sentiment of those mentions – whether the terms and tones used are positive or negative – varies across party lines.
“I’ve heard about her wanting to better the economy,” one Democrat wrote in the latest poll, while a Republican wrote that Harris was taking “credit for the economy being strong when, in fact, the economy was strong when Biden/Harris took over and then tanked the economy.”
The poll also finds the level of public attention to the campaign remaining somewhat below previous peaks. While about 7 in 10 Americans said they’d heard at least something about each of the main candidates, respectively, that compares with roughly 8 in 10 or higher in mid-October 2020 and 2016 – and similarly high numbers in July of this year, during the weeks when Trump was targeted by the first of two assassination attempts and President Joe Biden withdrew from the race.
Overall, the sentiment behind the words Americans used in describing what they’d heard around each candidate remained more negative than positive – although the sentiment used in describing the news surrounding both Harris and Trump remains considerably less negative than the tone used to describe the final weeks of Biden’s campaign.

CNN,Analysis: People are calling Trump a fascist. What does that mean? | CNN Politics,"A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.
Fascism is a dirty word in US politics, so when former President Donald Trump’s former chief of staff, retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, says Trump fits the definition of “fascist,” it’s news.
It places Trump’s name in the same ideological space as the most infamous fascists, Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. Trump has rejected the idea and called Kelly a “degenerate.”
Asked at a CNN town hall in the battleground state of Pennsylvania if she agrees with Kelly that Trump is a fascist, the Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, did not hesitate.
“Yes, I do. Yes, I do,” she said.
Kelly pointed The New York Times to a definition of fascism: “It’s a far-right authoritarian, ultranationalist political ideology and movement characterized by a dictatorial leader, centralized autocracy, militarism, forcible suppression of opposition, belief in a natural social hierarchy.”
“So certainly, in my experience, those are the kinds of things that he thinks would work better in terms of running America,” Kelly said.
Kelly added that Trump is in the “far-right area,” and “admires people who are dictators,” which in Kelly’s view places Trump in “the general definition of fascist.”
Using the military to quiet dissent
There are topical arguments to back Kelly up. Trump’s suggestion he could use the military against an “enemy from within,” which he said includes Democrats like Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff from California, certainly sounds fascist. His Republican defenders argue it’s just hyperbole.
Trump wanted to use the military to disrupt domestic protests when he was in office, something that his top general at the time, then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Mark Milley, rejected, according to reporting in 2021. Milley also privately compared Trump’s election denialism to Hitler’s “big lie.”
Even if he doesn’t intend to use the military on Democrats, he has a history of trying to use the military to put down protests in the US, making the threat to quiet dissent.
Sidelining dissent
Trump recently said he would fire special counsel Jack Smith “within two seconds” if he wins the election, which seems obvious since Smith has indicted Trump in cases involving election interference and mishandling classified documents.
The election interference case is delayed until after the election, and a different judge dismissed the classified documents case, although Smith has appealed.
Trump has a history of firing officials who question him. He fired James Comey, the FBI director, when he was president. He fired his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, after never forgiving Sessions for appointing a special counsel to investigate potential collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.
The resulting report from special counsel Robert Mueller has been referred to as the “Russia hoax” so many times by Trump and his allies that most Americans probably don’t remember that Mueller pointedly did not exonerate Trump of obstruction of justice in the report. Mueller identified multiple contacts between Trump’s campaign and Russians in 2016, a time when Russians were actively trying to help Trump’s campaign. Mueller concluded the contacts did not rise to the level of conspiracy.
Trump’s second attorney general, Bill Barr, slow-walked release of Mueller’s report to dilute its impact. Barr would later leave Trump’s administration after the 2020 election after refusing to support Trump’s unsupported election interference conspiracy theories.
Democrats wonder who would be left to temper Trump’s urges if he’s reelected.
Purging the government
If he wins the election, Trump has promised to do more to go to war with what he perceives as a “deep state” of bureaucrats at the Justice Department, the FBI and the Pentagon.
He has also suggested he would use the justice system to prosecute election officials.
All of this points in favor of at least a thematic alignment with some elements of fascism, built around a strong leader and where dissent in the government is dismissed. But there can also be more to fascism, such as complete control of the German economy and society. Trump has not suggested anything like that.
While Harris is just now coming around to labeling Trump a fascist, he’s been calling her Marxist for the entire presidential campaign, referring to her as “Comrade Kamala.” That’s clearly not true since Harris supports private ownership.
Trump has used the term too
In June, Trump said the US was a “fascist state” as he pushed the unfounded conspiracy theory that President Joe Biden was behind his prosecution in New York for falsifying business records related to hush money payments paid on Trump’s behalf to a porn star in 2016.
I delved into the definition of fascism and how it applied to Trump back in June, when he was using the term.
There are experts who view Trump as fascist. Robert Paxton, a professor emeritus at Columbia University who has written widely on fascism in Europe, had rejected the label for Trump until January 6, 2021, when the historian argued that the image of Trump supporters storming the US Capitol “removes my objection to the fascist label.”
Trump has also repeatedly used language that can be tied back to Nazis, such as when he said immigrants are “poisoning the blood” of the country.
‘I don’t care what you call this’
When CNN’s Wolf Blitzer asked Ohio Sen. JD Vance in May about Trump’s claim the US is a “fascist state,” Vance would not reject the idea, suggesting at least a tolerance for the term.
“I don’t care what you call this, but this is not the America that I know and love,” Vance, who was not yet Trump’s running mate, said in a tense exchange.
Concepts don’t have timeless essences
Back in June, I also talked to Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins, an assistant professor at Wesleyan University and editor of the book, “Did It Happen Here? Perspectives on Fascism and America,” which includes the writing of Paxton, among many others.
“That model of historical comparison where we look to what happened to Germany in the 1930s and then use it as kind of a navigational device or a map for understanding what’s happened today is quite common,” he said, although there are arguments it is a flawed comparison.
“Concepts don’t have timeless essences that we can just map on to any phenomena, but they change given political context, given power structures in society,” he said.
Today, he said, the term “fascism” is used “to mobilize people in order to get over their divides, to defeat an enemy that’s far greater than their own long-standing disputes.”
Steinmetz-Jenkins argued there is a long history, going back to Franklin D. Roosevelt, of Americans on both sides of the political aisle trying to label their opponents as “fascist,” and there are also examples of American lawmakers threatening their opponents with investigation.
There are arguments in favor of the fascism comparison, but also arguments against it – particularly since there are echoes of Trump’s rise in populist and White nationalist movements closer to home in American history.
I went back to Steinmetz-Jenkins to ask if the comparisons have changed in the intervening months, and he noted that the fascism debate had simmered over the summer, with Harris replacing Biden – and he noted that for most of Harris’ campaign, a message of the politics of joy had replaced fear of fascism.
Now, as Democrats get anxious about losing to Trump, the threat of fascism has returned to the fore.
“What is needed is a plan to inspire people to vote for the Democrats, not fear tactics that might lead to a sense of fatalism that the world is being engulfed by fascism,” he said.
Enough American voters have heard the term “fascism” in the same breath as Trump that if he wins in November, it will be clear that they are at least willing to tolerate it or don’t believe he will carry through with what he says.",24/10/2024
CNN,Promises Kamala Harris has made so far in her campaign,"Promises Kamala Harris has made so far in her campaign
Editor's Note: CNN's What Matters newsletter connects the dots of the ever-changing political landscape. Click here to sign up for free.
With her presidential campaign in full swing, Vice President Kamala Harris is revealing how she will address the key issues facing the nation.
In policy proposals, speeches and rallies, she has voiced support for continuing many of President Joe Biden’s measures, such as providing tax credits to middle-class and lower-income families, lowering drug costs and eliminating so-called junk fees. She describes her vision as “an opportunity economy” that focuses on strengthening the middle class and punishes bad actors who try to unfairly raise costs.
But Harris has made it clear that she has her own views on some key matters, particularly Israel’s treatment of Gazans in its war with Hamas. Generally, her agenda contains an amped-up series of progressive proposals, though her campaign has confirmed that she’s moved away from several of her more notable left-leaning stances from her 2020 presidential run, such as her interest in a single-payer health insurance system and a ban on fracking.
Harris is also expected to put her own stamp and style on matters ranging from abortion to the economy to immigration, as she aims to walk a fine line of taking credit for the administration’s accomplishments while not being jointly blamed by voters for its shortcomings.
She is now pitching an economic agenda focused on using government money and regulations to address higher costs, though most of her plan would require congressional approval. The measures would also prove pricey, and the Harris campaign has not provided many details about the proposals and how she would pay for them.
Like Biden, she intends to contrast her vision for America with that of former President Donald Trump. (See Trump’s campaign promises here.)
“In this moment, I believe we face a choice between two different visions for our nation: one focused on the future, the other focused on the past,” she told members of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta at an event in Indianapolis in late July. “And with your support, I am fighting for our nation’s future.”
Here’s what we know about Harris’ views:
Economy
High prices are a top concern for many Americans who are struggling to afford the cost of living after a spell of steep inflation. Many voters give Biden poor marks for his handling of the economy, and Harris may also face their wrath.
Harris has talked about the key pillars of her economic vision – particularly strengthening the middle class – on the campaign trail and in an 82-page policy paper that the campaign released in late September. However, she has not provided many details on her proposals.
As part of her economic agenda, Harris wants to counter the increase in food costs, which she argues stems in part from some big grocery chains that are keeping prices high even though their production costs have leveled off.
To do so, she is calling for the first-ever federal ban on price gouging on food and groceries. The policy paper specified that the ban would be aimed at big corporations unfairly exploiting consumers during crises and emergencies to increase their profits and compared Harris’ idea to similar price-gouging bans already in place in 37 states, including Texas and Florida.
Harris would also secure new authority for the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general to investigate and penalize companies that unfairly exploit consumers in the quest for excessive profits on food and groceries.
Also, she has proposed increasing a tax deduction for new small businesses to $50,000, up from $5,000. Plus, she would take several steps to cut the red tape that small businesses face, including creating a standard deduction for them and making it easier for them to operate across state lines.
Harris is also looking to help Black and Latino entrepreneurs and others by providing 1 million fully forgivable loans of up to $20,000 to start or grow a business.
The vice president has also pledged to strengthen the manufacturing sector by creating a new “America Forward” tax credit. It would be targeted at investment and job creation in key strategic industries, according to the policy paper, which mentions steel and iron, biotechnology, artificial intelligence, semiconductors, aerospace, autos and farming. Her investments in American innovation would cost about $100 billion and would be paid for by international tax reform, which Congress must approve.
“We will prioritize investments for strengthening factory towns, retooling existing factories, hiring locally and working with unions because no one that grows up in America's greatest industrial or agricultural centers should be abandoned,” she said during a late September speech in Pittsburgh.
Plus, Harris said she’d double the number of registered apprenticeships by the end of her first term, as well as increase skills-based hiring and eliminate degree requirements.
Her platform also calls for boosting investment in community development financial institutions, or CDFIs, which are dedicated to serving low-income people and communities that are missed by traditional lenders.
Harris has also committed to raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, in keeping with a long-standing Democratic goal. The federal minimum wage has been $7.25 since 2009.
In her campaign speeches, Harris has echoed many of the same economic themes as Biden, saying she wants to give Americans more opportunities to get ahead.
She promised at a late July rally to continue the Biden administration’s drive to eliminate so-called junk fees and to fully disclose all charges, such as for events, lodging and car rentals.
On day one, I will take on price gouging and bring down costs. We will ban more of those hidden fees and surprise late charges that banks and other companies use to pad their profits.”
Taxes
Harris has proposed using tax credits to provide relief to middle class and lower-income Americans. Her plan revives or extends temporary measures that Biden and congressional Democrats enacted in major packages when the party controlled Congress during the first two years of Biden’s term.
Harris’ proposal would restore the American Rescue Plan’s popular expansion of the child tax credit to as much as $3,600, up from $2,000, and call for it to be made permanent. The enhancement was only in effect in 2021.
Her plan would restore the American Rescue Plan’s enhancement of the earned income tax credit, known as the EITC, which increased the maximum credit for workers without dependent children to roughly $1,500. That previous boost was only for 2021.
Plus, the proposal would also add a new child tax credit of up to $6,000 for middle-class and lower-income families with children in their first year of life.
There's one more way I will help families deal with rising costs, and that's by letting you keep more of your hard-earned money.”
And Harris has also promised to end federal income taxes on tips, sparking Trump’s ire that she is copying his campaign promise. Tips would remain subject to payroll taxes under Harris’ plan.
To help pay for these and other measures on her wish list, Harris would raise the corporate tax rate to 28%, up from the current 21% rate set by Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Doing so would raise about $1 trillion over the next decade, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
The vice president also wants to raise the long-term capital gains rate to 28%, up from the current 20% rate, for those earning more than $1 million. That’s a break from Biden’s proposal to increase the capital gains rate to the top rate he wants to levy on ordinary income – 39.6%. High earners are also subject to an additional 3.8% net investment income tax, which Biden wants to lift to 5%.
Harris also said she supports Biden’s Billionaire Minimum Income Tax proposal, which seeks to ensure that those worth more than $100 million pay a federal income tax rate of at least 25% on their income – including unrealized gains on assets, which are not currently taxed.
Plus, she is in favor of quadrupling the tax on stock buybacks to 4%, as the president proposed in his fiscal year 2025 budget.
Housing
Harris has rolled out a three-section plan aimed at addressing the nation’s housing shortage. Parts of it build on proposals that Biden has already unveiled.
The vice president’s plan promises to provide up to $25,000 in down-payment support for first-time homebuyers. The down-payment support would apply to working families who have paid rent on time for two years, with more generous support for first-time homebuyers. The plan would also provide a $10,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers, something Biden proposed earlier this year.
The plan would allow for more than 1 million first-time buyers per year, including first-generation homebuyers, to access the funds, according to her campaign.
Harris is also calling for the building of 3 million new housing units. To spur construction, she would provide a first-ever tax incentive for builders who build starter homes sold to first-time buyers. She also would expand an existing tax incentive for building affordable rental housing.
By the end of my first term, we will end America's housing shortage by building 3 million new homes and rentals that are affordable for the middle class.”
The plan also highlights two main proposals that aim to lower rent costs in the US. The first would block landlords from using algorithm-driven price-setting tools to set rents. The second would discourage wealthy investors from buying up properties and marking up rents in bulk by removing tax benefits for investors who buy large numbers of single-family rental homes.
Health care
Harris’ health care platform builds on the Biden administration’s efforts to reduce prescription drug costs.
She is calling to expand the current $35 monthly cap on out-of-pocket costs for insulin and the upcoming $2,000 annual limit on out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs generally to all Americans, not just Medicare enrollees. These caps were put in place for those on Medicare in the Inflation Reduction Act. The $2,000 limit on Medicare Part D drug costs takes effect in January.
(The three major insulin manufacturers in the US offer price caps or savings programs that lower the cost of insulin to $35 for many patients – a move Biden pushed for in his State of the Union address last year.)
Harris’ plan would also accelerate the speed of Medicare’s drug price negotiations so that the costs of more medications come down faster. The Biden administration just announced the results of the first-ever round of negotiations, which is expected to result in $6 billion in savings for Medicare and a $1.5 billion reduction in out-of-pocket costs for seniors when the lower prices take effect in 2026.
The vice president would use some of that savings to establish a Medicare at Home program, which would provide home health aides to enrollees who cannot independently handle activities of daily living, such as bathing and eating. In addition, Harris is proposing that Medicare cover hearing aids and exams, eye exams, and new glasses and lenses.
Also, as part of her plan to help rural communities, Harris would recruit 10,000 health care professionals by expanding scholarships, loan forgiveness and other programs for doctors and nurses who will work in rural and tribal areas. In addition, she would launch a new grant program to train and fund community health workers in rural areas and expand grants to community and rural health centers.
Harris also supports expanding rural telehealth services by permanently extending Medicare coverage of telehealth benefits and by doubling federal funding for telehealth equipment and technology.
Plus, she is calling to reduce the number of “ambulance deserts” by increasing funding and technical support for emergency medical technicians and first responders, as well as providing more resources for ambulances, lifesaving equipment and first-responder stations. And she would give grants to volunteer ambulance programs.
Consumer debt
Hefty debt loads, which weigh on people’s finances and hurt their ability to buy homes, get car loans or start small businesses, are also an area of interest to Harris.
In her economic plan, she pledged to work with states to cancel medical debt for millions of Americans and help them avoid falling behind on health care bills in the future. States and municipalities have used American Rescue Plan funds to cancel $7 billion of medical debt for up to 3 million Americans, according to the campaign.
Harris has been a leader in the White House’s efforts to ban medical debt from credit reports, noting that those with medical debt are no less likely to repay a loan than those who don’t have unpaid medical bills.
Also, as vice president, she has promoted the Biden administration’s initiatives on student debt, which have so far forgiven more than $168 billion for nearly 4.8 million borrowers. In mid-July, Harris said in a post on X that “nearly 950,000 public servants have benefitted” from student debt forgiveness, compared with only 7,000 when Biden was inaugurated.
A potential Harris administration could keep that momentum going – though some of Biden’s efforts have gotten tangled up in litigation, such as a program aimed at cutting monthly student loan payments for roughly 3 million borrowers enrolled in a repayment plan the administration implemented last year.
Abortion
Harris took on the lead role of championing abortion rights for the administration after Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022. This past January, she started a “reproductive freedoms tour” to multiple states, including a stop in Minnesota thought to be the first by a sitting US president or vice president at an abortion clinic.
On abortion access, Harris embraced more progressive policies than Biden in the 2020 campaign, as a candidate criticizing his previous support for the Hyde Amendment, a measure that blocks federal funds from being used for most abortions.
Policy experts suggested that although Harris’ current policies on abortion and reproductive rights may not differ significantly from Biden’s, as a result of her national tour and her own focus on maternal health, she may be a stronger messenger.
Climate
Harris has been a champion on climate and environmental justice for decades. As California’s attorney general, Harris sued big oil companies like BP and ConocoPhillips, and investigated Exxon Mobil for its role in climate change disinformation. While in the Senate, she sponsored the Green New Deal resolution.
During her 2020 campaign, she enthusiastically supported a ban on fracking — but a Harris campaign official said in late July that she no longer supports such a ban.
Fracking is the process of using liquid to free natural gas from rock formations – and the primary mode for extracting gas for energy in battleground Pennsylvania. During a September 2019 climate crisis town hall hosted by CNN, she said she would start “with what we can do on Day 1 around public lands.” She walked that back later when she became Biden’s running mate.
Biden has been the most pro-climate president in history, and climate advocates find Harris to be an exciting candidate in her own right. Democrats and climate activists are planning to campaign on the stark contrasts between Harris and Trump, who vowed to push America decisively back to fossil fuels, promising to unwind Biden’s climate and clean energy legacy and pull America out of its global climate commitments.
If elected, one of the biggest climate goals Harris would have to craft early in her administration is how much the US would reduce its climate pollution by 2035 – a requirement of the Paris climate agreement.
Immigration
Harris has repeatedly tried to counter Trump’s attacks on her immigration record.
Her campaign released a video in late July citing Harris’ support for increasing the number of Border Patrol agents, and she has often called out Trump’s successful push to scuttle a bipartisan immigration deal that included some of the toughest border security measures in recent memory.
The vice president has changed her position on border control since her 2020 campaign, when she suggested that Democrats needed to “critically examine” the role of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, after being asked whether she sided with those in the party arguing to abolish the department.
In June of this year, the White House announced a crackdown on asylum claims meant to continue reducing crossings at the US-Mexico border. Harris has said that she would maintain Biden’s crackdown on asylum claims – and potentially go further.
Trump’s attacks stem from Biden having tasked Harris with overseeing diplomatic efforts in Central America in March 2021. While Harris focused on long-term fixes, the Department of Homeland Security remained responsible for overseeing border security.
She has only occasionally talked about her efforts as the situation along the US-Mexico border became a political vulnerability for Biden. But she put her own stamp on the administration’s efforts, engaging the private sector.
Harris pulled together the Partnership for Central America, which has acted as a liaison between companies and the US government. Her team and the partnership are closely coordinating on initiatives that have led to job creation in the region. Harris has also engaged directly with foreign leaders in the region.
Experts credit Harris’ ability to secure private-sector investments as her most visible action in the region to date but have cautioned about the long-term durability of those investments.
Israel-Hamas
The Israel-Hamas war is the most fraught foreign policy issue facing the country and has spurred a multitude of protests around the US since it began in October.
After meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in late July, Harris gave a forceful and notable speech about the situation in Gaza. She echoed Biden’s repeated comments about the “ironclad support” and “unwavering commitment” to Israel, as well as the need to get the Israeli hostages back from Hamas captivity. The country has a right to defend itself, she said, while noting, “how it does so, matters.”
However, the empathy she expressed regarding the Palestinian plight and suffering was far more forceful than what Biden has said on the matter in recent months. Harris mentioned twice the “serious concern” she expressed to Netanyahu about the civilian deaths in Gaza, the humanitarian situation and destruction she called “catastrophic” and “devastating.”
She went on to describe “the images of dead children and desperate hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time,” and said, “I will not be silent.”
But when describing the ceasefire deal in the works, she didn’t highlight the hostage for prisoner exchange or aid to be let into Gaza. Instead, she singled out the fact that the deal stipulates the withdrawal by the Israeli military from populated areas in the first phase before withdrawing “entirely” from Gaza before “a permanent end to the hostilities.”
Harris didn’t preside over Netanyahu’s speech to Congress in late July, instead choosing to stick with a prescheduled trip to a sorority event in Indiana.
The vice president continued calling out the plight of the people in Gaza, as well as the need to free the Israeli hostages and secure a ceasefire deal, in her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in August.
President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.”
Ukraine
Harris is committed to supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression, having met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at least six times and announcing last month $1.5 billion for energy assistance, humanitarian needs and other aid for the war-torn country.
At the Munich Security Conference earlier this year, Harris said: “I will make clear President Joe Biden and I stand with Ukraine. In partnership with supportive, bipartisan majorities in both houses of the United States Congress, we will work to secure critical weapons and resources that Ukraine so badly needs. And let me be clear: The failure to do so would be a gift to Vladimir Putin.”
More broadly, NATO is central to our approach to global security. For President Biden and me, our sacred commitment to NATO remains ironclad. And I do believe, as I have said before, NATO is the greatest military alliance the world has ever known.”
Police funding
The Harris campaign has also walked back the “defund the police” sentiment that Harris voiced in 2020. What she meant is she supports being “tough and smart on crime,” Mitch Landrieu, national co-chair for the Harris campaign and former mayor of New Orleans, told CNN’s Pamela Brown in late July.
In the midst of nationwide 2020 protests sparked by George Floyd’s murder by a Minneapolis police officer, Harris voiced support for the “defund the police” movement, which argues for redirecting funds from law enforcement to social services. Throughout that summer, Harris supported the movement and called for demilitarizing police departments.
Democrats largely backed away from calls to defund the police after Republicans attempted to tie the movement to increases in crime during the 2022 midterm elections.",23/10/2024
CNN,How a one-time GOP critic found alliance with Trump in pivotal Michigan Senate race | CNN Politics,"For more on the US Senate race in Michigan, watch CNN’s “Inside Politics Sunday with Manu Raju” this Sunday at 8 a.m. ET and 11 a.m ET.
The day after January 6, 2021, Mike Rogers was blunt.
The former Republican congressman blamed then-President Donald Trump’s “chaotic leadership style” for costing his party two critical Senate seats in Georgia. He said that “the spell” around Trump had been broken by the US Capitol attack, which, he said, Trump’s actions “clearly” provoked. And in discussing a news report a week later saying that Trump privately acknowledged some responsibility for the attack, Rogers made his own view crystal clear.
“Well, you’re damn right you had responsibility for this,” Rogers said of Trump on January 12, 2021.
Nearly four years later, as Rogers now battles Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin for a prized Senate seat in Michigan, Rogers and Trump are in a much different place, a relationship solidified over phone calls that led to Trump’s crucial primary endorsement of Rogers earlier this year.
“Well, I didn’t say he was clearly responsible” for January 6, Rogers told CNN last week at a diner in his old House district northwest of Detroit. “Listen, even Donald Trump said I was tough, but fair. I’ll take that all day long.”
While Rogers said he wasn’t walking away from his past remarks, he downplayed them.
“We’re going to have differences amongst our party members all the time,” he said.
Rogers’ evolution on Trump underscores both the former president’s enduring grip on the party and the calculation down-ticket Republicans have made in navigating the polarizing presence atop their ticket. Virtually all of them are aligning themselves with Trump, believing his sway with the GOP base overcomes his baggage with suburban and women voters – and that backing Trump could potentially let them ride his coattails into office.
Slotkin sees it differently.
“Everyone who used to be thoughtful and independent just either has to get with Trump and salute and do anything he says, or they can’t be in politics,” Slotkin said in an interview here in swing Macomb County. “And it’s sad to see. It’s like watching the last buffalo die.”
The Michigan seat is one of eight in competitive states that Democrats must hold in order to simply keep the Senate at 50-50, assuming their handful of long-shot pickup opportunities don’t materialize. And it’s a state where Democrats are forced to run the gauntlet – with the GOP making serious inroads with rank-and-file union workers here and the war in Gaza threatening to pull apart the Democratic coalition.
A fraying Democratic coalition
As both sides see the race as a deadheat, the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC linked to Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell, is dropping a staggering $27 million in the final six weeks of the campaign. And now Republican groups are outpacing Democrats, with plans to spend a whopping $96 million on air this cycle, compared to $88 million for their foes, according to data from AdImpact.
“We have gotten ourself to where the national party says, ‘You can win.’ But we’ve been telling them that for a while, so we’re glad that they came,” said Rogers, 61.
A centerpiece of the GOP ad campaign: Votes Slotkin took to preserve tailpipe emission standards and to allow states to impose limits on gas-powered vehicles. Slotkin stands by her votes but was forced to cut a response ad saying she doesn’t drive an electric vehicle or believe in mandates, a move aimed at appealing to autoworkers but that has angered some environmentalists.
“I’ve been very open,” Slotkin, 48, told CNN. “I do not care what kind of car you drive. There’s no EV mandate. I don’t drive an EV. I drive a combustion engine forward. But I want to make that next generation of vehicles.”
Another major challenge: The Arab American Political Action Committee is now urging the sizable Arab population in Michigan – roughly 310,000 people or 3% of the population – to not vote for the Democratic or Republican candidates for president or the Senate. Democrats fear that could hurt their party in a closely contested election. Nearly 146,000 Muslim Americans voted in the 2020 general election in Michigan, according to an analysis by the group Emgage.
“Slotkin has a history,” said Osama Siblani, a spokesman for the Arab American Political Action Committee. “We’re judging people by their history, in here, and we’re not going to take a chance by voting for someone, put them in office and then regretting that.”
Slotkin, who is Jewish, downplayed the group’s decision but said: “It’s hard to overstate how this issue has roiled the state of Michigan, also because it’s personal here,” pointing to the large Arab, Jewish and student populations here.
But some GOP groups are seeking to stoke the divide even further. The Future Coalition PAC, a GOP-linked group, has cut digital ads and mailers targeting Arab voters with messages like this: “Kamala Harris and Elissa Slotkin have proven time and again that they will always have Israel’s back.”
An unflinching defense of Trump
Yet Slotkin, who represents a swing district, sees major vulnerabilities in Rogers’ voting record over 14 years in the House – namely over his previous votes on abortion restrictions, which has become central to the Democratic ad campaign against him.
But Slotkin has tried to make a broader case: That Rogers has changed since his time leaving office.
“I want the 2014 Mike Rogers back,” Slotkin said at a debate last week.
Asked to respond, Rogers fired back.
“That’s ridiculous,” he said. “The 2024 Mike Rogers is worried about people affording their homes, putting gas in their car, getting enough groceries. … So that’s a campaign tactic that some consultant came up with, but I will tell you what, I am the same guy that’s going to fight for Michigan citizens as hard as I did in 2014 and earlier.”
But what’s changed since 2014 is Trump’s emergence on the national scene and dominance in the GOP. Just earlier this month, Trump delivered an economic speech in Detroit, insulting the city.
“Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she’s your president,” Trump said, referring to Harris. “We’re not going to let her do that to this country. We’re not going to let it happen.”
In the interview with CNN, Rogers defended the former president.
“What he was talking about is there are schools that are failing, and the Democrats, every year, keep saying, ‘I’m gonna help ya,’ and their schools have deteriorated. They keep saying, ‘Crime is better,’ if you live on the streets of Detroit, you know crime is not better,” Rogers said.
Slotkin had a different take.
“Do you see how scared he is of Donald Trump to even split with him on defending the biggest city in your state?” she said. “It’s sad.”

CNN,"CNN Polls: Harris has a narrow edge in Michigan and Wisconsin, while she and Trump remain tied in Pennsylvania | CNN Politics","Vice President Kamala Harris maintains a narrow advantage in two of the three “blue wall” states that collectively represent her clearest path to an Electoral College victory over former President Donald Trump, according to new CNN polls conducted by SSRS.
In Michigan, Harris holds a lead over Trump by 48% to 43% among likely voters. Harris also leads Trump in Wisconsin, where 51% support her to 45% for Trump. But the race is tied in Pennsylvania (both with 48% support), the largest electoral prize of the three states and a central piece of either candidate’s hopes of winning the White House. All three states broke in Trump’s favor in 2016, but President Joe Biden won them in 2020.
Of the seven states rated as tossups by CNN, Michigan and Wisconsin are the only two where voters’ ballots still include Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. – the former independent candidate who suspended his bid for the presidency and threw his support behind Trump. In Michigan, Kennedy holds 3% support, and he stands at 1% in Wisconsin. Support for third-party and independent candidates overall runs highest in Michigan, with 6% of likely voters there saying they back a candidate other than Harris or Trump.
There is less support for independent and third-party candidates among those likely voters who express the highest motivation to turn out. Among those likely voters who say they’re extremely motivated to vote in Michigan, 51% support Harris to 45% for Trump. In Wisconsin, they break 52% Harris to 47% Trump, and in Pennsylvania, they divide 50% for Harris to 47% for Trump.
The overall results are nearly identical to the last round of CNN polling in these three states, conducted in late summer, when Harris led Trump by 50% to 44% in Wisconsin and 48% to 43% in Michigan, with Harris and Trump tied at 47% in Pennsylvania.
The vast majority of blue wall state voters have locked in their choices. Just 8% of likely voters in Pennsylvania, 7% in Michigan and 6% in Wisconsin say they haven’t made a choice or could change their minds before Election Day.
Harris runs much closer to Trump on trust to handle the economy and further ahead of him on handling democracy in both Michigan and Wisconsin, where she also holds wider advantages on key attributes than in Pennsylvania, differences that help to explain her stronger showing in the upper Midwest states.
Her deficit against Trump on trust to handle the economy – a perennial top election issue and a Trump strength throughout the 2024 campaign – is more modest in those states: Just 4 points separate the two in Michigan and 3 points in Wisconsin, differences that are within each poll’s margin of sampling error. By contrast, Harris trails Trump by 8 points on the issue in Pennsylvania. Harris also holds an 8-point advantage over Trump on trust to protect democracy in Michigan and Wisconsin, compared with a narrow 4-point margin in Pennsylvania.
Likely voters in Michigan and Wisconsin also give Harris a relatively broad advantage on perceptions that she’s more honest and trustworthy: She leads Trump on this attribute by 17 points in Wisconsin and 16 points in Michigan, compared to a 7-point margin in Pennsylvania. And those voters in Michigan and Wisconsin also say that Harris is the candidate more likely to put the country’s interest above her own: Wisconsin likely voters say that by a 10-point margin and Michigan likely voters do by an 8-point margin. In Pennsylvania, that’s an issue where likely voters are about evenly split (46% Harris to 45% Trump).
These voters in Michigan and Wisconsin are more likely than those in Pennsylvania to say Harris cares about people like them, by 9 points in the upper Midwest states compared with just a 3-point difference in Pennsylvania.
In each of the three states, the percentage of likely voters who say they’re backing Harris is higher than the percentage who say she shares their vision for the US, while Trump’s overall support tracks more closely with his standing on this question. That could suggest that some voters are backing Harris less out of enthusiasm for her platform than out of concerns about Trump’s character.
Across Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, a majority of voters who say that leadership traits outweigh issues in their votes are backing Harris. And in each state, roughly 4 in 10 of her supporters say they’re voting more to oppose Trump than to support her, higher than the share of Trump voters who say they’re casting their vote predominantly in opposition to Harris.
Harris’ narrow leads in Michigan and Wisconsin are driven in part by relatively strong performance among White voters and White voters without college degrees, two groups which traditionally break Republican. White voters in both states split almost evenly (48% Trump to 44% Harris in Michigan, and 48% each in Wisconsin, which has a larger White population than the other two states). Trump’s margin among White voters without college degrees in those two states state lags behind his margin with the same group in Pennsylvania (Trump leads 54% to 37% in Michigan, 54% to 43% in Wisconsin and 61% to 34% in Pennsylvania).
Harris holds a wider lead among Black voters in Michigan (83% Harris to 12% Trump) than she does in Pennsylvania (76% Harris to 21% Trump). She has significant advantages with likely voters who hold college degrees across all three states (59% to 36% in Wisconsin, 56% to 36% in Michigan and 59% to 37% in Pennsylvania).
The tighter race in Pennsylvania is reflected across urban and rural voters within the state: Harris’ lead among likely voters who say they live in an urban area in Pennsylvania (53% to 38%) is much smaller than in Michigan (61% to 31%) or Wisconsin (70% to 28%), while Trump’s lead among rural likely voters is highest in the Keystone State (68% to 30%, compared with 61% to 31% in Wisconsin and 56% to 35% in Michigan).
Suburban likely voters, though, break broadly for Harris in all three states (55% to 40% in Pennsylvania, 52% to 40% in Michigan and 51% to 45% in Wisconsin). The suburban vote represents about half of likely voters in Pennsylvania, compared to 37% in Michigan and 28% in Wisconsin.
All three states feature competitive Senate races in seats Democrats are defending. The polls find close races for all three. Michigan Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin tops Republican former Rep. Mike Rogers 48% to 42% among likely voters. Pennsylvania’s Democratic Sen. Bob Casey holds 48% support to Republican Dave McCormick’s 45% in a race with no clear leader. And in Wisconsin, there also is no clear leader in the Senate race, with Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin holding 49% support to Republican Eric Hovde’s 47%.
Compared to Southern and Western battlegrounds, the blue wall states have less of a history of voting early or by-mail, and only about a third or fewer voters across these three say they have already cast ballots. In Michigan, 36% of likely voters say they’ve either mailed in a ballot or voted early, with Wisconsin at 34% and Pennsylvania at 26%. This is the first presidential election in which Michigan has held in-person early voting, and turnout soared in the first few days of statewide early voting over the weekend.
Those who say they have already cast ballots are included in each poll’s group of likely voters, and across all three states they break heavily in Harris’ favor (61% to 35% in Michigan, 60% to 38% in Wisconsin and 57% to 40% in Pennsylvania). Should those Pennsylvania numbers hold, they would reflect a significant shift in Trump’s favor compared with by-mail ballots cast in the 2020 election: Biden carried 76% of those votes to Trump’s 23%, according to the state’s election results.
Three-quarters or more of likely voters in each of the three states polled say they’re at least somewhat confident that the votes in their state will be accurately cast and counted in this year’s election. A near-universal 95% or more of Harris supporters in each state express confidence, compared with roughly 6 in 10 Trump supporters in each state.
Interviews were conducted October 23-28, 2024, online and by telephone with registered voters, including 726 voters in Michigan, 819 in Pennsylvania and 736 in Wisconsin. Likely voters include all registered voters in the poll weighted for their predicted likelihood of voting in this year’s election. Results among likely voters in Michigan and Pennsylvania have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.7 percentage points; it is 4.8 points among likely voters in Wisconsin.",30/10/2024
CNN,Here’s what Harris and Trump are proposing for the economy | CNN Politics,"Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris have laid out a broad array of ideas aimed at making life more affordable and strengthening the economy, which rank at the top of voters’ concerns.
Nearly all of the measures on their differing wish lists, which lack detail, would require congressional approval. That could be tough to achieve in the current partisan climate on Capitol Hill.
One issue that hasn’t been high on the candidates’ priority lists is reducing the ever-growing national debt. Both Trump and Harris have rolled out pricey provisions without specifying how they would cover the cost.
Harris’ plan would boost the debt by nearly $4 trillion over the next decade, while Trump’s platform would cause it to spike by roughly $7.8 trillion, according to an updated report from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
Meanwhile, 23 US winners of the Nobel Prize for economics favor Harris’ agenda, calling it “vastly superior” to Trump’s platform in a recent letter.
Here’s what you need to know about how Harris and Trump would address the economy:
Tackle expiring tax cuts
Some parts of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, one of Trump’s signature achievements during his time in the White House, are scheduled to lapse at the end of 2025 – and Trump and Harris have differing views on how to address the expirations, which include cuts to individual income taxes and the estate tax.
While the law reduced taxes for most people, Democrats often criticize the TCJA for disproportionately benefiting the wealthy.
Harris: The vice president has said that she will continue President Joe Biden’s pledge not to raise taxes on anyone making under $400,000 a year – which would mean extending some of the individual tax cuts. But she will push Congress to roll back tax cuts for the richest Americans, according to her policy paper.
The vice president is also proposing some additional tax hikes on wealthy Americans. She has said she would raise the long-term capital gains tax rate to 28%, up from the current 20%, for those who earn $1 million or more. Like Biden, Harris has expressed support for what is often called a billionaire minimum tax – which would impact those whose net worth is more than $100 million, or less than 1% of taxpayers.
Most of the corporate tax provisions included in the 2017 law are permanent, but Harris is also proposing an increase to the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%.
Trump: The former president wants to extend all the individual income and estate tax cuts that the 2017 law provided. This includes, among other things, an increase to the standard deduction, lower marginal income tax rates for most income brackets and an increase to the estate tax exemption.
Trump has suggested he would get rid of the cap on state and local tax deductions, known as SALT. The TCJA limited the deduction to $10,000, but the controversial cap expires at the end of 2025.
Additionally, Trump has called for lowering the corporate tax rate to 15% for certain companies. The TJCA permanently lowered the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%.
Trump would also restore companies’ ability to immediately deduct investments in equipment and research.
Eliminate taxes
Harris: The vice president has promised to end federal income taxes on tips in an effort to woo hospitality and service workers in key battleground states like Nevada.
Tips would remain subject to payroll taxes under Harris’ plan, and her campaign said she would work with Congress on a proposal that would set income limits and include measures to prevent fraud.
However, many tipped workers would not benefit from eliminating federal income taxes on tips since they don’t earn enough to pay income tax, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University.
Trump: The former president has rolled out a series of targeted tax breaks, including eliminating federal taxes on tips, Social Security benefits and overtime pay.
Trump was the first candidate to promise an end to taxes on tips, floating it at a rally in Las Vegas about two months earlier than Harris. Though his campaign hasn’t released details on the proposal, Trump has indicated that he would eliminate both federal income taxes and payroll taxes, which fund Social Security and Medicare.
Virtually all tipped workers would get some tax relief if Trump also gets rid of payroll taxes on tips, the Tax Policy Center found. However, these workers would then get smaller Social Security payments after they retire.
Seeking to appeal to senior citizens, a dedicated voting bloc, Trump has vowed that Social Security recipients would no longer have to pay taxes on the monthly benefits they receive. Around half of beneficiaries – mainly those with higher incomes – pay federal income tax on their Social Security payments.
In addition, Trump has proposed jettisoning taxes on overtime pay, though his campaign has not provided any details. However, if workers don’t owe payroll taxes on their overtime compensation, they could receive less from Social Security in retirement.
If enacted, all three of these measures could reduce the taxes that help fund Social Security, which could deplete the program’s trust funds by 2031 and force a roughly 30% cut in benefits for enrollees if the revenue is not replaced, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
Trump has also floated ending the federal income tax and replacing it with revenue from tariffs.
Help the middle class
Harris: The vice president has promised to provide tax relief to 100 million Americans, particularly those in the middle class. Her plan centers on reviving or extending several temporary measures that Biden and congressional Democrats enacted.
Harris’ proposal would restore the American Rescue Plan’s popular expansion of the child tax credit to as much as $3,600, up from $2,000, per child and call for it to be made permanent. The enhancement was only in effect in 2021.
Plus, she would add a new child tax credit of up to $6,000 for middle-class and lower-income families with children in their first year of life.
Her plan would also restore the American Rescue Plan’s enhancement of the earned income tax credit, known as the EITC, which increased the maximum credit for workers without dependent children to roughly $1,500 – but only for 2021.
Harris has also talked a lot about strengthening the care economy.
To assist Medicare enrollees who can no longer live fully independently at home, Harris has proposed having the program pay for home health aides, who would help with activities of daily living, such as eating and bathing. This measure would also provide some relief to those in the “sandwich generation,” who have to care for aging parents and children at the same time.
Medicare would cover the tab for those with modest incomes, while seniors with higher incomes would share in the cost, according to the campaign. In addition, Harris is proposing that Medicare cover hearing aids and exams, eye exams, and new glasses and lenses.
To offset the cost, the vice president said she would expand Medicare drug price negotiations, as well as increase drug discounts from manufacturers, implement international tax reform and take other measures.
On the campaign trail, the vice president has said that families should not have to pay more than 7% of their income toward child care but did not provide a proposal on how to achieve that goal.
Harris has also voiced support for raising the federal minimum wage to at least $15 an hour, though she added that Congress would have to approve any increase.
Trump: The former president unveiled on the campaign trail several measures aimed at helping Americans afford the cost of living.
He has said he would temporarily cap credit card interest rates at around 10%, which is less than half the current rate.
And Trump promised to make the interest paid on car loans fully tax deductible, similar to the popular existing deduction for mortgage interest. While he argues this will stimulate car ownership, some experts say it will mainly help wealthier Americans who itemize their deductions – and who typically buy more expensive cars.
To assist aging seniors and their family members, Trump has said he would push for a tax credit for family caregivers. Also, he would shift resources to at-home care and end disincentives that lead to care worker shortages, according to his platform.
GOP vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance has floated beefing up the child tax credit to $5,000 per child, but Trump has not formally adopted that idea.
Boost tariffs and trade
Harris: The vice president hasn’t specified whether she would add any new tariffs if elected, but the Biden-Harris administration has kept most of the tariffs Trump imposed when he was in office and increased the rate of some of the duties.
But the vice president has criticized Trump’s new plan for across-the-board tariffs, which many studies show would result in in higher prices for US consumers. She’s referred to her opponent’s proposal as a “Trump Tax.”
Harris has also suggested she would want to make changes to the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, known as USMCA, which Trump negotiated when in office. She was one of 10 US senators who voted against USMCA at the time and recently said that “it was not sufficient to protect our country and its workers.”
Trump: The former president has said that, if elected again, he will impose an across-the-board tariff of either 10% or 20% on every import coming into the US, as well as a tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports.
He’s also floated a 100% or 200% tariff on cars made in Mexico or on the products made by companies that move manufacturing from the US to Mexico.
Trump claims that tariffs will boost American manufacturing, create jobs and bring in billions of dollars to help pay for other policy initiatives – like tax cuts.
But it’s unlikely the revenue generated from new tariffs would fully cover his spending proposals. The duties would also likely raise prices on American consumers. Trump, for years, has inaccurately claimed that foreign countries pay the tariffs. They are paid by importers based in the US.
Separately, Trump has said he will renegotiate the USMCA trade deal his own administration struck with Mexico and Canada.
Cut prices
Harris: The vice president has acknowledged that prices – particularly for groceries – have remained high even as the rate of inflation has ebbed. She argues there are some bad players that are looking to pad their profits even though their production costs have leveled off.
One of the main ways she intends to address the issue is by instituting a first-ever national price-gouging ban on food and groceries. The ban would be aimed at big corporations that unfairly exploit consumers during crises and emergencies to increase their profits. A policy paper from her campaign noted that Harris’ idea is similar to price-gouging bans already in place in 37 states, including Texas and Florida.
Trump: The former president has repeatedly blasted Harris for the surge in prices in recent years. He has promised to reverse course and lower the prices of gas, groceries and other essentials, though he hasn’t provided many details on how he’d accomplish that.
Trump has repeatedly said he will bring down prices by boosting oil and gas production. He’s vowed to allow for more drilling and reduce regulations. But those efforts may have a limited effect on prices at the pump, which in the US are highly dependent on the global oil market.
Trump has also promised to rescind unspent funds under the Inflation Reduction Act, a milestone climate law backed by the Biden-Harris administration, as well as create a new efficiency commission to conduct a financial and performance audit of the federal government. He said in September that tech billionaire Elon Musk has agreed to lead the commission.
Make housing more affordable
Harris: The vice president has a three-section plan aimed at addressing the nation’s housing shortage, parts of which build on proposals that Biden has already unveiled.
Among the key provisions are providing up to $25,000 in down-payment support and a $10,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers. The plan would allow for more than 1 million first-time buyers per year, including first-generation homebuyers, to access the funds, according to her campaign.
Harris is also calling for the building of 3 million new housing units. To spur construction, she would provide a first-ever tax incentive for builders who build starter homes sold to first-time buyers. She also would expand an existing tax incentive for building affordable rental housing.
The plan also highlights two main proposals that aim to lower rent. The first would block landlords from using algorithm-driven, price-setting tools to set rents. The second would discourage wealthy investors from buying up properties and marking up rents in bulk by removing tax benefits for investors who buy large numbers of single-family rental homes.
Trump: The former president has not rolled out a formal housing proposal but has talked on the campaign trail about ways he’d help homeowners.
Trump has promised to make housing more affordable and boost supply by getting rid of regulations that increase costs and by opening up some federal land available for large-scale housing construction.
He has also said falling interest rates will send mortgage rates down to 3% or even lower, which will make financing less expensive for homebuyers. (However, presidents don’t control interest rates.)
Trump has also blamed undocumented immigrants for driving up the cost of housing, which he would address through mass deportations and by banning them from getting mortgages.
The platform of the Republican Party also notes that it would “promote homeownership through Tax Incentives and support for first-time buyers.”
Invest in US businesses
Harris: The vice president has called for a number of proposals to help small businesses and boost manufacturing.
She wants to increase a tax deduction for startup expenses from $5,000 to $50,0000 and make it easier for small business owners to file taxes and do business across state lines. The vice president has also said she would ensure that one-third of federal contract dollars goes to small businesses.
Harris said she would invest in community development financial institutions, or CDFIs, so that they can provide low- and no-interest loans to small businesses serving low-income communities that want to expand.
Additionally, Harris has called for a new tax credit for American manufacturers. Harris’ policy paper gives few details about the tax credit, which she’s calling “America Forward,” but says it will target key strategic industries and mentions steel and iron, biotechnology, artificial intelligence, semiconductors, aerospace, autos and farming. The policy paper said the tax credit will prioritize companies that protect workers’ rights to organize and investments in long-standing factory towns.
She also plans to expand apprenticeship programs to help workers get jobs without having to get a four-year degree. Relatedly, she said she backs eliminating degree requirements and increasing skills-based hiring.
Trump: The former president has said that his plans to increase tariffs and cut the corporate tax rate will result in a boom in American manufacturing.
He has said he will impose tariffs on companies that move manufacturing from the US to another country and, in September, specifically threatened John Deere with tariffs if the company doesn’t abandon plans to move some production from the Midwest to Mexico.
The idea is that tariffs will make foreign-made goods more expensive compared with those made in the US. But prices can go up for US manufactures too if they need to import certain parts. And there will likely be retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries, making it harder for US companies to sell goods abroad. In 2019, Federal Reserve economists found that Trump’s earlier tariffs led to a net decrease in manufacturing employment.
In September, he called his proposal to reduce the corporate tax rate to 15% for companies that make products in the US the “centerpiece” of his plan for a manufacturing renaissance.
Make health care more affordable
Harris: The vice president has unveiled several proposals that are largely in line with steps taken by the Biden administration.
They include extending the more generous Affordable Care Act premium subsidies that are set to expire at the end of 2025. The enhancement, which was made available through the American Rescue Plan and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act, has helped push sign-ups for Obamacare coverage to record levels.
Also, Harris wants to expand the current $35 monthly cap on out-of-pocket costs for insulin and the upcoming $2,000 annual limit on out-of-pocket costs for Part D prescription drugs to all Americans, not just Medicare enrollees. These caps were put in place for those on Medicare by the Inflation Reduction Act.
Harris’ plan would also accelerate the speed of Medicare’s drug price negotiations so that the costs of more medications come down faster. The Biden administration announced in August the results of the first-ever round of negotiations, which is expected to result in $6 billion in savings for Medicare and a $1.5 billion reduction in out-of-pocket costs for seniors when the lower prices take effect in 2026. Medicare gained this historic power through the Inflation Reduction Act.
Also, as part of her efforts to help rural communities, Harris would recruit 10,000 health care professionals by expanding scholarships, loan forgiveness and other programs for doctors and nurses who will work in rural and tribal areas. In addition, she would launch a new grant program to train and fund community health workers in rural areas and expand grants to community and rural health centers.
Plus, she wants to reduce the number of “ambulance deserts” by increasing funding and technical support for emergency medical technicians and first responders, as well as providing more resources for ambulances, lifesaving equipment and first-responder stations. And Harris would give grants to volunteer ambulance programs.
Trump: While health care was a main focus of Trump’s first term – when he unsuccessfully tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act and issued multiple executive orders and proposals aimed at reducing drug prices – the former president is not placing the same emphasis on the issue during this campaign.
He has alternated between saying he would like to try again to repeal Obamacare and replace it with a better program. When pressed at a September debate, Trump said he had “concepts of a plan.”
Vance sought to fill in some of the details at rallies last month. After initially indicating support for separating healthy and sicker Obamacare enrollees into different risk pools, which could threaten the law’s protections for those with preexisting conditions, he later backed off that view. In an October debate, he said he supports federal approval of state reinsurance programs, which have generally lowered Obamacare premiums by providing funding for insurers that enroll many high-cost patients.
