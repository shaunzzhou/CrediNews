CNN,Milwaukee’s Black voters expose cracks in Democratic foundation for Harris | CNN Politics,"Devonta Johnson is going door to door, clipboard in hand, wearing a bright yellow vest and a seemingly permanent smile.
“How do you feel about Kamala Harris?” Johnson asks when a woman answers the door and steps out onto the porch.
“I think she is great,” the woman says, and Johnson’s smile gets even bigger.
“How do you feel about Trump?” he asks.
“Not so great,” is the quick response.
The conversation lasts another minute or so, as Johnson runs through early voting opportunities and asks for a phone number so he can check back and make sure supporting Harris translates into voting for her. Then a pleasant goodbye, and Johnson turns back to the sidewalk and heads to the next knock.
Johnson and his colleagues from Black Leaders Organizing for Communities walk these streets year-round. But their steps are now a bit quicker and the falling leaves add a little color and crunching sound. The Halloween decorations on the lawn tell us the calendar is moving. So does the new script the canvassers are carrying.
“I just wanted to remind you that early voting starts on October 22,” one says to a man who steps out to talk.
It is turnout time, and any path to a Democratic victory in Wisconsin – which flipped from Trump to Joe Biden four years ago – begins in these overwhelmingly Black neighborhoods on Milwaukee’s north side.
“There’s a lot of momentum,” says Angela Lang, a veteran organizer who is the BLOC executive director. “Generally speaking, people feel pretty good about where we are at.”
The energy and activism among Black women is obvious. Plus, Lang says, her conversations with other organizers suggest perhaps a few surprises in the Wisconsin count.
“You can’t win a statewide election here without going through the heart of Milwaukee and in some cases that runs through this office and the work that our team does,” Lang said in an interview. “But we are also seeing folks in heavily red areas that are getting together with other women at coffee shops without their husbands knowing, for example, and starting to have those conversations.”
We first visited Lang and BLOC a year ago, in the early weeks of our CNN project – “All Over The Map” – to track the 2024 election through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds or are members of crucial voting blocs.
It is obvious that Harris is in better shape now than Biden was during that first visit last October.
Back then, even Johnson, then 21, said he was not sure who he would vote for, describing Biden and Trump as too old and disconnected from his generation. Now, he is as excited to vote for Harris as he is to knock doors organizing for her and other Democrats.
“At the time, I was like kind of iffy, feeling like everybody else, kind of undecided,” Johnson said of his choices before Harris got in the race. “But now that Kamala got the ball and she rollin’ with it, I feel like oh yeah. … She’s making a good image for herself and for the Democrats.”
A year ago, Lang was blunt about Biden’s struggles in Milwaukee’s Black neighborhoods. Now she says there is energy around Harris and myriad efforts to find creative ways to generate high turnout.
“It’s extremely different,” Lang said.
Cracks in the Democratic coalition
Yet she candidly discussed cracks and concerns in the Democratic foundation, which were on clear display as we walked with the canvassers and sat in on the meeting in which they share notes about what they call being “on doors.”
Some who answer don’t plan to vote.
“Because they say it isn’t going to change anything,” one of the canvassers said at the meeting.
Young Black voters are harder to motivate.
“We still got a job to do,” one of the canvassers told her colleagues. “They have a lot of questions that’s not answered.”
But by far the biggest worry is Black men.
Two things come up the most.
“People are, like, ‘I think I had more money in my pocket when Trump was in office because of the stimulus checks during the pandemic,’” Lang said.
She tells canvassers to point out Congress passed that funding and that Trump initially opposed the idea, though he in the end had his signature printed on the checks.
The second concern is about how Harris got her start in politics: as a county prosecutor and later as California’s attorney general.
“It makes sense why people may have a little bit of a pause,” Lang said of the vice president’s background in law enforcement. “I myself did as well.”
Now she tells canvassers that a key Harris priority as a prosecutor were programs designed to reduce recidivism.
‘They look at a man as being a leader’
Brian McMutuary says he is open to listening in the final days. He was a lifelong Democrat until he voted for Trump in 2020.
He disagrees with Trump on abortion rights and immigration. But he likes the former president’s take on cryptocurrency and remembers being better off when Trump was president.
“When I go to the grocery store, I get what I need, not so much what I want or what the kids want,” McMutuary said in an interview in Menomonee Falls, a Milwaukee suburb. “We need to make it each week. We have a budget, you know. It is tight.”
McMutuary also says he worries Russia’s Vladimir Putin and China’s Xi Jinping would not treat Harris as an equal.
“They look at a man as being a leader,” he said.
He said he had no problem with a woman president.
“Nope, not at all,” McMutuary said. “It’s about doing the right thing for the country.”
Eric Jones says he has heard that and more as he makes the rounds getting coffee, going to the barbershop or in his real estate business.
“If I were a gambling man, I would probably put my money on Harris,” Jones told us in an interview at Confectionately Yours, a new Black-owned coffee shop and bakery on Milwaukee’s Martin Luther King Jr. Drive.
“Things are getting better,” Jones said. “The numbers are better. The energy is different. It’s a lot different from when we were here last time, especially in terms of the election.”
Still, he sees the same cracks and doubts relayed by the BLOC community organizers, especially among Black men.
“They’ll say, ‘I had more money when he was the president,’’’ Jones said.
Harris’ work as San Francisco district attorney and California attorney general might help woo suburban voters but, at a minimum, raises questions here.
“Law enforcement has not been kind to Black people historically,” Jones said. “District attorneys have not been kind to Black people historically.”
Jones also says abortion and transgender rights have come up in some recent debates at stops in the community.
“The good old party feels they have a monopoly on the Christian vote,” Jones said. “The Democratic Party feels they have a monopoly over the Black vote. The problem is there are a lot of Blacks that are Christians and the Black church is one of the strongest institutions in the Black community, right?”
“So you have this tug of war in a city that I’m pretty sure the Black folk will decide who wins that city, and more than likely, the presidency.”",2024-10-11
CNN,How a one-time GOP critic found alliance with Trump in pivotal Michigan Senate race | CNN Politics,"For more on the US Senate race in Michigan, watch CNN’s “Inside Politics Sunday with Manu Raju” this Sunday at 8 a.m. ET and 11 a.m ET.
The day after January 6, 2021, Mike Rogers was blunt.
The former Republican congressman blamed then-President Donald Trump’s “chaotic leadership style” for costing his party two critical Senate seats in Georgia. He said that “the spell” around Trump had been broken by the US Capitol attack, which, he said, Trump’s actions “clearly” provoked. And in discussing a news report a week later saying that Trump privately acknowledged some responsibility for the attack, Rogers made his own view crystal clear.
“Well, you’re damn right you had responsibility for this,” Rogers said of Trump on January 12, 2021.
Nearly four years later, as Rogers now battles Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin for a prized Senate seat in Michigan, Rogers and Trump are in a much different place, a relationship solidified over phone calls that led to Trump’s crucial primary endorsement of Rogers earlier this year.
“Well, I didn’t say he was clearly responsible” for January 6, Rogers told CNN last week at a diner in his old House district northwest of Detroit. “Listen, even Donald Trump said I was tough, but fair. I’ll take that all day long.”
While Rogers said he wasn’t walking away from his past remarks, he downplayed them.
“We’re going to have differences amongst our party members all the time,” he said.
Rogers’ evolution on Trump underscores both the former president’s enduring grip on the party and the calculation down-ticket Republicans have made in navigating the polarizing presence atop their ticket. Virtually all of them are aligning themselves with Trump, believing his sway with the GOP base overcomes his baggage with suburban and women voters – and that backing Trump could potentially let them ride his coattails into office.
Slotkin sees it differently.
“Everyone who used to be thoughtful and independent just either has to get with Trump and salute and do anything he says, or they can’t be in politics,” Slotkin said in an interview here in swing Macomb County. “And it’s sad to see. It’s like watching the last buffalo die.”
The Michigan seat is one of eight in competitive states that Democrats must hold in order to simply keep the Senate at 50-50, assuming their handful of long-shot pickup opportunities don’t materialize. And it’s a state where Democrats are forced to run the gauntlet – with the GOP making serious inroads with rank-and-file union workers here and the war in Gaza threatening to pull apart the Democratic coalition.
A fraying Democratic coalition
As both sides see the race as a deadheat, the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC linked to Senate GOP Leader Mitch McConnell, is dropping a staggering $27 million in the final six weeks of the campaign. And now Republican groups are outpacing Democrats, with plans to spend a whopping $96 million on air this cycle, compared to $88 million for their foes, according to data from AdImpact.
“We have gotten ourself to where the national party says, ‘You can win.’ But we’ve been telling them that for a while, so we’re glad that they came,” said Rogers, 61.
A centerpiece of the GOP ad campaign: Votes Slotkin took to preserve tailpipe emission standards and to allow states to impose limits on gas-powered vehicles. Slotkin stands by her votes but was forced to cut a response ad saying she doesn’t drive an electric vehicle or believe in mandates, a move aimed at appealing to autoworkers but that has angered some environmentalists.
“I’ve been very open,” Slotkin, 48, told CNN. “I do not care what kind of car you drive. There’s no EV mandate. I don’t drive an EV. I drive a combustion engine forward. But I want to make that next generation of vehicles.”
Another major challenge: The Arab American Political Action Committee is now urging the sizable Arab population in Michigan – roughly 310,000 people or 3% of the population – to not vote for the Democratic or Republican candidates for president or the Senate. Democrats fear that could hurt their party in a closely contested election. Nearly 146,000 Muslim Americans voted in the 2020 general election in Michigan, according to an analysis by the group Emgage.
“Slotkin has a history,” said Osama Siblani, a spokesman for the Arab American Political Action Committee. “We’re judging people by their history, in here, and we’re not going to take a chance by voting for someone, put them in office and then regretting that.”
Slotkin, who is Jewish, downplayed the group’s decision but said: “It’s hard to overstate how this issue has roiled the state of Michigan, also because it’s personal here,” pointing to the large Arab, Jewish and student populations here.
But some GOP groups are seeking to stoke the divide even further. The Future Coalition PAC, a GOP-linked group, has cut digital ads and mailers targeting Arab voters with messages like this: “Kamala Harris and Elissa Slotkin have proven time and again that they will always have Israel’s back.”
An unflinching defense of Trump
Yet Slotkin, who represents a swing district, sees major vulnerabilities in Rogers’ voting record over 14 years in the House – namely over his previous votes on abortion restrictions, which has become central to the Democratic ad campaign against him.
But Slotkin has tried to make a broader case: That Rogers has changed since his time leaving office.
“I want the 2014 Mike Rogers back,” Slotkin said at a debate last week.
Asked to respond, Rogers fired back.
“That’s ridiculous,” he said. “The 2024 Mike Rogers is worried about people affording their homes, putting gas in their car, getting enough groceries. … So that’s a campaign tactic that some consultant came up with, but I will tell you what, I am the same guy that’s going to fight for Michigan citizens as hard as I did in 2014 and earlier.”
But what’s changed since 2014 is Trump’s emergence on the national scene and dominance in the GOP. Just earlier this month, Trump delivered an economic speech in Detroit, insulting the city.
“Our whole country will end up being like Detroit if she’s your president,” Trump said, referring to Harris. “We’re not going to let her do that to this country. We’re not going to let it happen.”
In the interview with CNN, Rogers defended the former president.
“What he was talking about is there are schools that are failing, and the Democrats, every year, keep saying, ‘I’m gonna help ya,’ and their schools have deteriorated. They keep saying, ‘Crime is better,’ if you live on the streets of Detroit, you know crime is not better,” Rogers said.
Slotkin had a different take.
“Do you see how scared he is of Donald Trump to even split with him on defending the biggest city in your state?” she said. “It’s sad.”

CNN,In pictures: Harris running mate Tim Walz | CNN Politics,"Vice President Kamala Harris selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, capping the Midwestern Democrat’s short but swift ascent from a relative unknown to a leading driver of the Democratic attacks on Donald Trump and the MAGA agenda.
Before Walz was elected governor in 2018, he served 12 years in Congress, representing a conservative-leaning rural district that, both before and after his tenure, has been mostly dominated by Republicans.
Walz, 60, is also a former high school teacher and football coach who served in the Army National Guard.",2024-08-06
CNN,Nebraska’s high court says people with felony records can register to vote | CNN Politics,"Nebraska’s top election official had no authority to declare unconstitutional a state law that restored the voting rights of those who have been convicted of a felony, the state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday in a decision with implications for the approaching election.
In July, Secretary of State Bob Evnen ordered county election officials to reject the voter registrations of those with felony convictions, citing an opinion issued by Attorney General Mike Hilgers. That opinion, which Evnen had requested, deemed as unconstitutional a law passed this year by the Legislature immediately restoring the voting rights of people who have completed the terms of their felony sentences.
Evnen’s order could have kept 7,000 or more Nebraska residents from voting in the upcoming election, the American Civil Liberties Union said. Many of them reside in Nebraska’s Omaha-centered 2nd Congressional District, where both the race for president and Congress could be in play.
In an otherwise reliably Republican state that, unlike most others, splits its electoral votes, the district has twice awarded an electoral vote to Democratic presidential candidates — once to Barack Obama in 2008 and again to Joe Biden in 2020. In a presidential race shown by polling to be a dead heat, a single electoral vote could determine who wins.
Given the Omaha district’s history, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and Democratic groups have spent millions in the district in the hopes of securing the electoral vote — far more than former President Donald Trump and Republican groups.
The last day to register to vote for the 2024 general election in Nebraska is October 25 and must be done in person at a voter’s county election commission office. Election Day is November 5.
Hilgers′ opinion had said the new law violates the state constitution’s separation of powers, saying only the state Board of Pardons under the control of the executive branch can restore voting rights through pardons.
Pardons are exceedingly rare in Nebraska. Evnen, Hilgers and Gov. Jim Pillen make up the three-member Board of Pardons. All three are Republicans.
The opinion also found unconstitutional a 2005 state law that restored the voting rights of people with felony convictions two years after they complete the terms of their sentences.
The ACLU is representing advocacy group Civic Nebraska and two Nebraska residents, a Republican and an independent, who would be denied the right to vote under Evnen’s directive. Because Evnen’s move came only weeks ahead of the November election, the ACLU asked to take the lawsuit directly to the Nebraska Supreme Court, and the high court agreed.
Restoring the voting rights of former felons has drawn national attention in recent years. In Florida, lawmakers weakened a 2018 voter-approved constitutional amendment to restore the voting rights of most convicted felons. Following that, an election police unit championed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis arrested 20 former felons. Several of them said they were confused by the arrests because they had been allowed to register to vote.
In Tennessee, lawmakers killed a bipartisan bill this year that would have let residents convicted of felonies apply to vote again without also restoring their gun rights.
Dozens of states allow people living with felony convictions to vote, either for those not currently in prison or upon completion of their sentences. Two states, Maine and Vermont, allow everyone, even those in prison, to vote. But despite a recent trend toward restoration of rights, felony disenfranchisement laws prevent around 5.85 million people across the country from voting, according to the ACLU.
Felony disenfranchisement laws date to the Jim Crow era and mainly targeted Black people, according to experts. Black registered voters have an overwhelmingly positive view of Harris, according to a recent poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.",2024-10-16
CNN,How elderly dementia patients are unwittingly fueling political campaigns,"Hundreds of elderly political donors, including those with dementia, have fallen victim to Republican and Democratic political campaigns and groups.
A single donation sparks a flurry of text messages and emails from candidates and political organizations across the country.
The messages make urgent pleas for money and look as if they are coming directly from major political candidates.
They come at an unrelenting pace, directing donors to pages that often sign them up for monthly – or even weekly – donations. Money is then drained from their bank accounts without them realizing it.
Ultimately, some of these elderly, vulnerable consumers have unwittingly given away six-figure sums – most often to Republican candidates – making them among the country’s largest grassroots political donors.
(CNN) — The 80-year-old communications engineer from Texas had saved for decades, driving around in an old car and buying clothes from thrift stores so he’d have enough money to enjoy his retirement years.
But as dementia robbed him of his reasoning abilities, he began making online political donations over and over again — eventually telling his son he believed he was part of a network of political operatives communicating with key Republican leaders. In less than two years, the man became one of the country’s largest grassroots supporters of the Republican Party, ultimately giving away nearly half a million dollars to former President Donald Trump and other candidates. Now, the savings account he spent his whole life building is practically empty.
The story of this unlikely political benefactor is one of many playing out across the country.
More than 1,000 reports filed with government agencies and consumer advocacy groups reviewed by CNN, along with an analysis of campaign finance data and interviews with dozens of contributors and their family members, show how deceptive political fundraisers have victimized hundreds of elderly Americans and misled those battling dementia or other cognitive impairments into giving away millions of dollars — far more than they ever intended. Some unintentionally joined the ranks of the top grassroots political donors in the country as they tapped into retirement savings and went into debt, contributing six-figure sums through thousands of transactions.
To provide a snapshot of who these vulnerable donors are and how much money they have lost to increasingly aggressive fundraising campaigns, reporters reached out to more than 300 of the biggest and most frequent small-dollar political donors and their family members. Through these interviews and consumer complaints, reporters collected the accounts of more than 50 unwitting elderly donors and traced the path of where their money went.
Often coming in $5 or $10 at a time, contributions from this small sampling of donors alone added up to more than $6 million over the last five years — the majority of which ended up with Trump and a long list of other Republican candidates, CNN found.
While this is a small fraction of the billions raised by political campaigns, for many of the individuals who made the donations, the sums represented huge portions of their life savings.
Deceptive fundraising tactics, including those that trick elderly donors, were exposed in the wake of the 2020 election. While studies show that older Americans tend to lean more Republican, both parties have continued to rake in donations from elderly voters. And mainstream Republican candidates have only doubled down on this strategy, using more aggressive and predatory tactics than those used by Democrats, according to donor complaints, interviews with experts and a review of solicitations. The Republican fundraising machine has been subject to more than 800 complaints to the Federal Trade Commission since 2022 — nearly seven times more than the number of complaints lodged against the other side.
“The fact there are lots of complaints means this is likely a huge problem,” said Prentiss Cox, a law professor at the University of Minnesota and former manager of consumer protection at the Minnesota Attorney General's Office, when presented with CNN’s reporting. “From a consumer protection standpoint, this raises red flag level concerns about consumer misinformation and deception.”
Donors identified by CNN were often in their 80s and 90s. They included retired public workers, house cleaners and veterans, widows living alone, nursing home residents and people who donated more money than they paid for their homes, according to records and interviews.
The money they gave came from pensions, Social Security payments and retirement savings accounts meant to last decades. Donors took out new credit cards and mortgages to pay for the contributions. In some cases, they gave away most of their life savings. Their cell phones and email inboxes were so full of pleas for money that they missed photos of their grandkids and other important messages.
At least one person continued to be charged for contributions after his death.
Donors or their families often learned of the extent of their donations from CNN reporters. The family members of some said their loved ones had also been the targets of common elder scams. Most asked CNN not to name them out of concern that they would be further victimized or ashamed.
One 82-year-old woman, who wore pajamas with holes in them because she didn’t want to spend money on new ones, didn’t realize she had given Republicans more than $350,000 while living in a 1,000 square-foot Baltimore condo since 2020.
By the time a Taiwanese immigrant from California passed away from lung cancer this year at age 80, she had given away more than $180,000 to Trump’s campaign and a litany of other Republican candidates – writing letters to candidates apologizing for not getting donations to them on time because she was going into heart surgery. She had only $250 in her bank account when she died, leaving her family scrambling to cover the cost of her funeral.
And a 78-year-old, a widow who limited showers to save on her water bill and canceled her long-term care insurance, didn’t understand why the retirement savings her husband had left her was dwindling so quickly. After CNN reached out to her family, they learned that the woman gave more than $200,000 in donations to Democratic political groups and candidates.

The federal government has gone after non-political companies for similar tactics, such as making false statements in ads or making them seem as if they were written directly to the recipient. But regulators have done little to stop fundraisers from using misleading and deceptive advertisements to target vulnerable donors. And the lawmakers who experts say would need to act to protect consumers at both the state and federal levels are the same ones benefiting from the current fundraising machines.
The biggest beneficiary of the small-dollar donations from unwitting donors identified by CNN was Donald Trump. His current and former campaigns and affiliated political committees brought in more than $400,000 from these elderly consumers between July 2019 and June 2024, which included multiple election cycles. The national committees which raise money to support House and Senate races across the nation also received hundreds of thousands of dollars from such donors, according to CNN’s analysis, and in all, the long list of Republican candidates and causes took in nearly $4 million.
A spokesperson for the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee noted that fundraising efforts over the years have varied and said Trump ads were designed to be respectful, including such language as “don’t sweat it” if donors couldn’t afford to contribute on a regular basis.
On the Democratic side, much of the money went to left-leaning political action committees known as PACs, not mainstream Democratic candidates. The Progressive Turnout Project and its affiliated group, Stop Republicans, took in the most, with roughly $150,000 coming from the vulnerable donors identified by CNN. President Joe Biden’s presidential campaign was not among the top recipients, taking in only about 10% of the $400,000 Trump brought in from those elderly donors.
Vice President Kamala Harris had not yet launched her presidential bid during the fundraising period covered in CNN’s analysis, though more recent campaign finance reports show her campaign has taken in several thousand dollars from this snapshot of donors. The Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

The fundraising operations that have solicited money from vulnerable senior citizens use either WinRed or ActBlue, two juggernaut digital platforms that unite hundreds of political groups and campaigns under a single umbrella. Each platform charges a fee of about 4% of every transaction, although WinRed is a for-profit company and ActBlue is a nonprofit. Campaign finance records show that the two groups took in more than $100 million in fees from federal campaigns and political committees in the last two years alone.
WinRed, founded by a former Trump staffer in 2019, and ActBlue, which has been around for two decades, say it is the campaigns themselves that are choosing the frequency and tenor of the pleas for donations. WinRed did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A spokesperson for ActBlue said the platform is designed to give “donors full control” over their contributions, saying donors or their families can contact their in-house support team with any concerns.
But it is the fundraising platforms that have made it easier than ever for campaigns to bring in as much money as possible from their bases. Both have boasted of record-breaking hauls this campaign cycle, with WinRed saying this summer it was processing more than 2,700 donations per minute — a jump of more than 40% from 2020.
The controversial feature that fools many donors is a pre-checked box campaigns use to automatically authorize recurring donations. Donors often don’t realize they need to uncheck that box, so while attempting to make a one-time small donation, they are unknowingly signing up for weekly or monthly recurring donations. Sometimes it takes months or years before they realize a campaign has been regularly charging their credit card or taking money out of their bank account.
While many mainstream Democratic candidates have backed away from the practice, both the Trump and Harris campaigns have recently been using donation pages with pre-checked recurring boxes to raise money, a CNN analysis of fundraising emails and Facebook and Instagram ads found.
Trump’s campaign said two of his current fundraising committees only returned to the use of pre-checked boxes in September after pausing the practice in January 2023. The spokesperson, however, did not address whether another Trump-affiliated committee still receiving donations this year had been using the tactic. Trump Campaign Senior Advisor Brian Hughes said ""we strive to be direct and transparent by informing them immediately when they have registered for recurring donations, sending a notice three days before processing, notifying them when the processing is complete, and having staff on-hand to assist with refunds and cancellations.”
Recurring donations only multiply as confirmed donors become valuable political currency — their names and contact information quickly swapped and sold. And once WinRed or ActBlue has a donor’s financial information, donations can be triggered by actions including a response to an online survey, an order of campaign merchandise or a one-word reply to a text message.
As a result, records show, some donors ended up being charged in excess of 100 times in a single day.
‘Lonely and isolated’
Richard Benjamin, an 81-year-old from Arizona, believed he had been in personal communication with former president Trump through all the messages he was receiving.
At one point, he told his children the former president invited him to a luxurious reception at Mar-a-Lago. He had grown up on a farm and worried he would feel out of his element at such a fancy venue. But when he received what he described to his children as an invitation to be a VIP at a rally in Arizona, he was thrilled he would finally meet the former president himself. He started making travel plans and asking his sister-in-law if she would like to accompany him, since his wife had passed away in 2018.
Later, he told his son how angry he was that Donald Trump Jr. wouldn't call him back even though the former president’s son had sent Benjamin so many nice messages.
“He was old, lonely and isolated,” his son, Jason Benjamin, told CNN, saying the pandemic only compounded that isolation. “’Save America, help save America,’ that was the constant message. He would get thanked for helping to save America.”
Richard Benjamin, who now lives in a memory care unit at an assisted living facility, would look forward to the emails and texts, and especially to the ones thanking him for being a true American and patriot when he donated his money. This eventually led him to give about $80,000, leaving him tens of thousands of dollars in debt and his children angry at the campaigns who they say tricked their dad and took advantage of his compromised state of mind. “He really, in his heart, believed that Donald Trump and Donald Trump Jr. and other politicians were personally reaching out to him,” Jason Benjamin said.
Richard Benjamin and his family showed CNN that he continues to be inundated with text messages and phone calls from politicians to this day. Yet he often couldn’t identify the politicians he financially supported.
“There’s no excuse for them to allow something like this to happen,” Jason Benjamin said of the campaigns behind the many solicitations. An employee from Richard Benjamin’s bank even lodged a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission about deceptive practices, saying Benjamin had never intended to donate close to the amount he did, according to FTC records.
Forensic geriatrician Kathryn Locatell said what Richard Benjamin felt each time he received a “thank you” message or made a donation is the same “dopamine hit” a lot of elderly Americans are seeking. And the solicitations are crafted in a way that intentionally suck elderly donors into their web, providing “a feeling of belonging to a thrilling, special club.”
“You and I could call these demands for money laughable but to a person who’s lost their capacity to judge reality, and who’s been soaking up all the toxic misinformation out there, on the internet and TV, it’s a perfectly coherent reality and they’re happy to join in and become a part of it,” she said. “That’s how all their money will be drained until it’s gone.”
Because the text informing donors they are enrolling in recurring donations is often so tiny, particularly on WinRed donation pages, it would be very easy for someone who isn’t actually processing what they’re reading to miss it, according to Locatell and other experts interviewed by CNN. Elderly donors who have short-term memory issues could be making one-time donations again and again, not remembering that they made a donation even an hour earlier, they added.
“These ads are a form of misleading, undue influence,” Locatell said. “One simple rule could be enacted: Ads can’t contain these pre-checked boxes; the person has to actively choose recurring donation.”
Behavioral symptoms such as getting hooked by solicitations like these and making poor financial decisions often happen in the early stages of dementia, before family members even realize their loved ones are experiencing any sort of cognitive decline.
CNN compared examples of pages donors use to make contributions to presidential candidates, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.
Some donors believe political candidates are speaking to them directly, with an ad like this one indicating that Trump requested to be their friend on social media.
Invitations to join phony boards or focus groups are another common fundraising tactic that experts told CNN are used to make people feel special and are more likely to entrap elderly donors who may have diminished reasoning abilities.
Polls like this one — with 11 questions — can rile up voters before asking them for money.
The yellow box automatically signs donors up for weekly donations, after asking if Trump can count on their “sustained support.”
The way this small text appears to be hyperlinked makes it seem like donors should click there to sign up for recurring donations. But they are actually already signed up by the pre-checked box above.
These boxes, which claim to be messages from Trump, are known as upsells. A click on both of these results in two additional donations.
Fundraising pages for the Harris campaign, like this one, are clearer than those used by Trump.
This headline tells donors they will be signing up for weekly donations.
Harris fundraising pages tend to be short and relatively simple.
Like Trump, the Harris campaign sometimes uses pre-checked boxes that automatically sign donors up for recurring donations unless they opt out.
Calls from CNN reporters asking about donations prompted some family members to rush over to their loved ones’ homes to help look through statements or to begin the long process of taking over their finances. Other families CNN spoke with said it was the unusually large number of political donations – which took precedence over expenses as important as electricity bills and taxes -- that alerted them something was wrong.
In the case of the 80-year-old retired communications engineer who gave away close to half a million dollars, one of the man’s sons discovered his savings account was nearly drained from all his donations. The son said he took him to a neurologist where he was diagnosed with dementia and spent weeks canceling credit cards and disputing charges, attempting to turn off recurring donations one by one. He ultimately received refunds from WinRed for his father’s most recent donations. Still, his father remains out roughly $300,000.
“When I found this out and started showing Dad, he was shocked, he had no idea,” his son said. “He's not a man to give anyone what he considered his life savings.”
It often falls on families to try to help their loved ones.

The daughter of an 81-year-old woman with Alzheimer’s disease told CNN that when she visited her mother at her home last month, her mom got a call from Ted Cruz’s campaign and a text with an ActBlue link within minutes of each other. She said her mother was going to donate to each before she stopped her. Her mother’s cognitive decline has gotten so bad, she said, that she believed when someone asked her for money, she needed to give it. The daughter, who lives in another city, said she has been trying to coordinate her mother’s medical care while also sorting through the credit card debt she accrued after giving away more than $100,000.
No oversight
When an elderly man discovered thousands of dollars' worth of political charges on his credit card he said he never authorized, he turned to the agency that oversees campaign donations – the Federal Election Commission – for help.
“I am an 89-year-old widower, a retired architect who lives alone,” he wrote in a 2022 complaint. He said he had been plagued by robocalls and scam mail and it appeared ActBlue was “rife with fraud.” By the time the FEC completed its investigation, he had died, collapsing ""on his way to the post office to mail postcards to voters in Texas,” according to his obituary. But the agency hadn’t planned on doing anything about his complaint anyway, writing in a response that the matter was “rated as low priority” for an enforcement action based on criteria including the severity of the allegation and the dollar amount involved.
The agency shut down another complaint made about WinRed by the daughters of an elderly woman who said their mother had lost more than $6,700 to “elder abuse” with the same boiler plate response, noting the “low dollar amount involved.”
The FEC would not comment on WinRed or ActBlue specifically but said in a 2023 report on legislative recommendations that it had been regularly hearing from donors who had signed up for recurring donations without their knowledge or consent. The report noted consumers had often attempted to cancel the donations without success before contacting agency staff for help. Agency officials said the outcry from donors ""strongly suggests that many contributors are unaware of the ‘pre-checked boxes’ and are surprised by the already completed transactions appearing on account statements."" But it said it didn’t have the authority to ban the practice, and that Congress should introduce legislation to change this — a recommendation agency officials first made after the New York Times reported on the issue in 2021.
""I'm a retired cleaning lady. I just can't believe anyone would do this to me.""
""I gave Trump $20 6 years ago that was just once. Since then I've been hounded by REPUBLICANS BEGGING FOR MONEY. On the RNC Convention day I received 77 text messages of more begging.""
""My father is elderly and isn't able to manage his finances anymore, so this went on undetected for a while until we realized that he was running out of money and didn't know why.""
""I was recently helping my 93 year old father, who suffers from a cognitive impairment, sort through a pile of mail and saw a massive fraud that someone in ActBlue is perpetrating on my father.... these fraudsters need to stop defrauding older people, especially ones with mental impairments.""
""I can't afford you taking all my Social security payments. You drained my bank account, before I can even get food or pay my bills.""
""I am distressed by what appears to be outright fraud on behalf of the Republicans.""
""I may never contribute again. You are greedy and illegally fool people into taking our money. Not American. not what I thought the party stood for.""
""My grandmother, utterly confused and frustrated by the situation has paid her bills and been draining her financial accounts... she was absolutely floored and clearly did not understand the gravity of the deception.""
Dan Weiner, director of the Brennan Center’s Elections & Government Program, said federal campaign finance law is primarily intended to police political corruption but offers few protections for donors. He said seeking recurring donations “from someone who is not of sound mind” is “unscrupulous behavior [that] falls into a legal gray area.”
The Federal Trade Commission criticized pre-checked boxes in a 2022 staff report as an example of a “trick” and “psychological tactic” used by retailers and direct marketers “to get consumers to part with their money.” But the agency — which enforces laws governing deceptive advertising, among other regulations — told CNN it did not have jurisdiction over ads used by political campaigns, or over the operations of WinRed and ActBlue, despite fielding hundreds of complaints from consumers.
Currently, pre-checked boxes for recurring donations are allowed in almost every state despite widespread condemnation of the practice from consumer advocates. Federal legislation introduced in recent years that would have prevented their use died in committee without gaining traction.
And while four Democratic attorneys general have been investigating the fundraising tactics of WinRed and ActBlue, no action has been taken to date. A number of Republican lawmakers have specifically targeted ActBlue with investigations after right-wing influencers claimed the large volume of transactions from some donors suggested money laundering. CNN has found no evidence of money laundering, instead finding that many elderly donors simply didn’t realize how much they were giving.
Individual complaints made to state attorneys general around the country, meanwhile, have not resulted in any apparent action taken against the fundraising platforms or campaigns, according to records obtained by CNN. And in what some donors and experts have pointed to as a potential conflict of interest, the same attorneys general receiving complaints about these platforms have also used WinRed and ActBlue for their own fundraising efforts.
Making it stop
In Utah, a 69-year-old woman, who had a tube surgically placed in her brain to drain fluid from it and had such severe dementia that she required around-the-clock home care, donated nearly $20,000 to Republican candidates in less than four months.
WinRed continued to charge her even after the attorney overseeing her financial affairs informed the company of her condition and sent a cease-and-desist letter. He filed a lawsuit in 2021 against the platform, which remains ongoing. But it still took a year to make the donations stop. Just seven days after she made her last donation to the Republicans, public records show that more donations were charged to her accounts. This time, to a political group supporting Democrats.

This 88-year-old
dementia patient’s son
filed a complaint about
WinRed to the Florida
attorney general
Matthew Hurtt, the chairman of Virginia-based Arlington County Republican Committee, said he has fielded more than 200 calls and emails from frustrated donors located all over the country. Many of them are elderly donors who say they have struggled to stop their recurring contributions and receive refunds. Hurtt is not affiliated with WinRed, but said he receives the angry inquiries because WinRed is registered in Arlington, so charges made through the platform can sometimes show up with “Arlington” on credit card statements.
Hurtt, like other experts, told CNN he believes such aggressive fundraising tactics are short-sighted and will turn off voters in the long run.
“We don't have to trick people into giving money to our candidates and to our causes,” Hurtt said. “Any platform that tricks older donors into giving money unwittingly seems like a scheme to me.”
Both WinRed and ActBlue have said they notify donors of each recurring contribution and have guides on their websites explaining how donors or their families can request refunds and cancel recurring donations.
ActBlue told CNN it has trained its customer service staff to be on the lookout for those donors who use keywords that indicate confusion or cognitive issues and escalate them to a higher level of service. The platform said this situation is rare and that employees do what they can to accommodate refunds beyond the standard 90-day refund window.
WinRed’s website meanwhile says it “is happy to refund any donation made in error,” but notes that it can only provide refunds for those contributions made in the last 60 days.
Some of the candidates and PACs who CNN identified as receiving the most money from elderly, unwitting donors said they try to work with contributors to refund mistaken donations.
But many of those interviewed by CNN said it was hard to determine which campaigns to contact, especially since donations were often spread out among hundreds of groups. They usually contacted WinRed or ActBlue instead and found the process confusing, difficult and frequently unsuccessful.
In the case of WinRed specifically, many said they couldn’t even figure out how to reach a representative on the phone. One frustrated son who filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office told CNN he resorted to tracking down a company intern he found on LinkedIn in the hopes of finally turning off his mother’s recurring donations. He said she had lost more than $20,000 and that after contacting WinRed and even cancelling her debit card, she continued to be charged.
In Washington state, meanwhile, WinRed was quick to dismiss an 80-year-old woman’s plea for the state to investigate the platform for “senior abuse” -- saying the woman had agreed to the company’s terms of use, which make clear it provides refunds only as required by law. By the time she had filed her complaint, her money was long gone. It was up to her to reach out to the campaigns for any refunds.
“With all due respect,” WinRed’s attorney wrote, “there is nothing here to investigate.”
How CNN reported this story
CNN reviewed Federal Election Commission reports on hundreds of millions of contributions made through WinRed and ActBlue, the main donation platforms for Republican and Democratic campaigns. Reporters identified the top small-dollar donors who also gave the most frequently on each platform in recent years, and then reached out to more than 150 of those top donors and their family members for each platform.
Based on these interviews, as well as an analysis of hundreds of consumer complaints submitted to the Federal Trade Commission and state Attorneys General, reporters identified more than 50 elderly donors who gave more than they intended, many of whom suffered from cognitive decline or dementia. Reporters also reviewed complaints lodged on consumer advocacy websites TrustPilot.com and PissedConsumer.com.
Reporters reviewed data on donations made by those vulnerable donors reported in WinRed and ActBlue’s FEC filings over five years, from July 2019 through the end of June 2024. The donation amounts reported in the story do not include any refunds the donors later received, which were typically only a small fraction of the total they had given.
To identify ads with pre-checked recurring donation boxes, reporters downloaded data on fundraising ads on Facebook and Instagram from Meta’s Ad Library, and also reviewed fundraising emails sent by Trump and Harris’ campaigns provided by the Archive of Political Emails, which collects emails from numerous campaigns.",2024-10-22
CNN,Maps and charts: Tracking the early votes in key states and how it compares to 2020 | CNN Politics,"CNN is monitoring who is casting pre-election ballots in the 36 states that offer early voting, as well as how early voting numbers compare with four years ago, when pre-election voting reached historic levels during the Covid-19 pandemic.
This page, updated daily, draws on data from Catalist, election officials and Edison Research.
Democrats held a wide advantage over Republicans in early voting four years ago, but the gap could be narrower this time as top Republican officials urge supporters to embrace voting before Election Day on November 5.
Voters register by party in four of the seven president battlegrounds and in each of those four, Democrats have cast a smaller share of pre-election ballots this year than at this point in 2020. Registration data by party is not available for the battleground states of Georgia, Michigan and Wisconsin.
The overall downtick in interest in early voting so far shouldn’t be surprising.
The 2020 election featured historic levels of pre-election voting during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some voters were wary to vote in-person with guidelines from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention recommending social distancing. Four years later, with the country out of the pandemic, more voters could be heading back to the ballot box for in-person voting either before or on Election Day.
Another measure evident in the data so far is that older voters have made up a larger share of people casting ballots in battleground states, compared with this point in 2020.
The data also show early voting trends by racial and ethnic groups, offering clues about the makeup of the electorate. In some battleground states, a greater share of White voters have cast pre-election ballots than at this point in 2020.

CNN,"Harris tries to paint contrast with Trump, arguing ‘it doesn’t have to be this way’ at Ellipse rally | CNN Politics","Kamala Harris on Tuesday night warned Americans that Donald Trump would open up a floodgate of vengeance against his political rivals, including ordinary citizens, while promising that she’d work she’d work tirelessly for every American.
“In less than 90 days, either Donald Trump or I will be in the Oval Office,” Harris said from the Ellipse in Washington, DC, pivoting to the visage of the White House behind her as she delivered what her campaign had billed as a “closing argument” speech.
“On day one, if elected, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list. When elected, I will walk in with a to-do list full of priorities on what I will get done for the American people.”
Standing where Trump told his supporters on January 6, 2021, to “fight like hell,” shortly before they ransacked the US Capitol, Harris described the election as an existential choice between the liberties she promised to protect and the “chaos and division” that she said would follow Trump back into the White House.
“Donald Trump intends to use the United States military against American citizens who simply disagree with him. People he calls ‘the enemy from within.’ This is not a candidate for president who is thinking about how to make your life better,” Harris said. “This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power.”
Speaking for about a half-hour from the Ellipse, Harris measured her policy plans against Trump’s, casting herself as the former president’s foil – a president who would expand Medicare to cover home health care, where Trump would try to cut the program; a president who would back women’s reproductive rights, where Trump would further restrict them; a president who would prize compromise, where Trump feasts on conflict.
“Our democracy doesn’t require us to agree on everything. That’s not the American way,” Harris said. “We like a good debate. And the fact that someone disagrees with us, does not make them ‘the enemy from within.’ They are family, neighbors, classmates, coworkers.”
“It can be easy to forget a simple truth,” she added. “It doesn’t have to be this way.”
One hundred days after President Joe Biden announced he would not run for reelection, Harris in her remarks continued to keep him at arm’s length. Serving as Biden’s vice president, Harris said, has been an “honor.” But it would not define her administration or her objectives in office.
“My presidency will be different because the challenges we face are different,” Harris said. “Our top priority as a nation four years ago was to end the pandemic and rescue the economy. Now our biggest challenge is to lower costs, costs that were rising even before the pandemic, and that are still too high.”
Shortly after she concluded her remarks, Biden was forced to clean up comments he made earlier that evening on a get-out-the-vote call that sparked immediate backlash from many who interpreted them as referring to Trump supporters as “garbage.”
Harris tried on Tuesday to connect her personal story to how she’d lead the country – a reflection of the fact that many Americans still say they want to know more about the vice president, who’s running a campaign on an incredibly compressed timeframe, and her plans.
And while her speech didn’t deliver more policy specifics, she once again argued that her background – a child of immigrants who became a prosecutor – had prepared her to deliver on her promises.
“For as long as I can remember, I have always had an instinct to protect. There’s something about people being treated unfairly, or overlooked, that just gets to me,” Harris said. “It is what my mother instilled in me. A drive to hold accountable those who use their wealth or power to take advantage of other people.”",2024-10-29

CNN,"In race for Congress, Democrats burn through cash while outraising Republicans in final election sprint, new filings show | CNN Politics","Staring down the prospect of losing the Senate and amid a tight race for the House, Democrats are burning through cash in the final sprint to Election Day, new federal filings show.
The pre-general election reports, which cover the first sixteen days of October, are the last opportunity before November 5 to see just how much congressional campaigns have raised and spent. Democrats are defending a razor-thin majority in the Senate, while Republicans are trying to maintain their own narrow edge in the House.
In almost all the key races, Democratic candidates brought in more than their Republican opponents between October 1-16. At this point in the race, neither side has a significant overall cash-on-hand advantage, with campaigns spending all the resources they can to win.
With no clear leader in the presidential election according to the most recent CNN Poll of Polls, the battle for Congress will be crucial to determining whether Kamala Harris or Donald Trump will have a supportive first branch of government to help implement the new president’s policies.
Senate Democrats’ final stand
Democrats face daunting odds to retain their narrow Senate majority. With Republicans almost certain to flip West Virginia’s Senate seat, they would need Harris to win the White House while not losing any of the other seats held by Democratic senators or senators who caucus with the party.
But Senate Democrats have had a massive money advantage all cycle. According to a CNN analysis of campaign finance reports filed with the Federal Election Commission, Democratic candidates in Senate races rated as competitive by Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales have thoroughly outspent their Republican opponents.
With less than two weeks until Election Day and early voting well underway, Democratic Senate candidates in 10 key races – not counting Nebraska, where Democrats don’t have a nominee – spent about $76 million altogether in the first 16 days of October while raking in nearly $49 million, according to the latest filings. Republicans combined to raise about $28 million, while spending more than $39 million over 11 races. Those totals did not include Ohio GOP nominee Bernie Moreno, whose filings were not available on the FEC site as of publication time.
The most vulnerable Democratic incumbents are up for reelection in states that Trump twice carried comfortably – Jon Tester in Montana and Sherrod Brown in Ohio.
Brown raised $7.8 million between October 1 and 16, spent $7.9 million and entered the final two weeks of the campaign with $4.4 million in the bank. More than $500 million has been spent on the Ohio race through Thursday, the most of any Senate contest in 2024. Inside Elections currently rates the Ohio race as the only Toss-up on the Senate map.
In Montana, Tester, the last remaining Democrat in statewide elected office, raised more than $9 million in the first half of October, spent more than $12 million and had just over $4 million on hand for the final dash to Election Day. His Republican opponent, retired Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, raised nearly $2.4 million, spent $2.5 million and had a similar amount left to spend. Inside Elections rates the Senate race in Montana as Tilts Republican.
The battle for the House
In the 30 House races currently rated as Toss-ups or tiling toward one party by Inside Elections, Democratic candidates have combined to outspend their GOP opponents, $190 million to $117 million over the course of the cycle through October 16.
Three Democratic candidates – Alaska Rep. Mary Peltola, Washington Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, and Virginia challenger Eugene Vindman – have spent over $10 million on their campaigns. Peltola and Gluesenkamp Perez represent districts that would have backed Trump in 2020, and Vindman is running for a competitive seat outside Washington, DC.
The battle for the House majority could come down to nine fiercely contested seats in deep-blue California and New York, which were key to Republicans winning control of the chamber two years ago. In these seats alone, Democrats have outspent Republicans, $58 million to $43 million this cycle. In the pre-general election period, the Democratic candidates in these seats outspent their GOP opponents, on average, $1.7 million to $1.3 million, though the average Republicans began October 17 with a slight cash-on-hand advantage.
Big donors, big dollars
Hundreds of millions of dollars have already been spent in the battle for Congress, and ultrawealthy donors are still pouring money into super PACs.
Elon Musk donated $10 million to the Senate Leadership Fund, the GOP super PAC aligned with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Musk has already spent nearly $120 million on the presidential election through America PAC, the super PAC he helped form to support Trump. Senate Leadership Fund also received $5 million from hedge fund manager Paul Singer, and $2 million from investment banker Warren Stephens.
The fund’s Democratic counterpart, Senate Majority PAC, received a $25 million donation from Majority Forward, the group’s dark money nonprofit arm, which is not required to disclose its donors.
The Congressional Leadership Fund, the top House GOP super PAC, received another $2 million check from billionaire hedge fund manager Ken Griffin in October. Griffin, who hasn’t donated to Trump this cycle, has donated $16 million to the fund so far this cycle. The group also received $4.5 million from insurance executive Patrick Ryan and his wife, Shirley, as well as $2 million from Singer.
On the Democratic side, House Majority PAC received a $2 million donation from billionaire businessman and former 2020 presidential candidate Tom Steyer, $1.8 million from philanthropist Marilyn Simons and $1.1 million from the Sixteen Thirty Fund, a Democratic-aligned nonprofit that is not required to disclose its donors.
In Michigan, the Great Lakes Conservative Fund, which has spent over $20.5 million in the Senate race in support of Republican Mike Rogers, received $1.2 million in donations from the DeVos family – including $125,000 from Trump’s former Education secretary, Betsy DeVos.
And in Pennsylvania, Keystone Renewal PAC, which has spent $48 million supporting Republican nominee Dave McCormick, received another $1 million from Pennsylvania-based billionaire Jeff Yass.",2024-10-25
CNN,Analysis: Obama again feels the ‘fierce urgency of now’ as Trump eyes return to power | CNN Politics,"Several political lifetimes ago, Barack Obama followed Bruce Springsteen onstage at a huge rally beneath the Cleveland skyline and declared, “A rising is coming.”
That promise, riffing off one of the rock icon’s hits, came true days later, when Obama won the 2008 presidential election.
The band was back together Thursday night, in Georgia. The former president, now 63 and still the Democratic Party’s most compelling figure, and the Boss were trying to push Democratic nominee Kamala Harris over the line in the critical swing state.
Springsteen, before strumming “Land of Hope and Dreams,” declared that Harris “is running to be the 47th president of the United States. Donald Trump is running to be an American tyrant. He does not understand this country, its history or what it means to be deeply American.”
Obama seized on recent interviews in which John Kelly, the Republican nominee’s former White House chief of staff, described the 45th president as an aspiring dictator and said he’d expressed a desire to be served by generals like those who surrounded Adolf Hitler. Trump on Thursday denied the report. “I never said that,” he said in Las Vegas.
But Obama warned, “Just because he acts goofy does not mean his presidency wouldn’t be dangerous.” He went on: “I want to explain that in politics a good rule of thumb is – don’t say you want to do anything like Hitler. … But it is useful because it gives us a window into how Donald Trump thinks.”
Harris reminisced before the huge crowd in Clarkston, a suburb of Atlanta, about her trip to Obama’s first presidential campaign launch in Springfield, Illinois, in 2007.
“I went there to support this brilliant young senator who was running for president of the United States,” she said. “Millions of Americans were energized and inspired not only by Barack Obama’s message but by how he leads, seeking to unite rather than separate us.”
But the sense of imminent change dancing in the frigid air that February morning is missing this year in the grueling slog for every last vote, amid Democratic dread that Obama’s nemesis, Trump, is about to reclaim power.
And Obama’s return to center stage is raising the question of whether, 12 years after his last election win, he has the political muscle to take the once and possibly future president down.
Obama is fired up and ready to go
Obama is feeling “the fierce urgency of now” again. The 44th president is logging more miles on the campaign trail than at any point since leaving the White House nearly eight years ago. He’s implored voters from Pittsburgh to Tucson to Las Vegas to back Harris, and by week’s end, his campaign blitz will have touched down in all seven top battleground states.
“We do not need to see what an older, loonier Donald Trump looks like with no guardrails,” Obama said this week in Detroit. “America’s ready to turn the page. We’re ready for a better story.”
Trump is bristling at Obama’s savage mockery and has taken to claiming that the once-youthful prophet of hope is “exhausted” and “looking a bit older.” That’s rich coming from a 78-year-old about a gym rat rival.
But the nation’s first Black president, who once hailed his generation of voters as a “people of improbable hope,” is sounding far less optimistic as Americans prepare to render a verdict for the third straight time on Trump.
The controlled fury of his speech Thursday night and his intense engagement this week shows that November’s election is more than merely a race for Harris: It’s a battle that will show whether anyone is still listening to him.
It’s been said often that Obama’s legacy is on the line in this election – and it’s true that in a new term, Trump might take another dig at overturning the Affordable Care Act and eradicating the reforms in economic and climate policy that Obama’s onetime vice president, President Joe Biden, put into place as the next step of a Democratic project spanning parts of three decades.
This election may represent the final showdown between Obamaism – a racially diverse and multi-generational movement for grassroots change – and the backlash politics of Trumpism.
But even more than that, Obama these days is sounding desperate to convince his audiences that his life’s project – political change – is even possible and that democracy is still the vessel to effect it.
“Who you vote for matters, not because it’s going to change every problem we’ve got. No president, no vice president, no senator, no governor is going to solve every problem,” Obama said in Madison, Wisconsin, this week. “We’re not going to eliminate poverty overnight. We’re not going to change race relations right away. We’re born into history, and change takes time.”
The man who once told swooning crowds that “we are the change that we seek” delivered a far more pragmatic pitch, warning: “Sometimes I think we expect so much, and then we’re disappointed when everything’s not immediately solved.”
Obama’s voters are taking Harris on trust
Obama’s caustic roasts of Trump, his gift for framing the stakes of an election and the way he has made a far more compelling case for Harris’ election than she has yet managed for herself, shows that his political skills are undiminished. He is paying it forward in the same way former President Bill Clinton did in 2012 to help lift Obama’s reelection bid.
That’s helped his fans to accept Harris – only three years younger than Obama at 60 – as the next recipient of his torch.
Kristen Roland, a high school teacher from Oakland County, Michigan, was awash in nostalgia as she waited to see Obama in Detroit and wore a black 2008 campaign shirt to mark the moment.
“He instilled in America a hope that maybe didn’t exist before,” Roland said. “I think he set the stage for someone like Kamala coming in and maybe completing some of the promises that he made.” Roland doesn’t know if Harris can beat Trump in battleground Michigan but said she was more hopeful than at any point this election season when she saw thousands of people waiting in line to see Obama.
“If he trusts her,” Roland said, “other people should trust her, too.”
In the rallies, Obama makes an affirmative case for Harris, whom he first met two decades ago, but spends the bulk of his time making a defiant case against Trump.
He returns time and again to one of his classic lines: “Don’t boo, vote,” as he seeks to make sense of this moment.
“I get why people are looking to shake things up. I understand that, but what I cannot understand is why anybody would think that Donald Trump will shake things up in a way that is good for you, because there is absolutely no evidence that this man thinks about anybody, but himself,” Obama said Thursday night in Georgia, as he has at his other rallies for Harris.
Obama’s words carry his familiar lecturing tone, which is just fine with Janavus Davis, a Detroit barber, who came to see Obama to remember a now-passed political era.
Davis hears plenty of the skepticism about Harris but believes Obama’s message will allay any fears or concerns about electing the first female president.
“We still listen to him, that’s why all these people are here,” Davis said. “When he was the president, I felt like he kept the people calm. With Kamala now, it’s time for a Black woman. I think it’s possible. I think it should happen.”
Yet for all his political skills, Obama has sometimes been unable to transfer his idiosyncratic appeal to other leaders. He couldn’t make Hillary Clinton president despite campaigning for her in the final days of the 2016 race. And the fact that he is still the Democratic Party’s prominent political rock star, 16 years after his first election as president and eight years after handing over the White House to Trump, says as much about his party as it does about Obama’s aura.
Harris is facing a far more challenging environment than then-Sen. Obama encountered in 2008. He was the insurgent after an eight-year Republican presidency marred by George W. Bush’s failures in Iraq and New Orleans, which left the country desperate for change. This year’s Democratic nominee is an incumbent in an unpopular administration. Obama’s young voters intoxicated by hope in 2008 are entering middle age with the same struggles with high grocery prices and mortgage rates that Trump’s voters are experiencing. And while Springsteen is America’s poet of the working class, many blue-collar voters have deserted Democrats in recent elections for Trump’s populist GOP.
Then there’s the question of whether heavyweight endorsements from ex-presidents and celebrities like Springsteen – and Beyoncé, who will line up with Harris in the closing stretch – really make a difference. Springsteen is no political newbie – he headlined a massive rally for John Kerry in Madison, Wisconsin, in 2004, before the Democratic nominee lost to Bush. So while big event’s like Thursday flash back to the rock and political anthems of yesteryear, there’s no guarantee they work politically.
CNN political commentator and Republican operative David Urban, who choreographed Trump’s critical win in Pennsylvania in 2016, remembered a star-studded rally in Philadelphia for Clinton on election eve that year, with Obama, Springsteen and Jon Bon Jovi.
“The next day, guess what happened? We whooped Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania. … If I was (in Georgia), I might go hear Bruce Springsteen tonight, but I don’t think it matters squat for November 5,” Urban told CNN’s Erin Burnett.
Still, the likelihood that this election will be decided by thousands of votes in a few states means that even if Obama and Springsteen get a few people to the polls, it could make a difference. And the former president is about to be upstaged by the biggest political star in his family. Former first lady Michelle Obama – who has become a female icon – will campaign with Harris on Saturday in Michigan.
At this point, marquee events are more about driving a party’s voters to the polls than changing minds. That’s a message Obama learned 16 years ago. And he drummed it out Thursday in his first moments onstage.
“Go vote, return your absentee ballots,” he cried.",2024-10-25
CNN,Virginia city’s preelection fight over certification shows how local procedures have become a flashpoint | CNN Politics,"A lawsuit from two Republican officials in Waynesboro, Virginia, that threatened not to certify the 2024 election results attracted a counter lawsuit Monday from voters in the Shenandoah Valley city who are seeking a court order that would force the board to formalize the results.
The dispute — in which the Republican officials on the Waynesboro Board of Elections are demanding a hand-count of ballots before they certify the 2024 results — is just the latest example of how local certification procedures have become a hot spot for unsubstantiated election fraud claims since former President Donald Trump’s attempts to overturn his 2020 loss.
The Virginia lawsuits stand out, however, for how the local officials are threatening to not formalize the results — potentially gumming up the works for certifying the entire state vote — well before the final ballot has been cast.
The two Republican officials, election board Chair Curtis Lilly and Vice Chair Scott Mares filed their lawsuit on October 4 in the Waynesboro Circuit Court against state elections officials, alleging that the voting machines used in Virginia are unverifiable and could potentially be manipulated.
In response, five Waynesboro voters filed their own lawsuit against the local officials, asking that the Circuit Court step in to protect their rights “under the Virginia constitution to have their votes counted and certified.”
The voters alleged the GOP officials’ lawsuit was an “effort to spread distrust of voting machines, the use of which is expressly permitted by the Virginia Constitution.”
In their initial suit, the Waynesboro officials said there was “no way to ensure that the [voting] machine does not connect to the internet or present results inconsistent with the content of the ballot box.” They claimed in affidavits that, because they could not certify that “votes have been counted and apportioned correctly by voting machines,” they would “refuse to certify the 2024 election until such time as the legal regime permits for hand-counting ballots.”
Lilly and Mares are two of three Waynesboro election board members in a Republican-leaning city where the majority of votes went for Trump in 2020. Waynesboro is about 30 miles west of Charlottesville, Virginia.
The new lawsuit from the Waynesboro voters alleged, citing a news report, that one of the GOP officials got the idea to file a lawsuit from the attorney who is now representing them. That lawyer, Thomas Ranieri, said in a statement Tuesday that his clients “want to ensure that all voters’ votes are safely cast and accurately counted, which is something they cannot verify at the present.”
“This case is not primarily about machines or removing voters; it is primarily about whether my clients can verify an election’s integrity in good conscience and under their oath without making sure that the votes represented on the returns are true and accurate,” Ranieri said in the statement, adding that the officials would submit to what the court decides but that they would appeal any decisions they disagree with.
A spokesperson for the Virginia State Board of Elections did not reply to CNN’s inquiry. The office of state Attorney General Jason Miyares, a Republican, said it does not comment on ongoing litigation.
While the dispute arises from a rural county in a state not seen as a key battleground in the presidential race, it shows how the once unheralded processes of election administration have become flashpoints in the fallout from 2020 election subversion schemes.
During that election, officials in Wayne County, Michigan, briefly balked at certifying the results in that jurisdiction, which includes the heavily Democratic Detroit, amid a relentless campaign by Trump to claim without proof that the election was rife with fraud. The officials eventually formalized the vote count.
“Certifying elections has not been an issue in the past. It has historically been a formality that marks the end of the vote-counting process,” Lauren Miller Karalunas, a senior counsel at the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s law school, told CNN. “But in 2020, that changed when we saw refusals to certify the results after the election. This is an escalation of that, where we are seeing threats of refusal to certify an election even before the election has occurred.”
Elections since have featured similar, albeit less high-profile, local squabbles over certification. The refusal by Republican officials in Cochise County, Arizona, to certify the 2022 midterms by the legal deadline resulted in criminal charges, with one of the two charged officials entering a guilty plea this week in the case and the other set to face trial next month.
Fights over the certification of election results have already become a hallmark of the 2024 contest, with battleground Georgia contending with a growing legal drama over new state election rules that Democrats say could allow local officials to delay or decline altogether certification of this year’s results.
The officials in the key presidential states targeted in Trump’s 2020 gambits have been preparing strategies to head off local-level certification fights.

CNN,The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2024 | CNN Politics,"While events on the other side of the world – and the other end of the US Capitol – have dominated recent news, the race for control of the Senate is a crucial factor in what Washington could look like after next year’s elections.
The 2024 Senate map is advantageous for Republicans as they try to pick up the one or two seats needed to flip the chamber, depending on who wins the White House next year. Members of the Senate Democratic Caucus are defending the most competitive seats – the top eight on this list of 10 seats most likely to flip – which is not likely to change ahead of November 2024.
The order of the ranking, however, is changing. (Rankings are based on CNN’s reporting, fundraising figures and historical data about how states and candidates have performed.) Pennsylvania, for example, shoots up from No. 7 in July to No. 4 this month – in large part because it’s the one battleground where Republicans aren’t facing a messy primary.
GOP candidate fields elsewhere have only grown over the past couple of months, despite the National Republican Senatorial Committee’s new policy of taking sides in primaries. Besides Pennsylvania, the national party has made its preference known for specific candidates in West Virginia, Montana, Nevada and Michigan. The NRSC is neutral in Ohio’s crowded primary and hasn’t ruled out endorsing in Arizona.
Whether engaging in primaries early on will pay off remains to be seen. So far, however, NRSC Chairman Steve Daines’ tactic of keeping Donald Trump close appears to be working, as the former president hasn’t yet endorsed against any of the campaign committee’s picks.
The GOP presidential front-runner – with his four criminal indictments – is likely to be a liability in some places next year if he is the party’s nominee. But Republicans take comfort in the fact that he won the top three states on this list handily in 2020 and red-state Democrats will have to run with an unpopular President Joe Biden atop the ticket. In an era of increasingly nationalized politics, it’s becoming harder to run for Senate in a state that voted for the opposite party’s presidential nominee. In Democrats’ favor, however, Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, Jon Tester of Montana and Sherrod Brown of Ohio have succeeded at it before.
Vulnerable Democratic senators will try to distance themselves from Biden where they can or try to signal that they represent a check on the White House. For example, six of them (plus independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who caucuses with Democrats) recently joined a bipartisan call to the secretary of state to freeze $6 billion in Iranian assets after Hamas’ attack on Israel – even though the administration has made clear that the money hasn’t been touched, has strict restrictions around it and the US hasn’t found a direct link between Iran and the Hamas attack.
It’s too early to say whether current events – especially abroad – could have any impact on elections that are still over a year away, but with the GOP-led House paralyzed without a speaker and Congress being called upon to approve aid to Israel and Ukraine, the moment has underscored how congressional contests have very real consequences.
Here’s where things stand in the race for the Senate just over a year before Election Day 2024:
1. West Virginia
Incumbent: Democrat Joe Manchin
West Virginia remains the seat most likely to change party hands next year, whatever Sen. Joe Manchin does. The most conservative Democrat in the Senate – who hasn’t ruled out running as an independent for reelection or for president – Manchin isn’t expected to announce his plans until the end of this year. He raised $715,000 in the July-to-September third quarter – enough to maintain appearances that he’ll be a candidate next year. The haul is also more than what either of his major GOP opponents raised but about half a million less than his previous quarter total. (The chances of this seat flipping only go up if Manchin declines to seek a third full term.)
Even if he runs without the “D” after his name, he’ll have an uphill battle in a state Trump won by 39 points in 2020. His vulnerability is apparent in the way GOP-affiliated ads are tying him to Biden and Democratic-aligned spots are tying him to Trump. One Nation, for example, has attacked him over his support of Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, while Duty and Honor PAC has touted Manchin’s work with Trump to protect miners’ pensions.
The immediate fight, however, is the GOP primary, where Jim Justice, the popular Democrat-turned-Republican governor, has outraised Rep. Alex Mooney by about $300,000. While national Republicans and Trump are behind Justice, the Club for Growth and an allied super PAC have committed nearly $13.6 million to the House Freedom Caucus member. The club’s political arm is airing ads calling Justice a RINO, or Republican in Name Only, and trying to tie him to Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell.
2. Montana
Incumbent: Democrat Jon Tester
Sen. Jon Tester, another red-state Democrat, is no stranger to tough races. But the most pressing question is whether GOP Rep. Matt Rosendale – fresh off his vote to oust House Speaker Kevin McCarthy – decides to complicate national Republicans’ plans by mounting his own bid to avenge his 2018 loss to Tester. The NRSC likes retired Navy SEAL Tim Sheehy, who already has the backing of the two other members of Montana’s congressional delegation (including Daines, the NRSC chairman) and Gov. Greg Gianforte. Sheehy, who entered the race in July, raised $2.9 million in the most recent fundraising quarter (including about $653,000 in personal money), but he’s a relative newcomer. (The Minnesota native has taken heat, for example, for saying in a Breitbart News interview that there were more bears than people in Montana.)
Rosendale, too, has out-of-state roots, and his House campaign only brought in about $335,000 during the third quarter. But as a previous statewide candidate – he was elected state auditor in 2016 and lost to Tester by about 4 points in 2018 – he starts with more built-in name recognition than Sheehy and could potentially benefit from assistance from the Club for Growth. Sheehy has been on air trying to introduce himself, leaning heavily into his military service and using ranching motifs to highlight his ties to the state. He’s also been attacking Tester for not adhering to some of the commitments in an ethics pledge he ran on during his first campaign, as CNN’s KFile reported.
An outside group called Last Best Place PAC, seemingly linked to Democrats, is attacking Sheehy – a sign Democrats may think he’d be a tougher opponent than Rosendale. Tester appears to be taking the race seriously – he raised more than $5 million in the third quarter and ended September with $13 million.
3. Ohio
Incumbent: Democrat Sherrod Brown
Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is gearing up for a tough race in a state that’s been trending red over the past decade. (He raised $5.8 million in the third quarter, ending the period with $11.2 million.) He’ll need all the money he can get if he faces one of the two self-funders vying for the GOP nomination. Both businessman Bernie Moreno and state Sen. Matt Dolan loaned their campaigns $3 million in the third quarter. Secretary of State Frank LaRose – who raised about $1 million, including $250,000 he loaned his campaign – doesn’t have the same kinds of personal resources, but he likely starts with a name ID advantage as the only statewide elected official in the GOP race. He became the public face of an August ballot effort to raise the threshold for amending the state constitution – seen as a proxy fight over an upcoming November referendum on abortion rights. LaRose admitted the measure was effectively about abortion, so the effort’s failure has been a point of attack from his primary opponents.
Trump carried Ohio twice, and his backing proved instrumental in getting now-Sen. JD Vance over the finish line in last year’s Republican primary, which also featured Dolan and, briefly, Moreno. Vance is backing Moreno in this primary, and while Trump has praised Moreno, he hasn’t made any endorsement yet. The NRSC is so far staying neutral in this race. The candidates met for their first forum last weekend, where US aid to Ukraine was a point of divergence between Moreno – who, like Vance, wants to suspend it – and Dolan, who wants it to continue. (LaRose called for making aid contingent on securing the US southern border.)
Meanwhile, Brown has been on the picket line with striking United Auto Workers – underscoring the economic populist streak that Democrats hope will allow him to defy the political tilt of his state once again.
4. Pennsylvania
Incumbent: Democrat Bob Casey
The Keystone State moves up several spots this month largely because of how uniquely settled the GOP primary is compared with other battleground states. Republicans coalesced around Dave McCormick to take on Democratic Sen. Bob Casey soon after the former hedge fund executive got into the race in late September. (State Sen. Doug Mastriano announced in May that he was passing on a bid – a major relief for national Republicans who were wary of the failed 2022 gubernatorial candidate and election denier.)
But Democrats think McCormick, who unsuccessfully sought the state’s other Senate seat last year, has his own baggage. He tried to tack to the right in an effort to secure Trump’s endorsement and the GOP nomination in the 2022 Senate primary, which could alienate some suburban Philadelphia voters in a general election. He’s also facing questions about his residency. McCormick insists that he lives in Pennsylvania but returns to Connecticut to visit his daughter, who’s still in school there and lives with his ex-wife. “And if there’s a political cost associated with that, so be it,” he recently told ABC27’s “This Week in Pennsylvania.”
Still, the combination of McCormick and his vast personal resources during a presidential year are likely to make this Casey’s most competitive Senate race yet. The three-term incumbent, who raised $3.2 million in the third quarter, has a well-known political name in the state and enjoys a 48% job approval (and 31% disapproval) rating, according to a Quinnipiac University poll released earlier this month. He led McCormick 50% to 44% among registered voters in that survey, but this race is still young.
5. Arizona
Incumbent: Independent Kyrsten Sinema
Kari Lake – who embraced election denialism and conspiracy theories in her losing 2022 gubernatorial bid – was far from Republicans’ dream Senate candidate in this emerging purple state. But the former TV anchor is going to be hard to beat in a primary given her strong connection with the GOP base. Trump endorsed her by video at her announcement rally earlier this month, and there are signs that the party establishment is trying to keep her close. “We have not ruled out endorsing Lake,” a source familiar with the NRSC’s strategy told CNN. Daines has said the national party has had “productive conversations” with Lake, who recently told The Associated Press she’d vote for McConnell for leader. She’s also picked up the backing of Senate GOP Conference Chairman John Barrasso.
But Lake still won’t admit she lost last year’s gubernatorial race and her past hard-line positions on abortion could turn off swing voters. Her candidacy represents a familiar challenge for Arizona Republicans, whose recent nominees for key offices swung right in the primary and then struggled to pivot to the general election. Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb is also running for Senate, but raised just $475,000 in the third quarter.
The race will remain unsettled, however, until Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, who left the Democratic Party to become an independent last year, announces whether she’s running. Her $825,000 haul in the third quarter raised questions about her future, given that it was less than what she’s raised in the past. But Sinema still had more than $10 million in the bank as of September 30. Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego, meanwhile, outraised her yet again – bringing in $3.1 million last quarter – but had about half of her cash on hand.
6. Nevada
Incumbent: Democrat Jacky Rosen
Nevada is a slightly more Democratic state than most on this list, although that’s not saying much. It voted for Biden by about 2 points, so Democrats aren’t taking Sen. Jacky Rosen’s reelection for granted. She raised $2.7 million in the third quarter, ending with $8.8 million in the bank.
National Republicans have made clear their preference for retired Army Capt. Sam Brown, an unsuccessful 2022 Senate candidate who’s trying to tie Rosen to Biden and his economic policies. But that hasn’t winnowed the GOP field. Trump’s former ambassador to Iceland, Jeff Gunter, entered the race in August and has cut an ad that refers to him as “110% pro-Trump.” Retired Air Force Lt. Col. Tony Grady, who lost a GOP primary bid for lieutenant governor last year, also jumped into the race in August. Former state Assemblyman Jim Marchant, an election denier and the losing 2022 GOP nominee for Nevada secretary of state, only raised $74,000 last quarter, compared with $1.2 million for Brown.
The primary isn’t until June, but Democrats are already seizing on what they see as vulnerabilities in Brown’s abortion positioning, including comments he made during a 2014 run for the Texas state legislature and his past work with the Nevada Faith and Freedom Coalition.
7. Wisconsin
Incumbent: Democrat Tammy Baldwin
Wisconsin slides down one spot on this list, in part because Republicans still don’t have a major candidate to take on Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin. That doesn’t mean this race won’t eventually be very competitive in a battleground presidential state that swung from Trump to Biden in 2020.
Republicans are eyeing businessman and 2012 Senate candidate Eric Hovde, who would likely have the ability to self-fund. Baldwin raised $3.1 million during the third quarter and began October with about $6.9 million in the bank. This is one of the few states where presidential performance isn’t necessarily indicative of Senate race outcomes. GOP Sen. Ron Johnson, for example, won a third term last year after Biden had carried the state, albeit by only about half a point, two years earlier.
8. Michigan
Incumbent: Democrat Debbie Stabenow (retiring)
Michigan is a bluer state than its Midwestern neighbor Wisconsin – Biden carried the Wolverine State by nearly 3 points and Democrats saw success up and down the ticket in 2022, in part because abortion was such a galvanizing issue. Democrats are now trying to ensure that retiring Sen. Debbie Stabenow’s seat remains in their hands. Much of the party has coalesced around Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who raised nearly $3 million in the third quarter, although she does face primary challenges, including from actor Hill Harper, who raised about $559,000 and kicked in about $463,000 more of his own money.
Republicans landed a prominent recruit in former Rep. Mike Rogers, who succeeded Stabenow in the House and represented an earlier version of Slotkin’s Lansing-area seat for seven terms. Rogers, who raised $824,00 in the third quarter after entering the race in September, earned immediate praise from the NRSC as the “type of candidate who can perform well with suburban Michiganders.” And although the former House Intelligence chairman may use his recent absence from elected politics as a selling point, the GOP has changed a lot since he left Congress in 2015 – especially in Michigan, where the state party has a controversial new chair.
Since entering the race, Rogers has already landed a primary challenge from former Detroit Police Chief James Craig, who was disqualified from last year’s governor’s race over signature issues. Former Rep. Peter Meijer, who has formed an exploratory committee, could still run – although the one-term congressman isn’t likely to curry much favor with the GOP base after voting to impeach Trump in 2021.
9. Texas
Incumbent: Republican Ted Cruz
Texas is a hard state for Democrats to flip – they haven’t won a statewide election here since 1994, their longest losing streak in the country. But GOP Sen. Ted Cruz makes a good villain for national Democrat donors. (See Beto O’Rourke’s massive 2018 fundraising hauls in his closer-than-expected loss to the senator.)
The question, however, is whether that grassroots Democratic opposition to Cruz can translate widely enough to deny him a third term. Democratic Rep. Colin Allred, who has already proved to be a strong fundraiser, brought in $4.7 million in the third quarter – more than Cruz’s $3.1 million. Democrats tout the former NFL player’s background as a good fit for Texas – he first won election to the House by flipping a GOP-held district in the Dallas area and has previously won support from the US Chamber of Commerce.
But although Allred already appears focused on Cruz, he’ll have to get through a crowded primary first. Among the other candidates is state Sen. Roland Guttierez, who represents Uvalde and raised $632,000 in the third quarter.
10. Florida
Incumbent: Republican Rick Scott
Former Democratic Rep. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell announced her campaign to take on GOP Sen. Rick Scott in late August. Despite only being in the race for part of the third quarter, she narrowly outraised the first-term senator and former governor – $1.5 million to $1.4 million. Scott gave his campaign an additional $154,000 of his own money, and there’s plenty more where that came from for the wealthy former health care CEO.
Florida has been trending red in recent years – Trump carried the state by about 3 points in 2020, nearly tripling his margin from four years earlier. But each of Scott’s races for governor and Senate have been relatively close, and he’s never run in a presidential year. Democrats have targeted him over some of his more unpopular policy proposals – such as a sunset provision for all federal programs, which he later revised to exclude Social Security and Medicare after criticism from within his own party. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, for example, has been running digital ads casting Scott and Cruz as threats to popular entitlement programs.
Even with Democratic investment, though, it’s going to take a lot to flip this seat blue. The state’s senior senator, Republican Marco Rubio, won reelection last year over a high-profile Democratic opponent by 16 points.",2023-10-22
CNN,"If you’ve been seeing more pro-Harris ads online lately, here’s why | CNN Politics","Democrats are mounting an unprecedented digital advertising campaign in the closing weeks of the presidential race, pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into a targeted effort that the party hopes will tip the balance in one of the closest elections in US history.
The effort is being steered by Future Forward PAC, or FF PAC, the largest single-candidate super PAC in the 2024 election. And the group is breaking from traditional political advertising by focusing half of its $450 million budget on digital platforms – including what it says is the largest political ad buy in YouTube history – crafting highly targeted content to capture and hold the attention of voters.
FF PAC’s approach, particularly in the campaign’s final weeks, has emphasized digital advertising aimed at non-political audiences, including younger voters, especially younger women, Black voters, Latino voters and other key demographics that Vice President Kamala Harris will need to form a winning coalition.
Super PACs are prohibited from directly coordinating with the campaigns they support. But leveraging its scale, FF PAC has produced and tested more than 1,000 unique ads, locking in on the economy and abortion as top messaging priorities. And in the closing stretch, the group is advising Democrats not to overemphasize attacks on Donald Trump’s character and fitness for office – such as recent messaging by the Harris campaign calling the former president a fascist – and remain focused on voters’ pocketbooks and reproductive rights.
The group’s staggering war chest is funded by some of the Democratic Party’s wealthiest supporters, taking advantage of loose campaign finance regulations that allow outside groups like FF PAC to raise and spend unlimited sums as they work to influence the outcome of elections.
It’s an effort that reflects some of the key dynamics at play in the 2024 race, characterized by big money, transforming media and analytics-driven campaigning. And countering Democrats is a network of Republican groups that are also breaking new ground in the American political arena.
Next week’s election will be a test for the powerhouse FF PAC and its digital investment, measuring the efficacy of some of the most cutting-edge tools and tactics available to modern campaigns.
FF PAC’s role this cycle
The Supreme Court’s 2010 decision in Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission transformed US elections, opening the floodgates to groups like FF PAC, which were allowed to accept unlimited contributions from wealthy megadonors and faced no limits on the amount they could spend influencing campaigns.
In the years since, those groups have proliferated and dominated political advertising, driving the cost of US elections to new heights. The 2024 election is poised to break the record set by the 2020 election and see $10.2 billion worth of campaign advertising, according to the ad tracking firm AdImpact.
Out of the large universe of outside groups, the Biden-Harris ticket selected FF PAC in July 2023 as its officially endorsed super PAC for the 2024 campaign. The group has taken on an unprecedented role in this year’s White House race, centralizing Democratic outside efforts in marked contrast to the balkanized network of pro-Trump outside groups.
From the start of 2023 through October 16, the end of the most recent FEC reporting period, FF PAC reported raising $394 million and spending $373 million – including $38 million before President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the race in late July. An aide with the group said its budget for the condensed general election between Harris and Trump totaled $450 million, primarily targeting seven key battleground states: Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia.
The group has received a substantial portion of its funding from a Democratic dark money hub, Future Forward USA Action, which, as a nonprofit 501(c)(4) organization, faces no requirements to disclose its donors and is able to contribute huge sums to super PACs like FF PAC. Among those donors is billionaire former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who gave $50 million to the dark money network this year.
FF PAC had reported receiving $128 million from its dark money parent organization through October 16. Top-named donors to FF PAC include Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, who has given $38 million; LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, who has given more than $10 million; and Bloomberg, who has also given $19 million directly to FF PAC in publicly disclosed contributions.
The ad laboratory
With its massive war chest, FF PAC has faced the challenge of effectively and efficiently distributing its resources. Part of its response has been operating a massive advertising laboratory, at an unprecedented scale. The group has produced and tested more than 1,000 unique ads and measured their effectiveness at moving voters. And after surveying voters watching the ads, the group has honed in on messaging about the economy and abortion.
It’s a focus that the super PAC is urging Democrats to mirror as Harris delivers her closing message. An October 25 email from the FF PAC to Democrats with advice on messaging contained this cautionary note: “How effective is attacking Trump for being a fascist? This topic is not as persuasive as contrast messages featuring Harris’s economic plans, and her promise to protect reproductive rights.”
Those lines of attack – focused on Trump’s character and citing criticism from former administration officials – have featured prominently in late advertising coming from the Harris campaign, such as a spot that began airing over the weekend and included audio of Trump’s onetime chief of staff, retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, telling The New York Times that the former president “certainly falls into the general definition of a fascist.”
Appearing Monday on CNN, Harris campaign spokesperson Ian Sams responded to FF PAC’s argument, saying that “the American people are capable of processing numerous things at once, and there are a lot of people who have a lot of different concerns about the country and the future.”
As part of its strategy, FF PAC has launched waves of ads that feature the candidate discussing tax policy. The group had received positive feedback about ads that include Harris speaking, as opposed to the dramatic narrators who often accompany political spots.
Voter testimonials are another key tactic, and FF PAC has produced dozens of spots that feature voters reacting disapprovingly to clips of Trump praising his “rich as hell” donors, a sustained line of attack.
Additionally, reflecting its effort to reach key groups such as young women, FF PAC has run ads on TikTok targeting the “MomTok” audience, touting Harris’ proposals to “cut taxes for families, up to $6,000 for your family.”
The super PAC’s ads have also emphasized abortion rights, a top issue for Democratic voters that is contributing to a yawning political gender divide. Many of those ads feature women and medical professionals warning against abortion restrictions and criticizing Trump, who appointed three of the five Supreme Court justices who voted with the majority to overturn Roe v.

A digital focus
Amid a transformed media landscape in 2024, TV advertising still draws the most dollars. Out of nearly $2.9 billion spent on advertising for the presidential race since the start of 2023, more than $2.2 billion has gone toward TV ads, according to data from AdImpact. FF PAC is spending hundreds of millions on TV, too, but it’s on digital platforms that the group hopes to make its mark.
“Our program has been about reaching voters where they are and on the screens they use,” Margit Westerman, FF PAC’s digital director, said in a statement. “That means a surround-sound approach where people see it while watching their favorite streaming show, looking at the latest YouTube clip and visiting their go-to website. We spent months understanding where people were and we’ve found the content that is persuasive as long as we make sure people see it.”
That includes a $44 million YouTube buy, targeting an audience that skews young and diverse. And the campaign has targeted high-profile live events, beginning with the Olympics late this summer and including the NFL’s “Sunday Ticket” through Election Day.
FF PAC has also bought ad time on popular gaming platforms such as Unity and Frameplay, targeting younger male voters, a key area of concern for the Harris campaign. And straining to reach screens, FF PAC also bought ad time on premium streaming TV platforms, including Hulu, Disney, Peacock, WB/Discovery/Max, and Univision. (Warner Bros./Discovery is the parent company of CNN.)
The group estimates it has delivered 3.71 billion high-quality video impressions so far. And it has done so by paying a premium: Many of FF PAC’s 30-second TV ads have 15- and 6-second versions designed for digital platforms’ unskippable slots.
On traditional TV too, FF PAC has been creative with its resources, spending millions on national ad buys that – while airing everywhere – still represent a cheaper way to reach swing states than buying ad time from local stations getting slammed in the race’s final sprint.
GOP countereffort
FF PAC’s commitment to digital advertising has enabled the group to blitz its Republican counterparts on leading platforms during the final weeks of the race.
In the first week of October, FF PAC spent $6.7 million advertising on Google and its affiliated platforms, including YouTube, while the leading pro-Trump advertiser spent about $1.5 million. The following week, FF PAC ramped its spending up to nearly $9 million, while the leading pro-Trump advertiser spent about $1.2 million. During the third week of October, FF PAC spent $10.5 million, while the largest pro-Trump advertiser spent about $2 million; and during the fourth week, FF PAC led with $12.3 million on Google platforms, while the top GOP advertiser spent $3.5 million.
While FF PAC has a singular role as the leading pro-Harris super PAC, Republicans have taken a divergent approach, deploying a network of large super PACs that each take on a share of the pro-Trump messaging.
Five of the largest groups – MAGA Inc., Preserve America, America PAC, Restoration PAC and Right For America PAC – have combined to raise $718 million and spend $709 million from the beginning of 2023 through mid-October. The largest, MAGA Inc., reported spending about $113 million before Trump had secured the GOP presidential nomination.
Each group has devoted a share of its spending to digital advertising, but FF PAC had exceeded their combined spending on Google platforms through October 27, $37.7 million to $11.4 million. On Facebook over the past 30 days, those pro-Trump groups collectively led FF PAC, about $4.8 million to $2.3 million (including about $700,000 in ad spending from a MAGA Inc. merchandise site).
One of the pro-Trump groups, America PAC, has received nearly $120 million from Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, and it has also taken an iconoclastic approach to its spending – though its efforts have differed from FF PAC’s.
Musk’s group has probed the limits of weakening campaign finance enforcement – including daily giveaways of $1 million that have drawn scrutiny from the Department of Justice and are the target of a civil lawsuit from the Philadelphia district attorney. America PAC is also engaged in an unprecedented on-the-ground effort, devoting more than $70 million to canvassing and field operations in battleground states, a huge lift for the Trump campaign.
Part of that is out of necessity – the former president’s campaign has been dramatically outraised by Harris’ team, leaving the Democratic nominee with significantly more campaign cash to spend on staff, door-knocking, phone banking and other turnout efforts.
FF PAC has not engaged in a comparable turnout effort, leaving that traditional campaign activity to the cash-flush Harris operation. But the super PAC is betting that its innovative and unprecedented digital advertising program will help Harris close what’s shaping up to be one of the closest elections in the country’s history.",2024-10-30
CNN,Fact check: Four deceptive quotes in Trump’s wildly misleading new television ad | CNN Politics,"On Friday, we published an article about how former President Donald Trump’s campaign has made a habit of deceptively using quotations in television ads attacking Vice President Kamala Harris.
Then, just days later, the campaign released perhaps the most egregious example yet.
A new minute-long ad revives two of the quote distortions from previous Trump ads – and sprinkles in two more for good measure. Here is a fact check.
Cutting out key words about Harris and taxes
The new ad cuts out critical words from a news article about Harris’ tax proposals.
The ad, like a previous Trump ad, features the following on-screen text attributed to an August article in The New York Times: “Harris is seeking to significantly raise taxes.” But as the Times itself has noted, this is a misleading snip. What the Times article actually said was this: “Harris is seeking to significantly raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans and large corporations.”
That’s a big difference.
The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this article. For the Friday article on the campaign’s misleading use of quotations, the campaign declined to address any of the specific examples we raised; instead, spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said, “President Trump has the hardest-hitting, most well produced ads in the business.”
Cutting out a key word about Harris and the border
The new ad also deletes a crucial word from a news article about immigration policy.
The ad features the following on-screen text the ad attributes to a CBS News piece in September: “Harris vows to keep Biden’s border.” The text is accompanied by a narrator saying, falsely, that “Kamala was in charge of his open-border policies.”
But what the CBS News article’s headline actually said was this: “Harris vows to keep Biden’s border crackdown: ‘The United States is a sovereign nation.’” The article began: “During a visit to the U.S.-Mexico border on Friday, Vice President Kamala Harris vowed to keep President Biden’s asylum crackdown in place if elected, solidifying Democrats’ embrace of more stringent immigration rules.”
Taking an immigration quote out of context
The ad features on-screen text that says, “welfare for illegals,” attributing those words to an NBC News article from 2018.
But as we noted when a previous Trump ad featured similar on-screen text, that NBC News article did not even mention Biden or Harris, whose administration did not begin until 2021. And the article used the phrase “welfare for illegal immigrants” only in passing – in a totally different context than the Trump ad uses it.
The article criticized occupational licensing rules that were preventing immigrants enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program from working in certain jobs. It said: “It’s a complete travesty that otherwise qualified individuals can’t get the government’s permission to cut hair. Regardless of one’s position on welfare for illegal immigrants, a license is clearly different from food stamps and other government safety nets.”
Taking a quote about national security out of context
The new ad features giant on-screen text with the words “global war,” attributing them to a July article by the media outlet Axios, as the ad’s narrator says, “Their weakness invited wars.”
But the Axios article did not claim there is “global war” under the Biden administration. The article was headlined, “U.S. not ready for global war, commission warns”; it was about a bipartisan commission’s findings about the country’s preparedness for hypothetical future conflict, not about the present situation.",2024-10-29
CNN,Huge fundraising powers Democrats’ hopes to flip the House | CNN Politics,"Rep. Cindy Axne, the last Democrat standing in Iowa, went to her party’s leadership about a month before the 2022 midterms to ask for a few hundred thousand more dollars in her race, or risk losing her seat.
The money didn’t come, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions, and Axne lost the Des Moines-based seat by around 2,000 votes — one of nearly two dozen close House races that cost Democrats their majority that year.
Now, that cash crunch is a distant memory and Democrats are in striking distance of not one, but two red-tinted seats in Iowa. Vice President Kamala Harris, who raised a stunning $1 billion in three months, has fueled a fundraising revolution this cycle that is changing the game for down-ballot Democrats and deeply troubling GOP leaders. House Democrats are so flush with cash that they are seriously competing on red-tinted turf in places like Iowa and Wisconsin that were trending away from the party just a few years ago.
The Democrats’ inroads in the Midwest are on top of the dozen-plus GOP-held seats in New York and California that were already the epicenter of the battle of House control. Democrats’ huge summertime war chests have expanded that battlefield as party leaders seek every possible path to victory. Republicans have had to buckle down on defense, keeping them from truly competing in once-feasible places like southwestern Connecticut, the Nevada suburbs and southeastern Pennsylvania.
“When excitement and energy happens, then the money follows,” said Christina Bohannan, the Democrat running in the neighboring Iowa district who has shattered fundraising records in her increasingly competitive rematch against GOP Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks. Bohannan not only outraised Miller-Meeks in the last quarter, but outspent the GOP incumbent by almost a 3-to-1 margin. And Democrats are planning to spend even more there in the final weeks.
The GOP is taking the threat seriously: House Speaker Mike Johnson will head to the district this week, followed by Majority Leader Steve Scalise, Majority Whip Tom Emmer and Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders later this month, according to a person familiar with the planning.
“People are just fired up,” Bohannan, the Democrat, told CNN. “We had a great message in 2022 but we didn’t have quite as much resources there to get that message out.”
But money alone won’t determine which party controls Congress. While Democrats need to net just four seats to flip the House, voters’ focus on issues like the border and the economy means that the political climate still favors the GOP. And there’s the Trump factor: Former President Donald Trump continues to do better among Hispanic voters and working class voters, fueling GOP hopes of flipping seats near the US-Mexico border and in rural Alaska and Maine.
“There is no candidate in modern history, Democrat or Republican, who turns out voters more effectively than President Trump,” Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, the House Republican Conference chairwoman, told CNN.
What is certain is that whichever party wins the House battle is almost guaranteed to face another razor-thin margin — making it all but impossible to govern for another two years.
Republicans’ cash crunch
In the final three week stretch, Republicans say it’s the Democrats’ cash advantage that’s keeping them up at night.
Out of the 32 most competitive House seats, all but two Republicans were outraised by Democrats in the most recent quarter, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission made public Tuesday. (The two GOP exceptions were Republican Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia and Rep. Michelle Steel of California.)
All but six of the Democrats broke the $2 million mark, and some pulled in far more.
In a competitive open seat in central Virginia, the GOP candidate Derrick Anderson brought in $1.1 million — putting him in the upper echelon of House Republican fundraisers this year. But the Democrat in the race, Eugene Vindman, raised an astounding $6.5 million. That allowed him to outspend his GOP opponent by almost 11 to 1.
Then there is Democrat Will Rollins, with a $3.6 million haul against long-time Republican Rep. Ken Calvert in southern California, and Democrat Amish Shah, who’s challenging Arizona GOP Rep. David Schweikert, who brought in $3.45 million. Both GOP incumbents are now in more danger than Republicans believe they should be.
Elon Musk’s super PAC recently spent big for Calvert, while Trump himself stumped for Calvert in the desert town of Coachella, California, over the weekend.
Rollins described his own fundraising as “higher than we ever thought imaginable.” And he described Trump’s visit as a last chance move to save Calvert. But, he predicted: “I don’t think they’re going to end up having the resources to do it. That’s why I ultimately think we’re going to win.”
Across the country, senior Democratic Rep. Ann Kuster of New Hampshire recently drove through Pennsylvania stumping for Democratic candidate Janelle Stelson, whose fundraising haul tripled that of her GOP opponent Rep. Scott Perry, the former House Freedom Caucus chairman.
“It’s insane. It’s like Senate numbers,” said Kuster, who is retiring this year after 12 years in a New Hampshire swing seat. “I never had a million dollar quarter. And now all of the candidates are having million-dollar quarters.”
Top Republicans have been forced to respond: The GOP leadership-aligned super PAC, Congressional Leadership Fund, this week announced a $2.6 million buy to help defend Perry in a seat that Trump won by nearly 5 points.
In another “reach” seat, Democrats raised so much against Steel that Republicans moved money out of a highly competitive open seat in Orange County to help protect the GOP congresswoman. And the Republican group is even beginning to spend in an open Colorado seat that Trump won by 8 points.
A ‘tsunami’ of Democratic dollars
One incumbent, Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, said he could lose his race because of the “tsunami” of money that Harris and her allies have dumped into his seat because of its unique status as a stand-alone electoral vote.
“That’s my number one issue right now, how we’re being outspent at the top of the ticket,” Bacon said, noting that Harris is spending $21 million on messaging in his district, compared to about $100,000 from Trump.
“I wish he’d put some stuff on the airwaves, show people why they need to vote for him. It helps everybody down-ballot,” Bacon said, adding: “I think the other side holds every ace right now, but we’re in the fight.”
Two years ago, Bacon’s challenger, state Sen. Tony Vargas. was outspent 3 to 1 by GOP super PAC groups. This time, Democrats have the money to keep up.
“Because we have these resources, now we have been able to battle back,” Vargas told CNN.
While Trump has been focused on his own race, Johnson and his leadership team — including campaign chief, Rep. Richard Hudson of North Carolina — have been making urgent pleas to fellow Republicans for last-minute cash.
But it’s too late to match one key Democratic advantage: The party went up on TV early in GOP-held seats, forcing Republican outside groups to respond in those places and narrow their own offensive opportunities. As a result, GOP groups decided not to compete in once-competitive turf, such as the seats of Democratic Reps. Angie Craig in Minnesota, Nikki Budzinski in Illinois, and Hillary Scholten in Michigan.
“(The money) is definitely sounding the alarm bells,” one senior House GOP aide told CNN. “It’s been very hard to keep up with. If we lose seats, I think that will be a defining part of the post mortem.”
With fewer of his own members on defense, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and his party jumped into some long-shot races that would have been unthinkable earlier this summer. House Majority PAC is now competing in tougher races like those of Perry in Pennsylvania, Ryan Zinke in Montana and Monica De La Cruz in Texas.
Zinke himself put out an urgent fundraising call this month, warning supporters in a text: “If I don’t do a total 180 on the fundraising front, not only will I lose my House seat, Republicans may never hold the majority in Congress again.”
Zinke raised $2 million but was still narrowly outraised by his Democratic challenger, Monica Tranel. Trump won the seat by 7 points last cycle.
Trump’s strength keeps GOP’s hopes alive
Democrats need to flip several seats in two key states to have a shot at retaking the House: New York and California. These roughly dozen seats are, on paper, friendly to Democrats. Yet troubling signs have emerged.
Stefanik, who is determined to protect the GOP’s hold in New York, said Trump is so far beating his poll numbers from the last two elections while Harris is underperforming those of Biden and Hillary Clinton.
“There’s a reason President Trump is coming to Madison Square Garden,” Stefanik said. “President Trump is a believer in Republicans winning New York,”
Republicans privately believe they are likely to lose at least two incumbents in the blue states: Rep. Brandon Williams in Syracuse and John Duarte in California’s Central Valley (along with GOP Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer in Oregon, where Trump’s support hasn’t improved.) Many are also worried about Rep. Mike Garcia of southern California and Rep. Marc Molinaro in upstate New York.
And Republicans are feeling hopeful about heavily Hispanic seats in Colorado, New Mexico and Texas, where Trump is helping them go on offense. Democrats fear Rep. Yadira Caraveo of Colorado is particularly vulnerable.
Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar, who represents a slice of the US-Mexico border in south Texas, said it’s a warning for his party across the board — including Harris.
“The Democrat Party, they cannot take Hispanic voters for granted,” Cuellar told CNN. As Democrats have been slow to respond on border issues, he warned Republicans are “chipping away” at their base of Hispanic voters.
He added, “In the minds of a lot of voters, they see the Democrats not being strong on border security and Republicans being strong on border security. I don’t want to say I told you so, but I used to say, ‘Guys, this is important.’”

CNN,"Trump calls Harris a fascist, says he is ‘the opposite of a Nazi’ | CNN Politics","Donald Trump on Monday told supporters in Georgia he is “the opposite of a Nazi,” as he responded to comparisons of his Sunday rally at Madison Square Garden to a 1939 pro-Nazi gathering at the same venue.
The former president also sought to turn criticism of his rally into a flashpoint for all Trump supporters by falsely claiming Vice President Kamala Harris is calling those who cast their ballots for him Nazis.
“The newest line from Kamala and her campaign is that anyone who isn’t voting for her is a Nazi,” Trump told supporters at a rally in Georgia, a line that his Democratic rival has not actually said.
Harris pounced last week after The Atlantic reported that Trump, while in the White House, had expressed admiration for the loyalty of Adolf Hitler’s Nazi generals. That report was substantiated by retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, Trump’s chief of staff from 2017 to 2019, who separately told The New York Times that Trump fit the definition of a fascist.
Harris responded to those reports at a CNN town hall, saying she thinks Trump is a fascist and that “the people who know him best on this subject should be trusted.” Her campaign has also used The Atlantic’s report and Kelly’s remarks in advertisements in recent days.
Trump seemed to be responding to those comments Monday night in Georgia, when he said his father had urged him never to describe people as Nazis or Hitler.
“He used to always say: ‘Never use the word Nazi. Never use that word.’ And he’d say: ‘Never use the word Hitler. Don’t use that word,’” Trump said.
Referring to Democrats, Trump added: “They use that word — really, it’s both words. ‘He’s Hitler.’ And then they say, ‘He’s a Nazi.’”
“I’m not a Nazi,” Trump said. “I’m the opposite of a Nazi.”
Trump also responded to Harris calling him a fascist by saying, “She’s a fascist, OK? She’s a fascist.”
Trump’s description of Harris comes despite Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell days earlier calling the vice president’s use of the word “reckless” and claiming it could lead to violence.
The attacks on Harris come amid the political fallout of Trump’s Sunday rally at the iconic Madison Square Garden, where a comedian opening for the former president called Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” — a comment that drew widespread condemnation and triggered backlash among a fast-growing Latino group in Pennsylvania.
Harris on Monday told reporters the incendiary remarks at the Trump rally at Madison Square Garden were “not new” for a former president who regularly uses violent rhetoric targeting undocumented immigrants.
“It is just more of the same, and maybe more vivid, than usual,” Harris said. “Donald Trump spends full time trying to have Americans point their finger at each other. He fans the fuel of hate and division, and that’s why people are exhausted with him.”
Harris has not called Trump, or his supporters, Nazis. However, her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, on Sunday said there was “a direct parallel” between Trump’s wild Madison Square Garden rally and the notorious 1939 gathering of Nazi supporters at the landmark arena in New York City.
“And don’t think that he doesn’t know for one second exactly what they’re doing there,” Walz said.
Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, complained Monday about that comparison.
“They decided to compare us to literal Nazis for gathering in Madison Square Garden and celebrating the United States of America. These are the same people, of course, who call us racist for wanting to secure the southern border. They’re the same people who have no plans, no ideas and no solutions. All they have is hatred of their fellow citizens,” Vance said at a campaign stop in Wisconsin.
Later, at another event, Vance argued that the values of American soldiers who stormed the beaches of Normandy to fight Nazi Germany in World War II are far from the policies Harris supports.
“If you think those brave men were fighting for an open border and sex change surgeries for illegal aliens,” Vance said, “the proper term for you is ‘dipsh*t.’”

CNN,"Chinese hackers targeted Eric Trump’s and Jared Kushner’s call data, sources say | CNN Politics","US officials believe Chinese government-linked hackers targeted Eric Trump’s and Jared Kushner’s call and text data as the scale of a sweeping cyber-espionage campaign targeting senior figures in both the Republican and Democratic parties comes into focus just days before the US election, with dozens of people believed to be impacted, three people familiar with the matter told CNN.
Former President Donald Trump’s son and son-in-law join a growing list of top political figures whose phone communications US officials believe were targeted by the elite Chinese hacking team. Other targets include Trump himself, his running mate JD Vance and people affiliated with the Harris-Walz campaign, CNN previously reported. The hackers also targeted prominent Democrats including the staff of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, another source briefed on the matter told CNN.
The scope of the hack is “way worse than the public knows” and officials are still sifting through the intrusions to determine the impact, another source familiar with the intelligence told CNN.
In some cases, the hackers may have had access to the call and text data of their targets for many months, the two sources said. The FBI has been notifying those whose phone data was targeted.
The New York Times was first to report that Eric Trump and Kushner had been targeted.
US officials investigating the hacking campaign, which came via intrusions at US telecom firms AT&T, Lumen and Verizon, consider it to be among the most concerning national security-related hacks in recent memory and more serious than initial press reports suggested.
And the timing of the revelations means the FBI is carrying out a high-stakes and delicate investigation into hacking aimed at both the Trump and Harris campaigns days from a hugely consequential election.
The hackers do not appear to be trying to influence the election itself, as the Iranians who breached the Trump campaign earlier this year attempted to do, according to US officials. But they are trying to collect intelligence on the private communications of senior officials from both parties that would be of keen interest to Beijing.
Investigators believe the hackers are also likely searching for other sensitive national security information, including, in some cases, information on wiretap warrant requests made by the Justice Department, CNN previously reported.
‘Real-time wiretapping’
“It’s real-time wiretapping,” one of the sources told CNN, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive and ongoing investigation. “They flat-out hacked the system that the Department of Justice requires [telecom firms] to maintain for lawful access.”
“We might as well let Huawei come into the network,” the source added, referring to the Chinese telecommunication giant that the US has imposed restrictions on banned from federal networks over spying concerns.
Eric Trump regularly appears with his father on the campaign trail and has served as one of the most prominent surrogates for his father, holding campaign events across the country. Eric’s wife Lara was tapped as co-chair of the Republican National Committee earlier this year.
Kushner has been barely visible this campaign cycle. Two years ago, his wife Ivanka Trump announced she and Kushner would be taking a step back from politics to focus on their family.
“Does this surprise anyone? Under Kamala and Biden, China has walked all over our country,” Eric Trump said in a statement to CNN.
There are no indications anyone was able to access data related to Jared Kushner or his devices, a person familiar with the matter told CNN.
CNN has asked the Trump campaign for comment. The Chinese Embassy in Washington, DC, has denied that Beijing-backed hackers have breached US telecom firms, calling that information “a distortion of the fact.”
The FBI declined to comment. In a statement last week, the FBI and US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency confirmed they were investigating “unauthorized access to commercial telecommunications infrastructure by actors affiliated with the People’s Republic of China,” but did not specify who was targeted.
The Trump campaign is operating under the assumption that the hackers could still have access to the phone communications they targeted that belong to Trump and Vance, two of the sources said. The campaign has changed some security protocols, including by rotating the use of phones, to try to evade the surveillance, one of the sources said.
Evicting hackers has proved difficult
Evicting the hackers from the telecom networks has proved difficult. The hackers are blending in with benign internet traffic in routers and switches, making them difficult to find, multiple other sources familiar with their techniques told CNN.
The FBI was watching the Chinese hackers operate in the telecom networks after US officials first learned of the intrusions, one of the sources familiar with the matter said. After the Wall Street Journal first reported on the seriousness of the hack this month, the hackers took additional steps to try to elude US investigators, according to the source, who likened it to a game of cat and mouse.
The White House has convened an interagency team to oversee the response to the hack, a move typically reserved for major cybersecurity incidents, three US officials familiar with the matter told CNN. The Washington Post first reported on that process being activated.
Meanwhile, a Department of Homeland Security-led group of cybersecurity experts that probes major hacking incidents plans to investigate the root causes of the Chinese hacking campaign, a DHS official told CNN.
On Capitol Hill, the alleged Chinese hack is such a sensitive matter that normally garrulous lawmakers clam up at the mention of it.
“This is a very serious breach that the committee is monitoring on a daily basis,” Sen. Mark Warner, the Virginia Democrat who chairs the intelligence committee, told CNN earlier this month. He repeated the same sentence when asked for more details and said he couldn’t share anything more.
Given how pervasive the Chinese hacking campaign has been in US telecom networks, some US allies are checking their own computer networks for signs of compromise. Officials in the United Kingdom, for example, have been on high alert for evidence of any impact in the UK from the hacks but so far have found none, a UK official familiar with the matter told CNN.
The ongoing Chinese hacking campaign means that the next administration — whether Trump or Harris wins — will likely inherit another major cybersecurity incident with big implications for national security. When President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, the US government was still dealing with the fallout of a sophisticated hack by Russian intelligence that infiltrated software made by the tech firm SolarWinds to breach multiple US government agencies.

CNN,Fact check: Debunking Trump’s October lying spree about immigration | CNN Politics,"Former President Donald Trump is lying about a whole bunch of topics in the final month of the presidential election. But he is lying most frequently, by far, about immigration.
Trump’s October rally speeches and interviews have featured a dizzying barrage of false claims on the subject – about immigrants and crime, about Vice President Kamala Harris’ record on immigration policy, about Trump’s own record on immigration policy and about how foreign countries are supposedly “dumping” their most unwanted citizens into the US.
These claims range from exaggerations to wholly fictional tales. Here is a fact check of at least 28 distinct false claims he has made about immigration in the last two weeks alone, some of which he has repeated over and over.
Harris’ border role: Trump, criticizing Harris, repeatedly claimed that President Joe Biden made her “border czar” and said that “she was in charge of the border.” Biden never made Harris “border czar,” a label the White House has always emphasized is inaccurate, and never put her in charge of border security, a responsibility of Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas. In reality, Biden gave Harris a more limited immigration-related assignment in 2021, asking her to lead diplomacy with El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras in an attempt to address the conditions that prompted their citizens to try to migrate to the United States.
Harris’ border visits: Trump, speaking about Harris and the border, repeated his false claim that “she never even went there.” Harris did go to the border as vice president, in Texas in mid-2021 and then again in Arizona last month; many Republicans had criticized Harris prior to the 2021 visit for not having gone, and some later argued that she didn’t go frequently enough, but the claim that she “never” went has not been true for more than three years.
Harris’ approach to the border: Trump falsely claimed of Harris: “She was saying the other day, ‘Yes, oh yes, we want to have a border.’ The first time she ever said it. She almost threw up when she said it.” This is nonsense; Harris has never said the US shouldn’t have a border, and it’s not even true that “the other day” was the first time she said the US should have a secure border. For example, she said in a television appearance while running for president in 2019: “We have to have a secure border. But I am in favor of saying that we are not going to treat people who are undocumented and cross the border as criminals.”
Harris, migrants and criminals: Trump again falsely described a recently released set of statistics about immigrants in the US with homicide convictions, claiming again that the figures are specifically about people who entered the country during the Biden-Harris administration: “It came out that 13,099 were let in, during their administration – they tried to say longer, wrong: over the last three-and-a-half years – 13,000-plus people came in: murderers.”
In reality, the Department of Homeland Security and independent experts have noted that these figures are about people who entered the country over decades, including during Trump’s own administration, not just under Biden and Harris. You can read more here.
The people on the ICE non-detained list: Trump repeated his false claim that “under Kamala Harris, 13,099 illegal alien convicted murderers are roaming free in the United States.” The Department of Homeland Security has made clear that this figure includes people who are currently incarcerated in federal, state and local prisons and jails; they are on the Immigration and Customs Enforcement “non-detained” list because they aren’t in the custody of immigration authorities in particular. You can read more here.
A Biden immigration bill and citizenship: Trump denounced an unspecified immigration bill from the Biden administration, falsely claiming “it would have allowed millions of people to become citizens right away.” The bill Biden proposed to Congress at the beginning of his administration in 2021 would have offered a pathway to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants, but over eight years. And the bipartisan 2024 border bill that Trump helped to kill offered a pathway to citizenship for tens of thousands of immigrants from Afghanistan who arrived in the US with temporary status in the wake of the US withdrawal in 2021, but that’s not “millions,” and, again, it wouldn’t have made them citizens immediately.
Migration and Black unemployment: Trump, arguing that undocumented immigrants are taking the jobs of Black and Hispanic Americans, falsely claimed Saturday of African Americans: “Their unemployment rate is through the roof. Wait ‘til you hear the numbers.” The Black or African American unemployment rate declined in September, to 5.7%. That is only a bit higher than the lowest rate of the Trump presidency, 5.3%, in two months of 2019. It’s also lower than the pre-pandemic February 2020 rate, also under Trump, of 6.1%.
FEMA and migrants: Trump falsely claimed of the Federal Emergency Management Agency: “They have no money. You know where they gave the money? To illegal immigrants coming in.” He also said, “They spent all their funds; they have no funds to take care…”
This is false in two ways. FEMA does have money for the immediate responses to Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton, though a string of recent disasters has depleted its disaster relief fund; the fund had about $11 billion remaining as of Wednesday. And FEMA did not give all of its disaster relief money to undocumented people; rather, as mandated by Congress, FEMA also administers an entirely separate pool of money for sheltering migrants.
An immigration chart and migration levels: Trump repeatedly made his false claim that his favorite chart about migration numbers at the southern border – which he had fortunately turned his head to look at when a gunman tried to kill him at a campaign rally in July – has an arrow pointing to “the day I left office,” which, he said, had the lowest level of border crossings “in the recorded history of our country.”
The chart doesn’t show that. In fact, the arrow actually points to April 2020, when Trump still had more than eight months left in his term and global migration had slowed to a trickle because of the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. After hitting a roughly three-year low (not an all-time low) in April 2020, migration numbers at the southern border increased each month through the end of Trump’s term.
The number of migrants: Trump, speaking about migration, repeated his false claim that “21 million people came in over the last three years, with them.” Through August, the country had recorded about 10.3 million nationwide “encounters” with migrants during the Biden-Harris administration, including millions who were rapidly expelled from the country; even adding in so-called “gotaways” who evaded detection, estimated by House Republicans as being roughly 2 million, there’s no way the total is “21 million.”
The border wall: Trump repeated his false claim that he built “571 miles of wall” on the southern border. That’s a significant exaggeration; official government data shows 458 miles were built under Trump – including both wall built where no barriers had existed before and wall built to replace previous barriers.
Trump’s wall promises: Trump made the false claim about having built “571 miles of wall,” then added an additional false claim that the number of miles he had wanted to add to the wall, before the Biden administration halted construction, was “much more than I said I was going to build.” He said, “I was going to add 200 miles more. I didn’t promise to do that, but I thought it would be good.” In reality, when he ran for president in 2015 and 2016, Trump regularly said “we need” 1,000 miles of wall; adding 200 miles to the 458 miles that were built, or even adding the 280 miles the federal government said were planned for construction but not yet built when Trump left office, would be less than he had spoken about building.
Mexico and the wall: Trump, who emphasized during his 2016 campaign that Mexico would pay for the wall, falsely claimed: “Mexico did pay for it.” He added, “You know, they gave us thousands and thousands of soldiers. They paid more.”
Mexico did not pay for the border wall, which was funded solely with billions of dollars in US government funds; the Trump administration directed roughly $16 billion toward the project (though not all of it was spent). While Mexico did deploy thousands of security personnel to thwart migrants heading to the US, Mexico paying for this initiative simply isn’t the same as Mexico paying for the wall.
Immigration judges and other countries: Trump, criticizing the fact that asylum seekers who arrive at the border have access to a US legal process before they are deported, falsely claimed that “No other country has judges at the border.” In reality, the US is far from the only country to let asylum seekers make their case before judges or legal tribunals.
“This statement is patently false,” James Hathaway, then a law professor and Director of the Program in Refugee and Asylum Law at the University of Michigan, told this reporter during Trump’s presidency in response to a previous version of Trump’s claim. “It is completely routine in other countries that, like the U.S., have signed the UN refugee treaties for asylum-seekers to have access to the domestic legal system to make a protection claim (and to be allowed in while the claim is pending).”
The number of US immigration judges: Trump falsely claimed, “We have thousands of judges at the border.” The US had 725 immigration judges nationwide as of the first quarter of the 2024 fiscal year.
Trump’s comments about immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, “eating the pets”: Asked at a Univision town hall if he really believes Haitian immigrants in Springfield are eating other residents’ pets, Trump said, “This was just reported. I was just saying what was reported; that’s been reported – and eating other things, too, that they’re not supposed to be. But this is – all I do is report.” He added, “That’s been in the newspapers and reported pretty broadly.”
It has not actually been broadly reported that immigrants in Springfield are eating other residents’ pets. In fact, no news outlet has reported any proof of this having actually happened; Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Trump’s running mate, acknowledged after promoting such claims in September that although he had heard the claims from his constituents, “it’s possible, of course, that all of these rumors will turn out to be false.” And when Trump claimed at the presidential debate in September that “in Springfield, they’re eating the dogs…they’re eating the cats….they’re eating the pets of the people that live there,” he did not say he was merely citing reports he had seen.
The legal status of immigrants in Springfield: Trump falsely claimed, “They just dropped 30,000 illegal aliens in Springfield, Ohio.”
This is false in more than one way. While we don’t know the immigration status of each and every Haitian immigrant in Springfield, the community is, on the whole, in the country lawfully. The Springfield city website says, “YES, Haitian immigrants are here legally, under the Immigration Parole Program. Once here, immigrants are then eligible to apply for Temporary Protected Status (TPS).” Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine wrote in a New York Times op-ed about Springfield in September that the Haitian immigrants “are there legally” and that, as a Trump-Vance supporter, he is “saddened” by the candidates’ disparagement of “the legal migrants living in Springfield.”
Second, nobody “dropped” the immigrants in Springfield; the city’s Haitian residents were not sent there by a government resettlement program. Rather, they independently decided to move to the city because of employment opportunities, affordable housing and the presence of a Haitian community, among other factors.
And while there is no official tally of the number of immigrants in Springfield, Trump’s “30,000” figure exceeds local estimates. The website for the city of Springfield says there are an estimated 12,000 to 15,000 immigrants in the county that includes Springfield, where the total population is about 138,000. Chris Cook, the county’s health commissioner, said in July that his team estimated the best number was 10,000 to 12,000 Haitian residents in the county.
More about immigrants in Springfield: Trump claimed that immigrants in Springfield are on “probation,” and he added, “Probation is for prisoners.” This is false in two ways.
First, Trump got his terms wrong. Many Haitians came into the country under a Biden-Harris administration parole program – not “probation” – that gives permission to enter the US to vetted participants with US sponsors. And though the word “parole” is most commonly used in the context of criminal prisoners who are let out early on certain conditions, in the context of immigration policy, “parole” does not mean that someone was let out of prison or had ever been in prison.
Rather, as the federal government explains on its website, “The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) allows the secretary of homeland security to use their discretion to parole any noncitizen applying for admission into the United States temporarily for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit.” The government has used the parole authority in the past to grant entry to certain people fleeing crises in Cuba, Vietnam, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Lebanon and elsewhere.
Venezuela, prisons and migration: Trump falsely claimed, “In Venezuela, many countries, they’re emptying their prisons into our country.” This is false. Trump has never corroborated this claim about Venezuela, let alone “many countries,” and experts have told CNN, PolitiFact and FactCheck.org that they know of no evidence for it.
“We have no evidence that the Venezuelan government is emptying its prisons or mental health institutions to send them outside the country, in other words, to the U.S. or any other country,” Roberto Briceño-León, founder and director of the Venezuelan Observatory of Violence, an independent organization that tracks violence in the country, said in an email to CNN in June, after Trump made similar claims.
Venezuela and migrant buses: Adding another colorful story about Venezuela, Trump falsely claimed that “they take the criminal gangs from Caracas off the streets and they bus them into the United States and drop them.” This is false. There is no evidence of Venezuelan authorities somehow busing gang members into the US.
Migrants and “the Congo”: Trump repeated his false claim that “a huge number” of migrants are “coming out of jails in the Congo,” explaining that this was because foreign countries are deliberately “releasing their prison populations into our country.” Trump and his campaign have never been able to provide any proof for this claim about “the Congo,” and both the Democratic Republic of Congo and the neighboring Republic of Congo told CNN in March that it is false. Experts on both countries also told CNN in March that they had not seen any evidence of Congolese prisons being emptied, let alone evidence of either country somehow having brought ex-prisoners into the US as Trump has claimed.
The world prison population: Trump repeated his false claim that “the prison population all over the world is down, because they put them in our country.” The recorded global prison population increased from October 2021 to April 2024, from at least about 10.77 million people to at least about 10.99 million people, according to the World Prison Population List compiled by experts in the United Kingdom.
“I do a daily news search to see what’s going on in prisons around the world and have seen absolutely no evidence that any country is emptying its prisons and sending them all to the US,” Helen Fair, co-author of the prison population list and research fellow at the Institute for Crime & Justice Policy Research at Birkbeck, University of London, said in June, when Trump made a similar claim.
Migrants and mental health facilities: Trump repeated his false claim about large numbers of migrants entering the US from mental health facilities foreign governments had deliberately emptied: “They’re coming in, but they’re also coming in largely, in tremendous numbers, coming in, out of mental institutions; they’re emptying out mental institutions, they’re emptying out insane asylums.” Trump’s own campaign hasn’t been able to substantiate these claims, and experts say they have found no evidence for them.
A gang and Colorado: Trump falsely claimed at a rally in Colorado that a Venezuelan gang called Tren de Aragua is “taking over your state,” suggesting that the city of Aurora has been “conquered” and promising to “liberate Colorado” if elected again.
The gang has members in the state, but it has not come close to taking over any town or city – let alone Colorado as a whole. Republican Aurora Mayor Mike Coffman said in a September joint statement, issued with the conservative chair of the city council’s public safety committee, that the gang “has not ‘taken over’ the city” and that problems with the gang “experienced at a select few properties do not apply to the city as a whole or large portions of it.” Coffman noted that the city’s police department had linked 10 people to the gang and arrested eight.
Migrants and towns: Trump, talking about the migrants who have entered the country under Biden and Harris, promised to “rescue…every town across America that has been invaded and conquered,” adding, “They’ve been conquered; they’re conquering the towns.” This is nonsense; no US town has been “conquered” by migrants.
The word “caravan”: Talking about migrant caravans, Trump repeated his false claim that he invented the term: “The caravan. I made up that name too. I’m good at names.” Trump did not come up with the word “caravan,” either in general – the word came to English in the 16th century – or in using it to describe groups of migrants traveling together toward the US border; before he first used it in that context in a 2018 tweet, it had been used by various others in the same context in the days and weeks prior, including in a BuzzFeed News feature article headlined, “A Huge Caravan Of Central Americans Is Headed For The US, And No One In Mexico Dares To Stop Them.”
Central American countries and deportations: Trump repeated his long-debunked story about how Latin American countries including Honduras – he has previously named Guatemala and El Salvador as well – refused to let the US deport criminals back there under President Barack Obama, even refusing to let deportation flights land on their runways. In 2016, Obama’s last calendar year in office, neither Honduras nor the other two countries were on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered “recalcitrant” (uncooperative) in accepting the return of their citizens from the US; in the 2016 fiscal year, ICE reported that Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador ranked second, third and fourth for the country of citizenship of people being removed from the US.
Harris and “missing” children: Trump falsely claimed that Harris “lost 325,000 migrant children” and declared that “most of them are dead, in my opinion”; agreeing with a comment from someone in his rally crowd, he added that “all” of them might be dead.
There is no basis for Trump’s claim that even “most” of these children are dead – or for his claim that Harris was responsible for all of the children.
He appeared to be referring to an August report from the Homeland Security Department’s Office of Inspector General, which said ICE reported more than 32,000 unaccompanied migrant children failed to appear as scheduled for immigration court hearings after being released or transferred out of custody between fiscal years 2019 and 2023 – a period that, notably, includes two years and four months under the Trump administration. The report also said that 291,000 unaccompanied migrant children during this period were not given notices to appear in court.
The report said that ICE has “no assurances” these children “are safe from trafficking, exploitation, or forced labor.” But it did not definitively assert that any of them were being exploited – let alone that most of them are dead, a claim experts say is nonsense.
Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, told CNN in a message this summer: “Long story short, no, there are not 320,000 kids missing. 32,000 kids missed court. That doesn’t mean they’re missing, it means they missed court (either because their sponsor didn’t bring them or they are teenagers who didn’t want to show up). The remaining 291,000 cases mentioned by the OIG are cases where ICE hasn’t filed the paperwork to start their immigration court cases.”",2024-10-18
CNN,CNN Poll: Harris and Trump remain in a locked race and are tied heading into the final stretch | CNN Politics,"The race for the White House rests on a razor’s edge in the final nationwide CNN poll before votes are counted. The poll, conducted by SSRS, finds 47% of likely voters support Vice President Kamala Harris and an equal 47% support former President Donald Trump.
CNN polling has found a tight race throughout the short campaign between Harris and Trump. In September, likely voters split 48% for Harris and 47% for Trump, nearly identical to the new poll, and a poll just after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race over the summer and threw his support behind Harris found 49% of registered voters behind Trump, with 46% backing Harris.
Trump has never trailed outside the margin of error in CNN’s polling on this year’s presidential contest against either Harris or Biden, a stark departure from his previous two runs for the presidency.
The race has been remarkably stable throughout this tumultuous political year. The poll finds that 85% of likely voters who’ve made a choice say they knew which party they would support in the presidential election all along, and just 15% say they changed their minds along the way. As of now, even more than that are fully locked in: A scant 2% of all likely voters say they haven’t yet chosen a candidate, and another 9% say that they could change their minds before casting a ballot.
Those voters who say their choices are locked in now split 50% Harris to 49% Trump, with just 1% supporting other candidates. Those who could change tilt toward Trump and are much more likely than decided voters to be backers of minor-party and independent candidates (38% support Trump, 31% Harris, 30% someone else). They are also much less motivated to vote than those who’ve made a decision. While 70% of likely voters who say their minds are made up say they are “extremely motivated” to vote, that drops to just 27% among those who could change their minds.
Harris has likely banked more votes than Trump so far, given Democrats’ higher propensity to vote early or by mail, according to the poll. The poll was fielded October 20-23, after early and absentee voting was well underway across the country, and found the 20% of likely voters who say they have already cast their ballots break 61% Harris to 36% Trump, while those who say they haven’t yet voted break in Trump’s favor, 50% to 44%.
The nation’s mood
The final days of the campaign find the country’s registered voters deeply negative about both Biden’s presidency and the way things are going in the nation more generally. About half, 49%, say they are worse off financially now than they were a year ago, while just 16% say their financial position has improved in the last 12 months. That’s worse than at the start of this year, when 41% said they were worse off and 22% felt better off. Just 32% say things in the US are going well today, down from 38% who felt that way in January. This was the lowest share to say so in the final CNN poll before a presidential election since 2008, when dissatisfaction with the burgeoning economic crisis and lingering Iraq war catapulted Barack Obama to the presidency.
Biden’s approval rating in the new poll among registered voters is deeply underwater (36% approve and 64% disapprove). The vice president holds support from 19% of likely voters who say they disapprove of the way Biden is handling the presidency. Past vice presidents making a run for the top job have not typically fared that well among voters who disapproved of their boss: George H.W. Bush carried just 11% of those who disapproved of Ronald Reagan in the 1988 exit poll, and Al Gore won only 9% of voters who disapproved of Bill Clinton’s work in 2000.
Assessing the candidates
Registered voters’ views of both Harris (41% favorable to 52% unfavorable) and Trump (41% favorable to 54% unfavorable) break negative. Trump’s ratings are nearly identical to what they were in September, while Harris’ have become slightly more negative (down 4 points on favorability). The vice presidential candidates, JD Vance and Tim Walz, remain less well-known than their running mates, with views of Walz splitting evenly (34% favorable and 34% unfavorable) and views of Vance breaking negatively (33% favorable to 43% unfavorable).
While most Harris voters say their vote is more for her (54%) than against Trump (45%), the share who say they’re voting mainly against Trump has grown 5 points since September, perhaps reflecting Harris’ own recent focus on a more vocally anti-Trump message. Trump’s supporters, meanwhile, remain widely likely to say their vote is to express support for him (73%) over opposition to Harris (27%).
More likely voters say Harris rather than Trump cares about people like them (43% Harris to 37% Trump), is honest and trustworthy (41% Harris to 29% Trump), and will put the country’s interests above their own (45% Harris to 39% Trump). Trump holds the edge on bringing the kind of change the country needs (44% Trump to 38% Harris) and on sharing voters’ vision for the country (43% Trump to 39% Harris).
Across each of those attributes though, 16% or more of likely voters say neither candidate fits the bill. Most notably, 29% say neither candidate is honest and trustworthy and 19% say neither cares about people like them. The nearly 3 in 10 who see neither candidate as honest and trustworthy break by a wide margin for Trump: 58% support him, 25% Harris. Harris, meanwhile, holds a wide edge among voters who think that neither can bring the kind of change the country needs (52% Harris to 23% Trump) or who say neither shares their vision for the country (50% Harris to 27% Trump).
Likely voters are largely put off by Trump’s demeanor and temperament (56% say it’s a reason to vote against him). About half say the same about his criminal conviction and the criminal charges he faces (51%) and about his pledge to go after his enemies if elected president (50%). More see his level of physical and mental ability as a reason to vote against him (46%) than for him (35%), a negative shift relative to perceptions of his abilities when he was running against Biden. And likely voters divide over whether his record as president is a positive (45%) or a negative (43%). His record as a businessman is seen as somewhat more of a plus, though (42% see it as a reason to vote for him, 39% against him).
Among Trump’s own supporters, relatively few see his demeanor or pledge to pursue his enemies as a reason to oppose him, and about half of his base see these elements as a positive part of his appeal.
Harris’ demeanor and temperament (45% a reason to vote for, 34% against) and mental and physical abilities (49% reason to vote for, 27% against) are more clearly positives for likely voters. Her record as vice president is more often seen as negative than positive (46% say it’s a reason to vote against her, 26% for her), and her record as a prosecutor produces a split reaction (33% for, 32% against, 35% doesn’t matter).
Few say that Harris’ potential to be the first female president should be a factor in the election (65% say it doesn’t make a difference either way). Those that do are more likely to see it as a positive (24%) than a negative (11%). Women are more likely than men to say it’s a reason to vote for her (29% vs. 20%), with an especially large divide among her own supporters (52% of female Harris supporters say it’s a reason to vote for her vs. 39% of her male supporters).
The dynamic between the two candidates on top issues remains roughly where it was last month. Trump maintains broad leads among likely voters as more trusted to handle the economy (50% say they trust Trump more, 37% Harris) and immigration (50% Trump to 34% Harris), with a narrower edge for handling foreign policy (48% Trump to 38% Harris). Harris holds a wide advantage on handling abortion and reproductive rights (52% Harris to 31% Trump) and a smaller one on protecting democracy (45% Harris to 41% Trump).
Looking at how decisive two of those issues might be for voters, the survey suggests a small issue advantage for Harris: 31% of registered voters say they would only vote for a candidate who shares their view on abortion, up from 24% who said the same in April. Fewer in the new poll, 26%, see a candidate’s views on immigration the same way.
Vote among key groups
Harris has a narrow edge with independents (45% Harris to 41% Trump), and both candidates carry more than 90% of their own partisans (93% of Democrats back Harris, 92% of Republicans favor Trump).
Harris holds the advantage over Trump among women (50% Harris to 44% Trump), younger voters (51% Harris to 41% Trump among voters younger than 35), and voters of color, including Black likely voters (79% Harris to 13% Trump) and Hispanic likely voters (54% Harris to 37% Trump). Suburban voters break in Harris’ direction (52% Harris to 44% Trump), with her edge there fueled largely by suburban women, who break 55% Harris to 41% Trump; suburban men split almost evenly.
Trump, meanwhile, has a lead with men (51% Trump to 45% Harris), White likely voters (55% Trump to 41% Harris), rural voters (64% Trump to 31% Harris) and those who say they did not cast a ballot in 2020 (50% Trump to 40% Harris).
There is little gender gap among White likely voters, with White men breaking for Trump by 17 points and White women by 13 points. Among likely voters of color, though, while both genders broadly split in Harris’ favor, women do so by a wider margin. Harris runs 46 points ahead of Trump with women of color, while she is up 27 points among men of color. White voters also continue to divide sharply by education, with White likely voters who do not have a college degree supporting Trump 62% to 34%, while those who do have a four-year degree split almost evenly, 50% Harris to 46% Trump.
The survey finds no clear leader on a generic congressional ballot, with 48% of likely voters saying they prefer the Republican candidate in their congressional district to 45% who would vote for the Democrat.
The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS online and by telephone October 20-23, 2024, among 1,704 registered voters nationwide drawn from a probability-based panel. Likely voters include all registered voters in the poll weighted for their predicted likelihood of voting in this year’s election. Results for the full sample of registered voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points; it is 3.1 for likely voters, and larger for subgroups.",2024-10-25
CNN,Fact check: Trump revives his lie that schools are secretly sending children for gender-affirming surgeries | CNN Politics,"Former President Donald Trump continues to repeat his lie that US schools are sending children for gender-affirming surgeries without their parents’ consent — even though his own presidential campaign could not find a single example of this having happened.
Trump debuted the tale in late August. It was debunked by CNN and others in early September. But Trump, whose campaign has spent tens of millions of dollars on late-campaign attack ads related to transgender people, has revived the story in October as Election Day draws near.
Trump made the claim again last week while discussing education policy during a New York City barbershop discussion filmed by Fox News: “No transgender, no operations — you know, they take your kid — there are some places, your boy leaves for school, comes back a girl. Okay? Without parental consent.” He added, “At first, when I was told that was actually happening, I said, you know, it’s an exaggeration. No: it happens. It happens. There are areas where it happens.”
Trump didn’t name these supposed “areas.” But he made the claim once more during his Friday interview with prominent podcast host Joe Rogan: “Who would want to have — there’s so many — the transgender operations: where they’re allowed to take your child when he goes to school and turn him into a male — to a female — without parental consent.”
Facts First: Trump’s claim remains false. There is no evidence that schools in any part of the United States have sent children for gender-affirming surgeries without their parents’ approval, or performed unapproved gender-affirming surgeries on site; none of that is “allowed” anywhere in the country. Even in the states where gender-affirming surgery is legal for people under age 18, parental consent is required before a minor can undergo such a procedure.
Trump’s campaign and four conservative groups contacted by CNN in September about Trump’s claim were unable to find any evidence for it. Experts on health care for transgender people said the situation Trump described simply does not happen in this country.
Landon Hughes, a postdoctoral fellow at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and a co-author of a recent study on the prevalence of gender-affirming surgery in the US, said in a September email: “There are no instances of children receiving surgeries or access to surgeries from their schools.” Hughes added: “No provider in the US would perform surgery on a minor under the direction of a school, let alone without parental consent.”
“Of course everything in this statement is false,” Dr. Meredithe McNamara, an adolescent medicine physician at the Yale School of Medicine, said in a September email. “Of course surgery of any kind happens in a qualified medical center and not in a school. Of course parents are the medical decision-makers for their kids, especially when it comes to gender-affirming care.”
For minors, parental consent is also required in the US for non-surgical gender-affirming medical treatments such as puberty blockers and hormone therapy. Various guidelines and standards for medical care of transgender adolescents from entities including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health explain that parental consent is needed.
“Any gender-affirming medical care or surgical care would legally require the consent of (both) parents/legal guardians and assent of an adolescent under 18,” Dr. Laura Taylor, medical director of the gender-affirming care program at the University of Southern California, said in a September email. “This includes puberty blockers, hormones, and surgery.”
There are no definitive national figures on the number of minors who receive gender-affirming surgeries, which include breast or chest procedures, often called “top surgery,” and genital reconstructive procedures, often called “bottom surgery.” But the limited available data makes it clear that the vast majority of such surgeries occur among adults.
Taylor outlined a lengthy process before a minor might undergo a gender-affirming surgery.
“In adolescents, the decision to start hormones and/or have surgery would happen after consultation with an interdisciplinary team for a psychosocial assessment,” she said, the bold type hers. “The assessment includes understanding the dysphoria related to gender incongruence (the distress caused by the physical characteristics that do not match the person’s identity), how long it has been present, excluding other reasons to account for the dysphoria, and making sure the adolescent and family can provide informed consent.”
Asked in September for any evidence for Trump’s claim that schools are secretly obtaining gender-affirming surgeries for children, Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt provided none. Instead, she sent a series of articles on the broader debate over how schools handle gender identity issues.",2024-10-26

CNN,"Harris hopes Ellipse speech will recall Trump’s chaos, but also evoke her own promise | CNN Politics","As advisers to Vice President Kamala Harris were mulling where to stage the final major address of her campaign, they had a few boxes to check.
The venue, they believed, must convey a degree of gravity about the choice before voters. But equally important, in their view, was its ability to evoke the promise of the office she seeks.
In the Ellipse – the patch of park where Donald Trump rallied his supporters on January 6, 2021, within view of the White House – they believe they found that equilibrium.
“It’s really a reminder of the gravity of the job, how much a president can do for good and for bad, to shape the country and impact people’s lives,” Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, the campaign chair, said Tuesday.
“But it’s also a stark visualization of probably the most infamous example of Donald Trump and how he’s used his power for bad, really focusing on himself and spreading division and chaos and inciting a mob to try to maintain his own power and put himself over the country.”
For Harris, striking a balance between dire warnings about a rival she calls a fascist and forward-looking optimism about the president she would be has become a defining challenge of the campaign’s closing stretch.
Tuesday’s high-profile speech is one of the last remaining opportunities for the vice president to try to reach a critical segment of the electorate known inside the campaign as “conflicted voters,” aides said, or those who may have concerns with Trump’s conduct but who are not yet convinced Harris is a candidate of change who can get the country on track.
While it’s hard to imagine that one speech could move the needle, aides said, it is also intended to draw a clear contrast with Trump’s controversial Madison Square Garden rally Sunday evening. That was not the original intent of Harris’ major address, aides said, but they believe it serves as a timely rebuttal.
“It’s going to crystallize many of the key arguments that she started with,” according to a source familiar with Harris’ speech, citing reproductive freedom and her framing of what she calls an “opportunity economy.”
Despite the sober overtones of the setting – it is where Trump told his supporters to march to the Capitol on January 6; many did, causing destruction and death – Harris’ advisers say the speech will be hopeful and optimistic, and not focused exclusively on the events that unfolded at the site nearly four years ago.
If there is a takeaway from that day she wants to drive home, it is that her own victory would turn the page on Trump’s divisiveness, according to advisers.
With the office she is seeking to occupy 500 yards to the north, the setting provides Harris an opportunity to describe her plans for country, principally on the economy, the top issue for voters.
In the final week of the campaign, the speech isn’t intended to cover entirely new ground, aides said, but rather to frame the stakes of the race and highlight the deep contrast between Harris and Trump.
Standing on the Ellipse, aides said, will allow Harris to bring familiar arguments about democracy to life in a setting that explicitly highlights the lengths that Trump and his allies went to try to overturn the 2020 election. The venue will also underscore how she believes a second term could be worse, they said.
“As I’ve said many times and I’ll say tomorrow night in my speech, there’s a big difference between he and I. If he were elected on Day 1, he’s going to be sitting in the Oval Office working on his enemies list,” Harris said Monday. “On Day 1, if I’m elected president of the United States, which I fully intend to be, I will be working on behalf of the American people on my to-do list.”
Preparations were underway on Monday ahead of the speech, including the installation of tall black fencing to create a secure perimeter around the Ellipse.
An amended permit for the event showed as many as 40,000 people are expected to attend, with spillover onto the National Mall – her first major campaign speech outdoors in Washington. Most of Harris’ large rallies this year have been in arenas or stadiums in battleground states.
The vice president worked on her remarks as she traveled to Michigan on Monday for three campaign stops, aides said, working through final drafts for one of the biggest speeches since the Democratic convention. She also is expected to address the economy, lowering the cost of prescription drugs, and her broader middle-class agenda, even though the sharpest contrasts are likely to come on Trump’s character.
In some ways, it harks back to Harris’ remarks at campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, the day after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race, making Tuesday’s speech something of a bookend in her extraordinarily truncated campaign.
“All of this is to say building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency,” Harris said at the time. “Because we here know, when our middle class is strong, America is strong.”
Aides have likened Tuesday’s speech to the closing arguments Harris delivered as a prosecutor early in her career. After laying out evidence for a jury — in this case, voters — she is hoping to tie the various threads together into a single case for herself.
She hasn’t been lacking in advice. As they have been since Biden was the party’s standard-bearer, Democrats are somewhat divided on how much to emphasize Trump’s character and perceived danger to democracy versus more narrowly focusing on pocketbook issues.
Last week, the leading super PAC supporting Harris’ candidacy raised concerns that the Harris campaign was too closely centering its closing message on calling Trump a fascist.
“This topic is not as persuasive as contrast messages featuring Harris’ economic plans, and her promise to protect reproductive rights,” the group warned in an email to Democrats about messaging in the final stretch of the campaign.
Still, Harris’ advisers believe there are moderates who will be swayed by the links between Trump and fascism, particularly when raised by his former top aide, John Kelly.
More broadly, the Harris team views the closing days of the campaign as a moment to harness widespread exhaustion and frustration at Trump’s chaotic brand of politics, not only by shining a spotlight on the tumult but also by offering a clear alternative.
Since the moment Harris ascended to the top of the ticket in July, her campaign has worked to capitalize on the trappings of office – and the power of strong imagery – to help voters see her as presidential and take the historic step of electing the first woman as commander in chief.
The sweeping backdrop of the White House and the National Mall was designed for maximum effect a week before the final day of voting. It’s something of an analogue to an August rally in Detroit, where Harris spoke to thousands before the majestic backdrop of Air Force Two.
The prime-time speech on the Ellipse comes amid rising anxiety from some over how much time Harris is devoting to disqualify Trump compared with what she would do if elected. The Tuesday night address, advisers tell CNN, is intended to be a balance of both messages.
“We don’t have the luxury of just talking about what she would do as president,” a top Democratic adviser said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss strategic decisions. “We can’t pretend this is an ordinary election.”",2024-10-29

CNN,Steve Bannon is released from prison in time for the last-week push to Election Day | CNN Politics,"Steve Bannon was released from federal prison Tuesday, according to a source with knowledge, emerging just a week before Election Day to retake the helm of his weakened right-wing media platform.
Bannon, a right-wing podcast host and the chief executive of Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, has remained a strident supporter of the former president. Even as he reported to federal prison in Connecticut in July, Bannon insisted he would influence the presidential race from behind bars and that his “War Room” podcast would continue to energize the Trump base.
Bannon was met early Tuesday morning by his daughter Maureen. He is expected to host his radio program later Tuesday morning.
He was convicted in 2022 on two counts of contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with a subpoena from the House Select Committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. He is continuing to appeal his conviction.
While in prison, Bannon digitally kept in touch with a small group of loyalists, including some who served as guest hosts for the podcast, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Bannon would in part discuss news of the day and politics including topics he thought about for the show.
However, Bannon’s MAGA megaphone has suffered in his absence. “War Room,” which frequently appeared in Apple’s Top Podcasts before Bannon reported to prison, fell off the charts by early July, according to data from Podchaser. By another measure, the podcast was once near the top of the Apple political podcast charts and has since fallen out of the top 25, per Podchaser data.
There are some signs that it’s ticking up slightly as Bannon prepares to return.
“Though we’ve been seeing election denial activists coming on the show still as a central hub, you see that ‘War Room,’ it wasn’t able to sustain itself without Bannon,” said Madeline Peltz, deputy director for rapid response at Media Matters, a progressive nonprofit that does extensive media monitoring.
Peltz still predicted Bannon would be a prominent voice for election denialism if it appears Trump is coming up short after Election Day.
“I think it’s going to take some time to bring the audience back and to mobilize them,” Peltz said. “I don’t think the one-week period between now and the election is enough time to complete that, but I think really, you’ll see it kick into high gear in the post-election chaos that we’re all sort of anticipating.”
While Bannon’s show is mainly seen as an energizer for the Trump base, data from Edison Research’s podcast metrics found that nearly half of Bannon’s audience was made up of Republicans but about a third of listeners were independents.
On the “War Room” podcast, a cast of fill-in hosts cheered Bannon’s return.
Prominent election conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell offered a deal on his MyPillow products to celebrate Bannon’s release (free pillows, plus shipping and handling, with the relevant discount code.)
“It’s less than 24 hours until Stephen K. Bannon is back a free man and preaching the gospel of MAGA here in the ‘War Room,’” Natalie Winters, one of the podcast guest hosts said Monday.
Winters then turned her focus to the presidential race, claiming, “It’s not an election, it’s ballot warfare.” It’s the kind of incendiary rhetoric Bannon embraced and promoted as an early voice in the “Stop the Steal” movement in 2020.
In May, Bannon claimed on his podcast that “they’re going to do everything to steal this election,” as he reiterated the baseless claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.
“Bannon is one of the most talented broadcasters among his peers, in terms of taking current events, pulling out a kernel of truth from them, and then spinning an elaborate conspiracy theory on top of it, which then becomes the fuel for the action that’s taken by the grassroots in response to these lies,” Peltz from Media Matters said. “There’s really no one who has quite the same level of talent for that particular misinformation approach.”
To mark his release, Bannon’s team said he plans to hold a press conference Tuesday afternoon in New York.

Who, what, when and where? It can be valuable to take a step back from the day-to-day news and look with a wider lens at the election playing out.
Here are answers to some more general questions that can get lost at the end of the campaign.
When is Election Day?
US law requires a presidential election every four years. These general elections, since 1845, are required to occur on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. This year, that date is November 5.
States oversee their own elections, which means polling times vary from state to state. The first polls close on Election Day at 6 p.m. ET in some counties in Indiana and Kentucky, and the last polls close at 1 a.m. ET Wednesday, November 6, in Alaska. Waves of state polls close every hour in between. But many millions of Americans will vote early in person or by mail.
Get information about your state in CNN’s Voter Handbook.
Why does Election Day last more than one day?
Each state conducts their election a little bit differently. Some, like in Washington state, Oregon and Utah, are done almost entirely by mail, a process that stretches for weeks.
Every state has some form of early voting available, which opens the process to people who can’t get to the polls on Election Day and ensures as many people cast ballots as possible.
Who are the candidates this year?
The Democrat is Vice President Kamala Harris, who is on the ballot with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her vice presidential running mate.
The Republican is former President Donald Trump, who is running this year with Sen. JD Vance of Ohio.
There are other candidates, and the options vary by state. The Libertarian Party’s Chase Oliver is on most ballots, and the Green Party’s Jill Stein is an option in most states as well. The former Democrat Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is also on the ballot in many states. He had been running as an independent but has since endorsed Trump.
That said, the vast majority of Americans will vote for either Harris or Trump.
Why are Trump and Harris the main options?
The two major parties, Republicans and Democrats, each held primary elections across the country earlier in the year.
Despite the fact that many Republicans repudiated Trump after his supporters stormed the Capitol building following his loss in the 2020 election, the former president easily emerged from a crowded field of primary candidates to be the GOP nominee again this year. It’s the third straight election where Trump is the Republican nominee.
For Democrats, President Joe Biden dominated the primaries and faced only token opposition. But after the primary season, concerns about Biden’s age – he’s 81 – accelerated. After CNN hosted a debate in June in which Biden fared poorly against Trump, the president bowed to pressure and dropped out of the race before Democrats held their nominating convention.
Biden’s endorsement of Harris, his vice president, helped make her the consensus nominee despite the fact that she did not take part in primaries. No Democrats rose to challenge her at the convention in August.
When will we know who won?
It could take a while. CNN did not project a winner in 2020 until four days after Election Day. Multiple states were decided by incredibly close margins that year.
In 2016, Hillary Clinton conceded the day after Election Day even though counting was still happening in multiple states. She acknowledged she would not win.
Trump is unlikely ever to acknowledge defeat. If there are close margins in key states, it could take days to determine a winner. The good news is that many states have made changes since 2020 to make it easier for election officials to get a head start on processing mail-in ballots, which take longer to count.
In 2000, one of the closest elections in US history, the winner was not apparent until 36 days after the election when the US Supreme Court ended recounts in Florida. Things were complicated that year by flawed paper ballots in some Florida counties, something that should not be a problem this year.
It could also end up not being that close of an election at all, and networks like CNN could project a winner on election night. We shall see.
What are the main issues?
One overriding issue is the cost of living. Prices spiked after the Covid-19 pandemic, and Trump has capitalized on a nostalgia people have for a time when the cost of groceries was lower. His plan to impose across-the-board tariffs on foreign goods might spike prices further, according to economists, but he has an advantage over Harris on the economy, according to polling.
Trump voters are also motivated by immigration. He would deport millions of migrants who crossed the border illegally, and he would all but shut down the US border.
For Harris voters, the issue of abortion is key. After the Supreme Court, with a third of justices appointed by Trump, overturned Roe v. Wade, Harris has framed reproductive rights as matter of personal freedom and has pledged to protect those rights.
There are ballot initiatives in key states to enshrine abortion rights. The issue is helping drive a gender gap in the vote, according to polling.
There is also the key issue of democracy. Trump was accused by the Justice Department of election interference after he tried to overturn the 2020 election results. That’s a nonstarter for many Democrats. Republicans, meanwhile, have largely grown to accept Trump’s role in the effort to keep Biden from the White House after he won in 2020. And many of them, after years of Trump questioning the system, now doubt the 2020 results themselves.
Trump was convicted on felony charges in New York related to hush money payments before the 2016 election. His sentencing is set for late November, meaning it will be after Election Day. However, his felony convictions, or even the possibility of jail time, don’t make Trump ineligible to serve as president.
How is a president elected in the US?
More than 150 million people are likely to cast ballots for the office of president on or before Election Day. But it’s 538 electors who will choose the president in a process that snakes through December and January.
When voters cast ballots, they are actually selecting a slate of electors tied to the candidate who wins the popular vote in each state.
The electors will then cast votes for president and vice president in each state’s capitol on December 17. That meeting is also known as the Electoral College, and it’s required in the Constitution.
Those electoral votes will be counted in the chamber of the House of Representatives on January 6, 2025, with the new Congress looking on.
The new president takes office on January 20, 2025.
How many electoral votes does each state get?
The number is tied to the size of a state’s congressional delegation, with one electoral vote for each senator and member of Congress.
The smallest states – Alaska, Delaware, the two Dakotas, Vermont and Wyoming – each get three.
With each additional member of Congress, a state gets one more elector. The most populous states are California (54 electoral votes), Texas (40 electoral votes) and Florida (30 electoral votes).
These numbers can change every 10 years because the Constitution requires an official population count, or census, and the number of congressional seats is then reapportioned. The most recent census occurred in 2020, so the number of electoral votes has changed.
Voters in Washington, DC, also get three electoral votes thanks to the 23rd Amendment, but they have no voting representation in the House or Senate. Other US citizens who don’t live in a state, like Puerto Ricans, aren’t so lucky when it comes to electoral votes.
How many electoral votes are there, and how many does it take to win the White House?
There are 538 electors. That figure is equal to 100 senators and 435 members of Congress, plus three votes for Washington, DC.
A majority of electoral votes is 270. Winning the White House is a mapping exercise for presidential candidates. They must pair the states that are safely in their column with enough battleground states to get to 270.
What are the battleground states in 2024?
There are thought to be seven states that could conceivably be won by either candidate. As a result, the campaigns have focused their energy in these areas. They can be broken up into two general categories.
3 Midwestern battlegrounds, aka “the blue wall” – These are the manufacturing and union-heavy states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. They used to be more reliably Democratic but have shifted in recent years as their populations have changed and as Trump has appealed to White voters without a college degree.
When Trump won the White House in 2016, he won all three. When Biden won in 2020, he won all three. If Harris wins all three this year, she will likely have the electoral votes to be president. But polls suggest close races in all three. Turnout will be key, which for Harris means appealing to suburban women and Black voters. All three states have urban centers.
The blue wall states usually vote the same way. The last time they did not all go to the same candidate was in 1988 – notably also a year when California was red and West Virginia was blue. In those eight elections since 1988, the only time the blue wall states went to a Republican was in 2016, when they were won by Trump.
4 Sun Belt battlegrounds – These states with growing populations include Arizona and Nevada in the West and North Carolina and Georgia in the East. Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina used to be more reliably Republican. Trump won North Carolina twice, but the margins were close in 2020. The last Democrat to win there was Barack Obama in 2008. Biden was the first Democrat to win Georgia since Bill Clinton in 1992 and Arizona since Clinton in 1996.
1 vote in Nebraska is a battleground – 48 states award their electoral votes winner-take-all to the victor in their state. Nebraska and Maine do it differently, awarding votes by congressional district. The state of Nebraska is safe Trump territory, but the congressional district around Omaha is a battleground. That one vote could end up being very important in the event of a close race in the Electoral College.
Note: It’s the reverse situation in Maine, the only other state that does not award all of its electors to the statewide winner. Trump could pick up a single electoral vote in Maine.
What if there’s a tie?
The total number of electoral votes, 538, is an even number, which means a tie is conceivable. It’s happened once before, in 1800, although the rules were a bit different then. If no candidate reaches the 270 votes needed to win the election, the new Congress would pick the president and the Senate would pick the vice president in what’s known as a “contingent election.”
Each of the 50 states would get one vote (sorry, Washington, DC). Republicans currently control more House delegations. Even if they lose the overall House majority in November, Republicans would still probably control more than half of the congressional delegations. Delegations in which there’s an even split between Republicans and Democrats (currently there are two) would not be counted.
Bottom line: An Electoral College tie would likely result in a Trump presidency.
In the Senate, it’s a simpler process. Each senator would get one vote to select the vice president. Democrats have a slim majority at the moment, but they are defending more seats on Election Day and there’s a good chance Republicans will control the Senate come January.
How are members of Congress elected, and why is the balance of power key?
Every two years, every seat in the House, all 435 of them, is up for grabs. Most of those seats are relatively safe for either Republicans or Democrats, but there is always the possibility that the majority changes hands.
Democrats are favored in 208 races and Republicans are favored in 212, according to preelection House race ratings from Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. With just 15 races listed as toss-ups, it’s likely that neither party will have a very large majority next year.
Changes in the balance of power have actually happened more in recent elections. This year, Republicans are heading into the election with a small majority, and it’s entirely possible that Democrats win their own small majority for the next House even if they lose the White House and control of the Senate.
It’s important for either party to control the House. Presidents need control to enact their priorities. The out-of-power party wants control to block the president’s priorities. In an ideal world, the two sides would work together to find consensus on issues like immigration and the tax code.
How do things work in the Senate?
It’s a little bit different in the Senate, where only a third of the seats are up for grabs every two years. Democrats are on defense as they try to defend their slim Senate majority.
Of the 34 seats for which there is an election this year, Democrats are defending 20 and Republicans are defending 13. Two of those Democratic seats, in West Virginia and Montana, are likely to be won by Republicans, according to the Senate race ratings. Another one, in Ohio, is rated as a toss-up.
Democrats hope they can pick up an unexpected win in either Texas or Florida, but Republicans are on pace to have a slim majority in the Senate next year. Assuming Republicans hold all of the seats they currently hold, they can control the chamber if they flip one Democratic seat and win the White House (the vice president breaks ties in the Senate) or win two seats regardless of the outcome of the presidential race.
No matter who has control of the Senate, neither party is expected to have a supermajority. That’s important because senators generally abide by a custom of respecting the filibuster. It usually requires 60 votes to enact major pieces of legislation, although both Republicans and Democrats have found ways around that in recent years.
Republicans found a way to enact tax cuts under Trump without 60 votes. Democrats did the same thing with their Inflation Reduction Act, which, among other things, aims to transition the US to a greener economy.",2024-10-29
CNN,Trump floats ending the federal income tax. Here’s what that would mean | CNN Politics,"After promising to eliminate taxes on tips, Social Security benefits and overtime pay, former President Donald Trump is taking aim at the largest levy of them all — the federal income tax.
With Election Day around the corner, Trump talked about his interest in ending the federal income tax in two high-profile interviews this week, harking back to the late 19th century, when the US relied on tariffs to fund federal spending. The former president has vowed to broadly impose tariffs, arguing they can generate trillions of dollars in revenue.
Speaking with barbers in the Bronx, New York, in a segment aired on Fox News on Monday, Trump said, “There is a way, if what I’m planning comes out.”
“When we were a smart country, in the 1890s … this is when the country was relatively the richest it ever was. It had all tariffs. It didn’t have an income tax,” Trump said after a barber asked whether it would be possible to jettison the federal income tax. “Now we have income taxes, and we have people that are dying. They’re paying tax, and they don’t have the money to pay the tax.”
A few days later, podcaster Joe Rogan asked Trump whether he was serious about replacing federal income taxes with tariffs.
“Yeah, sure, why not?” Trump said during his interview Friday on “The Joe Rogan Experience.”
Trump, who also floated the idea of ending the federal income tax in June, has not said whether he would eliminate federal corporate income and payroll taxes or just the individual income tax — which raises about half of the nearly $5 trillion in revenue that the federal government collects.
By contrast, tariffs bring in about 2% of federal revenue.
Eliminating the income tax could be a future “aspirational goal,” Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters Saturday, noting that the former president’s top priorities would be extending the expiring provisions of his 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and implementing the targeted tax cuts that Trump has rolled out.
‘Mathematically impossible’
Sweeping tariffs are a cornerstone of Trump’s economic platform for a second term, if he is elected. He has called for an across-the-board tariff of either 10% or 20% on all imports into the US, as well as a tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports.
The former president argues that tariffs, which he imposed to a lesser extent during his first term, would pay for his pricey array of proposals. He has repeatedly denied that American consumers would bear the brunt of the tariffs, inaccurately claiming that foreign countries would pay the levies.
Many federal budget experts, however, have poured cold water on the notion that tariffs could replace income taxes.
“It’s an absurd idea for many reasons, the biggest being that it is mathematically impossible to replace the income tax with tariffs,” Erica York, senior economist and research director at the right-leaning Tax Foundation, told CNN. “Imports are a much smaller tax base than taxable income, and there’s no way to squeeze enough revenue from taxing imports to fully replace taxing income. A swap like this would hike taxes on working-class taxpayers and invite harmful retaliation against US exports.”
Increasing tariffs would likely prompt Americans to purchase fewer imported goods, canceling out at least part of the hoped-for revenues, Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the right-leaning Manhattan Institute, told CNN.
“At first blush, fully replacing $2.4 trillion in income taxes would require a 75% tariff on America’s $3.2 trillion in annual imports,” he said. “However, even that unrealistically assumes that Americans continue purchasing the same imports at nearly double the price.”
What’s more, Trump had to spend part of the revenue raised from the tariffs he imposed in his first term bailing out industries, including agriculture, that were hurt by other nations’ retaliatory actions, Riedl said.
“So even the new revenues from Trump’s next round of tariffs may not provide much net budget savings,” he continued.
Even without eliminating the federal income tax, Trump’s economic package would increase the national debt by $7.5 trillion over a decade, according to a recent analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The nonpartisan watchdog group estimates that his tariffs proposal would bring in $2.7 trillion over 10 years.",2024-10-26
CNN,3 charts that help explain how Trump’s tariffs would work | CNN Politics,"If former President Donald Trump returns to the White House, tariffs will once again play a major role in his policy agenda.
Trump has repeatedly said he plans to impose an across-the-board tariff of either 10% or 20% on every import coming into the US, as well as a tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports, in a bid to encourage American manufacturing.
“To me, the most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff. And it’s my favorite word,” Trump said during an interview at the Economic Club of Chicago in mid-October.
On the campaign trail, Trump has described tariffs as a multiuse tool that will punish other countries for unfair trade practices, prevent US companies from moving overseas and bring in billions of dollars to reduce the federal deficit.
But as with many economic policies, there are trade-offs, and Trump doesn’t talk about the negative effect tariffs could have on US businesses and consumers. He’s also often falsely described how tariffs work and sparred with Bloomberg News editor-in-chief John Micklethwait during an interview when the journalist argued that the former president was ignoring the fact that tariffs raise prices.
Vice President Kamala Harris has referred to her opponent’s tariff policy as a “Trump Tax.” Several independent studies have found that the new tariffs, if implemented, would raise costs for the average middle-class family, with estimates ranging between $1,350 and $3,900 a year.
Here are three charts to help explain the impact of tariffs:
For years, Trump has inaccurately claimed that foreign countries pay the tariffs. But in reality, the tariff is paid by the US-based company that imports the good.
Study after study, including one from the federal government’s bipartisan US International Trade Commission, has found that Americans have borne almost the entire cost of Trump’s tariffs on Chinese products.
In total, Trump’s previous tariff actions put duties on about 14% of US imports – a relatively small share compared with the across-the-board tariff he has pledged to implement on 100% of imports if elected.
When Trump was in office, he implemented tariffs on about $380 billion worth of goods imported into the US, according to a Tax Foundation analysis.
These duties applied to thousands of Chinese-made products, including baseball hats, luggage, bicycles, TVs and sneakers. The Trump tariffs also hit foreign steel, aluminum, washing machines and solar panels.
The Biden-Harris administration has kept most of these tariffs in place and increased the rate of some of the duties.
Trump has said that if he wins the election, his administration could use tariffs to not only create US jobs but also bring in billions of dollars to help pay for other policy initiatives.
He’s proposed extending tax cuts implemented in 2017, as well as eliminating taxes on tips, overtime pay and Social Security benefits – and has claimed that he’ll still be able to cut the US deficit thanks to new revenue from his tariffs.
“Eventually our country will be making substantially more money, over and above cost, and we will start a massive debt reduction,” Trump said during an October speech at the Detroit Economic Club.
At a speech in September, Trump also said the tariff revenue could pay for a child care initiative. And CNBC reported that he’s floated the idea of replacing the federal income tax with tariff revenue.
When asked by podcast host Joe Rogan in October whether he was serious about replacing the federal income tax, Trump replied, “Yeah, sure, why not?”
Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller later told reporters that the idea is an “aspirational goal.”
But even if Trump implements tariffs on all US imports, the resulting revenue is unlikely to cover all these costs.
The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget recently estimated that Trump’s tariff plan would not generate enough revenue to pay for his other spending proposals.
Ultimately, the group estimated that Trump’s proposals would add $7.75 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. Harris’ proposals, by comparison, would add an estimated $3.95 trillion.

CNN,"Fact check: Trump, on a lying spree, made at least 40 separate false claims in two Pennsylvania speeches | CNN Politics","Former President Donald Trump is on a lying spree.
As Election Day draws nearer, the Republican presidential nominee has made false claim after false claim on a dizzying variety of subjects. He has both come up with new falsehoods on pressing issues, most notably the federal response to Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton, and repeated old favorites about subjects he has been railing about since his 2016 presidential campaign.
We went through the speeches Trump made at his two Wednesday campaign rallies in the critical swing state of Pennsylvania, one in Scranton and one in Reading. In those two addresses alone, he uttered at least 40 separate false claims.
Here is a fact check.
FEMA and migrants: Trump falsely claimed of the Federal Emergency Management Agency: “They have no money. You know where they gave the money? To illegal immigrants coming in.” He also said, “They spent all their funds; they have no funds to take care…”
This is false in two ways. FEMA does have money for the immediate responses to Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton, though a string of recent disasters has depleted its disaster relief fund; the fund had about $11 billion remaining as of Wednesday. And FEMA did not give all of its disaster relief money to undocumented people; rather, as mandated by Congress, FEMA also administers an entirely separate pool of money for sheltering migrants.
FEMA and employees: Trump added another false claim about FEMA, saying: “They have no workers, they have no nothing.” FEMA has more than 20,000 employees.
Harris and the response: Trump falsely claimed that as desperate people tried to survive Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, Vice President Kamala Harris “didn’t send anything or anyone at all” to help them. There were extensive federal and state rescue and relief efforts in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Helene. It’s true that some residents died and others were stranded for days, but the state was not ignored by Harris or the Biden administration; North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, has repeatedly thanked President Joe Biden for his assistance.
Schools and transgender children: Trump told a slightly vaguer version of his usual false story about schools supposedly obtaining or performing gender-affirming surgeries for transgender children behind their parents’ backs, saying, “Your child go goes to school, and they take your child. It was a ‘he.’ And comes back a ‘she.’ And they do this…And often without parental consent.”
There is no evidence that US schools have sent children into gender-affirming surgeries without their parents knowing or performed gender-affirming surgeries on site; Trump’s own presidential campaign could not provide a single example of any of this ever happening. Even in states where gender-affirming surgery is legal for people under age 18, parental consent is required before a minor can undergo such a procedure.
Trump’s opponents and the election: In Reading, Trump falsely claimed of his election opponents: “They are cheatin’ dogs, I will tell you that.” In Scranton, he falsely claimed, “Their first meeting is: ‘How do we cheat?’” This is all nonsense. There is no basis for the claim that Trump’s opponents are election cheaters.
Harris’ previous presidential campaign: Trump repeated his false claim that, when Harris ran for president in 2020, “she was the first one to drop out, of like 22 people” in the Democratic primary. In fact, 13 other Democratic candidates dropped out of that primary before Harris exited in December 2019 – including the sitting or former governors of Washington, Montana and Colorado; the sitting mayor of New York City; and sitting or former members of the House of Representatives and Senate.
Harris and the press: Trump falsely claimed of Harris: “She doesn’t do any interviews.” Trump is entitled to argue that Harris has not done a sufficient number of interviews as the Democratic presidential nominee, but the assertion she doesn’t do “any” is wrong; Harris has done multiple interviews in recent weeks. Notably, Harris did an interview with the CBS News show “60 Minutes,” which aired Monday, while Trump backed out of his own interview with the show.
Harris-Walz and the Supreme Court: After correctly noting that Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, recently expressed support for getting rid of the Electoral College, Trump falsely claimed, “They want to add… they’re thinking about – first time I heard this number – 25: they want to have 25 Supreme Court justices.” There is no basis for the claim that Harris or Walz is pushing for a 25-justice Supreme Court.
Walz and menstrual products in schools: Trump disparaged Walz as “Tampon Tim,” then said, “You know why they call him that? ’Cause they sell tampons, with special legislation, in boys’ locker rooms.” Trump’s claim is false. The law Walz signed in 2023 requires schools to provide free menstrual products in bathrooms, not the sale of menstrual products in locker rooms – and all 18 public school districts that responded to CNN’s questions about the law say they do not provide the products in boys’ bathrooms.

Wind power: Trump repeated a familiar nonsensical story about how the use of wind power means people “can’t watch” television if “there’s no wind tonight.” Using wind power as part of a mix of power sources does not cause power outages when the wind isn’t blowing, as the federal Department of Energy explained on its website even during the Trump administration.
The Biden administration and electric vehicles: Trump falsely claimed that under a Biden administration electric vehicle mandate, “everybody’s got to have an electric car almost immediately.” There is no Biden administration requirement that consumers must buy an electric car or give up their existing gas-powered cars, “almost immediately” or otherwise. The Biden administration has made a push to get automakers to reduce emissions and adopt electric vehicles, but there is not a mandate for consumers; the tailpipe rules for automakers that were unveiled by the administration earlier this year aim to have electric vehicles make up 35% to 56% new vehicles sold in 2032.
The Paris climate accord and emissions: Trump repeated his false claim that under the Paris climate accord, the US “had to pay a trillion dollars” while some other countries didn’t have to pay.
Trump’s “trillion” figure is a wild exaggeration. Under the Obama administration, the US paid $1 billion of a $3 billion commitment it originally made in 2014. After Trump pulled the country out of the Paris accord, the US paid nothing to the global finance goal. And while Biden pledged $11.4 billion annually from the US, this level of funding hasn’t materialized. That’s because Congress, responsible for appropriating the nation’s budget, has allocated only a fraction of that – roughly $1 billion in 2022.
Harris’ comments on fracking: Trump said, “Listen to Kamala in her own words very recently,” then played two video clips in which Harris said she was in favor of banning fracking. But those clips are from 2019, beyond any reasonable definition of “very recently.” Harris has said during the 2024 campaign that she no longer favors banning fracking.
Venezuela, prisons and migration: Trump falsely claimed, “In Venezuela, many countries, they’re emptying their prisons into our country.” This is false. Trump has never corroborated this claim about Venezuela, let alone “many countries,” and experts have told CNN, PolitiFact and FactCheck.org that they know of no evidence for it.
“We have no evidence that the Venezuelan government is emptying its prisons or mental health institutions to send them outside the country, in other words, to the U.S. or any other country,” Roberto Briceño-León, founder and director of the Venezuelan Observatory of Violence, an independent organization that tracks violence in the country, said in an email to CNN in June, after Trump made similar claims.
Venezuela, criminals and migration: Adding another colorful story about Venezuela, Trump falsely claimed that “they take the criminal gangs from Caracas off the streets and they bus them into the United States and drop them.” This is false. There is no evidence of Venezuelan authorities somehow busing gang members into the US.
The world prison population: Trump repeated his false claim that “the prison population all over the world is down, because they put them in our country.” The recorded global prison population increased from October 2021 to April 2024, from at least about 10.77 million people to at least about 10.99 million people, according to the World Prison Population List compiled by experts in the United Kingdom.
“I do a daily news search to see what’s going on in prisons around the world and have seen absolutely no evidence that any country is emptying its prisons and sending them all to the US,” Helen Fair, co-author of the prison population list and research fellow at the Institute for Crime & Justice Policy Research at Birkbeck, University of London, said in June, when Trump made a similar claim.
The number of migrants: Trump, speaking about migration, falsely claimed that “21 million people – plus – came into our nation” under the Biden-Harris administration. Through August, the country had recorded about 10.3 million nationwide “encounters” with migrants during the Biden-Harris administration, including millions who were rapidly expelled from the country; even adding in so-called “gotaways” who evaded detection, estimated by House Republicans as being roughly 2 million, there’s no way the total is “21 million.”
Harris, migrants and criminals: Trump, criticizing Harris on immigration, again wrongly described a set of statistics that was released in September. He falsely claimed in Scranton, “You saw that last week: 13,099 murderers allowed to come in, through them.” He falsely claimed in Reading that “as we speak she has – and this was just announced last week – 13,099, so over 13,000 illegal alien convicted murderers, roaming free in our country.”
This 13,099 figure includes people who are incarcerated in federal, state and local prisons and jails – and it includes people who entered the country over decades, including during Trump’s administration, not just under Biden and Harris. You can read more here.
Harris’ record as attorney general: Trump falsely claimed that when Harris was attorney general of California, “she said under no circumstances” will people be prosecuted for the crimes of child sex trafficking, assault with a deadly weapon or the rape of an unconscious person. Harris did not say anything like that; Trump was grossly mischaracterizing a debate over the language Harris’ office used to summarize California ballot initiatives.
Trump’s border wall: Trump repeated his false claim that “I built over 500 miles of wall” on the southern border. Official government data shows 458 miles were built under Trump – including both wall built where no barriers had existed before and wall built to replace previous barriers.
Trump’s crowds: Trump falsely claimed of his rallies: “We never have an empty seat.” There have been empty seats at numerous Trump rallies over the years – including hundreds at this very rally in Reading. And at many Trump rallies, some once-filled seats empty out during his speeches when supporters leave.
Trump’s crowd in Butler: Trump falsely claimed there were “over 100,000 people” at the rally he held Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania, at the same site where a gunman had attempted to assassinate him in July. CNN affiliate KDKA in Pittsburgh reported that the Secret Service put the crowd at 24,000 people, while the Trump-supporting sheriff of Blair County, Pennsylvania, James Ott, said in his speech at the rally itself (more than three hours before Trump took the stage) that he was looking out at “21,000-plus people.”
Trump’s response to the assassination attempt: Trump, speaking of his response to the attempted assassination in July, falsely claimed, “I said as I was getting up – before I even got up – I said, ‘How many people were killed?’ Because, you know, it was wall to wall people, and I said, ‘How many people were killed?’ They said, ‘We think three, sir,’ and I said, ‘That’s not good.’”
Trump’s rally microphone picked up what was said by Trump and Secret Service agents while he was on the ground and just after, and he did not ask, before or after he got up, how many people were killed. It’s possible he did so after he was whisked off stage (and, of course, possible he was genuinely misremembering what happened in such a traumatic moment).
Trump and firefighters: Trump falsely claimed, “We got the firefighters endorse us, you probably heard.” But the actual recent national news was that the International Association of Firefighters had decided not to endorse any candidate in the race; while Trump is free to argue that this was a victory for him, given that the union endorsed Biden in 2020, it was not an actual endorsement. And while there were some people in the Scranton crowd holding “Scranton Firefighters for Trump” signs, the Scranton chapter of the union also has not issued an endorsement. The president of the chapter told the Scranton Times-Tribune that none of the people he saw holding the signs were active or retired local firefighters.
Trump and classified documents: Speaking of the criminal case against him over his post-presidency retention of classified documents, Trump repeated his false claim that “I had the Presidential Records Act; I was totally allowed to do it.” The Presidential Records Act says that, the moment a president leaves office, the National Archives and Records Administration gets custody and control of all presidential records from their administration. (Trump’s case was dismissed by a federal judge in July on other grounds, that the appointment of special counsel Jack Smith was unconstitutional; Smith has appealed.)
The New York Times and the Russia investigation: Trump, calling claims about his 2016 campaign’s connections to Russia a “scam,” repeated his false claim that The New York Times “admitted they were wrong” about the coverage that won its journalists a Pulitzer Prize along with journalists from The Washington Post.
“The claim is completely false,” Times spokesperson Charlie Stadtlander said in an email to CNN in 2023, when Trump made a similar claim; Stadtlander noted that “the award was upheld by the Pulitzer Prize Board after an independent review” and said the Times’ reporting “was also substantiated by the Mueller investigation and Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee investigation into the matter.”
The New York Times and the 2016 election: Trump repeated a false claim he made during his presidency, saying of The New York Times’ coverage of the 2016 election: “Remember in 2016 they had to do an editorial apologizing to their readers because they said, ‘He’s going to lose’…and then I won?”
As the Times noted in 2017 in response to such Trump claims, it did not apologize for its 2016 election coverage. It did publish a post-election letter, from then-executive editor Dean Baquet and publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr., that said the election had raised several questions, including this: “Did Donald Trump’s sheer unconventionality lead us and other news outlets to underestimate his support among American voters?” But the letter did not include an apology, to Trump or anyone else.
Trump and the defeat of ISIS: Trump repeated his false claim that “we defeated ISIS in four weeks; it was supposed to take four or five years.” The ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency.
Military equipment surrendered to the Taliban: Trump repeated his false claim that “we gave $85 billion worth” of US military equipment to the Taliban. Trump’s figure is a massive exaggeration; the Pentagon has estimated that the equipment abandoned to the Taliban by Afghan forces upon their 2021 collapse was worth about $7.1 billion – a chunk of the roughly $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021.
Biden and foreign income: Trump repeated his false claim that “Biden got a lot of money from China.” After years of investigation by House Republicans, there is still no evidence Biden has received any Chinese money.
Chris Wallace and a question about the Biden family: Trump told his familiar false story about how he had asked Biden at a 2020 presidential debate why the wife of a mayor of Moscow had paid Biden $3.5 million – in fact, the money was sent to a firm connected to the president’s son Hunter Biden, not to the president – but moderator Chris Wallace, then of Fox News and now of CNN, had interjected to say, “Well, please don’t ask him that question.” Wallace never did that. As the transcript shows, Wallace interjected during this debate exchange to try to get Trump to allow Biden to answer Trump’s question about the payment, not to stop Trump from asking.
Inflation: Trump repeated his false claim that inflation under Biden and Harris is “the worst inflation in the history of our country.” Trump could fairly say that the US inflation rate hit a 40-year high in June 2022, when it was 9.1%, but that was not close to the all-time record of 23.7%, set in 1920, and the rate has since plummeted; the most recent available inflation rate at the time Trump spoke here was 2.5% in August.
Mortgage rates: Trump falsely claimed that young people can’t buy a house because interest rates are higher than 10%: “It’s not 10%, it’s 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 percent.” This is false. The average rate on a standard 30-year fixed mortgage was 6.12% in the week ending October 3, according to mortgage financing provider Freddie Mac, and 6.32% in the week ending October 10.
Trump’s tax cut: Trump repeated his false claim that “I gave you, as you know, the largest tax cut in the history of our country.” Expert analyses have found that his 2017 tax cut law was not the largest in US history, either in percentage of gross domestic product or in inflation-adjusted dollars.
Tariffs on China: Trump repeated two of his regular false claims about tariffs on imported Chinese products. He falsely claimed that China “paid hundreds of billions of dollars” in these tariffs during his presidency, then falsely claimed that before his presidency, “nobody ever brought in 10 cents, not one other – not 10 cents, you check those records.”
We’ve checked, and the truth is that the US was generating billions per year in revenue from tariffs on China before Trump took office; in fact, the US has had tariffs on Chinese imports since the 1700s. Second, US importers pay these tariffs, not China, and study after study has found that Americans bore the overwhelming majority of the cost of Trump’s tariffs.
The 1890s and tariffs: Touting the supposed benefits of tariffs, Trump falsely claimed that in the 1890s, when the US had very high tariffs, “Our country was the richest it ever was.” The US is far richer today than in the 1890s; per capita gross domestic product is now many times higher than it was then.
The trade deficit with China: Trump repeated his frequent false claim that the US trade deficit with China has averaged “$500 billion” per year. The US has never had a $500 billion trade deficit with China even if you only count trade in goods and ignore the services trade in which the US traditionally runs a surplus with China; the all-time record, about $418 billion, was set under Trump in 2018.
Harris and taxes: Trump played a deceptively edited video showing “The View” co-host Meghan McCain saying to Harris in 2019, “Everything from a 70 to 80% tax rate,” and Harris responding, “I think that’s fantastic.”
This video cuts out key words from the exchange; Harris was not specifically endorsing high tax rates when she made the “fantastic” comment.
Here’s the transcript of the 2019 exchange:
McCain: “Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is the new darling of the party. She officially has more Twitter followers than Nancy Pelosi. She was on ‘60 Minutes’ this weekend proudly calling herself a radical. And she’s promoting policies like saying that every single carbon emission in the country, every car, should be eliminated within the next 11 years, everything from a 70 to 80 percent tax rate. Do you agree that she could possibly – and this ideology, of the socialist left – could splinter your party?”
Harris: “No. You know, I think that she is challenging the status quo. I think that’s fantastic. I think that – you know, I used to teach, before, especially before – in the last few years – and the thing that I always loved about teaching was when you teach, it requires you to defend the premise. And it requires you to re-examine the premise. And question, is it still relevant? Is it – does it have impact? Does it have meaning? And I think that she is introducing bold ideas that should be discussed. And I think it’s good for the party, I frankly think it’s good for the country. Let’s look at the bold ideas. And I’m eager that we have those discussions. And when we are able to defend status quo, then do it, and if there are – you know, if there’s not merit to that, then let’s explore new ideas.”
Biden’s documents case: Trump falsely claimed in Reading that, in an investigation into Biden’s handling of classified documents, “Biden was essentially convicted” and in Scranton that “they ruled on him, they said he’s guilty.” Biden was not convicted, “essentially” or not, and was not found guilty; in fact, Biden was not even charged with a crime. The special counsel in the case, Robert Hur, wrote in his public report that “the evidence does not establish Mr. Biden’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt,” adding that “several defenses are likely to create reasonable doubt as to such charges.”
A supposed Biden gaffe: Mocking Biden’s gaffes, Trump falsely claimed, “But the worst was when he was in New Hampshire and he said, ‘It’s great to be in Florida.’ That’s palm trees.” This never happened. Biden has certainly made various geographic gaffes, as has Trump, but he never said he was in Florida when he was actually in New Hampshire.",2024-10-10
CNN,Michigan autoworkers see more enthusiasm for Harris — but also more sexism and racism | CNN Politics,"Tonya Rincon just retired and is “learning to cook again.” But most new hobbies need to wait. Election Day is near, and Rincon is trying to help her union and Vice President Kamala Harris win the blue-collar battle for Michigan.
“I think it’s still about 50-50 among union autoworkers,” said Rincon, a member of United Auto Workers Local 900 and a 30-year Ford assembly worker.
Rincon long ago lost patience with supporters of former President Donald Trump in the Ford assembly plant just across the road from her union hall.
“They think the Democrats are going to mandate all electric vehicles and it is going to kill our jobs,” Rincon said in an interview near her home in Wayne. “They think they are going to benefit from the Trump tax cuts even though we don’t make enough money to benefit from the Trump tax cuts.”
With time running short, her focus as she volunteers to knock on doors is on workers who are open to voting for a Democrat. She says many see things differently since the dramatic July shift from President Joe Biden to Harris atop the Democratic ticket.
“There’s a little bit more enthusiasm among some of my female colleagues,” Rincon said. “Couple of my male co-workers are pretty ambivalent about Harris. We may have lost a tiny margin of support, because sexism is a real thing, you know. I don’t think they are going to switch to Trump. I think they just may stay home.”
Rincon is participating in our All Over the Map project, an effort to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in battleground states and are part of critical voting blocs.
We first met in June and learned quickly that Rincon speaks bluntly. Back then, she was candid about a low level of enthusiasm even among those planning to support Biden.
Now, as she volunteers to help elect Harris, she takes issue with male colleagues who would vote for Biden but are wavering about Harris.
“They are just sexist,” she said. “They are like, you know, ‘I’m not sure she can do it. I don’t think the country is ready for a female president.’”
Trying to win them over is critical for Harris in a state that’s so close and so crucial to her path to victory. It’s also important because the United Auto Workers leadership — which endorsed Harris over the summer — is trying to get more members to make voting decisions based on the issues that are key to labor.
“It’s a pretty easy decision to make if you compare the policies side by side,” Rincon said.
Rincon’s door knocking gives her unique insight on why the math of this campaign is so different and unpredictable.
At one house, she meets a younger voter who voted for Biden in 2020 but is supporting the Green Party’s Jill Stein this year because of anger at how the White House has handled the Israel-Hamas conflict.
“People got to go somewhere with their grief and anger,” Rincon said. “I can have a conversation. That’s all I can do.”
Then, a voter Rincon expects to be Republican but who shares support for Harris.
“There are some people who are just tired of the drama,” Rincon said. “People are just, ‘I want this to be over. I want to make politics boring again.’”
Her take two weeks out: “It’s really, really close.”
New energy for Harris — but also more division
Walter Robinson Jr. agrees it is close — and says there is more emotion on both sides since the July switch to Harris.
“It’s more energy and it’s probably more division,” said Robinson. He sees a net plus for Harris since the switch. In June, with Biden as the candidate, he shared Rincon’s view the Wayne plant was split 50-50.
“Right now, I would probably say it is about 60-40” for Harris, Robinson said. “More people have more energy about the Democratic candidate now.”
The tone of debate, he says, has taken a turn for the worse.
“They have been saying some very disparaging things about the vice president,” Robinson said of Trump supporters. Just about every day, Robinson said, he has to decide how much to push back.
“They parrot what (Trump) puts out there,” he said. “The sexist and the racist things. I call them out, but I’m not going to spend too much time because I know that I’m not going to change their mind.”
Robinson helps with UAW organizing just about every weekend, knocking on doors at labor households in the Detroit suburbs. As time runs short, he sometimes thinks about what it would mean to elect a woman of color as president.
“That’s another ceiling that shows we are kind of moving toward a more inclusive nation,” said Robinson, who is Black. “That would be good to see. If she wins, hopefully all hell doesn’t break loose.”
A Trump voter who doesn’t believe everything he says
Our return visit with 30-plus-year Ford worker Bill Govier was a reminder the Democratic ticket switch was not the only big candidate news this year. In June, Govier said he was intrigued by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
But Kennedy has now ended his third-party campaign and endorsed Trump.
“RFK joining Trump, effectively, I couldn’t script it any better,” Govier said. “I love the idea of Donald Trump being the commander in chief. I love the idea of how Donald Trump handles the nefarious characters in the world.”
Govier voted twice for Barack Obama but has turned anti-establishment in recent years. If Trump wins, Govier voiced hope he would bring Kennedy and former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii into his administration. Both are former Democrats who frequently wander into conspiracy theories.
Govier said he has a hard time taking Harris seriously, saying, among other things, she laughs too much.
“What is it?” he said of the Harris message. “You’re the incumbent who wouldn’t do anything different or are you the underdog who wants change?”
Govier also supported Trump in 2016 and 2020. From the beginning, he says Trump critics have overreacted to what Govier insists are exaggerations, not outrages.
“He does it for effect,” Govier said. “I don’t believe that Trump really believes someone’s eating cats and dogs. I don’t believe that he’s going to call the National Guard out and, at gunpoint, round up every migrant and force them across the border. I don’t believe that for a second. But I do believe he sensationalizes things. That’s how he’s always talked. He’s always been that way.”
Why a longtime Democrat is voting Trump
Joseph Knowles has always been a Democrat. Until now.
“I’m independent now,” Knowles said in an interview at his home in Clinton Township, part of blue-collar Macomb County north of Detroit.
Knowles, who is Black, attended a Trump rally earlier this year.
“I took it from my mom, my auntie, my cousins, my sister — they came at me,” Knowles said. Relatives mentioned how Trump treats women, demeans Black people and conducted himself on January 6, 2021.
But Knowles said none of that matters to him.
“All I care about right now is how am I going to be able to take care of my wife and kids,” Knowles said.
Knowles is one of 1,100 UAW members recently laid off by Stellantis, the parent company of Chrysler and Jeep.
He blames corporate greed and said the company is breaking a promise it made in contract negotiations with the UAW last year.
But he assigns “second blame” to Biden and his administration.
“Because of the EV mandates,” he said.
The Biden administration, which has laid out future electric vehicle sales targets for new cars, has not mandated anyone buy them. And there are currently more automobile manufacturing jobs in the United States than at any point of the Trump presidency. But his union supporters here routinely parrot Trump in saying the industry is devastated because of Biden administration clean-energy policies.
Knowles echoes another Trump line in voicing his support for mass deportation of undocumented immigrants.
“If it is done legally and they cross correctly, I have no problem with it,” Knowles said. “But if you do it the wrong way, I think you should get rounded up and just thrown out. I have no problem with that because it jeopardizes my way of providing for my kids if they take jobs.”
He has never voted Republican before. But he finds himself in a new place: struggling to explain being laid off to his four sons and ignoring or deflecting criticism from family members who are harshly critical of his plans to vote Trump.
“I’m desperate,” Knowles said. “So, I’m wanting to try anything right now to make sure I can fulfill my responsibility and to take care of my wife and kids. That’s all I care about.”",2024-10-21
CNN,Promises Kamala Harris has made so far in her campaign,"Promises Kamala Harris has made so far in her campaign
Editor's Note: CNN's What Matters newsletter connects the dots of the ever-changing political landscape. Click here to sign up for free.
With her presidential campaign in full swing, Vice President Kamala Harris is revealing how she will address the key issues facing the nation.
In policy proposals, speeches and rallies, she has voiced support for continuing many of President Joe Biden’s measures, such as providing tax credits to middle-class and lower-income families, lowering drug costs and eliminating so-called junk fees. She describes her vision as “an opportunity economy” that focuses on strengthening the middle class and punishes bad actors who try to unfairly raise costs.
But Harris has made it clear that she has her own views on some key matters, particularly Israel’s treatment of Gazans in its war with Hamas. Generally, her agenda contains an amped-up series of progressive proposals, though her campaign has confirmed that she’s moved away from several of her more notable left-leaning stances from her 2020 presidential run, such as her interest in a single-payer health insurance system and a ban on fracking.
Harris is also expected to put her own stamp and style on matters ranging from abortion to the economy to immigration, as she aims to walk a fine line of taking credit for the administration’s accomplishments while not being jointly blamed by voters for its shortcomings.
She is now pitching an economic agenda focused on using government money and regulations to address higher costs, though most of her plan would require congressional approval. The measures would also prove pricey, and the Harris campaign has not provided many details about the proposals and how she would pay for them.
Like Biden, she intends to contrast her vision for America with that of former President Donald Trump. (See Trump’s campaign promises here.)
“In this moment, I believe we face a choice between two different visions for our nation: one focused on the future, the other focused on the past,” she told members of the historically Black sorority Zeta Phi Beta at an event in Indianapolis in late July. “And with your support, I am fighting for our nation’s future.”
Here’s what we know about Harris’ views:
Economy
High prices are a top concern for many Americans who are struggling to afford the cost of living after a spell of steep inflation. Many voters give Biden poor marks for his handling of the economy, and Harris may also face their wrath.
Harris has talked about the key pillars of her economic vision – particularly strengthening the middle class – on the campaign trail and in an 82-page policy paper that the campaign released in late September. However, she has not provided many details on her proposals.
As part of her economic agenda, Harris wants to counter the increase in food costs, which she argues stems in part from some big grocery chains that are keeping prices high even though their production costs have leveled off.
To do so, she is calling for the first-ever federal ban on price gouging on food and groceries. The policy paper specified that the ban would be aimed at big corporations unfairly exploiting consumers during crises and emergencies to increase their profits and compared Harris’ idea to similar price-gouging bans already in place in 37 states, including Texas and Florida.
Harris would also secure new authority for the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general to investigate and penalize companies that unfairly exploit consumers in the quest for excessive profits on food and groceries.
Also, she has proposed increasing a tax deduction for new small businesses to $50,000, up from $5,000. Plus, she would take several steps to cut the red tape that small businesses face, including creating a standard deduction for them and making it easier for them to operate across state lines.
Harris is also looking to help Black and Latino entrepreneurs and others by providing 1 million fully forgivable loans of up to $20,000 to start or grow a business.
The vice president has also pledged to strengthen the manufacturing sector by creating a new “America Forward” tax credit. It would be targeted at investment and job creation in key strategic industries, according to the policy paper, which mentions steel and iron, biotechnology, artificial intelligence, semiconductors, aerospace, autos and farming. Her investments in American innovation would cost about $100 billion and would be paid for by international tax reform, which Congress must approve.
“We will prioritize investments for strengthening factory towns, retooling existing factories, hiring locally and working with unions because no one that grows up in America's greatest industrial or agricultural centers should be abandoned,” she said during a late September speech in Pittsburgh.
Plus, Harris said she’d double the number of registered apprenticeships by the end of her first term, as well as increase skills-based hiring and eliminate degree requirements.
Her platform also calls for boosting investment in community development financial institutions, or CDFIs, which are dedicated to serving low-income people and communities that are missed by traditional lenders.
Harris has also committed to raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, in keeping with a long-standing Democratic goal. The federal minimum wage has been $7.25 since 2009.
In her campaign speeches, Harris has echoed many of the same economic themes as Biden, saying she wants to give Americans more opportunities to get ahead.
She promised at a late July rally to continue the Biden administration’s drive to eliminate so-called junk fees and to fully disclose all charges, such as for events, lodging and car rentals.
On day one, I will take on price gouging and bring down costs. We will ban more of those hidden fees and surprise late charges that banks and other companies use to pad their profits.”
Taxes
Harris has proposed using tax credits to provide relief to middle class and lower-income Americans. Her plan revives or extends temporary measures that Biden and congressional Democrats enacted in major packages when the party controlled Congress during the first two years of Biden’s term.
Harris’ proposal would restore the American Rescue Plan’s popular expansion of the child tax credit to as much as $3,600, up from $2,000, and call for it to be made permanent. The enhancement was only in effect in 2021.
Her plan would restore the American Rescue Plan’s enhancement of the earned income tax credit, known as the EITC, which increased the maximum credit for workers without dependent children to roughly $1,500. That previous boost was only for 2021.
Plus, the proposal would also add a new child tax credit of up to $6,000 for middle-class and lower-income families with children in their first year of life.
There's one more way I will help families deal with rising costs, and that's by letting you keep more of your hard-earned money.”
And Harris has also promised to end federal income taxes on tips, sparking Trump’s ire that she is copying his campaign promise. Tips would remain subject to payroll taxes under Harris’ plan.
To help pay for these and other measures on her wish list, Harris would raise the corporate tax rate to 28%, up from the current 21% rate set by Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Doing so would raise about $1 trillion over the next decade, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
The vice president also wants to raise the long-term capital gains rate to 28%, up from the current 20% rate, for those earning more than $1 million. That’s a break from Biden’s proposal to increase the capital gains rate to the top rate he wants to levy on ordinary income – 39.6%. High earners are also subject to an additional 3.8% net investment income tax, which Biden wants to lift to 5%.
Harris also said she supports Biden’s Billionaire Minimum Income Tax proposal, which seeks to ensure that those worth more than $100 million pay a federal income tax rate of at least 25% on their income – including unrealized gains on assets, which are not currently taxed.
Plus, she is in favor of quadrupling the tax on stock buybacks to 4%, as the president proposed in his fiscal year 2025 budget.
Housing
Harris has rolled out a three-section plan aimed at addressing the nation’s housing shortage. Parts of it build on proposals that Biden has already unveiled.
The vice president’s plan promises to provide up to $25,000 in down-payment support for first-time homebuyers. The down-payment support would apply to working families who have paid rent on time for two years, with more generous support for first-time homebuyers. The plan would also provide a $10,000 tax credit for first-time homebuyers, something Biden proposed earlier this year.
The plan would allow for more than 1 million first-time buyers per year, including first-generation homebuyers, to access the funds, according to her campaign.
Harris is also calling for the building of 3 million new housing units. To spur construction, she would provide a first-ever tax incentive for builders who build starter homes sold to first-time buyers. She also would expand an existing tax incentive for building affordable rental housing.
By the end of my first term, we will end America's housing shortage by building 3 million new homes and rentals that are affordable for the middle class.”
The plan also highlights two main proposals that aim to lower rent costs in the US. The first would block landlords from using algorithm-driven price-setting tools to set rents. The second would discourage wealthy investors from buying up properties and marking up rents in bulk by removing tax benefits for investors who buy large numbers of single-family rental homes.
Health care
Harris’ health care platform builds on the Biden administration’s efforts to reduce prescription drug costs.
She is calling to expand the current $35 monthly cap on out-of-pocket costs for insulin and the upcoming $2,000 annual limit on out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs generally to all Americans, not just Medicare enrollees. These caps were put in place for those on Medicare in the Inflation Reduction Act. The $2,000 limit on Medicare Part D drug costs takes effect in January.
(The three major insulin manufacturers in the US offer price caps or savings programs that lower the cost of insulin to $35 for many patients – a move Biden pushed for in his State of the Union address last year.)
Harris’ plan would also accelerate the speed of Medicare’s drug price negotiations so that the costs of more medications come down faster. The Biden administration just announced the results of the first-ever round of negotiations, which is expected to result in $6 billion in savings for Medicare and a $1.5 billion reduction in out-of-pocket costs for seniors when the lower prices take effect in 2026.
The vice president would use some of that savings to establish a Medicare at Home program, which would provide home health aides to enrollees who cannot independently handle activities of daily living, such as bathing and eating. In addition, Harris is proposing that Medicare cover hearing aids and exams, eye exams, and new glasses and lenses.
Also, as part of her plan to help rural communities, Harris would recruit 10,000 health care professionals by expanding scholarships, loan forgiveness and other programs for doctors and nurses who will work in rural and tribal areas. In addition, she would launch a new grant program to train and fund community health workers in rural areas and expand grants to community and rural health centers.
Harris also supports expanding rural telehealth services by permanently extending Medicare coverage of telehealth benefits and by doubling federal funding for telehealth equipment and technology.
Plus, she is calling to reduce the number of “ambulance deserts” by increasing funding and technical support for emergency medical technicians and first responders, as well as providing more resources for ambulances, lifesaving equipment and first-responder stations. And she would give grants to volunteer ambulance programs.
Consumer debt
Hefty debt loads, which weigh on people’s finances and hurt their ability to buy homes, get car loans or start small businesses, are also an area of interest to Harris.
In her economic plan, she pledged to work with states to cancel medical debt for millions of Americans and help them avoid falling behind on health care bills in the future. States and municipalities have used American Rescue Plan funds to cancel $7 billion of medical debt for up to 3 million Americans, according to the campaign.
Harris has been a leader in the White House’s efforts to ban medical debt from credit reports, noting that those with medical debt are no less likely to repay a loan than those who don’t have unpaid medical bills.
Also, as vice president, she has promoted the Biden administration’s initiatives on student debt, which have so far forgiven more than $168 billion for nearly 4.8 million borrowers. In mid-July, Harris said in a post on X that “nearly 950,000 public servants have benefitted” from student debt forgiveness, compared with only 7,000 when Biden was inaugurated.
A potential Harris administration could keep that momentum going – though some of Biden’s efforts have gotten tangled up in litigation, such as a program aimed at cutting monthly student loan payments for roughly 3 million borrowers enrolled in a repayment plan the administration implemented last year.
Abortion
Harris took on the lead role of championing abortion rights for the administration after Roe v. Wade was overturned in June 2022. This past January, she started a “reproductive freedoms tour” to multiple states, including a stop in Minnesota thought to be the first by a sitting US president or vice president at an abortion clinic.
On abortion access, Harris embraced more progressive policies than Biden in the 2020 campaign, as a candidate criticizing his previous support for the Hyde Amendment, a measure that blocks federal funds from being used for most abortions.
Policy experts suggested that although Harris’ current policies on abortion and reproductive rights may not differ significantly from Biden’s, as a result of her national tour and her own focus on maternal health, she may be a stronger messenger.
Climate
Harris has been a champion on climate and environmental justice for decades. As California’s attorney general, Harris sued big oil companies like BP and ConocoPhillips, and investigated Exxon Mobil for its role in climate change disinformation. While in the Senate, she sponsored the Green New Deal resolution.
During her 2020 campaign, she enthusiastically supported a ban on fracking — but a Harris campaign official said in late July that she no longer supports such a ban.
Fracking is the process of using liquid to free natural gas from rock formations – and the primary mode for extracting gas for energy in battleground Pennsylvania. During a September 2019 climate crisis town hall hosted by CNN, she said she would start “with what we can do on Day 1 around public lands.” She walked that back later when she became Biden’s running mate.
Biden has been the most pro-climate president in history, and climate advocates find Harris to be an exciting candidate in her own right. Democrats and climate activists are planning to campaign on the stark contrasts between Harris and Trump, who vowed to push America decisively back to fossil fuels, promising to unwind Biden’s climate and clean energy legacy and pull America out of its global climate commitments.
If elected, one of the biggest climate goals Harris would have to craft early in her administration is how much the US would reduce its climate pollution by 2035 – a requirement of the Paris climate agreement.
Immigration
Harris has repeatedly tried to counter Trump’s attacks on her immigration record.
Her campaign released a video in late July citing Harris’ support for increasing the number of Border Patrol agents, and she has often called out Trump’s successful push to scuttle a bipartisan immigration deal that included some of the toughest border security measures in recent memory.
The vice president has changed her position on border control since her 2020 campaign, when she suggested that Democrats needed to “critically examine” the role of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, after being asked whether she sided with those in the party arguing to abolish the department.
In June of this year, the White House announced a crackdown on asylum claims meant to continue reducing crossings at the US-Mexico border. Harris has said that she would maintain Biden’s crackdown on asylum claims – and potentially go further.
Trump’s attacks stem from Biden having tasked Harris with overseeing diplomatic efforts in Central America in March 2021. While Harris focused on long-term fixes, the Department of Homeland Security remained responsible for overseeing border security.
She has only occasionally talked about her efforts as the situation along the US-Mexico border became a political vulnerability for Biden. But she put her own stamp on the administration’s efforts, engaging the private sector.
Harris pulled together the Partnership for Central America, which has acted as a liaison between companies and the US government. Her team and the partnership are closely coordinating on initiatives that have led to job creation in the region. Harris has also engaged directly with foreign leaders in the region.
Experts credit Harris’ ability to secure private-sector investments as her most visible action in the region to date but have cautioned about the long-term durability of those investments.
Israel-Hamas
The Israel-Hamas war is the most fraught foreign policy issue facing the country and has spurred a multitude of protests around the US since it began in October.
After meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in late July, Harris gave a forceful and notable speech about the situation in Gaza. She echoed Biden’s repeated comments about the “ironclad support” and “unwavering commitment” to Israel, as well as the need to get the Israeli hostages back from Hamas captivity. The country has a right to defend itself, she said, while noting, “how it does so, matters.”
However, the empathy she expressed regarding the Palestinian plight and suffering was far more forceful than what Biden has said on the matter in recent months. Harris mentioned twice the “serious concern” she expressed to Netanyahu about the civilian deaths in Gaza, the humanitarian situation and destruction she called “catastrophic” and “devastating.”
She went on to describe “the images of dead children and desperate hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time,” and said, “I will not be silent.”
But when describing the ceasefire deal in the works, she didn’t highlight the hostage for prisoner exchange or aid to be let into Gaza. Instead, she singled out the fact that the deal stipulates the withdrawal by the Israeli military from populated areas in the first phase before withdrawing “entirely” from Gaza before “a permanent end to the hostilities.”
Harris didn’t preside over Netanyahu’s speech to Congress in late July, instead choosing to stick with a prescheduled trip to a sorority event in Indiana.
The vice president continued calling out the plight of the people in Gaza, as well as the need to free the Israeli hostages and secure a ceasefire deal, in her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in August.
President Biden and I are working to end this war such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.”
Ukraine
Harris is committed to supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russian aggression, having met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at least six times and announcing last month $1.5 billion for energy assistance, humanitarian needs and other aid for the war-torn country.
At the Munich Security Conference earlier this year, Harris said: “I will make clear President Joe Biden and I stand with Ukraine. In partnership with supportive, bipartisan majorities in both houses of the United States Congress, we will work to secure critical weapons and resources that Ukraine so badly needs. And let me be clear: The failure to do so would be a gift to Vladimir Putin.”
More broadly, NATO is central to our approach to global security. For President Biden and me, our sacred commitment to NATO remains ironclad. And I do believe, as I have said before, NATO is the greatest military alliance the world has ever known.”
Police funding
The Harris campaign has also walked back the “defund the police” sentiment that Harris voiced in 2020. What she meant is she supports being “tough and smart on crime,” Mitch Landrieu, national co-chair for the Harris campaign and former mayor of New Orleans, told CNN’s Pamela Brown in late July.
In the midst of nationwide 2020 protests sparked by George Floyd’s murder by a Minneapolis police officer, Harris voiced support for the “defund the police” movement, which argues for redirecting funds from law enforcement to social services. Throughout that summer, Harris supported the movement and called for demilitarizing police departments.

CNN,Judge Aileen Cannon defends her judicial independence and says she’s never met Trump | CNN Politics,"Judge Aileen Cannon is refusing to recuse herself from the criminal case against the man accused of trying to assassinate Donald Trump, saying she has no relationship with the former president who nominated her to the federal bench and that she doesn’t control what he says about her.
In her ruling Tuesday, Cannon said she has never spoken with Trump or met him, and she has no concerns over the “political consequences of my rulings.”
Attorneys for Ryan Routh, who prosecutors say set up a sniper’s nest outside of Trump’s golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, argued that Cannon’s dismissal of the criminal case against Trump over his handling of classified documents could create the appearance of partiality in their client’s case where Trump is the alleged victim.
Routh’s attorneys noted the many instances when Trump has praised Cannon by name for her decision to toss the documents case, including during his acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention this summer.
“I have no control over what private citizens, members of the media, or public officials or candidates elect to say about me or my judicial rulings,” Cannon wrote Tuesday.
Defense attorneys argued that if Trump were to win the 2024 presidential race, he could elevate Cannon to a higher court, something that might influence her in this case.
But Cannon insisted she is not “concerned about the political consequences of my rulings or how those rulings might be viewed by ‘some in the media.’”
“I have never spoken to or met former President Trump except in connection with his required presence at an official judicial proceeding, through counsel,” Cannon wrote. “I have no ‘relationship to the alleged victim’ in any reasonable sense of the phrase. I follow my oath to administer justice faithfully and impartially, in accordance with the Constitution and the laws of this country.”
Cannon said she would not entertain the “speculation” from Routh’s attorneys and noted that the case was randomly assigned to her, just like Trump’s classified documents case.
“This case, like the prior cited cases involving former President Trump, were randomly assigned to me through the Clerk’s random case assignment system. Period. I will not be guided by highly inaccurate, uninformed, or speculative opinions to the contrary,” Cannon wrote.
Special counsel Jack Smith is currently appealing Cannon’s dismissal of the documents case.
Cannon also rejected the defendant’s attempt to call into question her relationship with one of the prosecutors on the case, noting that despite attending the prosecutor’s wedding, she currently has no personal relationship with him.
“I maintained a professional friendship with the stated prosecutor during my time as a prosecutor (2013–2020), as I did with other colleagues within the United States Attorneys’ Office. As part of that professional friendship, I attended his wedding nearly a decade ago. I maintain no ongoing personal relationship with the prosecutor, nor have I communicated with him in years,” she said.
Routh’s trial is currently set for February.",2024-10-29
CNN,Biden’s clean energy law revived this red corner of Georgia. Voters there are backing Trump anyway | CNN Politics,"The face of a new era in American manufacturing is here, just off Interstate 75, tucked into this northwest corner of Georgia.
That’s where you’ll find the Qcells plant that pumps out 32,000 solar panels a day and has a total panel production capacity of 5.1 gigawatts. For context, officials note, the peak capacity of the Hoover Dam is roughly 2 gigawatts.
“When I came here, there was dirt. There was no building,” said Lisa Nash, the plant manager here, walking CNN through the high-tech factory floor in August. “I was the first person hired.”
Asked if she could have envisioned where things are now, she didn’t hesitate: “No.”
In Nash’s view, the dramatic growth isn’t just a success story for the company or industry, it’s also major win for the community here in Dalton.
“The population’s growing. They’re buying houses, rent, shopping, eating out. They’re contributing back into the local community, paying taxes,” Nash said.
It’s a cutting-edge operation that was made possible by the sweeping climate investment law enacted by the Biden administration in 2022.
“We’ve had lots of support in the state and federal level of various kinds,” said Scott Moskowitz, the head of market strategy and public affairs at Qcells. “But it wasn’t till the Inflation Reduction Act passed, which really provided the spark that this industry needed to make these types of investments.”
Which is why Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to the plant last year to highlight its growth – and speak to some of its employees.
“To meet her and to have a conversation with her, I was shocked because I was thinking, you know, she’s up here, but she’s actually down to earth, very straightforward,” said Kimberly Richardson, the Qcells employee selected by management to introduce Harris during her visit.
Richardson embodies a new generation of manufacturing workers – someone with no experience in solar panels or the green technology space prior to joining Qcells who has quickly acclimated – and risen – inside the company, where she’s now in charge of the plant’s recycling operation.
For Richardson, a Black woman, Harris’ campaign for president carries a deep meaning.
“She represents every woman in the United States, every woman,” Richardson said. “She set the tone for every woman in the United States, every little girl, to say, ‘I can do this,’ and that’s a good thing.”
But while Georgia may be a hotly contested battleground state, Richardson’s view isn’t exactly widespread here, where support for former President Donald Trump runs strong.
“She wasn’t well received in north Georgia,” Kasey Carpenter, the Republican state representative for the area, said of the Harris visit.
The Qcells plant offers a window into the convergence of local, state and federal government aligning to accelerate a manufacturing transition that has turbocharged a local economy. That the effort has crossed party lines is rare enough in these polarized times.
But that it happened in a community that backs a presidential candidate who has attacked the very law that is central to its rapid expansion underscores the complex – and in this case, contradictory - overlap of politics and a local economy.
Trump strikes a chord
Located in the congressional district represented by GOP firebrand Marjorie Taylor Greene, Dalton is Trump country.
“The independence that we keep up here – it’s that independence and outsider that he’s really struck a chord with,” Carpenter said of Trump’s rock-solid support in the area. “And my folks, they appreciate that. And quite frankly that I appreciate that too.”
Carpenter is far from a die-hard Trump supporter.
“We’re in a world where we get two candidates, but we have 27 boxes of cereal on the shelf. That’s the world I live in,” he said. “It’s that frustrating that you have two candidates.”
But for voters here, the political debate over the economy comes down to one thing.
“Inflation is such a big issue for our community right now that that’s going to trump anything that kind of I think about,” Carpenter said.
This is the paradox playing out during a dramatic comeback for this part of the state.
The Qcells plant – the largest of its kind in the Western Hemisphere – sits in what has long been known as the carpet capital of the world.
The moniker can be found on the signs welcoming visitors to Dalton, which has held a dominant market share of the carpet and flooring industry for decades.
But it also left the area particular vulnerable to something most thought was impossible until 2008: a housing market crash.
“It was a bloodbath for us here,” Carpenter said. “It was a ghost town. And it took us years to get out of it.”
The market collapse sparked local leaders to start thinking through – and setting up the infrastructure for – the diversification of the town’s economy.
That overlapped with efforts at the state level – most recently by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp – to line up incentives for major companies to relocate to or build in Georgia.
The Biden administration’s incentives from the federal side turbocharged the efforts on green energy.
“They are all equally important,” Nash said when asked whose support was most critical between federal, state and local government. “It’s like a recipe and without one ingredient, you can’t successfully have this project.”
The result has been the revival of a model that was thought to be a thing of the past.
“If you walk around in the factory, you’re going see a broad age band,” Nash said. “We have a 65-year-old father. His son and his daughter work here. There are high school students that we interview because of their gaming.”
What was once aspirational is now reality – and growing.
‘A hometown feel’
Just about 50 miles down I-75 is Cartersville, where on a recent Saturday the center of town was jam-packed with residents stopping through booths filled by local vendors selling locally sourced food and agricultural goods.
For two years running, this has been ranked the top farmer’s market in Georgia, which might not be expected in a county that voted 75% for Trump in 2020.
But in some ways, it’s a key element to an approach that helped the town lure Qcells to build its next plant here, just a few miles away from where CNN linked up with its mayor, Matt Santini.
This is clearly a Republican town, with deep-rooted support for the former president. But in Santini’s mind, the true nature of the place is the community itself.
“It’s doubled in size since I moved here in the early ‘90s, but it’s still a place where, again, you can walk through a farmer’s market,” Santini said. “You see people talking and getting along with each other. We have a hometown feel.”
Back in Dalton, that hometown feel is exactly the vibe a visitor gets walking into the Oakwood Cafe.
The restaurant is technically the day job for Carpenter, the state legislator – and one that keeps him connected to the community he represents while in Atlanta when the Legislature is in session.
“I’m real connected,” Carpenter said with a chuckle. “I fry their chicken on Monday, and Saturdays I’m washing their dishes.”
Carpenter describes his community and its residents with pride.
“It’s blue-collar, man. We’re all workers,” he said.
But he acknowledges there’s a heavy dose of ideological irony in the economic engine that has taken root in the area over the past few years.
“We’re growing the green energy that they don’t necessarily care that much about,” he said. “But I think they’re coming around because they see the impact on the economy.”
That impact, he notes, has been significant.
“Whether it’s janitorial, whether it’s restaurants, catering, whether it’s, you know, plastics, you know, garbage bags, whatever, shipping goods, all of that stuff flows downstream from something like that,” Carpenter said.
Threats that haven’t resonated
That downstream effect – perhaps most tangible in the form of downtown Dalton’s new boutique hotel, right across the street from the Oakwood Cafe, the area’s first in 50 years and evidence to many of the city’s comeback.
Still, the campaign-trail threats from Trump to repeal pillars of the climate law that sparked the growth haven’t moved voters here – or really resonated.
“I don’t think they realize that if the whole thing is repealed, it will affect those 2,500 jobs down on the south end of the county. And it’s real,” Carpenter said. “It will have consequences.”
Qcells representatives are quick to point out that they first broke ground in Dalton in 2018 because Trump’s tariffs on solar panels incentivized production stateside.
Still, the former president’s threats are impossible to ignore, even if the bipartisan support for the project across the federal, state and local levels offers it a level of protection should Trump win.
“You want to ask me that after November?” Nash, the Qcells plant manager, responded when asked about the future for the industry.
But she underscored the scale of the transformation already underway – and what that means for the future.
“No, I’m optimistic because we’re just scratching the surface,” she said.
It’s a future Nash’s parents thought didn’t exist.
“Both of them said, ‘Don’t go into manufacturing,’” she recalled. “I’d like to think they’re both proud of me today because of this. I look at my kids and my grandkids, and I’m thinking: ‘I wouldn’t mind them doing that.’”
It’s a window into a transformation that has taken hold of an entire community – a one-industry town no more.
Asked if there were any plans to add “Solar capital of the world” onto the current Dalton signs in town, Carpenter thought about it for a minute.
“No, but we should, though,” he said. “We’ve gotta wait and see what happens. Right now, the story still remains.”",2024-09-27
CNN,Analysis: The electorate is changing. Here’s what that means for Trump and Harris. | CNN Politics,"There’s a reason Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are intensifying efforts to reach beyond their party’s traditional supporters in the final weeks of this razor-thin campaign.
Extending a pattern that stretches back decades, White voters without a college degree, the cornerstone of the modern GOP coalition, have declined by a little more than 2 percentage points as a share of eligible voters since 2020, falling below 40% of the eligible voting pool for the first time ever, according a new analysis of the latest Census Bureau data by demographer William Frey shared exclusively with CNN.
While those working-class Whites are shrinking, Frey found that both Whites with at least a four-year college degree and voters of color have each increased since 2020 by about a single percentage point as a share of eligible voters. Those increases also continue long-term trends that have seen well-educated Whites grow to represent more than 1-in-4 eligible voters and people of color rise past 1-in-3.
These trends help explain why the former president has devoted so much effort to reaching beyond his traditional base of White voters without a college education to attract more Black and Latino voters, especially men. And, in turn, the trends help explain the emphasis the vice president is placing on attracting more college-educated White voters who have previously leaned toward the GOP — a priority she underscored by barnstorming across populous white-collar suburbs outside Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee with GOP former Rep. Liz Cheney on Monday.
The impact of these incremental shifts in the composition of the major voter groups can easily be outweighed by changes in the preferences of those groups. Trump, for instance, is counting on gains among Latino voters, especially men, to neutralize the anticipated benefits for Democrats as Latinos increase their share of the vote, particularly in closely contested Arizona and Nevada.
But the cumulative impact of these shifts in the electorate’s basic composition is undeniable. Trump, for instance, in each of his two presidential campaigns won nearly as big a share of White voters without a college education as Ronald Reagan did in 1984, according to exit polls. Yet because those working-class Whites had fallen from about two-thirds of voters in 1984 to around two-fifths now, Trump only won about 47% of the total vote in each of his two campaigns, while Reagan captured nearly 59%.
Even this year, in a race so close, small shifts in the electorate’s composition across the most competitive states could make a difference. For instance, the fact that non-college Whites, according to Frey’s analysis, have fallen as a share of the eligible electorate since 2020 considerably more in Michigan and Wisconsin than in Pennsylvania may help explain why most analysts consider the Keystone State more difficult than the other two for Harris.
Shifts in racial and educational levels are not the only important changes Frey, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Brookings Metro think tank, has tracked in the make-up of eligible voters between 2020 and 2024. He also found that women will comprise nearly 52% of all eligible voters, which should help Harris. But his analysis shows that number actually represents a very small shift in the eligible electorate since 2020 toward men, which at the margin might benefit Trump. Frey also finds that Generation Z will make a big jump in their share of eligible voters, from about 1-in-10 last time to more than 1-in-6 this year. That increase underscores the stakes in Harris’ attempt to max out her support among younger women and Trump’s determined attempts to court young men.
Frey’s analysis finds that the White voters without a college degree are declining as a share of eligible voters not only in the nation overall but specifically across almost all of the seven battleground states. (North Carolina is the sole swing state where he found that they had increased as a portion of eligible voters since 2020.)
That decline is rooted in an ongoing process of generational replacement. Compared to younger generations, America’s older cohorts are much more heavily White and also much less likely to hold at least a four-year college degree. As those older Whites age out of the electorate, and more diverse and better-educated generations grow into it, the composition of the eligible voter pool inexorably transforms.
“Whites are a shrinking part of the population and a part of that population which is shrinking even more are the people who don’t have college education,” said Frey.
While these blue-collar Whites are receding in both the Rustbelt and Sunbelt electorates, different kinds of voters are replacing them across the two regions, Frey found.
These blue-collar Whites represent a much larger share of the total electorate in the Rustbelt than the Sunbelt: Frey found that in 2020 they comprised around half of eligible voters in both Michigan and Pennsylvania and nearly three-fifths in Wisconsin.
But Frey found that since 2020, they have declined more rapidly than almost anywhere else in Michigan (falling by nearly 3 percentage points) and Wisconsin (dropping by more than 3 percentage points). In Michigan, he found a slight increase in minority voters among the eligible voter pool, while in Wisconsin those non-White voters, who were already a smaller share of eligibles than in the other Rustbelt battlegrounds, actually declined even further.
In both states, the big gainers since 2020 are Whites with at least a four-year college degree: Frey found they increased more than 2 percentage points as a share of eligible voters in Michigan and over 4 points in Wisconsin.
In Pennsylvania, the shift isn’t as dramatic: Frey found that the non-college White share of eligible voters dropped since 2020 by about 1.5 percentage points, about half as much as in the other two former “blue wall” states. A small increase in the minority population made up most of that difference, with college-educated Whites increasing only very slightly.
Across the Sunbelt battlegrounds, blue-collar Whites are a smaller share of the eligible voters: about 1-in-3 in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada and just over 2-in-5 in North Carolina. Arizona and Georgia saw big increases since 2020 in the minority share of their eligible voter population, Frey found, while non-Whites actually declined somewhat in North Carolina and remained almost unchanged in Nevada. College-educated Whites increased as a portion of eligible voters in Nevada and Arizona, while falling slightly in Georgia and essentially holding steady in North Carolina.
After these shifts, the minority share of the eligible voting population will remain much higher in the Sunbelt than Rustbelt states, with voters of color representing about one-third of the eligible voter population in North Carolina, a little more than two-fifths in Arizona and more than 45% in both Nevada and Georgia.
In both the Rustbelt and Sunbelt, the winning modern demographic formula for Democrats since the 1990s has been to maximize their support among non-White voters and grow their support among college-educated Whites, while holding down their losses among the blue-collar Whites, with a particular focus on women in each group. In the Trump era, the dominant GOP demographic strategy has been to maximize their support among working-class voters without a college degree, particularly men. That strategy has broadened from a nearly exclusive focus on White working-class voters in Trump’s 2016 race to his more panoramic attempt this year to attract non-college-educated Black and Latino voters as well, especially men.
Manuel Pastor, director of the Equity Research Institute at the University of Southern California, says the contrasting strategies of Harris and Trump in the campaign’s final days illuminate “the task of reinvention that each party faces” as a result of the electorate’s ongoing racial and educational reconfiguration.
Trump, Pastor notes, has responded to the relentless increase in the electorate’s diversity by stressing “really a more male-leaning, masculine approach that is helping to make inroads with Latino males and, to a lesser extent, Black males.” (Trump is devoting a comparable effort to courting younger White men, especially those without college degrees, appearing on podcasts and other media sources where they congregate.)
And while Harris is expending enormous defensive effort on holding as many Latino and especially Black men as possible, she’s also accepting the shifting composition of the party’s coalition more explicitly than President Joe Biden did in 2020 and throughout his presidency, Pastor believes.
Biden, he notes, embodied an almost nostalgic desire to hold onto the Democrats’ mid-20th century base of White working-class voters, but Harris, the daughter of two academics herself, has leaned more comfortably into the party’s modern identity as a coalition primarily of often economically struggling minorities and more comfortable college-educated suburbanites.
“Where Democrats have made inroads is with college-educated Whites who are offended by Trump’s language around immigrants, around his dalliance with right-wing neo-fascist groups and language, with the threats around ‘the enemy within’ — all of the stuff Harris is trying to make sure to get into the conversation” in these final days, Pastor said.
Patrick Ruffini, a Republican pollster who specializes in demographic trends, said the offsetting gains of Democrats with well-educated Whites and Trump with blue-collar non-Whites should be understand as inextricably linked components of the same dynamic. “Trump doing better among working class minorities is a function of Democrats doing better among college educated voters,” Ruffini, the author of the recent book “Party of the People” about the shifting GOP coalition, wrote in an email. “As the electorate polarizes on education, the nonwhite working class will not be immune from these trends and will gravitate towards Trump more than your standard issue Republican. I think he is broadening the coalition, not necessarily with a lot of intentional effort, but because of natural dynamics in the electorate,” he added.
Democrats need to remain at least competitive among working-class White voters, particularly in the Rustbelt battlegrounds, where historically they have been able to win a significantly higher percentage of them than in the South (where far more of those voters are staunchly conservative evangelical Christians). But anywhere in the country, the most realistic goal for Democrats among these working-class Whites — especially against Trump’s formidable appeal to them — is to hold down their losses.
The groups that Harris needs to give her winning margins are the non-White and college-educated White voters (especially women in each case). The fact that both of those groups are increasing in the electorate, while Trump’s best cohort is shrinking, may give Harris a small swell in her sails. “The growing parts of the population are leaning Democrat, even in this time” when so many voters are discontented with conditions in the country, Frey said. The fact that women are likely to cast more ballots than men in all the swing states, he believes, will provide a small lift to Harris as well.
But many analysts point out these demographic changes can easily be overcome if Trump can reduce the Democratic margins among the groups she’s likely to win, or expand his own lead among his best groups. For instance, the fact that members of Gen Z are growing in the electorate should benefit Harris, given that Democrats have won big majorities among young people in every election since 2004, the first when millennials entered the electorate in large numbers. But while Harris is posting huge advantages among Gen Z women, Trump may somewhat blunt the impact of this generational transition if he can run as well among Gen Z men as polls show is now possible.
Melissa Deckman, CEO of the non-partisan Public Religion Research Institute and author of the recent book “The Politics of Gen Z,” says almost everything about Trump’s messaging on cultural, racial and gender issues profoundly alienates the vast majority of Gen Z women. “I think Gen Z women, including White women, are very committed to an inclusive democracy,” she said.
But while young men may not entirely endorse Trump’s most vituperative and vitriolic messages about racial and cultural change either, she said, they are less likely to find such statements disqualifying amid their concerns about their economic prospects. (Among younger generations, far more women than men are earning four-year and post-graduate college degrees.) Some younger men may also find Trump’s swaggering persona attractive, she noted, viewing him almost as an “anti-hero.”
“For young people in general, there are huge amounts of economic anxiety,” Deckman said. “But I think the difference is that Gen Z women are more likely to prioritize social issues whereas Gen Z men tend to vote more on pocketbook issues.”
These cross-currents among the electorate’s youngest cohort underscores a larger point: At such a fluid moment in US politics, the shift in the electorate’s composition doesn’t so much portend the result of this year’s election as define the assignments that each side faces in attempting to assemble a winning coalition.
One other factor is critical to any discussion of how demographic change may influence the balance of power between the two parties this year. The composition of the actual voters who turn up on Election Day is shaped not only by the share of eligible voters each group represents, but also, of course, by their turnout rates.
College-educated White voters consistently turn out at much higher rates than any other group. In the 2020 election, nearly 9-in-10 eligible White adults with at least a four-year college degree voted, compared to just under 2-in-3 Whites without a college degree and about 3-in-5 non-White voters, according to calculations from Census data provided to me by Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political scientist who studies voter participation.
As a result, the college-educated Whites tend to comprise a slightly larger share of the actual than eligible electorate while the relationship is reversed for the other two groups. Analyzing Census data, Frey and McDonald both found that in 2020 college-educated Whites cast just over 3-in-10 votes, while people of color cast just below 3-in-10. The White voters without a college degree remained the electorate’s largest group, but they cast slightly less than 40% of all votes — the first time they had fallen below that threshold among actual voters. (Census data indicates that these blue-collar Whites fell below a majority of the nation’s electorate for the first time in 2008, when Barack Obama was elected the nation’s first Black president.)
A similar pattern is evident along gender lines. Eligible female voters have turned out at a higher rate than eligible male voters in every election since 1980, according to the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. (Before that, men voted at higher rates than women.) That gap can be substantial: using Census data, Frey has calculated that in the presidential elections since 2004, turnout among eligible women has always exceeded the rate among men by at least 3.3 percentage points, reaching as much as 4 points in some cases.
As a result, according to Frey’s analysis of Census data, in all of the seven swing states, women in 2020 comprised a larger share of actual than eligible voters. They represented about 52% of actual voters last time in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Nevada, 54% in North Carolina and around 55% in both Arizona and Georgia, he found. (Nationwide, Frey’s analysis of Census data showed women casting 53% of all ballots, slightly more than their 52% share of the eligible electorate.) One rule of thumb among Democrats is that they usually triumph when they win women by at least as large a margin as Republicans win men; these data indicate Harris could survive even if Trump wins men by slightly more.
Young people, of course, consistently turn out at much lower rates than older voters, even though their participation has trended upward in the Trump era. Potentially worrisome for Trump is that the gender gap in turnout rates is even greater for young women and men than it is among the older generations, the Rutgers Center has found. Younger non-White men, who have expressed the most receptivity to Trump in minority communities, have an especially meager turnout record.
Other sources of data about the composition of the electorate in 2020 paint slightly different pictures than the Census data Frey uses. The Pew Research Center’s validated voters study put Whites without a college degree at 42% of all voters, while the analysis by Catalist, a Democratic targeting firm, figured them at 44%. Each of those analyses placed both the college-educated Whites and non-Whites just a tick lower than the Census data. Pew, the exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media organizations including CNN, and the AP/VoteCast project with NORC found that women represented just a slightly smaller share of all voters last time than the Census did; Catalist concluded they represented even more.
Still, all these data sources agree on the same basic pattern over the differing periods that they cover. Consistently they find Whites without a college degree shrinking as a share of actual voters at a rate of about 2 percentage points every four years, with non-Whites posting the greatest gains and college-educated Whites increasing more slowly, though also steadily growing. And they agree that women now consistently cast the majority of votes in presidential elections.
No one, of course, can entirely predict how many voters from each of these groups will turn out this year. But this history clearly shows it is likely that the changes in the composition of the eligible electorate Frey has documented will closely track the shifts in the configuration of the actual electorate. Most of the experts I spoke with believe it’s a good bet that, just as with the eligible population, Whites without a college degree will continue to shrink as a share of actual voters by about 2 percentage points, while people of color and college-educated Whites will each slightly rise.
These glacial shifts in the nature of the American electorate typically leave their mark over decades, rather than from election to election. But this may be a butterfly effect election where even the smallest flutter in the environment could tip the balance between two political coalitions that are utterly antithetical in their vision for America’s future, but also almost exactly equal in size.",2024-10-22
CNN,Special counsel probe into Biden’s handling of classified documents appears to be nearing end | CNN Politics,"Special counsel Robert Hur’s interview of President Joe Biden is a sign that the classified documents investigation is nearing conclusion after casting a wide net that included dozens of witnesses during the ten-month long probe, multiple sources told CNN.
The White House announced this week that Biden was questioned by Hur and his team over two days in a voluntary interview that CNN has reported was scheduled weeks earlier. While the White House has declined to discuss details of the questioning, including whether Biden invoked executive privilege, the interview is the first public development in months.
One source told CNN that investigators have indicated they hope to wrap by the end of the year. As of now, it’s unclear if the probe will result in charges being filed, but sources familiar with the investigators’ line of questioning said they got the impression that’s unlikely, and there has been no discernible grand jury activity.
The Justice Department has said that Hur will produce a final report explaining his findings from the investigation, a standard part of a special counsel’s work.
“The breadth and depth of Hur’s work suggests that he is going to compile a detailed report to explain exactly how he conducted this investigation,” one source familiar with the investigation told CNN.
Hur was appointed in January to investigate after classified documents were found at Biden’s former office at the Penn Biden Center in Washington, DC, and at his Wilmington, Delaware, home.
Compared to special counsel Jack Smith’s investigation into classified materials found at former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence, including the indictment handed down in June, Hur’s probe into Biden has continued to operate quietly behind the scenes.
Still, the protracted length and exhaustive nature of the investigation has frustrated top Biden aides who expected it to wrap up months ago given the relatively small number of classified documents involved, according to a person familiar with the White House’s thinking.
That person said some Biden aides believe Attorney General Merrick Garland was overly cautious in selecting Hur, an appointee to two top Justice Department roles during the Trump administration, to ensure the investigation was politically unassailable.
Investigators working for Hur have interviewed a broad spectrum of witnesses — from longtime advisor and current counselor Steve Ricchetti, to former White House legal and communications aides, to a former low-level aide who helped pack up the vice president’s residence at the end of the Obama administration, sources familiar with the matter tell CNN.
Hur’s team also has reached out to people who worked in the Senate during the time Biden served in that chamber, sources said. That’s because some of the documents with classified markings date back to Biden’s time in the Senate, according to a statement from Biden’s personal attorney.
As part of the investigation, Hur has sought to examine the handling of classified documents during Biden’s time in the Senate, a period before many of the strict procedures now used for handling classified documents, according to sources.
That has caused Hur to confront the delicate issues of the Senate’s constitutional speech or debate protections, which limit the Justice Department’s ability to interview Senate staff without coordination with Senate lawyers, people briefed on the matter said.
It’s unclear whether and how the Senate and Justice Department’s discussions over Senate-related interviews have been resolved. A special counsel spokesman declined to comment on the idea of no charges or on any discussions with the Senate.
One person familiar with the investigation described members of Hur’s team as being professional but tedious in the level of detail they have sought in witness interviews. Investigators have asked about where staffers sat in the office, where they stored briefing books, and how they operated an office safe.
Another person described a lengthy interview with FBI agents and lawyers focused on understanding everything surrounding specific documents. Investigators appeared to be following a process that identified meetings connected to specific classified documents or notes recovered from Biden properties, the person familiar with the interview said. Everyone who attended a meeting or briefing connected the document is being interviewed, the person said.
Investigators appear to be trying to establish a chain of custody for the documents and the circumstances surrounding them to discern how the classified documents ended up in Biden’s office and home.
Another source said: “The central question in this case is: Did the vice president of the United States intentionally take classified documents for personal use?”
The challenge for investigators is how they assess culpability and the circumstances surrounding how the documents got to the Penn Biden Center and the president’s house in Delaware, the source said.
A lawyer for one witness also described Hur’s process as being slow and methodical. Investigators interviewed this lawyer’s client earlier this year, but recently came back and asked his witness for additional documents.
“They are certainly being sufficiently thorough, and there is a temptation to think they are doing some things twice,” the lawyer said.
White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to say Tuesday if the president answered all questions posed to him or invoked executive privilege during the interview with Hur. Jean-Pierre also wouldn’t say if the Biden administration requested that the interview be postponed following Hamas’ attack on Israel over the weekend.
“He’s been very much focused on the issues of the – you know – horrific events that we have seen in Israel,” she said. “As president, he has to do multiple things at once, and that’s what you saw him do this weekend.”",2023-10-11

CNN,"Who is Rep. Mike Johnson, the new House speaker? | CNN Politics","Rep. Mike Johnson, the new speaker of the House, has been a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump and was a key congressional figure in the failed efforts to overturn the 2020 election.
The Louisiana Republican was first elected to the House in 2016 and serves as vice chairman of the House Republican Conference, as well as GOP deputy whip, an assistant leadership role. An attorney with a focus on constitutional law, Johnson joined a group of House Republicans in voting to sustain the objection to electoral votes on January 6, 2021. During Trump’s first impeachment trial in January 2020, Johnson, along with a group of other GOP lawmakers, served a largely ceremonial role in Trump’s Senate impeachment team.
Johnson also sent an email from a personal email account in 2020 to every House Republican soliciting signatures for an amicus brief in the longshot Texas lawsuit seeking to invalidate electoral college votes from multiple states.
After the election was called in favor of Joe Biden on November 7, 2020, Johnson posted on X, then known as Twitter, “I have just called President Trump to say this: ‘Stay strong and keep fighting, sir! The nation is depending upon your resolve. We must exhaust every available legal remedy to restore Americans’ trust in the fairness of our election system.’”
Although Trump said he wouldn’t endorse anyone in the speaker’s race Wednesday, he leant support to Johnson in a post on Truth Social.
“In 2024, we will have an even bigger, & more important, WIN! My strong SUGGESTION is to go with the leading candidate, Mike Johnson, & GET IT DONE, FAST!” Trump posted.
Johnson serves on the Judiciary Committee and the Armed Services Committee. He is also a former chair of the Republican Study Committee.
After receiving a degree in business administration from Louisiana State University and a Juris Doctorate from the Paul M. Hebert Law Center, Johnson took on roles as a college professor and conservative talk radio host. He began his political career in the Louisiana legislature, where he served from 2015 to 2017, before being elected to Congress in Louisiana’s Fourth District.
Rep. Kevin Hern, an Oklahoma Republican who chairs the influential Republican Study Committee, dropped out of the race for speaker Tuesday evening and backed Johnson.
“I want everyone to know this race has gotten to the point where it’s gotten crazy. This is more about people right now than it should be,” he said. “This should be about America and America’s greatness. For that, I stepped aside and threw all my support behind Mike Johnson. I think he’d make a great speaker.”
Johnson’s win in the secret-ballot race for the House Republican Conference’s nominee for speaker followed Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer’s decision to drop out of the race hours after Republicans chose him to be the nominee following resistance from the right flank of the conference and a rebuke from Trump. Reps. Steve Scalise and Jim Jordan have also dropped out after earlier seeking the speaker’s gavel.
Johnson joined the speakership race in a Saturday post on X, formerly known as Twitter.
“I have been humbled to have so many Members from across our Conference reach out to encourage me to seek the nomination for Speaker. Until yesterday, I had never contacted one person about this, and I have never before aspired to the office,” he said in a posted letter. “However, after much prayer and deliberation, I am stepping forward now.”

CNN,The 10 Senate seats most likely to flip in 2024 | CNN Politics,"With just over a month until Election Day, the same competitive races continue to dominate the Senate landscape, but there are a few significant changes to the order of CNN’s ranking of the seats most likely to flip.
And in the final weeks, the degree to which these 10 races – which are mostly playing out in states Donald Trump either won or narrowly lost in 2020 – move in the same direction as the presidential contest will likely determine which party wins control of the Senate.
Republicans – who are virtually a lock to pick up the West Virginia seat and would need to either win the White House or pick up one more seat for the majority – have an incentive to nationalize many of their targeted races. Well-funded Democratic incumbents, for the most part, are touting statewide and local accomplishments and their support for abortion rights.
Two states that are part of the Democratic “blue wall” – and also key White House battlegrounds – move up on this month’s rankings, which are based on reporting, as well as fundraising, polling and advertising data. Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are now in the middle of the pack of flippable seats, along with Michigan, which remains at No. 4.
The oddity of this year’s fight for the Senate is that Democrats have consistently led in the public polling of key races, but it’s Republicans who are poised to gain seats and, potentially, control of the chamber.
That’s a reflection of the Senate map – but also increasingly some post-Labor Day tightening as GOP spending picks up and voters get to know their candidates. Still, no public general election polling that meets CNN standards has shown the Republican nominee ahead in any of the seats that Democrats are defending, save for West Virginia.
And two GOP targets – Arizona and Nevada – are moving down the list because Republicans have not kept the races as competitive as elsewhere. Earlier this year, those two states were Nos. 4 and 5. Now, they’re at 7 and 8.
At the same time, Democrats are trying to expand the map in hopes of mitigating potential losses. As CNN first reported last week, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is making multimillion-dollar TV investments in Texas and Florida. DSCC Chairman Gary Peters has insisted that this is extra spending that won’t take money away from their defensive priorities. Texas remains at No. 9 on CNN’s ranking, while Florida fell off the list earlier this year in favor of the race in deep-blue Maryland.
Nebraska is a new state generating political buzz, but it hasn’t earned a place on the ranking. Still, independent Dan Osborn’s challenge to GOP Sen. Deb Fischer has prompted the National Republican Senatorial Committee to start spending here, and elections analysts have moved the race out of the solid Republican category.
There remain lots of unknowns in Nebraska, but we’ll be watching to see how that race – and the 10 others – develop over the next month.
1. West Virginia
West Virginia is essentially out of reach for Democrats, who had little chance of holding this seat without Sen. Joe Manchin running for reelection. Manchin, now an independent who caucuses with Democrats, is likely to be succeeded by Republican Jim Justice, the state’s two-term governor.
Justice has had his share of negative headlines, but in a state poised to back Trump by a significant margin, it’s hard to see a world in which Republicans don’t pick up this open seat.
2. Montana
Democrat Jon Tester, who’s running for a fourth term in a state Trump has twice carried by double digits, remains the most vulnerable Senate incumbent this year. Republicans feel confident their nominee, Tim Sheehy, has an edge – and both Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales and the Cook Political Report with Amy Walter have shifted their rating of the once toss-up race toward the GOP.
Democrats still see a path to victory for Tester, who has a proven history of defying the partisan lean of his state by communicating both what he’s done for Montanans and painting a contrast with his opponents.
Democrats are trying that playbook against Sheehy, trying to define the wealthy businessman and retired Navy SEAL, who moved to Montana in 2014, as an out-of-state carpetbagger who cannot be trusted. Recently unearthed audio recordings of Sheehy using racist stereotypes to refer to Native Americans has played into that message, with Democrats arguing that he’s alienating a crucial demographic in the state. In a debate earlier this week, Sheehy acknowledged his comments were “insensitive,” saying, “I come from the military as many of our tribal members do. You know, we make insensitive jokes and probably off-color sometimes.”
Tester’s campaign is now leaning into abortion rights on the airwaves – an issue that’s on the ballot in Montana this year. A recent ad features a self-described “life-long” Republican woman arguing that Sheehy “wants to take away personal freedoms.”
But Republicans are invoking transgender issues in an attempt to cast Tester as a liberal who’s been changed by his years in Washington, while Sheehy is trying to tie Tester to Kamala Harris – especially on immigration. Tester – who has not endorsed in the presidential race – tried to meet those attacks during their debate by pointing out that Sheehy would not have supported this year’s bipartisan border bill that Republicans blocked.
3. Ohio
Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is facing his toughest reelection in a state that has twice backed Trump by 8 points. Public polling still shows the three-term senator ahead of GOP nominee Bernie Moreno, although that is expected to tighten as more Republican voters come home to Moreno. Brown was at 47% to Moreno’s 43% in a late September New York Times/Siena College poll among likely Ohio voters – not far outside the margin of error. But the reassuring news for Democrats: Brown was winning 10% of Trump voters.
Democrats have seized on Moreno’s recent comments at a town hall suggesting that some suburban women were single-issue voters when it comes to abortion and questioning why women over 50 would care about the topic. Brown pointed to the remarks as evidence that his opponent is out of step with the 57% of Ohio voters who last year approved a ballot measure protecting reproductive rights. WinSenate, a Democratic outside group, also launched a new ad with a woman talking about the emergency abortion she underwent at 25 for an ectopic pregnancy, saying, “Our lives don’t belong in Bernie Moreno’s hands.”
(Moreno’s campaign said in a statement that he was “clearly making a tongue-in-cheek joke about how Sherrod Brown and members of the leftwing media like to pretend that the only issue that matters to women voters is abortion,” and that Moreno believes women “care just as much about the economy, rising prices, crime and our open southern border as male voters do.”)
The Senate contest in Ohio ranked as the most expensive congressional race on record, as of October 3, with total ad spending from both parties this cycle, including future reservations, exceeding $446 million, according to AdImpact. Brown – who announced raising $30.6 million in the third quarter – has continued to tout his work to pass the PACT Act to help veterans exposed to burn pits, while Moreno tries to nationalize the race by tying Brown to Harris and inflation and linking himself to Trump. The Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC tied to GOP leadership, is attacking Brown over transgender issues to try to cast him as out-of-step with the partisanship of the state.
4. Michigan
Michigan remains the most competitive open seat on this list. Democrat Elissa Slotkin has held a narrow edge in the race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow, but the absence of an incumbent and the competitiveness of the presidential race in the Wolverine State makes it one that could come down to the wire.
Slotkin, a third-term congresswoman, led Republican former Rep. Mike Rogers 47% to 42% among likely voters in a late September New York Times/Siena College poll, with Slotkin drawing 6% of likely voters who also said they would vote for Trump. Slotkin has a strong fundraising record – her campaign announced raising $18 million in the third quarter – but Republicans are pouring more money into this state, with the Senate Leadership Fund recently announcing a $22.5 million investment.
Slotkin has been running ads on abortion – an issue that has helped propel recent Democratic victories in the state. Her spots claim that Rogers’ past support for abortion restrictions makes him untrustworthy on the issue now. “I’m scared that Mike Rogers will continue to take away my rights,” says one woman in a spot who says she needed an abortion to save her life.
Rogers has been responding on air, speaking directly to camera while holding hands with his wife in one new spot, saying he respects Michigan voters’ decision on abortion rights and “won’t do anything to change it” in the Senate.
Rogers, the former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, scored the endorsement of the state Farm Bureau’s PAC, which had previously backed Stabenow (the chair of the Senate Agriculture panel). Rogers, whom Democrats have attacked for living in Florida after he left Congress a decade ago, is running spots that tout his Michigan roots and public service. Rogers and Republicans are also attacking Slotkin and the Biden administration over plans to support the building of electric vehicles, using the misleading term “mandate.”
5. Pennsylvania
Democratic Sen. Bob Casey’s race against Republican challenger Dave McCormick moves two spots up on the list in light of heavy GOP outside spending, some tighter polling and the competitiveness of the presidential race in a state that is part of Democrats’ so-called blue wall of must-win states.
September polling from Marist, Quinnipiac University, the New York Times/Siena College/Philadelphia Inquirer, Franklin & Marshall, CBS News/YouGov and Fox News all gave Casey anywhere from a 5- to 9-point lead among likely voters. Polls from CNN and The Washington Post around the same time, however, showed no clear leader.
The two candidates, who met on the debate stage for the first time Thursday night, have been hitting the airwaves with competing messages, as have their allied outside groups. Democrats are going after McCormick on abortion, including one ad that features footage of him referring to himself as “pro-life.” The Senate Leadership Fund, which is adding $28 million to GOP sending here, and the pro-McCormick Keystone Renewal PAC have been attacking Casey over inflation and immigration.
McCormick’s tenure as the CEO of FreeMarkets – a Pittsburgh-based software company – has also been featured in ads on both sides. The Democratic group WinSenate is accusing him of outsourcing jobs and pointing to his management of the company to argue that “Connecticut Dave” – he owns a home in the Nutmeg State – “wants to buy our Senate seat.” McCormick is running ads featuring former FreeMarkets employees praising him and touting the company’s hiring policies.
6. Wisconsin
Wisconsin also moves up two spots on the list amid signs that some Republicans could be drifting home toward their party’s nominee, Eric Hovde, in his challenge to Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin.
The two-term senator maintained a modest edge over Hovde in a Marquette University Law School poll released this week – 51% to 45% among likely voters when third-party candidates are included and 53% to 46% in a head-to-head matchup. Baldwin had a similar 7-point lead in a New York Times/Siena College survey of the two-person race taken around the same time.
While Baldwin has repeatedly outraised Hovde, the Senate Leadership Fund is also pouring funds – $17 million – into the Badger State, and Hovde has plenty of his own money to pay for ads at the lower candidate rate if he chooses. (We’ll be eying his third-quarter fundraising filing for details about how much the Sunwest Bank CEO had loaned his campaign through September.) Ads from Hovde – whose campaign recently underwent a shakeup – have sought to tie Baldwin to Harris, attacking her over border security, fentanyl and transgender rights.
But Baldwin, who’s made an effort to visit the red, rural parts of Wisconsin, has a well-defined brand. She picked up the endorsement of the Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation this week – a notable get for a Democrat running statewide. Much of Democratic advertising has played up Hovde’s past controversial comments and sought to cast him as a California carpetbagger – he owns property in Laguna Beach, even though he was born and raised in Wisconsin and his family’s company is a prominent state brand.
7. Arizona
Arizona is a conservative-leaning purple state, where Republicans should ordinarily be able to pick off a Senate seat – especially an open one. But in the race to replace retiring Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, Republican candidate Kari Lake seems to have hit a ceiling.
The 2022 gubernatorial nominee is well known in the state, but not necessarily for the right reasons. She still refuses to accept her loss for governor and, despite tethering herself to Trump, is underperforming his polling numbers.
Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego led Lake by 10 points among likely voters in a Marist poll and 13 points in a Fox News survey, both from mid-September. Lake was polling behind Trump in both surveys by 6 points and 8 points respectively.
Lake and the NRSC are blaming Gallego for inflation and immigration – pointing to his support for what they’re calling the “Kamala Inflation Act.” (Harris cast the tie-breaking vote in the Senate for the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.) And while the Senate Leadership Fund hasn’t spent here, a Club for Growth-affiliated group is also airing attacks on the congressman. Gallego, a former member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, was on the airwaves for months introducing himself to voters statewide as a Marine veteran and is touting his support from law enforcement and Republican voters. He announced raising $21.7 million in the third quarter.
8. Nevada
Nevada moves down two spots on the list as Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen appears to be in a stronger position against Republican opponent Sam Brown in a state where Democratic prospects seem to have picked up since Harris ascended to the top of the ticket.
Rosen, who appeared at a Harris rally in Las Vegas earlier this week, led Brown by 10 points in a CNN poll in late August. Like Lake in Arizona, Brown – an Army veteran who first ran for office in Texas and lost the GOP primary for Nevada’s other Senate seat last year – also appears to be running up against a ceiling.
Rosen and Democrats are hitting Brown over his previous stances on abortion – which is on the ballot this year in Nevada. Brown, who says he supports current state law legalizing the procedure up to 24 weeks, has said he’d “close the door” on backing a national abortion ban.
Rosen has had a fundraising edge over her opponent, and this week, national Republicans canceled their remaining independent expenditures in the state in favor of running hybrid ads with Brown, which allows them to benefit from the lower candidate rate in the ultra-pricey Las Vegas media market — a strategy they’ve employed in races across the country to try to compete with well-funded Democratic candidates on the airwaves.
9. Texas
National Democrats’ decision to invest TV resources in Texas was the first major signal the party is putting money where its mouth is on the competitiveness of the Lone Star State this year. Democrats see Republican Sen. Ted Cruz as unpopular and his Democratic challenger, Rep. Colin Allred, as the man to beat him, even in a state that is still comfortably red at the presidential level.
The first hybrid ad between Allred and the DSCC features Kate Cox, the woman who had to leave the state to seek an abortion after her fetus had been diagnosed with a deadly condition, and Amanda Zurawski, who sued the state after she was denied an abortion when experiencing complications. “If you’re experiencing pregnancy complications in Texas, you’re in danger,” Zurawski says in the ad, “and it’s Ted Cruz and the anti-abortion extremists’ fault.”
Allred has also tried to flip the script on Republicans by accusing Cruz of “doing nothing to secure the border.” Cruz, in turn, is attacking Allred over a vote related to the inclusion of transgender athletes in women’s sports. “Boys and girls are different,” is how another ad from the Republican opens. “This election is about keeping Texas Texas,” Cruz has said.
Cruz only beat Democrat Beto O’Rourke by 3 points in 2018. But Democrats hope that Allred, a former NFL player who flipped a Dallas-area House seat the same year, is a more formidable challenger and can turn out more minority voters. (Allred would be the state’s first Black senator if he wins.)
Even Republicans acknowledge that Allred is running a good race, and the NRSC is investing here to help Cruz and the state party. Still, Democrats have not won a statewide election in Texas since 1994, so this remains an uphill battle for Allred.
10. Maryland
The race to succeed retiring Democratic Sen. Ben Cardin remains in tenth place this month as Angela Alsobrooks fights to keep this seat in party hands. Joe Biden won Maryland by 33 points in 2020, but Republican nominee Larry Hogan – a popular former two-term governor – has a supportive super PAC committing $18 million to tout his independence.
Alsobrooks, the Prince George’s County executive, led Hogan by 11 points in a recent Washington Post/University of Maryland poll. She’s become better known statewide and has made gains among voters who say they care about Democrats maintaining control of the Senate. The argument that Hogan would be another vote for Senate Republicans has been Democrats’ central pitch in deep-blue Maryland, especially on abortion rights and Trump.
Voters in the Post survey were split over whether Hogan would back his party’s leaders in the Senate. He’s winning nearly half of independents, as well as 18% of Democrats. And as he tries to combat Democratic attacks over abortion rights, he’s run ads about being “the ultimate girl dad” and “one of the few Republicans who never caved” to Trump. Hogan rejected the former president’s endorsement earlier this year, but Democrats quickly seized on Trump saying that he’d like to see Hogan win.
Maryland’s Future, the super PAC backing Hogan, is trying to localize the race by attacking Alsobrooks for improperly taking advantage of tax breaks she did not qualify for, as first reported by CNN. (Her senior adviser told CNN that she was unaware of the problem and that her attorneys are working with both the District of Columbia and Prince George’s County to resolve the issue.)

CNN,How elderly dementia patients are unwittingly fueling political campaigns,"Hundreds of elderly political donors, including those with dementia, have fallen victim to Republican and Democratic political campaigns and groups.
A single donation sparks a flurry of text messages and emails from candidates and political organizations across the country.
The messages make urgent pleas for money and look as if they are coming directly from major political candidates.
They come at an unrelenting pace, directing donors to pages that often sign them up for monthly – or even weekly – donations. Money is then drained from their bank accounts without them realizing it.
Ultimately, some of these elderly, vulnerable consumers have unwittingly given away six-figure sums – most often to Republican candidates – making them among the country’s largest grassroots political donors.
(CNN) — The 80-year-old communications engineer from Texas had saved for decades, driving around in an old car and buying clothes from thrift stores so he’d have enough money to enjoy his retirement years.
But as dementia robbed him of his reasoning abilities, he began making online political donations over and over again — eventually telling his son he believed he was part of a network of political operatives communicating with key Republican leaders. In less than two years, the man became one of the country’s largest grassroots supporters of the Republican Party, ultimately giving away nearly half a million dollars to former President Donald Trump and other candidates. Now, the savings account he spent his whole life building is practically empty.
The story of this unlikely political benefactor is one of many playing out across the country.
More than 1,000 reports filed with government agencies and consumer advocacy groups reviewed by CNN, along with an analysis of campaign finance data and interviews with dozens of contributors and their family members, show how deceptive political fundraisers have victimized hundreds of elderly Americans and misled those battling dementia or other cognitive impairments into giving away millions of dollars — far more than they ever intended. Some unintentionally joined the ranks of the top grassroots political donors in the country as they tapped into retirement savings and went into debt, contributing six-figure sums through thousands of transactions.
To provide a snapshot of who these vulnerable donors are and how much money they have lost to increasingly aggressive fundraising campaigns, reporters reached out to more than 300 of the biggest and most frequent small-dollar political donors and their family members. Through these interviews and consumer complaints, reporters collected the accounts of more than 50 unwitting elderly donors and traced the path of where their money went.
Often coming in $5 or $10 at a time, contributions from this small sampling of donors alone added up to more than $6 million over the last five years — the majority of which ended up with Trump and a long list of other Republican candidates, CNN found.
While this is a small fraction of the billions raised by political campaigns, for many of the individuals who made the donations, the sums represented huge portions of their life savings.
Deceptive fundraising tactics, including those that trick elderly donors, were exposed in the wake of the 2020 election. While studies show that older Americans tend to lean more Republican, both parties have continued to rake in donations from elderly voters. And mainstream Republican candidates have only doubled down on this strategy, using more aggressive and predatory tactics than those used by Democrats, according to donor complaints, interviews with experts and a review of solicitations. The Republican fundraising machine has been subject to more than 800 complaints to the Federal Trade Commission since 2022 — nearly seven times more than the number of complaints lodged against the other side.
“The fact there are lots of complaints means this is likely a huge problem,” said Prentiss Cox, a law professor at the University of Minnesota and former manager of consumer protection at the Minnesota Attorney General's Office, when presented with CNN’s reporting. “From a consumer protection standpoint, this raises red flag level concerns about consumer misinformation and deception.”
Donors identified by CNN were often in their 80s and 90s. They included retired public workers, house cleaners and veterans, widows living alone, nursing home residents and people who donated more money than they paid for their homes, according to records and interviews.
The money they gave came from pensions, Social Security payments and retirement savings accounts meant to last decades. Donors took out new credit cards and mortgages to pay for the contributions. In some cases, they gave away most of their life savings. Their cell phones and email inboxes were so full of pleas for money that they missed photos of their grandkids and other important messages.
At least one person continued to be charged for contributions after his death.
Donors or their families often learned of the extent of their donations from CNN reporters. The family members of some said their loved ones had also been the targets of common elder scams. Most asked CNN not to name them out of concern that they would be further victimized or ashamed.
One 82-year-old woman, who wore pajamas with holes in them because she didn’t want to spend money on new ones, didn’t realize she had given Republicans more than $350,000 while living in a 1,000 square-foot Baltimore condo since 2020.
By the time a Taiwanese immigrant from California passed away from lung cancer this year at age 80, she had given away more than $180,000 to Trump’s campaign and a litany of other Republican candidates – writing letters to candidates apologizing for not getting donations to them on time because she was going into heart surgery. She had only $250 in her bank account when she died, leaving her family scrambling to cover the cost of her funeral.
And a 78-year-old, a widow who limited showers to save on her water bill and canceled her long-term care insurance, didn’t understand why the retirement savings her husband had left her was dwindling so quickly. After CNN reached out to her family, they learned that the woman gave more than $200,000 in donations to Democratic political groups and candidates.

The federal government has gone after non-political companies for similar tactics, such as making false statements in ads or making them seem as if they were written directly to the recipient. But regulators have done little to stop fundraisers from using misleading and deceptive advertisements to target vulnerable donors. And the lawmakers who experts say would need to act to protect consumers at both the state and federal levels are the same ones benefiting from the current fundraising machines.
The biggest beneficiary of the small-dollar donations from unwitting donors identified by CNN was Donald Trump. His current and former campaigns and affiliated political committees brought in more than $400,000 from these elderly consumers between July 2019 and June 2024, which included multiple election cycles. The national committees which raise money to support House and Senate races across the nation also received hundreds of thousands of dollars from such donors, according to CNN’s analysis, and in all, the long list of Republican candidates and causes took in nearly $4 million.
A spokesperson for the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee noted that fundraising efforts over the years have varied and said Trump ads were designed to be respectful, including such language as “don’t sweat it” if donors couldn’t afford to contribute on a regular basis.
On the Democratic side, much of the money went to left-leaning political action committees known as PACs, not mainstream Democratic candidates. The Progressive Turnout Project and its affiliated group, Stop Republicans, took in the most, with roughly $150,000 coming from the vulnerable donors identified by CNN. President Joe Biden’s presidential campaign was not among the top recipients, taking in only about 10% of the $400,000 Trump brought in from those elderly donors.
Vice President Kamala Harris had not yet launched her presidential bid during the fundraising period covered in CNN’s analysis, though more recent campaign finance reports show her campaign has taken in several thousand dollars from this snapshot of donors. The Harris campaign did not respond to a request for comment.

The fundraising operations that have solicited money from vulnerable senior citizens use either WinRed or ActBlue, two juggernaut digital platforms that unite hundreds of political groups and campaigns under a single umbrella. Each platform charges a fee of about 4% of every transaction, although WinRed is a for-profit company and ActBlue is a nonprofit. Campaign finance records show that the two groups took in more than $100 million in fees from federal campaigns and political committees in the last two years alone.
WinRed, founded by a former Trump staffer in 2019, and ActBlue, which has been around for two decades, say it is the campaigns themselves that are choosing the frequency and tenor of the pleas for donations. WinRed did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A spokesperson for ActBlue said the platform is designed to give “donors full control” over their contributions, saying donors or their families can contact their in-house support team with any concerns.
But it is the fundraising platforms that have made it easier than ever for campaigns to bring in as much money as possible from their bases. Both have boasted of record-breaking hauls this campaign cycle, with WinRed saying this summer it was processing more than 2,700 donations per minute — a jump of more than 40% from 2020.
The controversial feature that fools many donors is a pre-checked box campaigns use to automatically authorize recurring donations. Donors often don’t realize they need to uncheck that box, so while attempting to make a one-time small donation, they are unknowingly signing up for weekly or monthly recurring donations. Sometimes it takes months or years before they realize a campaign has been regularly charging their credit card or taking money out of their bank account.
While many mainstream Democratic candidates have backed away from the practice, both the Trump and Harris campaigns have recently been using donation pages with pre-checked recurring boxes to raise money, a CNN analysis of fundraising emails and Facebook and Instagram ads found.
Trump’s campaign said two of his current fundraising committees only returned to the use of pre-checked boxes in September after pausing the practice in January 2023. The spokesperson, however, did not address whether another Trump-affiliated committee still receiving donations this year had been using the tactic. Trump Campaign Senior Advisor Brian Hughes said ""we strive to be direct and transparent by informing them immediately when they have registered for recurring donations, sending a notice three days before processing, notifying them when the processing is complete, and having staff on-hand to assist with refunds and cancellations.”
Recurring donations only multiply as confirmed donors become valuable political currency — their names and contact information quickly swapped and sold. And once WinRed or ActBlue has a donor’s financial information, donations can be triggered by actions including a response to an online survey, an order of campaign merchandise or a one-word reply to a text message.
As a result, records show, some donors ended up being charged in excess of 100 times in a single day.
‘Lonely and isolated’
Richard Benjamin, an 81-year-old from Arizona, believed he had been in personal communication with former president Trump through all the messages he was receiving.
At one point, he told his children the former president invited him to a luxurious reception at Mar-a-Lago. He had grown up on a farm and worried he would feel out of his element at such a fancy venue. But when he received what he described to his children as an invitation to be a VIP at a rally in Arizona, he was thrilled he would finally meet the former president himself. He started making travel plans and asking his sister-in-law if she would like to accompany him, since his wife had passed away in 2018.
Later, he told his son how angry he was that Donald Trump Jr. wouldn't call him back even though the former president’s son had sent Benjamin so many nice messages.
“He was old, lonely and isolated,” his son, Jason Benjamin, told CNN, saying the pandemic only compounded that isolation. “’Save America, help save America,’ that was the constant message. He would get thanked for helping to save America.”
Richard Benjamin, who now lives in a memory care unit at an assisted living facility, would look forward to the emails and texts, and especially to the ones thanking him for being a true American and patriot when he donated his money. This eventually led him to give about $80,000, leaving him tens of thousands of dollars in debt and his children angry at the campaigns who they say tricked their dad and took advantage of his compromised state of mind. “He really, in his heart, believed that Donald Trump and Donald Trump Jr. and other politicians were personally reaching out to him,” Jason Benjamin said.
Richard Benjamin and his family showed CNN that he continues to be inundated with text messages and phone calls from politicians to this day. Yet he often couldn’t identify the politicians he financially supported.
“There’s no excuse for them to allow something like this to happen,” Jason Benjamin said of the campaigns behind the many solicitations. An employee from Richard Benjamin’s bank even lodged a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission about deceptive practices, saying Benjamin had never intended to donate close to the amount he did, according to FTC records.
Forensic geriatrician Kathryn Locatell said what Richard Benjamin felt each time he received a “thank you” message or made a donation is the same “dopamine hit” a lot of elderly Americans are seeking. And the solicitations are crafted in a way that intentionally suck elderly donors into their web, providing “a feeling of belonging to a thrilling, special club.”
“You and I could call these demands for money laughable but to a person who’s lost their capacity to judge reality, and who’s been soaking up all the toxic misinformation out there, on the internet and TV, it’s a perfectly coherent reality and they’re happy to join in and become a part of it,” she said. “That’s how all their money will be drained until it’s gone.”
Because the text informing donors they are enrolling in recurring donations is often so tiny, particularly on WinRed donation pages, it would be very easy for someone who isn’t actually processing what they’re reading to miss it, according to Locatell and other experts interviewed by CNN. Elderly donors who have short-term memory issues could be making one-time donations again and again, not remembering that they made a donation even an hour earlier, they added.
“These ads are a form of misleading, undue influence,” Locatell said. “One simple rule could be enacted: Ads can’t contain these pre-checked boxes; the person has to actively choose recurring donation.”
Behavioral symptoms such as getting hooked by solicitations like these and making poor financial decisions often happen in the early stages of dementia, before family members even realize their loved ones are experiencing any sort of cognitive decline.
CNN compared examples of pages donors use to make contributions to presidential candidates, former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.
Some donors believe political candidates are speaking to them directly, with an ad like this one indicating that Trump requested to be their friend on social media.
Invitations to join phony boards or focus groups are another common fundraising tactic that experts told CNN are used to make people feel special and are more likely to entrap elderly donors who may have diminished reasoning abilities.
Polls like this one — with 11 questions — can rile up voters before asking them for money.
The yellow box automatically signs donors up for weekly donations, after asking if Trump can count on their “sustained support.”
The way this small text appears to be hyperlinked makes it seem like donors should click there to sign up for recurring donations. But they are actually already signed up by the pre-checked box above.
These boxes, which claim to be messages from Trump, are known as upsells. A click on both of these results in two additional donations.
Fundraising pages for the Harris campaign, like this one, are clearer than those used by Trump.
This headline tells donors they will be signing up for weekly donations.
Harris fundraising pages tend to be short and relatively simple.
Like Trump, the Harris campaign sometimes uses pre-checked boxes that automatically sign donors up for recurring donations unless they opt out.
Calls from CNN reporters asking about donations prompted some family members to rush over to their loved ones’ homes to help look through statements or to begin the long process of taking over their finances. Other families CNN spoke with said it was the unusually large number of political donations – which took precedence over expenses as important as electricity bills and taxes -- that alerted them something was wrong.
In the case of the 80-year-old retired communications engineer who gave away close to half a million dollars, one of the man’s sons discovered his savings account was nearly drained from all his donations. The son said he took him to a neurologist where he was diagnosed with dementia and spent weeks canceling credit cards and disputing charges, attempting to turn off recurring donations one by one. He ultimately received refunds from WinRed for his father’s most recent donations. Still, his father remains out roughly $300,000.
“When I found this out and started showing Dad, he was shocked, he had no idea,” his son said. “He's not a man to give anyone what he considered his life savings.”
It often falls on families to try to help their loved ones.

The daughter of an 81-year-old woman with Alzheimer’s disease told CNN that when she visited her mother at her home last month, her mom got a call from Ted Cruz’s campaign and a text with an ActBlue link within minutes of each other. She said her mother was going to donate to each before she stopped her. Her mother’s cognitive decline has gotten so bad, she said, that she believed when someone asked her for money, she needed to give it. The daughter, who lives in another city, said she has been trying to coordinate her mother’s medical care while also sorting through the credit card debt she accrued after giving away more than $100,000.
No oversight
When an elderly man discovered thousands of dollars' worth of political charges on his credit card he said he never authorized, he turned to the agency that oversees campaign donations – the Federal Election Commission – for help.
“I am an 89-year-old widower, a retired architect who lives alone,” he wrote in a 2022 complaint. He said he had been plagued by robocalls and scam mail and it appeared ActBlue was “rife with fraud.” By the time the FEC completed its investigation, he had died, collapsing ""on his way to the post office to mail postcards to voters in Texas,” according to his obituary. But the agency hadn’t planned on doing anything about his complaint anyway, writing in a response that the matter was “rated as low priority” for an enforcement action based on criteria including the severity of the allegation and the dollar amount involved.
The agency shut down another complaint made about WinRed by the daughters of an elderly woman who said their mother had lost more than $6,700 to “elder abuse” with the same boiler plate response, noting the “low dollar amount involved.”
The FEC would not comment on WinRed or ActBlue specifically but said in a 2023 report on legislative recommendations that it had been regularly hearing from donors who had signed up for recurring donations without their knowledge or consent. The report noted consumers had often attempted to cancel the donations without success before contacting agency staff for help. Agency officials said the outcry from donors ""strongly suggests that many contributors are unaware of the ‘pre-checked boxes’ and are surprised by the already completed transactions appearing on account statements."" But it said it didn’t have the authority to ban the practice, and that Congress should introduce legislation to change this — a recommendation agency officials first made after the New York Times reported on the issue in 2021.
""I'm a retired cleaning lady. I just can't believe anyone would do this to me.""
""I gave Trump $20 6 years ago that was just once. Since then I've been hounded by REPUBLICANS BEGGING FOR MONEY. On the RNC Convention day I received 77 text messages of more begging.""
""My father is elderly and isn't able to manage his finances anymore, so this went on undetected for a while until we realized that he was running out of money and didn't know why.""
""I was recently helping my 93 year old father, who suffers from a cognitive impairment, sort through a pile of mail and saw a massive fraud that someone in ActBlue is perpetrating on my father.... these fraudsters need to stop defrauding older people, especially ones with mental impairments.""
""I can't afford you taking all my Social security payments. You drained my bank account, before I can even get food or pay my bills.""
""I am distressed by what appears to be outright fraud on behalf of the Republicans.""
""I may never contribute again. You are greedy and illegally fool people into taking our money. Not American. not what I thought the party stood for.""
""My grandmother, utterly confused and frustrated by the situation has paid her bills and been draining her financial accounts... she was absolutely floored and clearly did not understand the gravity of the deception.""
Dan Weiner, director of the Brennan Center’s Elections & Government Program, said federal campaign finance law is primarily intended to police political corruption but offers few protections for donors. He said seeking recurring donations “from someone who is not of sound mind” is “unscrupulous behavior [that] falls into a legal gray area.”
The Federal Trade Commission criticized pre-checked boxes in a 2022 staff report as an example of a “trick” and “psychological tactic” used by retailers and direct marketers “to get consumers to part with their money.” But the agency — which enforces laws governing deceptive advertising, among other regulations — told CNN it did not have jurisdiction over ads used by political campaigns, or over the operations of WinRed and ActBlue, despite fielding hundreds of complaints from consumers.
Currently, pre-checked boxes for recurring donations are allowed in almost every state despite widespread condemnation of the practice from consumer advocates. Federal legislation introduced in recent years that would have prevented their use died in committee without gaining traction.
And while four Democratic attorneys general have been investigating the fundraising tactics of WinRed and ActBlue, no action has been taken to date. A number of Republican lawmakers have specifically targeted ActBlue with investigations after right-wing influencers claimed the large volume of transactions from some donors suggested money laundering. CNN has found no evidence of money laundering, instead finding that many elderly donors simply didn’t realize how much they were giving.
Individual complaints made to state attorneys general around the country, meanwhile, have not resulted in any apparent action taken against the fundraising platforms or campaigns, according to records obtained by CNN. And in what some donors and experts have pointed to as a potential conflict of interest, the same attorneys general receiving complaints about these platforms have also used WinRed and ActBlue for their own fundraising efforts.
Making it stop
In Utah, a 69-year-old woman, who had a tube surgically placed in her brain to drain fluid from it and had such severe dementia that she required around-the-clock home care, donated nearly $20,000 to Republican candidates in less than four months.
WinRed continued to charge her even after the attorney overseeing her financial affairs informed the company of her condition and sent a cease-and-desist letter. He filed a lawsuit in 2021 against the platform, which remains ongoing. But it still took a year to make the donations stop. Just seven days after she made her last donation to the Republicans, public records show that more donations were charged to her accounts. This time, to a political group supporting Democrats.

Matthew Hurtt, the chairman of Virginia-based Arlington County Republican Committee, said he has fielded more than 200 calls and emails from frustrated donors located all over the country. Many of them are elderly donors who say they have struggled to stop their recurring contributions and receive refunds. Hurtt is not affiliated with WinRed, but said he receives the angry inquiries because WinRed is registered in Arlington, so charges made through the platform can sometimes show up with “Arlington” on credit card statements.
Hurtt, like other experts, told CNN he believes such aggressive fundraising tactics are short-sighted and will turn off voters in the long run.
“We don't have to trick people into giving money to our candidates and to our causes,” Hurtt said. “Any platform that tricks older donors into giving money unwittingly seems like a scheme to me.”
Both WinRed and ActBlue have said they notify donors of each recurring contribution and have guides on their websites explaining how donors or their families can request refunds and cancel recurring donations.
ActBlue told CNN it has trained its customer service staff to be on the lookout for those donors who use keywords that indicate confusion or cognitive issues and escalate them to a higher level of service. The platform said this situation is rare and that employees do what they can to accommodate refunds beyond the standard 90-day refund window.
WinRed’s website meanwhile says it “is happy to refund any donation made in error,” but notes that it can only provide refunds for those contributions made in the last 60 days.
Some of the candidates and PACs who CNN identified as receiving the most money from elderly, unwitting donors said they try to work with contributors to refund mistaken donations.
But many of those interviewed by CNN said it was hard to determine which campaigns to contact, especially since donations were often spread out among hundreds of groups. They usually contacted WinRed or ActBlue instead and found the process confusing, difficult and frequently unsuccessful.
In the case of WinRed specifically, many said they couldn’t even figure out how to reach a representative on the phone. One frustrated son who filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office told CNN he resorted to tracking down a company intern he found on LinkedIn in the hopes of finally turning off his mother’s recurring donations. He said she had lost more than $20,000 and that after contacting WinRed and even cancelling her debit card, she continued to be charged.
In Washington state, meanwhile, WinRed was quick to dismiss an 80-year-old woman’s plea for the state to investigate the platform for “senior abuse” -- saying the woman had agreed to the company’s terms of use, which make clear it provides refunds only as required by law. By the time she had filed her complaint, her money was long gone. It was up to her to reach out to the campaigns for any refunds.
“With all due respect,” WinRed’s attorney wrote, “there is nothing here to investigate.”
How CNN reported this story
CNN reviewed Federal Election Commission reports on hundreds of millions of contributions made through WinRed and ActBlue, the main donation platforms for Republican and Democratic campaigns. Reporters identified the top small-dollar donors who also gave the most frequently on each platform in recent years, and then reached out to more than 150 of those top donors and their family members for each platform.
Based on these interviews, as well as an analysis of hundreds of consumer complaints submitted to the Federal Trade Commission and state Attorneys General, reporters identified more than 50 elderly donors who gave more than they intended, many of whom suffered from cognitive decline or dementia. Reporters also reviewed complaints lodged on consumer advocacy websites TrustPilot.com and PissedConsumer.com.
Reporters reviewed data on donations made by those vulnerable donors reported in WinRed and ActBlue’s FEC filings over five years, from July 2019 through the end of June 2024. The donation amounts reported in the story do not include any refunds the donors later received, which were typically only a small fraction of the total they had given.
To identify ads with pre-checked recurring donation boxes, reporters downloaded data on fundraising ads on Facebook and Instagram from Meta’s Ad Library, and also reviewed fundraising emails sent by Trump and Harris’ campaigns provided by the Archive of Political Emails, which collects emails from numerous campaigns.",2024-10-22
CNN,In pictures: Trump running mate JD Vance | CNN Politics,"Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump’s vice presidential pick, formally accepted the nomination in July during his keynote speech at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.
“Tonight is a night of hope — a celebration of what America once was and, with God’s grace, what it will soon be again,” Vance said.
Vance was announced as Trump’s running mate earlier in the week. The 40-year-old is in his first term as a senator from Ohio.
The venture capitalist and author of the best-selling memoir “Hillbilly Elegy” was elected in 2022 after receiving a boost from Trump in a contentious Republican primary.
It was a reversal from just six years earlier. Vance was a key voice in the “Never Trump” movement during the 2016 election and has a well-documented history of opposing Trump publicly. But he earned Trump’s endorsement in 2022 after a concerted yearlong effort to embrace a new image as a leading MAGA proponent.",2024-07-15

CNN,Biden seeks to clean up ‘garbage’ comment about Trump supporters denigrating Latinos | CNN Politics,"President Joe Biden on Tuesday tried to clean up comments he made earlier that sparked immediate backlash from many who interpreted them as referring to supporters of former President Donald Trump as “garbage.”
Speaking during a Voto Latino get out-the-vote call, Biden — in reaction to Trump’s offensive rally at Madison Square Garden on Sunday — said, “And just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico ‘a floating island of garbage.’ Well, let me tell you something … I don’t know the Puerto Rican that I know… or Puerto Rico where I’m – in my home state of Delaware – they’re good, decent, honorable people.”
“The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters,” Biden said, pausing for a moment before continuing. “His, his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable and it’s un-American. It’s totally contrary to everything we’ve done, everything we’ve been.”
Biden’s comments drew swift backlash online, with Republicans immediately connecting them to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 remark that half of Trump’s supporters were “deplorables.” Biden’s remarks came just as Vice President Kamala Harris was set to take the stage for a major rally in Washington, DC.
“Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage—which is the only word I can think of to describe it,” Biden posted on X later that evening. “His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation.”
When CNN asked for an explanation on the president’s comments, a White House spokesperson insisted that Biden had meant “supporter’s” rather than “supporters,” arguing that he had actually said this: “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter’s – his – his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American.”
“The President referred to the hateful rhetoric at the Madison Square Garden rally as garbage,” White House spokesman Andrew Bates said.
Trump was informed of Biden’s remarks during his rally in Allentown, Pennsylvania, when Florida Sen. Marco Rubio ran on stage, saying, “You might not have heard this. Just moments ago. Joe Biden stated that our supporters are garbage.”
Trump said, “Wow. That’s terrible. That’s what it says. That’s what it says. So you have, remember Hillary, she said ‘deplorable’ and then she said irredeemable, right? But she said deplorable, that didn’t work out. Garbage I think is worse, right?”
His campaign soon blasted out a fundraising email using Biden’s comments, with the subject line, “You are not garbage! I love you! You are the best our nation has to offer.”
And Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt responded in a statement claiming that Biden and Harris “despise the tens of millions of Americans who support him,” while Trump “will be a president for ALL Americans.”
Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance also seized on Biden’s comments. “This is disgusting. Kamala Harris and her boss Joe Biden are attacking half of the country. There’s no excuse for this. I hope Americans reject it,” the Ohio senator posted on X.
As CNN reported earlier Tuesday, Biden’s role in the final weeks of the election has been moved even further out of the spotlight as recent campaign trail gaffes prompted a range of responses – from eyerolls to outright anger – from some Harris campaign aides.
Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro — an ally of Harris — said he hadn’t heard Biden’s comments until asked to respond by CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on “The Source,” but he added, “I would never insult the good people of Pennsylvania or any Americans even if they chose to support a candidate that I didn’t support.”
Responding to the White House’s attempt to explain the remarks, Shapiro said, “I think President Biden will decide what he wants to say. It’s certainly not words that I would choose, and I think it’s important that we remain focused on the contrast between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump and not attacking supporters of either candidate.”
On Tuesday’s call, Biden also criticized Trump’s character when trying to make the case for Harris.
“Donald Trump has no character, he doesn’t give a damn about the Latino community. He’s a failed businessman and he only cares about the billionaire friends he has,” Biden said, calling the former president “a true danger.”
“He’s a true danger, to not just Latinos, but to all people, particularly those who are in a minority in this country. You know, we have to vote to elect Kamala as president. Tim Walz as vice president. It’s never been more important,” Biden said.
In the days since his New York City rally, Trump’s campaign has tried to distance itself from comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who who made the remark about Puerto Rico. Hinchcliffe, like the other speakers, was an invited guest. “This joke does not reflect the views of President Trump or the campaign,” Trump campaign spokesperson Danielle Alvarez said in a statement Sunday.
But the vulgar and racist rhetoric at the rally has prompted finger-pointing within the former president’s inner circle and deep concern that his message was once again eclipsed by controversy.

CNN,Analysis: People are calling Trump a fascist. What does that mean? | CNN Politics,"A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.
Fascism is a dirty word in US politics, so when former President Donald Trump’s former chief of staff, retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, says Trump fits the definition of “fascist,” it’s news.
It places Trump’s name in the same ideological space as the most infamous fascists, Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. Trump has rejected the idea and called Kelly a “degenerate.”
Asked at a CNN town hall in the battleground state of Pennsylvania if she agrees with Kelly that Trump is a fascist, the Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, did not hesitate.
“Yes, I do. Yes, I do,” she said.
Kelly pointed The New York Times to a definition of fascism: “It’s a far-right authoritarian, ultranationalist political ideology and movement characterized by a dictatorial leader, centralized autocracy, militarism, forcible suppression of opposition, belief in a natural social hierarchy.”
“So certainly, in my experience, those are the kinds of things that he thinks would work better in terms of running America,” Kelly said.
Kelly added that Trump is in the “far-right area,” and “admires people who are dictators,” which in Kelly’s view places Trump in “the general definition of fascist.”
Using the military to quiet dissent
There are topical arguments to back Kelly up. Trump’s suggestion he could use the military against an “enemy from within,” which he said includes Democrats like Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Adam Schiff from California, certainly sounds fascist. His Republican defenders argue it’s just hyperbole.
Trump wanted to use the military to disrupt domestic protests when he was in office, something that his top general at the time, then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Mark Milley, rejected, according to reporting in 2021. Milley also privately compared Trump’s election denialism to Hitler’s “big lie.”
Even if he doesn’t intend to use the military on Democrats, he has a history of trying to use the military to put down protests in the US, making the threat to quiet dissent.
Sidelining dissent
Trump recently said he would fire special counsel Jack Smith “within two seconds” if he wins the election, which seems obvious since Smith has indicted Trump in cases involving election interference and mishandling classified documents.
The election interference case is delayed until after the election, and a different judge dismissed the classified documents case, although Smith has appealed.
Trump has a history of firing officials who question him. He fired James Comey, the FBI director, when he was president. He fired his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, after never forgiving Sessions for appointing a special counsel to investigate potential collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.
The resulting report from special counsel Robert Mueller has been referred to as the “Russia hoax” so many times by Trump and his allies that most Americans probably don’t remember that Mueller pointedly did not exonerate Trump of obstruction of justice in the report. Mueller identified multiple contacts between Trump’s campaign and Russians in 2016, a time when Russians were actively trying to help Trump’s campaign. Mueller concluded the contacts did not rise to the level of conspiracy.
Trump’s second attorney general, Bill Barr, slow-walked release of Mueller’s report to dilute its impact. Barr would later leave Trump’s administration after the 2020 election after refusing to support Trump’s unsupported election interference conspiracy theories.
Democrats wonder who would be left to temper Trump’s urges if he’s reelected.
Purging the government
If he wins the election, Trump has promised to do more to go to war with what he perceives as a “deep state” of bureaucrats at the Justice Department, the FBI and the Pentagon.
He has also suggested he would use the justice system to prosecute election officials.
All of this points in favor of at least a thematic alignment with some elements of fascism, built around a strong leader and where dissent in the government is dismissed. But there can also be more to fascism, such as complete control of the German economy and society. Trump has not suggested anything like that.
While Harris is just now coming around to labeling Trump a fascist, he’s been calling her Marxist for the entire presidential campaign, referring to her as “Comrade Kamala.” That’s clearly not true since Harris supports private ownership.
Trump has used the term too
In June, Trump said the US was a “fascist state” as he pushed the unfounded conspiracy theory that President Joe Biden was behind his prosecution in New York for falsifying business records related to hush money payments paid on Trump’s behalf to a porn star in 2016.
I delved into the definition of fascism and how it applied to Trump back in June, when he was using the term.
There are experts who view Trump as fascist. Robert Paxton, a professor emeritus at Columbia University who has written widely on fascism in Europe, had rejected the label for Trump until January 6, 2021, when the historian argued that the image of Trump supporters storming the US Capitol “removes my objection to the fascist label.”
Trump has also repeatedly used language that can be tied back to Nazis, such as when he said immigrants are “poisoning the blood” of the country.
‘I don’t care what you call this’
When CNN’s Wolf Blitzer asked Ohio Sen. JD Vance in May about Trump’s claim the US is a “fascist state,” Vance would not reject the idea, suggesting at least a tolerance for the term.
“I don’t care what you call this, but this is not the America that I know and love,” Vance, who was not yet Trump’s running mate, said in a tense exchange.
Concepts don’t have timeless essences
Back in June, I also talked to Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins, an assistant professor at Wesleyan University and editor of the book, “Did It Happen Here? Perspectives on Fascism and America,” which includes the writing of Paxton, among many others.
“That model of historical comparison where we look to what happened to Germany in the 1930s and then use it as kind of a navigational device or a map for understanding what’s happened today is quite common,” he said, although there are arguments it is a flawed comparison.
“Concepts don’t have timeless essences that we can just map on to any phenomena, but they change given political context, given power structures in society,” he said.
Today, he said, the term “fascism” is used “to mobilize people in order to get over their divides, to defeat an enemy that’s far greater than their own long-standing disputes.”
Steinmetz-Jenkins argued there is a long history, going back to Franklin D. Roosevelt, of Americans on both sides of the political aisle trying to label their opponents as “fascist,” and there are also examples of American lawmakers threatening their opponents with investigation.
There are arguments in favor of the fascism comparison, but also arguments against it – particularly since there are echoes of Trump’s rise in populist and White nationalist movements closer to home in American history.
I went back to Steinmetz-Jenkins to ask if the comparisons have changed in the intervening months, and he noted that the fascism debate had simmered over the summer, with Harris replacing Biden – and he noted that for most of Harris’ campaign, a message of the politics of joy had replaced fear of fascism.
Now, as Democrats get anxious about losing to Trump, the threat of fascism has returned to the fore.
“What is needed is a plan to inspire people to vote for the Democrats, not fear tactics that might lead to a sense of fatalism that the world is being engulfed by fascism,” he said.
Enough American voters have heard the term “fascism” in the same breath as Trump that if he wins in November, it will be clear that they are at least willing to tolerate it or don’t believe he will carry through with what he says.",2024-10-24
CNN,North Carolina appeals court rejects RNC request to set aside ballots from overseas voters who never lived in state | CNN Politics,"The North Carolina Court of Appeals on Tuesday unanimously rejected a Republican bid to have election officials segregate overseas ballots cast by people who have never resided in the state for additional checks of the voters’ eligibility.
The court’s decision is the latest blow to Republican efforts to attack overseas ballots in critical battleground states.
Earlier Tuesday, a federal judge in Pennsylvania dismissed a challenge to the vetting procedures for overseas ballots in that state. And last week, a state judge in Michigan sided against the GOP in a case targeting ballots cast by people who had never lived there but were eligible to vote in the state because of familial ties to it.
The Republican National Committee sued North Carolina in early October to block a policy that allows citizens abroad to cast ballots in the state if their parents resided there before leaving the country, even if the voters themselves never lived there.
The law permitting such votes was passed with bipartisan support in 2011 and has been in effect in every election since 2012, but Republicans argued in their suit that it ran afoul of the state constitution’s requirement that limits voting in the state’s elections “to North Carolina residents and only North Carolina residents.” They claimed that it could expose the election to “fraud and other misconduct.”
Last week, Wake County Superior Court Judge John W. Smith denied the RNC’s request for an emergency court order that would require election officials to set aside ballots from overseas voters who hadn’t themselves lived in the state. The judge said that “there is absolutely no evidence that any person has ever fraudulently claimed (the exemption at issue) and actually voted in any North Carolina election.”
The RNC quickly appealed to the Court of Appeals, making the same request that Smith turned down.
The North Carolina State Board of Election and Democratic National Committee, which intervened in the case to defend the state law, pressed the appeals court to maintain the status quo by declining to segregate the ballots, warning that a ruling in favor of the RNC would invite chaos into an election that is already underway.
“It is difficult to conceive of an outcome more disruptive, unanticipated, or unfair than throwing out the ballots of U.S. citizens who have already voted in good-faith reliance on a statute that has been in place for more than thirteen years,” attorneys for the state told the appeals court.
State officials announced Tuesday afternoon that nearly 2.3 million ballots had already been cast in the general election, a figure that included more than 15,000 overseas votes and just under 5,000 military ballots.
Though North Carolina’s policy of accepting ballots from overseas voters has been on the books for several years, starting in 2016, civilian voters abroad began outnumbering the military vote overseas – which itself is not as conservative as it once was.
Democrats announced earlier this cycle a six-figure investment into turning out eligible Democrats abroad, particularly those who can vote in battleground states.

CNN,In pictures: A historic race for the White House | CNN Politics,"In a span of just one month, the presidential election changed dramatically in the United States.
President Joe Biden pulled out of the race on July 21, a few weeks after a disastrous debate performance that had Democratic allies wanting him to step aside and “pass the torch” for the good of the party and the country. He threw his support behind Vice President Kamala Harris, who has secured the Democratic nomination and is looking to become the nation’s first-ever female president.
Eight days before Biden dropped out, former President Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The shooting shocked the world and unified many Republicans around their nominee, who lost to Biden four years ago.

CNN,"Michigan young voters enthused for Harris, but their level of support is still a big question | CNN Politics","The campus art museum doubles as a voting hub. There are voter registration tables seemingly everywhere. Even the sleeves at the campus coffee shop have a message: “Wolverines: Let’s Vote Early.”
So Jade Gray bristles a bit at this hypothetical: What if Kamala Harris comes up just short in battleground Michigan?
“If she comes up short in Michigan, I don’t think it’s because of young voters,” said Gray, a former co-president of the University of Michigan College Democrats who graduated in May. “I think it’s probably because we waited too long to make a switch of the candidate.”
Voters aged 18-29 are a vital piece of the Democratic coalition. They were crucial to Joe Biden’s 2020 Michigan win and in the dramatic state-level gains the party made in 2022. But young voters’ level of support is a big question for 2024 because of anger and disappointment with how the Biden-Harris administration has handled the Israel-Hamas conflict.
“I don’t think there is any blame to put on young people or people of color or Muslim voters in this election cycle, and I quite frankly don’t really want to hear about that,” Gray said in an interview. “I think that you got to put that on campaigns, and you have to put that on the elected officials that are running for office. I sure hope she doesn’t come up short in Michigan, because I don’t really want to be talking to people about how young people should have done more when I feel like we’re doing a lot.”
The conversation with Gray and Anushka Jalisatgi, also co-president of the College Democrats last school year, was our third in 11 months. Both are part of a CNN project, called All Over the Map, designed to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in battleground states and are part of crucial voting blocs.
In the two prior conversations, both said Biden’s age was a concern for many young voters who felt little connection to the octogenarian president. Now, with Harris as the Democratic nominee, the energy and enthusiasm difference is obvious.
Gray now works as a digital organizer for a progressive group.
“I have noticed a significant shift in activity, across the board,” Gray said.
Jalisatgi is back on campus as a first-year law student, and just switched her voter registration to Michigan.
“A lot of my out-of-state friends are switching their registration to Michigan because it is a battleground state,” Jalisatgi said.
And while Gray and Jalisatgi have moved on, the College Democrats are in high gear for election crunch time. A Harris campaign official stopped by a meeting during our latest visit and a crowded room of students spent time phone banking after getting a pep talk from the state’s Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer.
“The work that you are doing is so important and I am energized by what I see happening with all these Dem clubs on campuses. You are kicking a**. So, we just got to keep rolling through,” Whitmer said over a video link.
Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell stopped by in person, and warned against overconfidence.
“I’m going to look you all in the eye and tell you, neither candidate is winning in Michigan right now.”
No encampment on campus, but tensions still high over Israel-Hamas conflict
The almost everywhere-you-look focus on registration and early voting at the Ann Arbor campus is remarkable.
One registration table we stopped by on our latest visit was in a familiar spot: on the same campus path where students last semester built an encampment to air their grievances at Israel, at the Biden administration and at school officials they were pushing to divest from companies that do business with Israel.
The school will not allow a new encampment, so it is harder to gauge how much the raw anger of last semester has carried over to the new school year – and into voting decisions.
“A lot of that energy, because it can’t happen in a physical space – it’s still occupying a lot of online space,” Gray said.
Jalisatgi sees it directed less at Harris and more at university officials.
“People still very much care that this is ongoing and that the university is complicit in contributing to it,” Jalisatgi said. “I’m seeing universities putting out a lot of new free speech guidelines, new regulations for how they want to curb free speech or how they want to regulate it.”
The Ann Arbor College Republicans would not let CNN into a meeting they held during our recent visit.
Member Max Scheske, a junior, said attendance and energy are up some as the election draws close. But he also said the group was pretty evenly divided when it comes to enthusiasm for Donald Trump.
“We certainly do have our, you know, ‘Trump is basically Jesus’ wing of the club,” Scheske said. “But we do have a very sizeable, you know, very critical of Trump.”
Scheske describes himself as libertarian and Trump as a populist. “So, he is kind of hit or miss with me,” Scheske said.
There are Harris yard signs and posters and placards all around Ann Arbor. Signs of Trump support are much harder to find. On campus, Scheske said Trump’s unequivocal support for Israel makes it harder to win over Democrats critical of the Biden-Harris administration’s defense of the Jewish state.
“If it was up to me, he would not have been the Republican nominee,” Scheske said.
‘We feel a sense of betrayal’
The biggest risk for Harris is that young voters stay home, skip the presidential line on the ballot, or vote third party.
In May, Wayne State student Summer Matkin was leaning third party. Biden was the Democratic nominee then, and she had concerns both about his age and the Israel-Hamas conflict.
Now, she calls Harris “the safest option” even though she is frustrated the bloodshed in the Middle East continues.
There were signs of trouble for Harris, though, when we stopped by a meeting of the Wayne State Syrian Students Association.
The roughly 20 students in the room did not want to be quoted by name or have their faces captured on camera. But when asked if they would have a hard time voting for Harris, nearly every hand in the room went up.
Likewise, Wahbeh Nuseibeh, a 26-year-old Wayne State student, said he would not vote for Harris in 2024 after voting for Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020.
“We feel a sense of betrayal,” said Nuseibeh, who is Palestinian.
“I’m not voting for Kamala Harris. I cannot in good conscience,” he said. In his view, his tax dollars pay for bombs shipped to Israel “to kill my friends and family overseas.”
Nuseibeh will likely choose a third-party option.
“Donald Trump is a threat to our democracy and a threat to our society,” he said in an interview at a Yemeni coffee shop in majority Arab American Dearborn just outside Detroit.
Maya Siegmann will cast her vote for Harris, though she found the vice president’s debate answers far too vague.
“She didn’t directly answer most of the questions and seemed to go around them or could not give a real answer,” Siegmann said. “And when the topic of the Israel-Hamas war came up, there wasn’t really a solid response as to how she would solve it.”
Siegmann is active in the Hillel campus Jewish organization at Wayne State and just got back from a summer in Israel. There, she said, she was asked a lot about public opinion in the United States.
“The response was basically that the propaganda war, the social media war, the news war that Hamas and Israel are fighting, Hamas is winning right now,” Siegmann said.
Last year was tense on campus and as both the October 7 anniversary of Hamas’ attack on Israel and then the US election draw near, Siegmann said she is mindful that emotions could get high again. She is a proud Jew and fervent supporter of Israel, but she is also critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his conduct of the war.
But she says such nuance can get quickly lost when passions get high.
“I worry that when it does come up, because we have different classes, like policy classes, that it will be an argument and less a discussion.”
The campus has a large Arab and Muslim population, and Siegmann said this semester she is making more of an effort to get to know classmates better.
“These are people I am going to be with until I complete my degree or degrees,” she said. “So I want to kind of form that solid groundwork so that I can build off that.”",2024-10-02
CNN,Tensions between Trump and RNC spill over into public view | CNN Politics,"Former President Donald Trump’s decision to skip next month’s third GOP presidential primary debate and instead hold a rivaling rally just up the road highlights how complicated – and at times thorny – the relationship between the Republican National Committee and the front-runner’s team has become.
The RNC was caught off guard when Trump’s campaign announced last week that it would hold a counterprogramming event the same night as the debate, just down the road from the Miami arena where other Republican candidates would be facing off.
While Trump has not attended any of the debates, citing his commanding lead in the polls, the decision to host what appears to be a competing event in the same area has rubbed some Republicans the wrong way.
“It’s a slap in the face [to the RNC],” one Republican operative with ties to the committee told CNN. “An intentional slap in the face.”
Allies close to Trump attempted to justify the decision, pointing to Trump’s public frustration that the RNC is continuing to hold debates despite the wide margin he has over the rest of the field. Earlier this month, the former president’s top campaign advisers called on the RNC to “immediately cancel the upcoming debate in Miami and end all future debates in order to refocus its manpower and money” on defeating Democrats in 2024.
But even before the debates took center stage, Trump’s relationship with the organization, led by his own hand-picked chairwoman, Ronna McDaniel, had become increasingly tumultuous in recent months.
For one, the former president privately still harbors resentment towards the organization over the 2020 election, blaming them for not having what he believes were the proper attorneys in place to challenge the election results, multiple sources told CNN. Some Trump allies have tried unsuccessfully to rid him of this belief – noting that it was not the RNC’s responsibility to provide the legal resources to challenge the election. Others have pointed out that his own 2020 campaign should have had a better legal infrastructure in place – however, these arguments, like many involving the 2020 election, have fallen on deaf ears.
While Trump seems to understand that why the RNC has not endorsed his 2024 candidacy, sources said he has asked allies and aides why the RNC must remain neutral in the 2024 GOP presidential primary race. The RNC’s bylaws mandate neutrality; this primary season, McDaniel has taken pains to act as an impartial chair.
The RNC stressed that it is focused on presiding over the GOP primary in a fair way to all the candidates running for the Republican nomination for president.
“The RNC will continue to enact a fair, transparent debate process. In addition to sanctioning the primary debates, the RNC is continuing to buildout our 2024 operation, with in-state hires for Political and Election Integrity staffers in key battleground states,” an RNC spokesman said in a statement.
Trump appointed McDaniel as chair after he was elected in 2016, and dozens of establishment Republican committee members were replaced by Trump loyalists. Trump personally felt like he helped make McDaniel into the party leader she is, and has expected loyalty from her as a result, sources familiar with their relationship said. When Trump was president, McDaniel was extremely supportive. And, while Trump was a driving force behind McDaniel retaining the chair of the committee earlier this year, many in his orbit fault her for Republicans’ underwhelming results in the 2022 midterms.
“There’s a general concern about Ronna and the RNC when it comes to the 2020 and 2022 elections,” a person close to Trump told CNN, pointing to what they saw as mistakes with the party’s messaging strategy and get out the vote efforts.
“There’s a lot of concern about her leading the party going forward,” the source added.
However, Trump’s top campaign officials are in regular touch with RNC leadership and Trump’s senior campaign advisers, including Susie Wiles, flew to California earlier this year for McDaniel’s reelection as chair. Privately, Trump’s team had made it clear that they were backing McDaniel against her opponent, Trump attorney Harmeet Dhillon.
Shortly after winning, McDaniel told Fox News that this would be her “last term as chair…It’s done.”
After a major political party picks a nominee, there are usually some adjustments between that nominee’s campaign structure and the party committee – something that some members of Trump’s inner circle would like to see if Trump becomes the GOP nominee.
One source noted that it was too early to have a conversation about changes at the RNC, but added that top officials, including McDaniel, should be willing to step aside to make way for new leadership if Trump wins the nomination.
Another insisted that Trump is not planning to “clean house” should he becomes the nominee.
“It’s not unusual for the nominee to make some changes at the RNC, and I imagine Trump will, but there is nothing planned,” one source close to the former president said, noting that McDaniel’s term would be over in a year and a half anyway. “There would be a new RNC chairman that I imagine Trump would be influential and in choosing just like he was influential with [McDaniel].”
The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.
Tensions began escalating ahead of first debate
After McDaniel announced the first debate would be in August, Trump began to suggest publicly he may not participate, citing his lead in early polls and because he would face questions from what he described as “hostile” news networks.
Trump also said in a Truth Social post that the RNC didn’t get “approval” from him or his campaign ahead of announcing the debates, though presidential candidates do not have singular control over the format or timing of these events.
A GOP adviser familiar with the process said Trump’s campaign was fully briefed on the timing, location and other specifics of the announced primary debates. McDaniel had told Trump personally that the debates would start in August, according to two sources familiar with the conversation.
The debate fight came to a head when RNC officials met with Trump’s senior campaign advisers in Nashville last spring at the RNC retreat to sort out what had become a public back and forth, multiple sources familiar with the meeting told CNN.
The conversation turned into a heated back-and-forth between David Bossie, who is in charge of the RNC debate committee, and Trump campaign adviser Chris LaCivita. McDaniel and Wiles stepped in break it up.
As it became clear Trump would not likely participate in the first debate, McDaniel and Bossie privately visited Trump at Bedminster in July to encourage him to participate in the debates, CNN previously reported. Trump was noncommittal on his plans during that meeting. However, in the weeks that followed, he increasingly became frustrated with McDaniel and Bossie for continuing to try and pressure him into attending – something that has also contributed to the straining of their relationship, a source familiar with the matter told CNN.
“Sitting there, having Bossie and Ronna tell him that it’s a good idea to go to a debate where he’s going to get the crap kicked out of him by all the other candidates, never mind the moderators, there’s no upside,” the source said. “He didn’t appreciate it.”
“It just started to grate on him,” the source said.
RNC officials and members pushed back at the idea that they would not hold the debate just because Trump is leading in the polls.
“The reality is 50% of the base is with him – that means there’s another 50% that’s not,” the Republican operative said. “That 50% has to feel like there’s a fair process that played out if they’re going to turn out if Trump is nominated and actually vote for him.”
While Trump bristled at the date, which he said was early, the sources said that he did not completely shut it down. But two Trump sources familiar with the conversations between Trump’s campaign and the RNC said that his team and the former president himself had made it clear that he would not attend a debate before Labor Day.
Trump instead sat for a pre-recorded interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.
The legal complications
The link between Trump world and McDaniel and the RNC goes deeper than politics, as the chairwoman and the committee have become entangled in Trump’s legal woes. The RNC paid millions of dollars to law firms representing Trump in various investigations, but stopped after Trump announced his third presidential run due to their neutrality policy.
The committee “cannot pay legal bills for any candidate that’s announced,” McDaniel told CNN’s Dana Bash last November when asked whether the RNC would stop paying Trump’s legal bills if he became a candidate.
“We cannot do in kind contributions to any candidate right now. He’s the former president being attacked from every which way with lawsuits, and he’s certainly raised more under the RNC than we’ve spent on these bills,” she added at the time.
McDaniel also testified before the House select committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, and is likely to testify in the federal trial as well. The federal case into Trump’s alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election is just one of several trials Trump is facing early next year.
Earlier this month, the judge presiding over the Georgia election subversion case signed an order to compel McDaniel to testify at the trial.
“You’d think that maybe everyone attacking her would take into consideration that she’s probably going to end up in several of his trials,” the GOP operative told CNN.
As of now, it’s unclear how her potential testimony could further impact their relationship, but her role as a likely witness could further add to the strain between the two.",2023-10-23
CNN,Michelle Obama makes passionate plea for women’s health while campaigning for Harris | CNN Politics,"Michelle Obama issued a scathing indictment of Donald Trump on Saturday at a rally in Michigan for Kamala Harris, calling the former president an existential threat to women’s rights and telling men that a vote for Trump “is a vote against us.”
The former first lady, in a reprise of her passionate and often cutting remarks this summer at the Democratic National Convention, expressed hope and fear in equal turn, touting Harris’ bravery and compassion while openly agonizing over the prospect of Trump’s return to the White House. By the time she introduced and embraced Harris, Obama’s voice was nearly trembling — gripped by worry and frustrated by a race that, she insisted, should not be as close as the polls suggest.
“By every measure, she has demonstrated that she’s ready,” Obama said of Harris. “The real question is, as a country, are we ready for this moment?”
Addressing a raucous, adoring crowd in Kalamazoo, Obama spoke frankly and often in bleak terms about the implications for women — and “the men who love us” — if the federal government, led by the president, is not inclined to cushion the blow of state abortion bans.
“Please, please do not hand our fates over to the likes of Trump, who knows nothing about us, who has shown deep contempt for us,” Obama said. “Because a vote for him is a vote against us, against our health, against our worth.”
Harris’ Kalamazoo rally — or “Kamala-zoo,” as the former first lady joked — followed another reproductive rights-themed event on Friday night in Houston, where music superstar Beyoncé endorsed the vice president and issued a similar message of faith and fear.
“I’m not here as a celebrity. I’m not here as a politician,” the singer said. “I’m here as a mother.”
Harris in Houston spoke directly to male voters, saying, “Men across America do not want to see their daughters and wives and sisters and mothers put at risk because their rights have been taken.”
Obama in Michigan made a similar overture, but often in more vivid, painfully detailed terms.
“If your wife is shivering and bleeding on the operating room table during a routine, the delivery gone bad, her pressure dropping as she loses more and more blood, or some unforeseen infection spreads and her doctors aren’t sure if they can act — you’ll be the one praying that it’s not too late,” Obama said. “You’ll be the one pleading for somebody, anybody to do something.”
To the women watching, Obama asked that they either try to convince undecided friends and family members to vote for Harris or that they strike out on their own.
“If you are a woman who lives in a household of men that don’t listen to you or value your opinion, just remember that your vote is a private matter,” Obama said. “You get to use your judgment and cast your vote for yourself and the women in your life. Remember, women standing up for what is best for us can make the difference in this election.”
That appeal to moderate Republicans and conservatives disillusioned by the Trump brand of Republican politics has been another theme of Harris’ campaign in the closing weeks of the campaign.
“Kamala, she is putting herself out there fearlessly, facing down even her harshest critics. She’s seeking out Republicans to find common ground,” Obama said. “Unlike her opponent, she’s not ducking interviews or cowering in safe spaces only with fawning audience. She’s showing us what a sane, stable leader looks like.”
After a spelling out a litany of criticism against Trump, his “horrible behavior” and what she described as his bumbling pandemic response, Obama — again — offered a glimpse of her own anxiety.
“With all that being said, I got to ask myself, ‘Well, why on Earth is this race even close?’” Obama said. “I lay awake at night wondering what in the world is going on.”
Harris, who has been on a dayslong swing-state blitz, with the exception of her star-studded event in Texas, focused her remarks on now-familiar themes and lines of attacks, again contrasting Trump’s “enemies list” with her “to-do list.”
“Just imagine Donald Trump with no guardrails,” Harris said. “He who will claim unchecked and extreme power if he is reelected, he who has vowed he will be a dictator on Day 1, he who has said he wished he had generals like Hitler, who calls Americans who disagree with him ‘the enemy from within.’”
Standing behind a podium with a presidential seal, Harris pointed to Trump’s previous call to terminate the Constitution and restore him to power, saying the comments alone should disqualify him.
“Never again, never again,” she said.
Harris received raucous applause as she delivered the passion-filled line, the loudest response to the vice president of the evening.
Speaking in a typically blue-leaning county that President Joe Biden won by about 20 points in 2020, Harris also made a direct appeal to younger voters — including those in Kalamazoo, which is home to multiple colleges.
“Generations of Americans before us led the fight for freedom, and now the baton is in our hands,” she said, asking, “Can I see Gen Z?” — which prompted a cheer from some younger attendees.
“I love you guys,” Harris said, adding, “Of the many things that I just think are so great about you, you are rightly impatient for change.
“I love that.”",2024-10-26
CNN,Election officials are hustling to fight misinformation in real time as early voting begins | CNN Politics,"The election misinformation machine is already ramping up in critical battleground states as early voting gets underway, and election officials are hustling to combat falsehoods in real time.
Conservatives have been sharing uncorroborated instances of machines flipping votes, claims of widespread fraud in mail ballots and suggestions that election officials are subverting the process if it takes multiple days to count ballots. The claims are ricocheting around social media as voters hit the polls. They mirror claims that former President Donald Trump and his allies spread around the 2020 election as they tried to head off Trump’s loss to now-President Joe Biden.
State and local election officials, however, are also preparing for a deluge of false and misleading claims, and are actively trying to address issues before they go far.
“Our humble ask is that before people swallow whole what they see in their social media feed, they at least verify it against a trusted source,” Minnesota Secretary of State and president of the National Association of Secretaries of State Steve Simon, a Democrat, told reporters this week.
Bret Schafer, a senior fellow at the nonprofit Alliance for Securing Democracy who’s focused on election-related disinformation, said that some of the push is needed because social media companies have stepped back from challenging false claims.
“It’s reassuring how much better election officials have gotten around communication in advance of the election,” Schafer said. “There definitely wasn’t the same level of interaction four years ago … in trying to communicate any changes in how voting will work this time, and, to the extent possible, short-circuit some of the false election narratives we know will be coming.”
Here are four examples from this month as early voting continues in earnest:
Machines switching votes?
“We have received a report that twice, persons voting on a machine had the machine alter their vote from Trump to Harris,” the Washoe County Republican Party in Nevada claimed in an email blast that was flagged on social media by local political reporter Jon Ralston.
It was reminiscent of the many debunked voting machine claims from 2020. And while those conspiracy theories continue to swirl online, a spokesperson for Washoe County told CNN there have been no specific complaints about machines flipping votes since early voting began.
Claims of voter fraud also circulated in Texas this week as early voting began in the state. In one instance, shared by some right-wing personalities on social media, a man claimed that his vote had been switched on the voting machine from one candidate to another, telling people to “check your paper ballots.” Trump allies who shared the video claimed that Texas’ Tarrant County used a voting system that had vulnerabilities and led to the alleged switch.
The county’s Elections Administration Department issued a statement Tuesday pushing back on these claims, saying that in one reported instance, a voter reviewed their printed ballot and “found that it did not correctly reflect his choice for President.”
Another ballot was provided and the issue was resolved, the department said, adding that they had “no reason to believe votes are being switched by the voting system.”
Counting votes in Georgia
In Georgia, several right-wing accounts seized on a CBS interview with GOP Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger over the weekend, in which he said the state should be able to report 70% to 75% of the vote total by 8 p.m. on Election Day. He noted the state would still need to tally overseas and military ballots, which can be received until the Friday after Election Day and could help determine the winner in a razor-thin race.
But Raffensperger’s critics twisted his comments to make it seem as if he was suggesting 25% of the remaining vote would come from overseas or military ballots and that there was no chance the state would be able to report results for three days – claims Raffensperger did not make.
“I know you’re up to something & it is going to all come to light,” Kylie Jane Kremer, a Trump supporter who helped to organize the January 6, 2021, rally on the Ellipse that precluded the attack on the US Capitol, said on X. “You don’t just belong in jail, you belong under the jail, for subverting Georgian’s right to secure, free & fair elections.”
Kremer told CNN, “Raffensperger is putting out confusing information to the masses on voting,” but said she believes all overseas and military ballots should be counted.
Raffensperger responded to some of the criticism on X, reiterating that most of the early vote would be tallied by 8 p.m. and Election Day votes would be reported later that evening.
But the inaccurate extrapolations had already taken off and, much to the disappointment of officials in Georgia, Utah Sen. Mike Lee was among those criticizing Raffensperger.
Lee, a Republican, posted “Just…no” on X, as he shared a post inaccurately claiming that Raffensperger said the results wouldn’t be ready for three days.
Raffensperger’s appearance on CBS came as he too was debunking a claim that machines were flipping votes.
“We’re going to respond quickly to these sorts of things in 2024 because it’s not supported by the facts,” Raffensperger said. “The equipment’s working.”
Mail ballots in Arizona
In Arizona, officials were also hitting back at the notion that taking multiple days to count the ballots somehow equates to election fraud.
“Any Secretary of State in any state who gets on TV today and says it’ll take days to count the votes is a cheater, a traitor, and should be arrested,” a prominent right-wing account called Catturd posted on X.
Maricopa County Recorder Stephen Richer, a Republican, shot back: “That’s one possibility. A different possibility is that different states have different state laws.”
In Arizona, for instance, experts expect hundreds of thousands of voters to return their mail ballots on Election Day, which takes time to process and count. Other states don’t have the same kind of deluge of Election Day mail ballots.
Unattended ballots in Minnesota
In another instance that left officials scrambling, officials in Minneapolis over the weekend tried to mitigate the fallout of a picture circulating on social media showing boxes of unattended ballots in a parking lot.
Local GOP leaders and pro-Trump accounts raised suspicions on Friday about the incident, spreading the photo and questioning the legitimacy of mail-in voting, which nonpartisan experts say is a secure process that isn’t plagued by widespread fraud.
Within hours, Hennepin County officials issued a statement acknowledging the “unacceptable” security lapse – and posted 18 minutes of surveillance footage to YouTube, showing that nobody touched the unguarded ballots.
“Mis- and disinformation is one of the biggest challenges facing elections officials right now, and getting out ahead of rumors as quickly as we can is our only hope of combatting them,” Hennepin County elections director Ginny Gelms told CNN.

CNN,House nears third week without speaker as eight Republicans vie for gavel | CNN Politics,"A crowded field of Republicans are vying to earn the support of their conference to wield the gavel, throwing the chamber into even more uncertainty after three weeks without a speaker.
The conference is searching for a new speaker nominee after Rep. Jim Jordan on Friday became the latest to exit the race. The chamber has been without a speaker since House Republicans ousted Rep. Kevin McCarthy earlier this month.
Eight House Republicans are running for the position, including GOP Whip Tom Emmer, who is endorsed by McCarthy. Emmer has moved to lock in support across the ideological and geographic spectrum in the conference, giving him what many House Republicans believe is an advantage, according to GOP sources. He could face an uphill battle, however, against allies of former President Donald Trump who have been quick to criticize Emmer for voting to certify the 2020 election.
The speaker hopefuls spent the weekend working the phones to win their conference’s support ahead of a candidate forum Monday evening and secret-ballot election Tuesday.
Emmer spoke with Trump by phone over the weekend, a source familiar with the matter told CNN, and Emmer touted his “strong working relationship” with the former president on social media Monday.
“Thank you, Mr. President,” Emmer posted on X, alongside a video clip of Trump saying he’s “always” gotten along with Emmer. “If my colleagues elect me Speaker of the House, I look forward to continuing our strong working relationship.”
Texas Rep. Pete Sessions, another candidate for speaker, said Monday that he also spoke with Trump about his bid.
“He called me and we had a polite conversation. I believe that the president is interested in having somebody he can work with, and I think I’m one of those people,” he told CNN’s Manu Raju, adding that he did not ask for Trump’s endorsement.
These are the other GOP representatives running for speaker:
- Jack Bergman of Michigan, a retired 40-year veteran of the US Marines.
- Byron Donalds of Florida, a second-term member of the far-right Freedom Caucus.
- Kevin Hern of Oklahoma, chair of the conservative group known as the Republican Study Committee – which wields a large bloc of GOP members.
- Mike Johnson of Louisiana, the vice chairman for the House Republican Conference.
- Gary Palmer of Alabama, the chairman of the Republican Policy Committee.
- Austin Scott of Georgia, the seven-term ally of McCarthy who quickly dropped out of a last-minute challenge to Jordan last week.
Rep. Dan Meuser of Pennsylvania had also been in the running but dropped out of the race Monday evening.
Speaking to reporters, Meuser said, “I felt that it was in the best interest in the end.”
“We have great candidates, and I wrote up a plan of how to improve the speaker’s office – making it a members-first office, which in the end is a people’s first office – and a few of the candidates up there have adopted some of my ideas,” he said.
Frustrations and divisions have only intensified within the conference as Republicans search for a way to resolve the impasse. That, along with the GOP’s narrow majority, has made it increasingly unclear whether any candidate will be able to secure the 217 floor votes needed to win the gavel.
The House, meanwhile, remains in a state of paralysis amid the threat of a government shutdown next month and the Israel-Hamas war.
The government runs out of funding in less than a month, after narrowly avoiding a shutdown with a stopgap funding bill last month. A speaker will need to be involved in negotiations with the White House and the Senate, both of which are controlled by Democrats.
And there is momentum for a bill to give further aid to Israel’s war against Hamas. President Joe Biden has asked Congress for a $105 billion package that will include aid for Israel and Ukraine, which is said to be running out of munitions in its fight against Russia’s invasion.
The showdown over the speakership kicked off earlier this month when a bloc of hardline conservatives voted to oust McCarthy, a historic move that plunged the House into unprecedented territory. Then, in the aftermath of McCarthy’s ouster, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise’s speakership nomination met a swift downfall when the conference failed to come together on his bid.
On Friday, Republicans pushed Jordan out of the race after he failed to win the gavel for the third time in a floor vote earlier in the day.

For the vast majority of Americans who live outside the seven battleground states, there is a confounding helplessness in 2024.
On the one hand, polling suggests a historically tight race heading into Election Day.
On the other hand, the Electoral College map suggests that the results in all but those seven states are a foregone conclusion, assuming people show up and vote the way polling suggests they will.
Every vote counts, obviously, but some seem to matter more than others. At least in some years.
Swing today, safe tomorrow
If there is some consolation for the millions of Republicans in California and Democrats in Texas – and so on – it is that today’s swing state is tomorrow’s safe state.
Missouri, for example, is a flyover state for presidential candidates today, reliably red and far off the radar of campaigns popping back and forth between actual battlegrounds.
But for about 100 years, Missouri was the ultimate bellwether in presidential elections, voting for the winner in 25 of 26 elections between 1904 and 2004 – within the lifetime of most of today’s voters.
Florida and Ohio, both of which are now red states for presidential purposes, were hotly contested battlegrounds until this election cycle. Virginia and Colorado, which were battlegrounds in roughly the same era, are now essentially blue in presidential years.
In the closest possible election that people alive today can remember, 2000, it’s Florida’s “hanging chads” and the US Supreme Court decision that ended a recount there that stick in people’s minds. But New Hampshire and New Mexico, now both blue states, were also decided by the smallest of margins.
Battlegrounds for about a generation
The point is that the people and politics of this country are constantly churning and moving. The makeup of the battlegrounds seems immutable in a single election, but battlegrounds have a shelf life, and it might only last about a generation.
I talked to David Schultz, a political science professor at Hamline University and author of the book, “Presidential Swing States,” which will be due for its fourth edition after the 2024 presidential election.
Swing, battleground and competitive are different things
Schultz told me that while we use terms like “swing state” and “battleground state” interchangeably, they’re actually different things.
A swing state is one that has actually flipped and recently supported presidents from different parties. Think of the “blue wall” states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. They swing from Democratic President Barack Obama in 2012 to Republican President Donald Trump in 2016 and then back to Democratic President Joe Biden in 2020.
Now they’re battleground states, or places where candidates show up and campaign.
They also fall into a third category of competitive states, where results are within 5 percentage points.
“In many cases, a swing state is really all three. It’s a battleground state. It’s been flipped. It’s competitive. But in some cases, there are states that have not flipped yet,” he argued.
More technically, according to Schultz, these states usually share some characteristics, including that they are relatively evenly split between Republicans and Democrats and that their “average or median voter is to the right of where the Democrats are nationally and to the left of where the Republican Party is nationally.”
Today’s battlegrounds
That’s about where the Rust Belt states collectively known as the blue wall are at the moment.
They had voted in a bloc for Democrats in every election from 1992 until Trump won them in 2016. They moved back toward Democrats in 2020 and represent Democrats’ best chance to retain the White House, according to many political strategists, even though the long-term demographic trends might not be so favorable for Democrats there. The parties are increasingly divided by education and race.
In Schultz’s view, if there’s one single bellwether state this year, it’s Pennsylvania.
Republicans are in a similar situation with Sun Belt states like Georgia and North Carolina, which have seen population growth among young people and people of color.
The country is constantly changing
Schultz argued that with deaths spurred by the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as internal migration and new voters being eligible to vote, some states have seen up to a 20% change in the makeup of their populations since just the last election.
That means the country’s population has changed quite a bit since some states last swung.
In the 1988 election, the last time the blue wall did not vote together, Pennsylvania and Michigan voted with the loser, Democrat Michael Dukakis. That election represented the end of an era in many ways. That was the last election in which California, the most populous state, voted for a Republican president, George H.W. Bush.
Texas, the second most populous state, on the other hand, hasn’t voted for a Democrat since Jimmy Carter won the White House in 1976, although results there were quite close in 1992 and 1996 when Clinton won the White House.
Schultz said the country has seemed to sort itself into red and blue and that something is shrinking the number of competitive states.
“If a state gets to be a reputation of being Republican or Democrat, we start to see patterns of immigration, of people sorting themselves out of where they want to live,” he told me.
Will Texas ever turn?
Democrats, for years, have been hoping that demographic shifts would again put Texas in play, something that could completely reshuffle the electoral map. Schultz doesn’t see that kind of shift in Texas for another four or eight years.
But he does think there are some states that could become new swing states in the years to come. He mentioned South Carolina and Montana, states that could shift as more young people move into them, changing their makeup.
If you look at all the competitive states in all the elections going back to 1976, most of the states have swung one way or the other or been competitive in the past 50 years.
Some states change all of a sudden
Sometimes, the swing bypasses the competitive category altogether.
West Virginia today is one of the most reliably Republican states – when it swung from Democrats to Republicans in the 2000 election, it swung hard. The result placed it outside the “competitive” category.
In other years, nearly the entire country swings, such as in 1984 – when the only state won by the Democratic candidate, Walter Mondale, was Minnesota, his home, which he took along with Washington, DC.",2024-10-29
CNN,Arizona fake electors led vocal campaign to overturn the 2020 election – they’re now part of a ‘robust’ state investigation | CNN Politics,"They called it “The Signing.” Eleven fake electors for President Donald Trump convened at the state Republican Party headquarters in Phoenix, Arizona, on December 14, 2020. They broadcast themselves preparing to sign the documents, allegedly provided by a Trump campaign attorney, claiming that they were the legitimate representatives of the state’s electoral votes.
By that time, Trump’s loss in the state – by less than 11,000 votes – had already been certified by the state’s Republican governor affirming that Joe Biden won Arizona in the 2020 presidential election.
But in the weeks that followed, five of Arizona’s 11 “Republican electors,” as they called themselves, pushed an unusually vocal campaign, compared to other fake electors from states across the country, for Vice President Mike Pence to reject the legitimate Democratic slate of electors.
Instead, they called on Pence to accept them or no electors at all, according to a CNN KFile review of their interviews, actions and comments on social media.
Much attention has been drawn to the fake elector schemes in Georgia and Michigan where local and state authorities charged some participants for election crimes this past summer. But in no other state were there fake electors more active in publicly promoting the scheme than in Arizona.
Now those fake electors find themselves under new legal scrutiny as the Arizona attorney general announced a broad investigation into their actions and their public campaign that could open the electors up to increased legal liability, according to experts who spoke with CNN.
“They were more brazen,” Anthony Michael Kreis, an expert on constitutional law at Georgia State University told CNN. “There is no difficulty trying to piece together their unlawful, corrupt intent because they publicly documented their stream of consciousness bread trail for prosecutors to follow.”
Attorney General Kris Mayes, in an interview with CNN, said she has been in contact with investigators in Michigan and Georgia and the Department of Justice.
“It’s robust. It’s a serious matter,” Mayes, a Democrat, said of her ongoing investigation. “We’re going to make sure that we do it on our timetable, applying the resources that it requires to make sure that justice is done, for not only Arizonans, but for the entire country.”
All 11 electors took part in multiple failed legal challenges, first asking a judge to invalidate the state’s results in a conspiracy theory-laden court case and then taking part in a last-ditch, desperate plea seeking to force Pence to help throw the election to Trump. The cases were dismissed.
Of the 11 fake electors in Arizona, five were the most publicly vocal members advocating the scheme in the state: Kelli Ward, the chairperson of the state party and her spouse, Michael Ward; state Rep. Anthony Kern, then a sitting lawmaker; Jake Hoffman, a newly elected member of the Arizona House; and Tyler Bowyer, a top state official with the Republican National Committee.
Each of these five publicly pushed for the legitimate electors to be discarded by Pence on January 6, 2021. One of the fake electors, Kern, took part in “Stop the Steal” rallies and was photographed in a restricted area on the Capitol steps during the riot at the Capitol.
“The Arizona false electors left a trail here that will surely interest prosecutors,” Ryan Goodman, a law professor at New York University who previously served as the special counsel to the general counsel at the Department of Defense, told CNN.
Electors, a part of the Electoral College system, represent the popular vote in each state. When a candidate wins a state, the party’s designated slate of electors gets to participate in the Electoral College process. The electors meet in a ceremonial process and sign certificates, officially casting their vote for president.
CNN reached out to all of the electors, but only received comment from two of them.
Five vocal fake electors
The most publicly vocal of the fake electors, Kelli Ward called the group the “true electors,” and provided play-by-play updates on the Arizona Republican Party’s YouTube. Falsely saying the state’s electoral votes were “contested,” even though legal challenges to the count had been dismissed, she urged supporters to call on Arizona’s state legislature to decertify the state’s results.
“We believe our votes are the ones that will count on January 6th,” she said in one interview on conservative talk radio, two days after signing the fake documents.
Ward’s comments were echoed in tweets by her husband, Michael, also an elector and a gadfly in Arizona politics known for spreading conspiracy theories. In a post sharing a White House memo that urged Pence to reject the results from states that submitted fake electors, Michael Ward hinted at retribution for Republicans who failed to act.
“My Holiday prayer is that every backstabbing ‘Republican’ gets paid back for their failure to act come Jan 20th!” he wrote in a tweet on December 22.
Another prominent elector was the RNC Committeeman Bowyer, who on his Twitter account pushed false election claims and conspiracies.
“It will be up to the President of the Senate and congress to decide,” Bowyer tweeted after signing the fake electors documents.
In repeated comments Bowyer declared the decision would come down to Pence.
“It’s pretty simple: The President of the United States Senate (VP) has the awesome power of acknowledging a specific envelope of electoral votes when there are two competing slates— or none at all,” wrote Bowyer in a December 28 tweet.
“We don’t live in a Democracy. The presidential election isn’t democratic,” he added when receiving pushback.
A spokesperson for Bowyer said that he was simply responding to a question from a user on what next steps looked like and maintained that there was precedent for a competing slate of electors.
Bowyer urged action in the lead up to the joint session of Congress on January 6.
“Be a modern Son of Liberty today,” he said late in the morning of January 6 – a post he deleted following the riot at the Capitol.
The spokesperson for Bowyer said he had not directly been contacted by Mayes’s office or the DOJ.
Newly elected state representative Hoffman sent a two-page letter to Pence on January 5, 2021, asking the vice president to order that Arizona’s electors not be decided by the popular vote of the citizens, but instead by the members of the state legislature.
“It is in this late hour, with urgency, that I respectfully ask that you delay the certification of election results for Arizona during the joint session of Congress on January 6, 2021, and seek clarification from the Arizona state legislature as to which slate of electors are proper and accurate,” wrote Hoffman.
In interviews, Hoffman repeatedly argued no electors be sent at all because “we don’t have certainty in the outcome of our election,” and to contest Democrat electors if they were sent.
Then-state Rep. Kern, who lost his seat in the 2020 election, spent his final weeks in office sharing “stop the steal” content and participating in their rallies. He said he was “honored” to be a Trump elector.
“On January 6th, vice President Mike Pence gets a choice on which electors he’s going to choose,” Kern told the Epoch Times in an interview in December.
“There is no president elect until January 6th,” he added.
Kern hadn’t changed his tune in an interview with CNN.
“Why, why would you think alternate electors are a lie?,” Kern said.
Kern repeatedly promoted the January 6, 2021, rally preceding the Capitol riot. Kern was in DC that day and shared a photo from the Capitol grounds as rioters gathered on the steps of the Capitol.
“In DC supporting @realDonaldTrump and @CNN @FoxNews @MSNBC are spewing lies again. #truth,” he wrote in a tweet.
Later Kern was seen in a restricted area of the Capitol steps during the riot. There is no indication he was violent, and he has not been charged with any crime.

CNN,"Appeals court upholds January 6 obstruction prosecution, in a ruling that could bolster case against Trump | CNN Politics","A federal appeals court has upheld the Justice Department’s ability to prosecute January 6, 2021, rioters with an obstruction charge, in a new opinion that is likely to bolster prosecutors’ criminal case against former President Donald Trump on the same charge.
The decision, issued Friday, means prosecutors can use the law that criminalizes obstructing an official proceeding as they seek to bring to justice rioters who disrupted the congressional certification of the 2020 presidential election.
The three-judge panel of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals split 2-1 in the decision.
Trump is scheduled to go to trial in his federal election subversion case in March. His attorneys are arguing to have the case against him dismissed.
The appeals court ruled in the case of Thomas Robertson, a former police sergeant from southern Virginia who was convicted for taking part in the US Capitol riot. Robertson had asked the courts to examine the use of the obstruction law in relation to the riot.
Robertson went into the Capitol after then-President Trump’s speech on the Ellipse, and he hit a police officer with a stick. Robertson was later found guilty of obstruction.
The mob violence at the Capitol complex prompted Congress to evacuate the House and Senate chambers, pausing their certification of Joe Biden’s Electoral College win – a development that is a key factor of the DOJ’s obstruction cases against rioters.
Robertson argued in court that he shouldn’t face the obstruction charge because he hadn’t been acting corruptly, as the law requires. He also argued the law was too vague and was unconstitutional.
But the Friday ruling solidifies that his conviction and others like it can stand. In Robertson’s case, the court found he had broken the law in multiple ways, making it clear he acted corruptly.
“Where a defendant acts feloniously to obstruct a proceeding before the Congress, with no evidence or argument that he was merely engaged in peaceful expression, his culpability – i.e., the ‘corruptness’ of his actions – is not difficult to discern,” Judge Florence Pan of the DC Circuit wrote in the opinion.
Judge Nina Pillard agreed with the decision, while Judge Karen Henderson dissented.
Trump is separately charged under the same obstruction law and has pleaded not guilty. Trump is not personally accused of violence, as many rioters like Robertson were, and instead is accused of exploiting the Capitol riot as to derail the presidential transfer of power.",2023-10-20
CNN,Analysis: Behind CNN’s investigation on deceptive political fundraising that costs elderly donors their retirement savings | CNN Politics,"A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.
A new CNN investigation documents how political campaigns have deceived the elderly and people with dementia with badgering, personalized text messages and prechecking boxes for recurring donations. The end result is that some people are misled, collectively losing millions of dollars. Unsuspecting family members are often caught completely by surprise.
Read the report, which illustrates the aggressive text messaging and charts how recurring donations can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars drained from retirement savings.
I talked by email to some of the CNN reporters involved in the project – Blake Ellis, Melanie Hicken, Yahya Abou-Ghazala, Audrey Ash, Anna-Maja Rappard and Kyung Lah – about this eye-opening reporting.
How did this reporting come about?
WOLF: What was the genesis for this report? What set you out on the trail of recurring donations?
ELLIS AND HICKEN: We were poking around in the FEC’s database of contributions to political candidates and noticed numerous donors giving small amounts of money to various political groups, over and over again. We then looked at a sampling of who these donors were and discovered they were in their 80s and 90s.
Given the sheer number of donations and groups involved, we wondered if these donors knew just how much they were giving, and how often. We started calling some of the top donors and found out that they didn’t understand the scope or frequency of their contributions.
We also noticed a common thread: Nearly all had given through the same fundraising platforms: WinRed for Republican candidates and ActBlue for Democrats. We knew that The New York Times had reported back in 2021 how WinRed had used prechecked boxes that signed donors up for recurring donations, and we wanted to dig deeper into the people who were impacted. So we brought other members of the investigative team on board and launched the project.
When did you know you had something?
WOLF: What was the moment in the reporting when you realized you were onto something bigger than you might have anticipated?
ELLIS AND HICKEN: The very first person we reached was a man in his 80s who donated more than $400,000 to (former President Donald) Trump and other Republicans, and he seemed confused about the amount he had given when we asked about it. He’s the person highlighted at the top of our story.
We got hold of his son, and he said his dad had dementia and had no idea he had given away such a huge amount of money – and that he had drained his retirement savings to make those donations. He was one of the biggest grassroots donors to the Republican Party, so after hanging up, we had a feeling we were onto something.
What kind of time investment does this require?
WOLF: Start to finish, how long did this process take? And how many people did you cold-call for their story?
ABOU-GHAZALA: The reporting process for this story took over three months from start to finish. The team spent a significant chunk of that time gathering and reviewing the stories of elderly donors from a variety of sources: public records, complaints filed with government agencies, lawsuits and cold-calling donors.
Our team’s data whiz, Casey Tolan, downloaded enormous campaign finance datasets and helped us identify the biggest and most frequent donors through WinRed and ActBlue, and then we all reached out to over 300 of the country’s top elderly grassroots donors and their family members and managed to collect dozens of stories highlighting the widespread nature of the issue.
Why do campaigns use these tactics?
WOLF: Why do you think this particular sort of fundraising is so effective at convincing people to donate?
RAPPARD: Experts we spoke to told us that elderly donors are the backbone of grassroots fundraising efforts. This demographic, often less tech-savvy, is particularly vulnerable to highly personalized appeals for money, particularly when they play on their emotions.
In interviews with donors and their families, we found many elderly individuals experience loneliness and isolation, making them susceptible to messages such as, “Thank you, patriot!” that provide a sense of purpose or connection to something bigger than themselves.
Relentless text messages like “900 x match!” or “Win the Golden Eagles Award,” combined with confusing visual elements such as prechecked boxes for recurring donations, can easily mislead older Americans, especially those with cognitive challenges. One 81-year-old man we interviewed believed he was really communicating with Donald Trump and Don Jr. over text messages.
Which story sticks with you?
WOLF: Was there a particular call or family member’s account that drove this story home for you?
ABOU-GHAZALA: It became clear to us early in the process of reaching out to families that we were likely to be the ones informing them for the first time about the total amount their loved ones had donated. The conversations were unfortunately very similar – the families were in utter disbelief, often asking us for time to look into what was happening and assess the extent of the financial damage.
LAH: It took time to convince family members to talk to us on camera. A woman named Karen was stunned when we told her how much her recently deceased mother had donated to former President Trump and other Republican campaigns.
More than a month later, we spoke with her at length, where we talked about grief, financial strain (she struggled to pay for her mother’s funeral) and elder abuse. Sitting with her in her mother’s home, her heartbreaking loss hung over every part of the interview.
This wasn’t just about the money. This was a loss of dignity and a lifetime of saving money to care for the next generation. Her mother had done everything right and was taken advantage of. And it was legal.
How big is this problem?
WOLF: If families of victims didn’t want to use their names in our report, it’s probable there are people who don’t want to come forward at all, either out of embarrassment or simply to put something painful behind them. Is it your sense that a lot of this goes unreported?
ABOU-GHAZALA: We spoke to several elderly donors who didn’t believe that they could have unwittingly donated such a large amount of money to political groups or expressed a sense of embarrassment that they were unaware of the problem.
In one instance, an elderly donor asked us not to inform their family members about the donations out of fear they would be upset. In cases where we reached family members, the children of elderly donors experiencing cognitive decline often told us that their parents would brush off the notion they had unwittingly donated tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.
It’s likely that much of this goes unreported due to a complete lack of awareness that it’s happening in the first place, or the difficulty in having these sorts of difficult conversations with elderly loved ones about what happened.
An expert we spoke with also noted that ardent political supporters would typically be reticent to complain about their own political party, suggesting there are many other possible victims out there.
Is this predatory?
WOLF: Is there evidence this is predatory or is it simply a function of recurring payments, like when people realize they’re paying for more Netflix than they need?
ASH: There is evidence it’s a mixture of both – experts told us that recurring donations have a valid place in fundraising because it allows campaigns to plan for the future, giving them a base amount of money they can expect each month.
But both ActBlue and WinRed have features that go beyond just recurring donations – including prechecked boxes that sign donors up for these regular donations and “upsells” that collect additional donations from users. WinRed hosts a blog for campaigns that outlines features such as doubling or even tripling a donation with just the click of a box and pop-ups that encourage a user to donate before leaving the site. There are also mechanisms for campaigns to create individual-specific donation pages based on certain donor characteristics.
The way these donation pages are written also indicates that campaigns are relying on an emotional response from the donor. For example, campaigns sometimes create fake polls meant to create a fear response from the donor. The claims of “9,000 times matching” or telling a donor that time for their “membership” is running out is all meant to encourage donations from unsuspecting users, and a lot of the donation pages hosted on WinRed are confusing for even the average user.
And it is clear that campaigns and fundraising platforms know that donors get caught up in the system – both WinRed and ActBlue are currently being investigated by several state attorneys general, and WinRed even has a disclaimer on its website that if a campaign is suspected of abusing a certain type of “upsell,” like a recurring donation, the campaign will be blocked from using it in the future.
Is there a solution?
WOLF: Does there seem to be any movement to address this problem?
LAH: There has been previous legislation introduced to curb the use of prechecked boxes in campaign finance. Democratic Sens. Amy Klobuchar and Dick Durbin introduced legislation in 2021 following a recommendation from the Federal Election Commission that Congress ban the use of prechecked recurring donations, but that bill died in committee before ever reaching a vote.
Other groups that use similarly deceptive tactics have been investigated by the federal government, but political speech seems to fall into more of a gray area, so it’s up to Congress to take the next steps to regulate it. Critics say that the only people who can take action are the same people who are currently using the platform to raise money for their campaigns – even state attorneys general, who investigate consumer complaints, will use the platforms while campaigning.
Why are there more complaints against Republicans?
WOLF: Both Democratic and Republican campaigns currently precheck boxes for recurring donations online. What explains the fact that there are more complaints against Republicans?
ABOU-GHAZALA: From our review of political advertisements and solicitations from campaigns on both sides of the aisle, we found that the messaging coming from Republicans tends to be more aggressive and misleading. Still, some Democratic groups and campaigns also employ similar tactics.
Oftentimes, the language in the text message or email will feel very personal to the donor, as though the campaign or politician is interacting with them on an individual level.
For example, one of the Trump campaign’s ads appeared like a friend request with big, bold red text at the top of the WinRed page, telling donors they had “[1] NEW FRIEND REQUEST FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP.”
Other ads seemed to appeal to a sense of guilt or shame for the donor. An email from the Marjorie Taylor Greene campaign landed in inboxes with a subject line that asked the donor: “Have you abandoned me?”
The experts we spoke to explained how these kinds of tactics can suck elderly donors into their web, providing a feeling of belonging. It became clear to us throughout our reporting process the kind of effect these tactics were having on elderly donors.
Many families we spoke to reiterated the same point: Their elderly loved ones were often under the false impression that they were in personal communication with these campaigns or politicians.",2024-10-22

CNN,Analysis: Biden may have handed Trump a big assist with his ‘garbage’ gaffe | CNN Politics,"Joe Biden had largely been an afterthought one week before the election in which he’d once hoped to win a second term.
Not anymore.
The president inadvertently injected himself into the homestretch of the campaign and may have handed a big assist to his erstwhile rival, ex-President Donald Trump, who is struggling to quell a furor over his bigotry-filled rally at Madison Square Garden earlier this week.
Biden mentioned Puerto Rico, slandered as a “floating island of garbage” by a comedian at Trump’s event on Sunday night. But his clumsy defense of the self-governing American territory — and the vital swing voters in its diaspora on the US mainland — sparked a new political firestorm and distracted from Vice Kamala President Harris’ big closing argument speech against a White House backdrop on Tuesday night.
“And just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico ‘a floating island of garbage.’ Well, let me tell you something … I don’t know the Puerto Rican that I know… or Puerto Rico where I’m – in my home state of Delaware – they’re good, decent, honorable people,” Biden said during virtual remarks in a Voto Latino get-out-the-vote call meant to help Harris.
“The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters,” Biden said, pausing for a moment before continuing. “His, his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable and it’s un-American.”
The White House quickly tried to clean up the president’s remarks, with spokesman Andrew Bates saying he’d been referring to the “hateful rhetoric” at the rally in New York, not the former president’s backers. He said that Biden had actually said this: “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter’s – his – his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American.”
And in a further sign that the White House recognizes the potential political fallout of the episode, Biden himself took to social media to address it.
“Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage—which is the only word I can think of to describe it. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation,” Biden wrote on X.
But the damage may already have been done.
Biden’s comment drew immediate comparisons with then-Democratic nominee Hillary’s Clinton’s remark in 2016 that half of Trump’s supporters should be “put into the basket of deplorables” because of their “racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic” views. Her remarks became a rallying call for Trump and conservative media and remain a badge of honor for Trump fans who view East Coast Democratic elites as condescending and disdainful of their way of life.
And Trump’s campaign seized on Biden’s remarks to try to create the same kind of dynamic, claiming that the ex-president is supported by “Latinos, Black voters, union workers, angel moms, law enforcement officers, border patrol agents, and Americans of all faiths,” while his opponents “have labeled these great Americans as fascists, Nazis, and now, garbage.” The Trump campaign’s national press secretary Karoline Leavitt added: “There’s no way to spin it: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris don’t just hate President Trump, they despise the tens of millions of Americans who support him.”
Harris now has a new political problem
No one can say how this latest twist in a turbulent campaign will affect the final result. But in the vicious heat of the last week of the deadlocked presidential campaign, when even a few imprecise words can wreak significant political consequences, it may not matter what Biden really meant. Perception is everything.
Just when Harris’ team wanted to keep the attention on Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally, which played into her contrast message on Tuesday night, the president handed Harris a political mess. She’s now almost certain to be asked whether she also regards Trump’s backers as “garbage.” Her answer will only prolong the story. The former president is also likely to seize on the gaffe to argue that Democrats view working Americans in the heartland with contempt.
A Trump fundraising email Tuesday evening read: “FIRST Hillary called you a DEPLORABLE! THEN they called you a FASCIST! And moments ago Kamala’s boss Biden called you GARBAGE!”
His campaign has already been trying to twist fallout from claims that Trump pined for the kind of generals that served Adolf Hitler into an argument that Harris believes all of his supporters are Nazis.
Biden’s “garbage” remark may also offer Trump an opening to finally spin his way out of the backlash about Puerto Rico caused by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe at the New York rally. “Probably he shouldn’t have been there,” Trump said of the comedian in an interview with Fox News’ Sean Hannity that aired Tuesday evening. His earlier comments that the event was “an absolute love-fest” had done nothing to defuse the controversy.
More broadly, a Biden comment that will be portrayed by pro-Trump media as contempt for the ex-president’s supporters came at exactly the moment that Harris is trying to come across as a unifying figure to win over Republicans who are disaffected with Trump’s extremism but are not yet ready to take the leap to vote for a Democrat.
“Here is my pledge to you,” Harris said on Tuesday night, at a rally on the Ellipse in Washington, the spot where Trump told his supporters to “fight like hell” before the invasion of the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. “I pledge to seek common ground and commonsense solutions to make your life better.”
The vice president went on: “To people who disagree with me, unlike Donald Trump, I don’t believe people who disagree with me are the enemy. He wants to put them in jail. I’ll give them a seat at the table.”
Clinton and Obama warned against demeaning Trump supporters
Whatever Biden meant, his remarks fly in the face of admonishments to Democrats from two other presidents, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, who pleaded with activists during the Democratic National Convention to take the political fight to Trump but not to disrespect his voters.
“Meet people where they are. I urge you not to demean them … treat them with respect, just the way you’d like them to treat you,” Clinton said, urging delegates to make the case for the vice president with their neighbors carefully.
Obama addressed the risk that name calling could cause available voters to conclude that all politicians are the same. “A sense of mutual respect has to be part of our message. Our politics has become so polarized these days that all of us, across the political spectrum, seem so quick to assume the worst in others unless they agree with us on every single issue,” he said. “We start thinking that the only way to win is to scold and shame and out yell the other side. And after a while, regular folks just tune out, or don’t bother to vote at all.”
Democrats are likely to regard a flap over a few ill-chosen words by the president, whether they were intended or not, as a triviality at a time when Harris is warning that the country could next week elect a man she blasted on Tuesday as a “a petty tyrant.”
And verbal missteps by Biden and other Democrats pale by comparison to the often vulgar rhetoric and unhinged commentary of the Republican nominee, who recently made a crude comment about the anatomy of late pro-golf legend Arnold Palmer at the start of a rally. And while Biden’s notoriously loose tongue got him into trouble, the significance of his remarks isn’t as serious as a false claim by Trump in Pennsylvania on Tuesday night that Democrats are already cheating in the county of Lancaster, in what appeared to be his latest attempt to sow doubt on the fairness of the election in advance.
But the fallout of Hillary Clinton’s “deplorables” comment in 2016 showed that imprecision and implied contempt can haunt candidates and their surrogates in the endgame of elections. In a neck-and-neck race that may be decided by mere thousands of votes in swing states, neither Harris nor Trump can afford mistakes. And the history of presidential elections is littered with incidents that appear insignificant at the time but can take on wider implications. Hinchcliffe’s slamming of Puerto Rico is a classic example since it has left Trump scrambling to placate Puerto Rican voters in Lehigh County, an important area in Pennsylvania where he had hoped to eat into the Democratic vote.
Biden’s diminished campaign role
Tuesday’s controversy will also likely renew speculation about Biden’s future role in the campaign. He was, after all, forced to shelve his reelection bid following a disastrous debate performance on CNN in June that exposed his advanced age and sparked questions about his cognition. While he has appeared several times with Harris, he’s been used sparingly by her campaign in recent weeks. And as CNN reported on Tuesday, his gaffes have caused responses – from eyerolls to outright anger – from some Harris campaign aides.
Last week, the president referred to Trump in New Hampshire and said, “We got to lock him up,” before quickly adding, “Politically lock him up. Lock him out. That’s what we have to do.” The comment went viral on conservative talk radio and social media, as Republicans claimed it proved Trump’s claims that Biden had weaponized the Justice Department against the GOP nominee. In Arizona on Friday, Biden referred to former Rep. Gabby Giffords, who survived being shot in the head at a 2011 campaign event, in the past tense, suggesting she was no longer alive.
While aides have previously brushed off such slips as “vintage Biden,” noting his history of gaffes and the president’s proclivity to misspeak, they also acknowledge there’s no room for error.
“We’re in ‘Do No Harm’ mode,” one official involved in discussions of Biden’s role, said, according to reporting by CNN’s Kayla Tausche, MJ Lee and Kevin Liptak.
That approach may have come off the rails on Tuesday night.",2024-10-30
CNN,There’s no such thing as a guaranteed Supreme Court vacancy | CNN Politics,"Supreme Court justices do not go easily.
With the presidential election nearing a climax, speculation has grown over new appointments to the country’s highest court. But imminent vacancies are far from guaranteed.
The power to decide the nation’s law is difficult to relinquish.
“The great ones get their backs up,” observed Georgetown Law professor Brad Snyder, author of a Felix Frankfurter biography and a scholar of the 20th century court, referring to retirement pressure. “They say ‘No one can do this job as well as I can.’”
The historical pattern endures. Of the last dozen vacancies, dating to 1990, more than half were caused by a death or illness. Two of the last four justices to leave the bench died while serving – Antonin Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg – and most of the last dozen were at least age 80.
“I’m getting old and coming apart,” Justice Thurgood Marshall told reporters when he announced in June 1991 that he would be retiring. He was about to turn 83.
For that liberal civil rights trailblazer, the first Black justice, the vicissitudes of personal health overcame any reluctance to leave while Republican George H.W. Bush was in office and could name his successor. Bush chose Clarence Thomas, an ardent conservative whose approach to the Constitution and civil rights remedies has been the opposite of Marshall’s.
Now age 76, Thomas is the oldest of the current nine justices, followed by Samuel Alito, 74, and Sonia Sotomayor, 70. Chief Justice John Roberts will turn 70 in January.
While the three have passed the average retirement age, they are still in their prime at the Supreme Court, an institution that reveres seniority.
Thomas and Alito are part of a dominant right-wing bloc overhauling the law in America, including the reversal of abortion rights. That bloc has also ended racial affirmative action in college admissions and diminished the authority of federal regulators to set workplace, consumer and environmental policy. It has also changed the court’s direction on multiple culture war issues involving religion.
In short, Thomas and Alito hold formidable positions on the coalition that is reshaping the legal landscape.
Sotomayor, a liberal, falls on the losing side, to be sure, but she is in a position of seniority giving her the authority to assign a dissenting opinion and take the lead for the left wing.
Even with the frustrations that come from internal dissent or growing public criticism, justices are loath to surrender the role.
“They are trying to keep power, and they are trying to stay relevant,” Snyder said. “They are also trying to stay alive. These are people who live to work. You take away their job and they are no longer living to work.”
Not all presidents get vacancies
Yet new presidents eagerly anticipate openings so that they can make their mark with a life-tenured appointments. President Joe Biden, who named the first Black woman to the bench in 2022 (Ketanji Brown Jackson), predicted in June, “The next president is likely to have two new Supreme Court nominees.”
But such talk is just that. Talk.
Despite election-season predictions to the contrary, President George W. Bush saw no vacancies in his first four-year term, and Barack Obama had none during his second, even after a subtle overture to Ginsburg during a 2013 lunch at the White House. Jimmy Carter, who served only a single term, never had the opportunity to appoint a Supreme Court justice.
Trump filled a vacancies, however, in his single term, two of those arising from deaths of conservative and liberal icons: Scalia, who died unexpectedly in 2016 while at a Texas hunting ranch, and Ginsburg, who died in 2020 of pancreatic cancer.
Chief Justice William Rehnquist similarly died while in office, after nearly a year fighting thyroid cancer and resisting retirement. After his September 2005 death, he was succeeded by the like-minded Roberts.
Ginsburg’s forestalling of retirement produced more significant consequences. When she died at age 87, Trump replaced her with Amy Coney Barrett (four decades younger) and secured a conservative supermajority.
The Ginsburg situation subsequently accelerated liberal pressure on her fellow octogenarian Stephen Breyer to retire while Democrat Biden occupied the White House.
Breyer, then 83, was still enjoying the job when he announced he would retire in 2022. He understood the reality of life in his 80s. As his predecessor, Justice Harry Blackmun, had remarked when he retired in 1994 at age 85: “It’s not easy to step aside, but I know what the numbers are, and it’s time.”
Shortly before Breyer retired, he told CNN in an interview that his primary consideration would be the state of his health. Breyer has since explained justices’ interest in longevity by emphasizing the judicial long game, that cases build on cases, and that justices become more confident with the years.
“You learn that the applause dies away very fast when you’re there,” he has said. “After two or three years, I was at some kind of meeting when a young student came up to me and said, ‘Oh, judge, I love your opinions. Would you sign my program?’ I said sure. I signed it. Then he turned to his friend and held up four fingers and said, ‘That makes four!’”
Why justices quit
Justices have made it clear over the years that they favor likeminded successors – even former law clerks, as has been a pattern in recent years. (Breyer, for example, was succeeded by Jackson, his former clerk; four years earlier, retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy was succeeded by Brett Kavanaugh, who had clerked for him.)
So the politics of who holds the White House matters.
With today’s bench, that means that if Republican Trump were to win, Alito and Thomas would be more inclined to consider leaving; if Democrat Kamala Harris wins, Sotomayor. Friends of the three say those justices have, at times, mused about election forecasts and individual retirements but suggested a tenor reflecting casual thoughts rather a concrete plan.
The more obvious determinant is individual health.
Current justices resist sharing health information or explaining sudden absences from oral arguments or other public events.
The current nine appear healthy, but it is difficult for any outsider to really know their personal situations. In 2022, Thomas was hospitalized for a week with what court officials described as an infection. In 2020, Roberts was hospitalized for a head injury after a fall at a Maryland country club; a court official said that the fall, which became known only after The Washington Post received a tip, was unrelated to epileptic seizures Roberts had previously suffered, the first reportedly in 1993.
Sotomayor, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age 8, has spoken at times, particularly to audiences of children, about managing the condition; in 2018, paramedics were called to her home for what a court official said were “symptoms of low blood sugar.”
Justice John Paul Stevens, a 1975 appointee who for years was the subject of retirement rumors, held out until 2010. After stumbling over the words of a dissenting opinion (in the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission case) he was reading from the bench in January that year, he knew his time had come.
Stevens later disclosed in his memoir that he learned he “had suffered a mini stroke.” The justice then told Obama he would leave at the end of the annual session, in June.
Stevens was age 90 when he retired. Twenty years earlier, in 1990, Justice William Brennan made a more abrupt retirement announcement after he had a small stroke while vacationing. He was 84 when he notified President George H.W. Bush he would immediately retire.
Justice Sandra Day O’Connor was only 75 in July 2005 when she announced her plans to leave the bench. But she said her husband was suffering from Alzheimer’s disease and she wanted to spend more time with him.
Justice David Souter is a modern exception.
He retired in 2009 at the relatively youthful age of 69. The erudite New Hampshire bachelor had never quite adapted to the ways of Washington.
His brief resignation letter offered no reason for his departure. And for the next decade, Souter occasionally heard US appellate court cases. He declined to respond to CNN’s recent queries regarding his thoughts on why most justices hold on to the job longer.
Perhaps revealing of Souter’s mindset, a few weeks after he informed Obama, Souter told an audience at a legal conference, “For most of us, the very best work that we do sinks into the stream very quickly. We have to find satisfaction in being part of the great stream.”",2024-10-30

CNN,House Oversight Committee launches investigation into Coast Guard after CNN report | CNN Politics,"The House Oversight Committee has launched an investigation into the US Coast Guard’s “mishandling of serious misconduct” — including sexual assault, racism and hazing — after CNN exposed that its leaders concealed reports documenting those problems from its workforce, the public and Congress.
The inquiry is the latest in a string of government probes announced in the wake of CNN’s reporting, which revealed the existence of a yearslong investigation that found rapes and other sexual abuse at the Coast Guard Academy had been ignored and, at times, covered up by high-ranking officials. Dubbed “Operation Fouled Anchor,” the internal probe was kept confidential by Coast Guard leaders for years until CNN started making inquiries into the report earlier this year.
Last week, CNN exposed that Coast Guard leaders suppressed yet another report, this time a “Culture of Respect” review from April 2015, that documented racial and gender discrimination and assault across the service.
In a letter sent Friday to the Coast Guard’s leader, Commandant Linda Fagan, House lawmakers lambasted the agency, saying that the Coast Guard “may have obstructed the ability of Congress to carry out constitutionally mandated oversight authority and legislation to address these issues,” “prevented actionable change within the agency” and “likely put more people at risk.”
“[The Coast Guard] only notified Congress about Operation Fouled Anchor and its April 2015 Report when existence of these reports was going to be in the press,” wrote committee Chairman Rep. James Comer and Rep. Glenn Grothman, chairman of the Subcommittee on National Security, the Border, and Foreign Affairs. “The Committee has serious concerns that congressional committees would not have been notified of these reports, and the serious allegations contained within them, if it had not been for the threat of public reporting.”
The announcement comes on the heels of the Coast Guard’s own acknowledgment of past failures in a rare and highly critical internal report issued this week that also orders a series of changes to how the agency handles sexual assault. A number of congressional lawmakers and assault survivors were not satisfied, however, saying the agency still needs to hold past perpetrators and the leaders who covered up their dangerous and criminal behavior accountable – rather than only looking to the future.
The committee requested a litany of documents and information “to assist the Committee in investigating these reports, the withholding of information from Congress, and the inaction of senior leadership to combat misconduct,” including a list of Coast Guard officials involved in the handling of sexual misconduct cases from the time of Fouled Anchor to present.
CNN’s reporting showed that, over the years, alleged perpetrators weren’t being held accountable for misconduct. Many of the problems documented in the Coast Guard’s reports continue to plague the agency, according to interviews with current and former service members.
Meanwhile, a probe by the Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General remains ongoing, as does a Senate inquiry – with a hearing scheduled next week where multiple whistleblowers and survivors of sexual assault and harassment will testify.

After spending 90 days speaking with hundreds of service members, reading through more than 170 written comments and “sifting through a mountain of data,” an internal review team said it had heard a resounding message from the workforce that “these failures and lack of accountability are entirely unacceptable” and that leaders “must do something about it.”
“Too many Coast Guard members are not experiencing the safe, empowering workplace they expect and deserve (and) trust in Coast Guard leadership is eroding,” the authors wrote in the roughly 100-page report, noting that they had heard from victims of sexual assault and harassment stretching from the 1960s to the current day who “expressed deep rooted feelings of pain and a loss of trust in the organization.”
The scathing internal review was launched after CNN exposed a secret criminal investigation, dubbed Operation Fouled Anchor, which found that serious misconduct had been ignored and, at times, covered up by high-ranking officials. It wasn’t until CNN started asking questions about Fouled Anchor this spring that Coast Guard leaders rushed to officially brief Congress on the scandal — leading to outrage on both sides of the aisle, multiple government investigations and proposed legislation.
CNN’s coverage of Fouled Anchor and subsequent reporting revealing that Coast Guard leaders declined to prosecute a retired officer for sexual misconduct “have led people to experience feelings ranging from disappointment to outrage,” the report said.
“For so many victims, there are even deeper levels of broken trust: in leaders who failed them in preventing and responding to sexual violence; in a military justice system with antiquated legal definitions of rape; in non-existent support programs for those impacted prior to 2000,” it stated. While the report outlined a number of changes made in the last two decades, it also acknowledged that reforms to date have not been enough to prevent assaults and properly support victims.
The review did not seek to hold past perpetrators or officials involved with the Fouled Anchor cover-up accountable, saying multiple government investigations launched by Congress remained ongoing.
Instead, it looked to the future and focused on preventing future assaults and other misconduct, describing the report as a “road map aimed at improving” the agency’s culture.
Along with the report’s findings, the Coast Guard announced a series of actions directed by the agency’s leader, Commandant Linda Fagan, through recommended changes to everything from training and victim support services to strengthening processes for holding perpetrators accountable.
“This report acknowledges the Coast Guard’s failures and uses them to inform a way ahead, rebuild trust, and set the baseline for organizational growth,” the document states, noting that many of the actions require additional funding and authority to implement.
Among the reforms are the creation of a mentorship program for victims to help them navigate the aftermath of a sexual assault, the development of a “safe to report” policy so that victims are not penalized for collateral minor misconduct (such as alcohol use at the time of an incident), more secure locks on Coast Guard Academy bedrooms and improved oversight of the school and its cadets – including a new chain of command for the academy head.
Fagan also directed officials to better keep tabs on the academy’s hallmark “Swab Summer” training program, which is run by upperclassmen at the academy, and to consider strengthening policies that allow the agency to reduce pension payments for those found to have committed misconduct.
The report was the Coast Guard’s most expansive response to the growing criticism of its handling of misconduct. And while it was being released publicly, and members of Congress had been briefed on its contents earlier, the report was specifically addressed to “U.S. Coast Guard workforce, past and present.”
“You made it clear that you want and expect our Service to confront this issue and make it better. You want our Service to deliver meaningful change,” the report stated. “Whether you’re a member who has a story to share — or the shipmate standing beside them — this is our time. Let’s get it right.”
While the Coast Guard is focused on the future, members of Congress are still determined to get answers about past failures as well.
“This new report still does not hold anyone accountable for past failures—particularly those at the Coast Guard Academy,” said Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut, where the Coast Guard Academy is located. Murphy and other lawmakers have continued to slam the agency for its failure to be transparent about sexual assault and other misconduct. “It does lay out a modest plan to improve oversight, training, and support for survivors, but a report is nothing more than paper until concrete steps are taken.”
Democratic Senators Maria Cantwell and Richard Blumenthal also criticized how, despite calling this effort an “accountability” review, the Coast Guard still failed to hold anyone to task for the mishandling of sexual assault cases. Cantwell reiterated the importance of an independent investigation, saying she is looking forward to seeing the results of the probe currently being conducted by the Department of Homeland Security’s Inspector General.
Earlier this year, CNN reported how former Commandant Karl Schultz and his second-in-command, Vice Commandant Charles Ray, failed to act on plans to share the findings of Fouled Anchor with Congress and the public. Ray resigned from his position at a Coast Guard Academy leadership institute soon after, but no other current or former Coast Guard officials have publicly faced any consequences.
“Current Coast Guard personnel are being told to trust their leadership, but their leaders aren’t holding predecessors accountable,” K. Denise Rucker Krepp, a former Coast Guard officer and former chief counsel of the Maritime Administration wrote in a recent letter to Congress, describing how she had attended a “community healing” event sponsored by the Coast Guard Academy Alumni Association last month.
“Before my first cup of coffee I learned about a woman who was raped shortly after joining the service. She never told her parents about the crime,” she wrote. “While washing my hands in the bathroom, another woman shared that she was raped while attending the Coast Guard Academy in the late 1990s. Another woman shared that she was gang-raped by three students at the school and had spent two-thirds of her life on medication because of the crimes that occurred almost 40 years ago.”
Next week, more survivors of sexual assault and harassment at the Coast Guard Academy are slated to share their experiences publicly in a Congressional hearing. The hearing, announced just yesterday, is part of an ongoing Senate probe launched in reaction to the Fouled Anchor cover-up.

CNN,Analysis: One of the most important jobs in American politics has turned into a nightmare | CNN Politics,"Winning a majority party’s nomination for speaker of the House of Representatives usually elevates a lawmaker into the pantheon of American political leaders.
But such is the toxicity of the GOP three weeks after the ouster of Speaker Kevin McCarthy that the nominee expected to emerge on Tuesday may never get the top job.
The nomination is an assignment to what may be an impossible political mission to unite a conference that might never be reconciled. And even if the nominee wins the gavel, the next speaker has a reasonable chance of a tenure even shorter than McCarthy, who lasted nine months.
But this is about more than the plight of a Republican Party that often looks like it’s tearing itself apart. If the dysfunctional House GOP majority cannot get its act together, the US government could run out of funding before Thanksgiving week – and millions of Americans could pay the price.
As lawmakers returned to Washington on Monday, there was a growing sense of rising public frustration about a House that has been paralyzed for three weeks, as global crises boil and the shutdown deadline approaches.
Florida Rep. Vern Buchanan said his constituents “think all of us are incapable.” Buchanan, who is supporting fellow Sunshine State lawmaker Byron Donalds for speaker, added: “People are very angry and upset.”
The hopefuls lined up on Tuesday at the start of rounds of secret balloting that will produce a party nominee for speaker following the failures of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan to replace McCarthy. But there is no guarantee the candidate who emerges from secret balloting will be able to get the required majority in the full House – given the extreme splits in the GOP between some of the far-right hardliners who helped eject McCarthy and more moderate lawmakers in battleground districts.
Because of their tiny majority, almost every Republican must back the nominee for him to become speaker – a longshot in a conference that is deeply divided. Ex-President Donald Trump has been fielding calls from top candidates seeking his endorsement but joked on Monday that only divine intervention could end the crisis.
“I said there’s only one person who can do it all the way,” Trump said in New Hampshire. “You know who that is? Jesus Christ. If Jesus came down and said, ‘I want to be speaker,’ he would do it.”
A new GOP speaker could find it impossible to unite the party
The fact there were so many candidates on Tuesday tells its own tale – namely that no one is strong enough to clear the field and whoever emerges may not have a strong base of support.
There are signs House Majority Whip Tom Emmer has been making progress, but as a member of a House leadership team distrusted by the right-wing House Freedom Caucus, his candidacy may suffer the same liabilities as those of Scalise and McCarthy. Another possible nominee is Donalds of Florida, a member of the House Freedom Caucus and one of the few Black Republicans in Congress. But Donalds may be too radical for moderate Republicans in districts that voted for President Joe Biden. There’s been palpable anger among such members – on whom the majority rests – that the lawmakers who voted out McCarthy have escaped punishment. A speaker from the far-right may be too much for them to accept.
But the identity of the new Republican speaker – when he eventually emerges (there’s not one woman among the current candidates) – may be less important than the dire situation he will confront. The House GOP has now spent three weeks failing to select a new leader – time that would have been better spent staking out a position on a new government funding deal needed to prevent the government from closing down in mid-November. Even if a new speaker is selected by the end of this week, there’s barely three weeks before the Thanksgiving break to get a deal with a Democratic-run Senate and the White House to avoid yet another governing debacle on the GOP majority’s watch.
The funding showdown will represent one of the most difficult tests ever for a new speaker. The likelihood that this leader will be a compromised figure at risk of losing his job at any moment at the head of a rebellious conference makes the position even more vulnerable.
As former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, himself a notoriously polarizing figure, said on Fox News this weekend: “They got big decisions coming down the road. There’s a very real danger that they’ll elect somebody and three of four or five weeks from now, you’re going to have a group of people blow up and decide to go back into the same mess.”
The risk of such a scenario is raised by the fact that any new speaker will face the same kind of impossible choices that confronted McCarthy when he narrowly averted a government shutdown last month. Knowing that he couldn’t satisfy extreme demands for spending cuts from hardliners with a Democratic Senate and the White House, McCarthy was forced to use some Democratic votes to pass a stopgap funding bill. And it cost him his job.
The growing pressure to fill the speaker’s chair might be a motivating factor for the GOP to finally end the stalemate. But the risk is that a compromise candidate will not have spent the years building a powerbase – inside the Capitol and on the critical fundraising circuit – and may therefore not be an effective leader of a fractious conference.
The fact that party leaders can only lose four votes and still pass a bill on party lines has highlighted the huge splits inside the conference and underscored that there is no reliable Republican majority for any legislation in the House right now.
Rep. Brett Guthrie of Kentucky, for instance, said the leadership crisis “shows that we’re not functioning as a majority. And when you lose that, you lose the ability to govern.”
How Americans could pay the price for the House’s dysfunction
The 2024 elections are still more than a year away, but the spectacle of a House brought low by its own divisions augurs poorly for the GOP. The party cannot enact its agenda, has no chance of showing voters it can be an effective majority, and cannot even use its power to jam Democrats into taking tough political votes that may come back to haunt them – as a majority party might generally do at this point in the political cycle.
But House Republicans are not just harming themselves. If the leadership limbo goes on much longer, the damage could spread countrywide and go global.
A government shutdown could harm countless Americans – including members of the armed services that could go without pay. And the paralysis in the House means that lawmakers cannot vote on sending emergency aid to Israel amid its war with Hamas. Biden’s request for a new $60 billion aid package for Ukraine is also not going anywhere. Domestically, vital appropriations bills on everything from farming to energy and foreign operations are stalled.
“I think House Republicans know that this is very detrimental to the country. Look at what is going on … over in Israel, what’s happening in Ukraine, and all the other things we know are happening in the world, including in our own country,” Rep. Larry Bucshon told CNN’s Brianna Keilar on Monday. The Indiana Republican also warned the party was hurting itself ahead of the critical funding showdown.
“I think it does put us at a disadvantage. We don’t have someone who is the speaker of the House to negotiate with the White House, with Senate Democrats who are in the majority. … It does put us at a political disadvantage.”
“Also practically for the country, it’s not a good thing.”",2023-10-24

CNN,Trump says it was ‘my honor to be involved’ in controversial Madison Square Garden rally | CNN Politics,"Donald Trump on Tuesday defended his controversial Madison Square Garden rally, telling supporters that the event was “an absolute lovefest” and that it was “my honor to be involved.”
The former president’s comments come amid backlash over disparaging and divisive remarks at his Sunday event in New York City, which included a comedian describing Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage.” Allies expressed worry the remarks could have political repercussions, especially given Puerto Ricans’ growing influence in battleground states, with about half a million residing in Pennsylvania alone. But Trump at his Mar-a-Lago rally did not directly address the criticism of that remark.
“I don’t think anybody has ever seen anything like what happened the other night at Madison Square Garden,” Trump told a crowd of supporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida as he addressed criticism of his rally for the first time. “The love in that room – it was breathtaking. And you could have filled it many, many times with people that were unable to get in.”
He claimed that veteran politicians told him there had “never been an event so beautiful.”
“It was like a lovefest, an absolute lovefest, and it was my honor to be involved,” he said.
CNN reported Monday that several of Trump’s allies expressed dismay at the language used by speakers at the event, particularly the Puerto Rico remark, which set the tone for an evening of disparaging and divisive comments. The violent and vulgar rhetoric at the rally has prompted finger-pointing within the former president’s inner circle and deep concern that his message was once again eclipsed by controversy.
In an interview that aired Tuesday night, Trump said that the comedian behind the offensive comments about Puerto Rico, Tony Hinchcliffe, probably shouldn’t have attended his Madison Square Garden rally.
“Yeah. I mean, I don’t know if it’s a big deal or not, but I don’t want anybody making nasty jokes or stupid jokes. Probably he shouldn’t have been there,” Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity.
Earlier in the day, Trump tried to cast himself as an ally of the island, saying at a roundtable in Pennsylvania, “No president’s done more for Puerto Rico than I have.”
He was responding to a woman who said she moved from Puerto Rico and told Trump, “I want you to know that Puerto Rico stands behind you, and Puerto Rico loves you.”
Trump said: “Well, we love it. I know it very well and we helped you through a lot of bad storms.”
In 2017, after Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico and caused a humanitarian crisis, Trump was criticized by both Democrats and Republicans for being slow to respond to the crisis. The Trump administration ultimately deployed a Navy hospital ship to the island.
Puerto Rico Shadow Senator Zoraida Buxo spoke at Trump’s rally Tuesday night in Allentown, Pennsylvania.
Speaking at Mar-a-Lago, Trump mocked Democrats for drawing parallels between his rally and a Nazi rally held at Madison Square Garden in 1939. Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, said before the rally that Trump’s campaign knows “exactly what they’re doing there.”
“They started to say, ‘Well, in 1939, the Nazis used Madison Square Garden,’” Trump said. “How terrible to say, right? Because you know, they’ve used Madison Square Garden many times. Many people have used it. But nobody’s ever had a crowd like that. And I tell you what, right now, nobody’s ever had love like that. That was love in the room, and it was love for our country.”
The comments about Puerto Rico by Hinchcliffe, a comedian and podcast host, were swiftly condemned by Harris’ campaign, which used them in an advertisement portraying Trump as having “abandoned” the US territory in the wake of Hurricane Maria in 2017. Trump’s own campaign distanced the former president from the remark in a statement Sunday evening.
“These are fellow citizens he’s talking about,” former President Barack Obama said at a rally for Harris on Monday. “Here in Philadelphia, they are your neighbors. They are your friends, they are your co-workers. Their kids go to school with your kids. These are Americans.”
Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny signaled support for Harris moments after Hinchcliffe’s remarks, sharing a clip on social media of the vice president’s plans for the island.
Republicans have sought to brush off the backlash. Trump said Tuesday that he didn’t hear Hinchcliffe’s comments and that he didn’t know who the comedian was, despite the fact that Hinchcliffe kicked off the high-profile campaign rally.
“I don’t know him; someone put him up there. I don’t know who he is,” Trump told ABC News.
Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, on Monday described criticism of the joke about Puerto Rico as a “fake outrage cycle.”
“A comedian told a joke, and I don’t think that’s news worth making. I think what is news is that Americans can’t afford their groceries because Kamala Harris has been a terrible vice president,” Vance said at an event in Racine, Wisconsin.
Trump’s comments Tuesday downplaying the controversy over his Madison Square Garden rally came at a campaign event in which he criticized Harris and President Joe Biden for their administration’s handling of the economy and border security.
“We’re going to fight like hell for the next seven days,” Trump said, as the crowd chanted “fight,” the word he’d shouted moments after surviving an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania in July.

CNN,Analysis: What happens if there’s a tie in 2024? Be ready for a ‘contingent election’ | CNN Politics,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.
When Robert F. Kennedy Jr. suspended his presidential campaign, he did it in the most complicated way.
Get your head around this: Kennedy will take himself off the ballot in certain key states, but he is encouraging supporters to vote for him in safe red and blue states so that he can feature in a “contingent election” if former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris tie.
In the battleground states, Kennedy said he’s supporting Trump.
Could Kennedy actually feature in a “contingent election?” Short answer: No. He could not take part unless he won electoral votes, something that does not seem to be mathematically possible. Perhaps he’s envisioning an elector going rogue and supporting him in defiance of voters, but Kennedy did not share details of his thinking.
For the facts about contingent elections, read on.
With two presidential candidates fighting over a mere 538 Electoral College votes, a tie scenario is more than possible. It’s actually kind of surprising there has only been one tied election so far, in 1800, between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr.
That tie was the result of a failure of coordination by Democratic-Republicans, but it led to the nation’s first “contingent election,” decided in the House of Representatives.
Could a tie actually happen this year?
Yes. While a tie is not a likely outcome, it is something to be ready for. Here is one plausible scenario for the 2024 election:
If Harris wins Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Nevada and a single electoral vote in Nebraska, all of which Joe Biden won in 2020, but she loses Pennsylvania and Georgia, there’s a tie, 269-269.
The website 270 to Win also has more tied-election scenarios.
Unlike every other state, Maine and Nebraska award two electors to the statewide winner and one to the winner of each congressional district. Those individual, competitive electoral votes in Maine and Nebraska become hugely consequential in potential tie scenarios.
Make your own 269-269 scenario with CNN’s interactive election map.
What happens if there’s a tie?
If there’s a 269-269 tie, or if a third party or independent candidate wins electoral votes and keeps a candidate from reaching an Electoral College majority of 270, the next step is the same. It’s called a “contingent election.”
According to the 12th Amendment, enacted in the wake of that divisive 1800 election, if no candidate gets a majority of the Electoral College votes, the new Congress, which would have just been sworn in on January 3, chooses the president. The Senate would choose the vice president.
When would a ‘contingent election’ occur?
According to an analysis by the Congressional Research Service, a contingent election would occur on January 6, immediately after members of Congress met to count electoral votes and determined that no candidate had a majority.
There is a lot of information from that CRS report in this story. While it dates back to 2017, it’s still a valuable resource.
How would the process work?
The nation would clearly be divided. Lawmakers could be torn between supporting their preferred candidate and the one their state’s voters preferred.
In a contingent election, the House selects the president and the Senate selects the vice president. House members can only choose from among the top three finishers in the Electoral College for president, and senators can choose from among the top two finishers for vice president. Kennedy would presumably need to win electoral votes – win a state or a congressional district in Nebraska or Maine – in order to be an option in a contingent election. There’s no chance of that happening at the moment.
Rather than voting as individuals, each state delegation in the House would get one vote, although how the state delegations select their preferred candidate is not spelled out. A simple majority, 26 state delegation votes, would appoint the new president.
If state delegations in the House did not select a president by Inauguration Day, January 20, the new vice president selected by the Senate would become temporary president. It is possible the Senate could select a vice president when the House is deadlocked, because in the Senate each senator would get one vote.
If the Senate had not selected a vice president by January 20, the presidential succession plan in the 20th Amendment temporarily takes effect. First in line after the vice president is the speaker of the House, currently Mike Johnson, although it could be a different Republican or a Democrat if Democrats win a majority in the House this November.
Does either side have an advantage?
If the Electoral College already benefits smaller and more rural states, the contingent election process – in which each state, regardless of population, has an equal vote – gives them a huge advantage.
California and Texas get the same say as Delaware and Wyoming in a contingent election. Plus, Washington, DC, which gets three votes in the Electoral College, would be cut out of the contingent election.
There’s nothing to require state delegations to honor the winner of their state’s vote. And in closely divided states, the results in single seats, perhaps determined by gerrymandered congressional maps, could swing a delegation’s vote.
Heading into the 2024 election, Republican lawmakers held a majority in 26 states, compared with Democrats, who held the majority in 22, with ties in Minnesota and North Carolina. Republicans in North Carolina have changed the state’s congressional map, however, and it is likely to have a majority-Republican congressional delegation in January. Republicans are likely to maintain their advantage next year, especially if voters are so split that they deliver a national tie at the top of the ticket.
In Arizona, for instance, who is to say that a potential majority of Republican members of Congress would vote for the Democratic candidate, even if Harris pulled out a narrow win there? Would Alaska’s Democratic member of Congress, assuming she wins reelection, vote for the Democrat for president even though her state is likely to go for Trump in November?
Why does this bizarre tie-break system exist?
It’s actually meant to be an improvement. The way the Electoral College was first assembled, electors voted for two candidates. Whoever got the most votes was president and whoever got the second-most votes was vice president.
By the time political parties were forming – Federalists and Democratic-Republicans in 1800 – electors needed to coordinate to cast more votes for their presidential pick than their vice presidential pick.
In the 1800 election, a rematch of 1796, Jefferson’s Democratic-Republicans beat incumbent President and Federalist John Adams.
But the Democratic-Republicans were poorly coordinated or bad at counting and foolishly cast equal numbers of votes for their presidential pick, Jefferson, and his running mate, Burr.
Out of pique, when the early version of the contingent election rolled around, the Federalists, who still controlled the House at that time, backed Burr. Despite the intervention of Alexander Hamilton, a noted Federalist, it took 36 rounds of voting to finally elect Jefferson.
By 1804, the 12th Amendment was being ratified.
Has a contingent election happened in the years since the tied election of 1800?
Yes. In 1824, multiple candidates got votes in the Electoral College but none of them received a majority, triggering a contingent election.
Amazingly, from today’s perspective, all of the candidates who got Electoral College votes that year were from the same Democratic-Republican political party, although they were split into regional sects.
Andrew Jackson won 40% of the popular vote and got the most votes in the Electoral College with 99 of the 131 needed for victory. But the House ultimately picked his top rival, John Quincy Adams, whose father lost that 1800 election.
Jackson would have his revenge with a victory four years later, and John Quincy Adams would round out his career as the only former president to be elected to Congress, the body that made him president.
Another contingent election occurred with the 1836 race, but just for vice president. Virginia’s electors did not like Robert M. Johnson, the running mate of election winner Martin Van Buren, and withheld their votes for him in the Electoral College. The Senate later elevated Johnson to the vice presidency in a contingent election.
What about the disputed election of 1876?
In 1876, when there was a contested outcome, the contingent election system was bypassed.
That year, at the height of Reconstruction, the issue was not that no person got a majority in the Electoral College, but rather that three Southern states – Florida, Louisiana and South Carolina – sent multiple slates of electoral votes to Washington, DC, after the state elections were disputed. And in Oregon, there was a dispute over one elector.
Congress created a special bipartisan commission, with one more Republican than Democrats, to determine which candidate should get the 20 disputed electoral votes. They ultimately gave the votes to Republican Rutherford B. Hayes even though Democrat Samuel Tilden got more popular votes.
Hayes then largely ended Reconstruction, perhaps as part of a secret deal that gave him the White House.

CNN,Biden comes to grips with a diminished role on the campaign trail | CNN Politics,"President Joe Biden’s role in the 2024 presidential campaign in the final weeks of the election has been moved even further out of the spotlight as recent campaign trail gaffes prompted a range of responses – from eyerolls to outright anger – from some Harris campaign aides.
Planning for a range of Biden events had been up in the air late last week as the campaign worked to reassess how best to use the incumbent, who now plans to make several solo stops this week, including an infrastructure speech in Baltimore and an address to union members in Philadelphia and an appearance in his hometown of Scranton..
Biden’s impromptu attack on former president and GOP nominee Donald Trump in New Hampshire spurred a flurry of coverage outside the scope of the event, raising concerns among Harris aides and allies about singular comments getting amplified in the final stretch of the race.
“We got to lock him up,” Biden had said, while speaking off the cuff to campaign workers in Concord, New Hampshire, before quickly pivoting to try to clarify his remarks. “Politically lock him up. Lock him out. That’s what we have to do.”
Then, speaking in Arizona on Friday, Biden referred to former Rep. Gabby Giffords, who survived being shot in the head at a 2011 campaign event, in the past tense, suggesting she was no longer alive.
While aides have previously brushed off such slips as “vintage Biden,” noting the president’s proclivity to misspeak, they also acknowledge there’s no room for error amid the frenzied news cycle and fragile balance of the race that has raised the stakes for each event in the final days.
“We’re in ‘Do No Harm’ mode,” said one official involved in discussions of Biden’s role.
As the campaign entered the post-Labor Day home stretch, Biden’s senior-most aides acknowledged that his role would be diminished, both due to the need to familiarize voters with Harris and to distance her from an outgoing president whose approval rating has been underwater for much of his term. But they express surprise at just how little Biden has been utilized in a race that’s become something of a referendum on his presidency.
A Harris’ campaign spokesman said the vice president is thankful for what Biden has done for her so far.
“Vice President Harris is grateful for President Biden’s support and appreciates that he is campaigning for her,” said Ian Sams, a Harris campaign spokesman.
Andrew Bates, senior deputy press secretary at the White House, said Biden’s best role in the Harris campaign is “demonstrating leadership as president” while Harris is on the trail.
“As President Biden has said himself, he knows that every President needs to ‘cut their own path’ and he will continue to coordinate with the campaign on where and how he can be helpful, like he has done in recent days mobilizing the labor unions he has worked with for decades,” he said.
After so long in politics, Biden is fully aware of the delicate decisions that govern campaign seasons. He has long said – usually as a joke – that he’s willing to campaign for or against his favored candidate, “whichever will help the most.”
With days until voting closes, the president’s schedule this week doesn’t reflect a surrogate in high demand. After suggesting in September he would be on the road regularly for Harris in the final months, Biden has been largely absent from the campaign trail in the closing stretch. A tour of Pennsylvania alongside Gov. Josh Shapiro, which Biden teased earlier this fall, doesn’t appear to have materialized. An event Biden helmed with union workers over the weekend was not promoted by the Harris campaign, which omitted the appearance from its top surrogate recaps, though it was approved and supported by the Harris operation.
Biden has a few “campaign calls” scheduled this week, where he hopes to rally various groups telephonically behind Harris. He’ll attend a union event on Friday in Philadelphia, the hometown of his wife, for an official White House appearance rather than a campaign rally.
Such is the existence of an unpopular incumbent on the way out. He joins a club that includes Bill Clinton and George W. Bush as presidents mostly kept off the campaign trail as their party looks to turn a page.
Soul searching
As he’s watched from the sidelines of the race that he was in a little more than three months ago, Biden has embarked on some soul-searching, those close to him say, reflecting on both the long arc of his career and its abrupt end – his decades as a beloved party operative and, more recently, persona non grata.
Biden, these people say, remains firm in his view that he would be able to defeat his predecessor in November if he remained at the top of the Democratic ticket.
But if the president’s tone has shifted at all since July on anything, it has been on the issue of his own age.
Once defiant on his mental and physical fitness in the face of questions from reporters, concerns within his own party and a blistering critique by former special counsel Robert Hur, Biden has become much more circumspect on his abilities, multiple sources told CNN.
In private conversations, the president in recent weeks has more readily acknowledged that self-reflection about his age – and everything that is required of the presidency – had indeed been a part of his decision-making process over the summer. First lady Dr. Jill Biden, who had supported Biden staying in the race until the end, recently admitted in an interview with ABC’s “Good Morning America” that exiting the race was “the right call.”
Biden himself has hinted more at the role that his age played in his decision-making – at times sheepishly and with an injection of humor – including recently in an interview with the hosts of ABC’s “The View.”
“I stepped down because I started thinking about it,” he said. “It’s hard for me to even say how old I am. I’m serious. I give my word. It’s like – ‘Holy God, that can’t be right. This can’t be right.’”
Diminishing role
While the president has largely stuck to White House events and travel, the campaign has utilized another Biden on the road – the first lady.
In the past week, Jill Biden has traveled to Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, including stops with fellow educator Gwen Walz.
Asked Monday by reporters whether he would appear with Harris on the campaign trail this week, the president acknowledged he’s taking direction from the campaign.
“We talk all the time, and they’re asking me to be where they think I should be,” he said.
Biden said he’s done “a lot of surrogate stuff,” but chalked up his absence from the trail to his day job.
“The fact of the matter is that I’ve also had to be president at the same time. So, I’ve been to all the battleground states, I’ve been campaigning, but I also have to continue my job as president,” he said.
A long, emotional good-bye
People close to the president say he has not yet come to terms with his popularity as a politician, which deteriorated markedly during his time in office as the cost of living soared. Before dropping out of the 2024 race, Biden’s approval rating hit 36%, according to Gallup.
During his participation in White House events, Biden has appeared wistful – a descriptor used often by his aides – and at times has choked up at the magnitude of the office.
While presenting the National Medal of Arts and National Humanities Medals to several dozen creatives, he teared up while recounting the lyrics to “My Country Tis of Thee.” Ashley Biden, the president’s daughter, and Jon Meacham, presidential historian who has helped write some of most consequential speeches, could be seen wiping their eyes in the East Room as they looked on.
Biden’s core belief, one longtime aide says, is that he’s served as “a damn good president.”
But privately, this aide says, Biden has struggled with the question that’s plagued his West Wing: Why hasn’t it mattered to voters?
With his final months in office, Biden is expected to try to reframe that narrative through a series of speeches on issues like the economy and a series of summits with world leaders that affirm the US’ relationship with key allies. He’ll greet heads of state in Peru at the APEC summit and G-20 leaders in Brazil in late November. And in December, he’ll visit Africa to highlight efforts to counter China’s inroads there.
The post-election burst of activity is expected to release Biden’s kinetic energy that’s been under wraps as Harris has stepped into the spotlight. When Biden has tried to share that spotlight during the height of the campaign, wires and messages have gotten crossed.
In early October, Biden made a spontaneous inaugural visit as president to the White House Press Briefing room – something that sources said he had expressed interest in doing to his team weeks ago – to tout unexpectedly good jobs data and the end to a port worker strike. But Biden’s surprise appearance took place at the exact moment Harris was taking the stage at a campaign rally in Detroit, leading major television networks to change their feed from her remarks to the president.
White House officials insist there was no malice involved.
“He was just excited,” one official said.

CNN,New House speaker once partnered with so-called ‘ex-gay’ conversion group | CNN Politics,"Speaker of the House Mike Johnson closely collaborated with a group in the mid-to-late 2000s that promoted “conversion therapy,” a discredited practice that asserted it could change the sexual orientation of gay and lesbian individuals.
Prior to launching his political career, Johnson, a lawyer, gave legal advice to an organization called Exodus International and partnered with the group to put on an annual anti-gay event aimed at teens, according to a CNN KFile review of more than a dozen of Johnson’s media appearances from that timespan.
Founded in 1976, Exodus International was a leader in the so-called “ex-gay” movement, which aimed to make gay individuals straight through conversion therapy programs using religious and counseling methods. Exodus International connected ministries across the world using these controversial approaches.
The group shut down in 2013, with its founder posting a public apology for the “pain and hurt” his organization caused. Conversion therapy has been widely condemned by most major medical institutions and has been shown to be harmful to struggling LGBTQ people.
At the time, Johnson worked as an attorney for the socially conservative legal advocacy group, Alliance Defense Fund (ADF). He and his group collaborated with Exodus from 2006 to 2010.
For years, Johnson and Exodus worked on an event started by ADF in 2005 known as the “Day of Truth” – a counterprotest to the “Day of Silence,” a day in schools in which students stayed silent to bring awareness to bullying faced by LGBTQ youth.
The Day of Truth sought to counter that silence by distributing information about what Johnson described as the “dangerous” gay lifestyle.
“I mean, our race, the size of our feet, the color of our eyes, these are things we’re born with and we cannot change,” Johnson told one radio host in 2008 promoting the event. “What these adult advocacy groups like the Gay Lesbian Straight Education Network are promoting is a type of behavior. Homosexual behavior is something you do, it’s not something that you are.”
In print, radio and on television, Johnson, a Louisiana Republican, frequently disparaged homosexuality, according to KFile’s review. He advocated for the criminalization of gay sex and went so far as to partially blame it for the fall of the Roman Empire.
“Some credit to the fall of Rome to not only the deprivation of the society and the loss of morals, but also to the rampant homosexual behavior that was condoned by the society,” Johnson told a radio host in 2008.
Johnson’s office did not respond to a CNN request for comment asking about his work with Exodus.
A close collaboration
Exodus International joined ADF’s Day of Truth event in 2006 and the groups worked together on promotional material for the event, including a standalone website which pointed users to Exodus’ conversion ministries. Documents on that website cited the since-repudiated academic work in support of conversion therapy. Exodus Youth, the group’s youth wing, promoted the event within its blogs.
Videos put out by Exodus and ADF on their standalone Day of Truth website featured two Exodus staffers speaking about how teens didn’t need to “accept” or “embrace” their homosexuality. The videos featured testimonials of a “former-homosexual” and “former lesbian.”
Documents on the website were not archived online but were saved by anti-conversion therapy groups such as Truth Wins Out in 2007 and 2008. The website featured a FAQ on homosexuality provided by Exodus and sold t-shirts saying, “the Truth cannot be silenced.”
One video featured Johnson, who was later quoted in a press release on Exodus International’s website ahead of the event, saying, “An open, honest discussion allows truth to rise to the surface.”
Johnson promoted the event heavily in the media – through radio interviews, comments in newspapers, and an editorial. In interviews, he repeatedly cited the case of a teen who went to school after the Day of Silence wearing a shirt that read, “Be ashamed. Our school has embraced what God has condemned” and “Homosexuality is shameful.” The teen was suspended and ADF represented him in legal action over the incident. The case was dismissed because the teen graduated, and the court found he no longer had standing to challenge the dress code.
“Day of Truth was really established to counter the promotion of the homosexual agenda in public schools,” Johnson told a radio host in 2008.
Those who worked to counter ADF and Exodus at the time, said the event was dangerous to confused youth.
“This directly harmed LGBTQ youth,” Wayne Besen, the executive director of Truth Wins Out and an expert on the ex-gay industry, told CNN. “This is someone whose core was promoting anti-gay and ex-gay viewpoints. He wouldn’t pander to anti-gay advocates, he was the anti-gay and ex-gay advocate.”
Randy Scobey, a former executive vice president at Exodus, who worked on the Day of Truth in the organization’s collaboration with ADF, called the event one of his biggest regrets.
“It was bullying those who were trying to not be bullied,” said Scobey, who now lives openly as a gay man. “That was one of the public ways that the Alliance Defense Fund worked with us.”
Ties between Exodus and ADF extended beyond the event.
ADF, which has since changed its name to the Alliance Defending Freedom, touted Exodus International in promotional brochures in 2004, crediting it as an organization that “played an instrumental role in helping thousands of individuals come out of homosexual behavior.”
Scobey recalled Johnson as quiet, but firm in his beliefs that homosexuality was wrong. He said Johnson and ADF provided crucial legal advice to Exodus and its “member ministries.”
“We worked with them behind the scenes a lot,” Scobey told CNN, saying the group offered them legal guidance over their ex-gay counseling. “They were very important to us as far as helping us to feel more secure legally and politically.”
Exodus International stopped sponsoring the Day of Truth event in 2010, saying it became adversarial and counterproductive.

CNN,Democratic divisions over Israel heat up over Gaza hospital blast controversy | CNN Politics,"Democrats on Capitol Hill are furious over Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib’s refusal to retract or add new context to her statements blaming Israel for the deadly blast that devastated a Gaza hospital, killing hundreds of people and setting off a regional backlash against the US and Israel.
Tlaib’s initial social media posts reflected the early Hamas-sourced reports out of Gaza. But those reports are now at odds with initial American intelligence, which subsequently concluded that the Israel Defense Forces were not responsible for the explosion.
The dispute has laid bare long-standing and increasingly passionate disagreements among congressional Democrats over the party’s relationship with Israel – and, now, how to position the party as the deadly conflict in Israel and Gaza escalates.
Mainstream Democrats, led by President Joe Biden, continue to insist on staunch support for Israel, while some progressive House members are becoming more insistent that the US aggressively push for a ceasefire and hold Israel accountable for alleged war crimes against Palestinians. And within the progressive bloc too, high-profile members such as New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have occasionally diverged, at least rhetorically, from their ideological allies and have spoken in more cautious, conciliatory tones. The political director for Rep. Ro Khanna, another influential progressive, resigned because the California Democrat did not sign a resolution calling for a ceasefire.
Tlaib, a Palestinian American and a longtime advocate for Palestinian rights, has been the most outspoken critic of Israel in Congress since her election in 2018. Her insistence on blaming Israel for the blast, which the US believes was struck by an errant rocket launched by extremist group Islamic Jihad, has roiled colleagues determined to present a united front at a harrowing time.
“That’s a vile position to take,” Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz told CNN, suggesting that Tlaib should review intelligence made available to House members. “She should at least pull those tweets down, instead of remaining entrenched in a position that is dangerous and unacceptable.”
Democrats have mostly been measured in their public comments about Tlaib, expressing frustration with her unyielding position in light of the conflicting reports and new evidence that Israel was not responsible for the hospital blast while also blaming the media over its coverage of the tragedy.
“When Israel makes statements, they have to show satellite imagery and all sorts of video. But when Hamas says something, the entire media world ran with it.” Florida Rep. Jared Moskowitz said. “It caused riots in all sorts of countries. It caused meetings to be canceled for the president. And so everyone has to be careful before they just react, and wait for things to be confirmed.”
But the effort to project unity could soon become untenable – and the divisions are becoming more personal.
According to a source with knowledge of the complaints, some Jewish Democrats have privately complained to Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries’ team about comments from Tlaib and Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, who initially echoed reports blaming Israel for the hospital attack before posting additional context about the hospital explosion and acknowledging the US intelligence assessment. (Jeffries has embraced the US and Israeli intelligence conclusions and a spokesperson said in a statement that Jeffries, like Biden, backs Israel’s “unequivocal right to defend itself against Hamas under the established rules of war and strongly disagrees with any effort to blame President Joe Biden or the policies of his administration.”)
Tlaib’s office did not respond to a request for comment on the matter, but the Michigan Democrat appeared at a Wednesday rally on Capitol Hill and continued to blame Israel.
“That’s what’s been really painful – just continue to watch people think it’s OK to bomb a hospital, where children,” Tlaib said. “What’s so hard sometimes is watching those videos and the people telling the kids, ‘Don’t cry.’ But like, let them cry. And they’re shaking, and somebody – you know this – they keep telling them not to cry in Arabic. They can cry, I can cry, we all can cry. If we’re not crying, something is wrong.”
“People are furious,” one House Democrat told CNN about the reaction to Tlaib’s comments. “The intelligence that we’ve received is clear. Do you believe Hamas’ intel or do you believe the United States’ intelligence?”
There’s now a push among some House Democrats to convince Tlaib to get an intelligence briefing on the hospital strike, according to the source.
Another House Democrat felt that Tlaib’s comments were frustrating but not entirely unexpected and that her colleagues are taking different approaches to addressing them. Some have been speaking out publicly while others are giving Tlaib space to walk back her comments.
Some Democrats pointed to a social media post by Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman as summing up the way a lot of them are feeling right now.
“It’s truly disturbing that Members of Congress rushed to blame Israel for the hospital tragedy in Gaza,” Fetterman wrote. ” Who would take the word of a group that just massacred innocent Israeli citizens over our key ally?”
Another Democratic aide, though, argued that the pushback against Tlaib and Omar undermined the Democratic Party’s brand.
“Part of being a ‘diversity party’ and a ‘big tent party’ includes bringing new voices who have been marginalized into the party,” the aide said. “And Muslim Americans have been some of the most marginalized people in American life for the past two decades.”
“No one in Congress is denying the horror of Hamas or the horror of the thousands of Israelis killed and the largest attack on Jews since the Holocaust,” the aide said, adding that the frustration among Muslim Americans – and some Jewish Americans – lies in “one side with very little political power receiving all of the outrage.”
Former House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, downplayed the discord in the caucus.
“Name me more than four people,” Hoyer told CNN, in an apparent reference to the original “squad” of Tlaib, Omar, Ocasio Cortez and Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley. “Do we have some people that have a different view? We do. But it’s not the position of the party.”
But the ranks of the dissenters have grown since then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi first offered a similarly dismissive assessment of the squad members in 2019. Progressives now make up a growing share of the House Democratic Caucus. More than a dozen Democratic members have so far publicly called for a ceasefire, including those who signed a proposed resolution by Missouri Rep. Cori Bush, a newer squad member.
“I am grieving for every Palestinian, Israeli, and American life lost to this violence, and my heart breaks for all those who will be forever traumatized because of it,” Bush said in an accompanying statement. “War and retaliatory violence doesn’t achieve accountability or justice; it only leads to more death and human suffering.”",2023-10-20
CNN,These are the states where abortion rights will – or could – be on the ballot in November | CNN Politics,"This November, voters in at least 10 states will take to the polls to determine the future of abortion access in their state, after a nationwide effort by organizers to secure a wave of ballot measures aimed at restoring or protecting the right to an abortion — and some aimed at restricting it.
Abortion rights advocates hope the effort will restore the issue of reproductive health access to the people, after the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, eliminating the national right to an abortion.
Most of the proposed ballot measures aim to enshrine the right to an abortion in state constitutions. They follow a series of restrictive trigger laws that went into effect following the Dobbs decision, along with abortion policies that were handed down by politicians or decided by state supreme courts since the decision.
Anti-abortion organizers backed a handful of initiatives aimed at restricting abortion access, though similar restrictive measures have failed in the few states where votes have been held in the past couple of years.
Abortion measures on the ballot in November
Ten states — Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York and South Dakota — have already secured abortion measures on the 2024 ballot. All eyes are on Florida, which has served as a critical access point for people seeking services in a region of the country that is fast becoming an abortion care desert. A six-week abortion ban replaced the state’s 15-week ban on May 1.
Nebraska Secretary of State Robert Evnen announced in August that for the first time in the state’s history, two conflicting petition efforts made the same ballot. Now voters in Nebraska will vote on whether abortion rights will be enshrined in the constitution or whether the state’s current 12-week ban will be preserved.
After organizers secured the New York Equal Rights Amendment on the 2024 ballot, it was briefly struck from the ballot by a state judge. State Attorney General Letitia James appealed that decision, and a state appeals court restored the measure to the ballot in June.
A measure in Missouri that seeks to broadly protect reproductive care has made it onto the ballot, while an opposing measure to permanently ban abortion never made it out of the state’s legislative session.
States with potential abortion ballot measures
Organizers in states across the country have continued to work to secure funding, gather signatures and jump through the legal hoops necessary to secure abortion measures on the 2024 ballot.
In most states, the process entails collecting a certain number of signatures by a designated deadline, while others require the additional step of having the ballot language approved by a state court, according to campaign organizers. The abortion rights measures are largely backed by coalitions of reproductive health advocates, many of which have fundraised to secure the money to support the campaigns.
Organizers in Arkansas collected and submitted signatures for a proposed abortion rights measure, but the Secretary of State rejected their petition, saying the organizers did not correctly submit paperwork regarding paid canvassers. The state’s supreme court sided with the secretary, ensuring the measure will not be on the ballot this November.
Lawmaker proposed measures in Iowa and Missouri to restrict or exclude the right to abortion in state constitutions did not make it out of legislative sessions. Lawmakers in Pennsylvania proposed a measure barring the use of public funding for abortions, which is unlikely to pass the state legislature.
States that have voted on abortion post-Dobbs
Seven states have already seen a vote on abortion access since Roe v. Wade was overturned, and reproductive health advocates have been heartened by the overwhelming support for abortion access among voters. Every measure aimed at protecting abortion access has passed, while all measures to restrict it have failed.
While support for abortion access is considered a given in states like California, organizers say these votes offer an important layer of legal protection for patients and providers – and send a message to elected officials about what voters want.

CNN,Analysis: House GOP circus embarrasses senior party leaders as the country and the world wait for a speaker | CNN Politics,"House Republicans on Monday open the next act of their Washington farce, desperately searching for a speaker after ousting the incumbent and rejecting two would-be replacements while still clueless about how to dig out of the crisis.
Congress has seen impeachments, fiscal cliffs, government shutdowns and even an insurrection, but the modern Republican Party is surpassing itself with a debacle that is embarrassing senior party leaders and threatens to damage the House GOP’s hopes of saving and expanding upon its tiny majority in 2024. Far from tackling critical bills needed to fund the government, the leaderless House can’t do the basics, like pass a resolution condemning the Hamas attacks in Israel.
At least nine new candidates have signed up to run for speaker ahead of a new selection process this week after Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan folded his futile bid for the job on Friday, following Majority Leader Steve Scalise the week before. The uprising that began nearly three weeks ago with the toppling of Speaker Kevin McCarthy has now weakened three of the most powerful figures in the House GOP. Perhaps a newcomer can change the calculations of the extremists who opposed McCarthy and Scalise and the more moderate battleground district members who doomed the bulldozing Jordan. But there’s no sign yet any of them can win the 217 votes needed in the full chamber to claim the top job. And more importantly, for whoever eventually wins the gavel, the task of making the House a functional legislative body looks impossible after weeks of GOP infighting that cultivated fresh grievances and demands for vengeance.
“You know, getting 217 is obviously going to be very difficult and is the sort of Rubik’s Cube of the answer to all of this,” Ohio Rep. Mike Turner, chairman of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday.
Twisting colored squares together in the right order seems simple by comparison with attempts to unite a House Republican conference unable to comprehend how clownish it looks. Republicans, determined to fight a civil war over fractures in the conservative movement, seem oblivious to the degenerating global stability all around them or the shutdown threat directly in front of them.
The vacuum is rendering one branch of the US government inoperable, since the Senate can’t pass laws without the other chamber. “We need (a speaker) because the House can’t do anything without a speaker,” Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” Sunday.
The imbroglio is far more serious than the classic congressional drama wherein lawmakers procrastinate and work through their political rituals, and then finally get their acts together. In a practical sense, the absence of a speaker means the House cannot support Israel in accordance with a new aid request from President Joe Biden. A critical and bitter debate over new Ukraine funding – $60 billion of which was requested by Biden last week – cannot begin. Before long, the blocked US lifeline could have grave consequences in Ukraine’s war for survival and boost Russian President Vladimir Putin, who is betting US resolve will wane – not a bad wager considering increasing GOP resistance to defending the democratic government in Kyiv.
But forget reverberations overseas. The House meltdown could soon begin to harm millions of Americans. The GOP has wasted three of the precious weeks that it had to solve a spending showdown that could shut down the government by the middle of November. Even if the party suddenly moves quickly toward choosing a new leader, it’s unlikely much serious work gets done this week either.
What the vacant speakership says about the GOP
The empty speaker’s chair offers an eloquent metaphor for how internal political chaos is compromising American leadership. It’s also threatening the more-than-two-centuries-long experiment in self-government by the people that relies ultimately on no one getting everything they want but accepting incremental change. That’s a concept that the modern GOP seems to reject – as evidenced by the claims of Donald Trump and many of his acolytes in the House that they have the right to rule even though the former president’s bid for a second term was rejected by voters in 2020.
The House Republican conference is showing that it cannot even compromise with itself, let alone construct a unified position before eventually accepting the trade-offs that will be needed in dealing with a Democratic-run Senate and White House. Whichever Republican finally wins the speakership will face similar questions to the ones that eventually cost McCarthy his dream job – namely whether to indulge far-right Republicans with extreme spending cuts that the White House and the Senate will never accept, or to avert a government shutdown by advancing stopgap funding with some Democratic votes. Unless a new speaker can change the dynamic, their tenure risks being even shorter than that of the California Republican.
A new speaker will also be hampered by the reality that chaos and a neutered government are a welcome outcome for many grassroots Republicans in a party transformed by Trump. Many of these lawmakers have perfected the extremism that hedges against primary challenges and the cacophony that pleases the ratings-driven demands of conservative media. Influence in the GOP is no longer bought by years of service that paves the way for committee chairmanships. Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, who led the eight Republicans who voted to can McCarthy, understands the equation well – which is one reason why senior figures bemoaning the need to “govern” aren’t persuading rabble-rousing members. The most obvious representative of this style of stunt politics Republicanism is Trump – who, despite being impeached twice, falsely claiming the 2020 election was stolen and facing four criminal trials, is the runaway front-runner for the GOP’s 2024 presidential nomination.
Embarrassed GOP leaders plea for an end to the mess
Sheer fatigue in the House GOP may create an opening for a candidate who could become a weak speaker with no national name recognition but who could attract the least rancor from across the divided conference. Until then, serious Republican legislators in the House only have the power to express dismay as America’s enemies delight in watching US democracy founder.
“This is probably one of the most embarrassing things I’ve seen because if we don’t have a speaker of the House, we can’t govern. And every day that goes by, we’re essentially shut down as a government,” House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican, said on ABC News’ “This Week.”
McCarthy, who supported Jordan but is now backing House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, warned on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that the situation cannot be allowed to endure much longer. “This is embarrassing for the Republican Party. It’s embarrassing for the nation, and we need to look at one another and solve the problem,” the former speaker said.
Emmer is among nine GOP candidates seeking to lock down votes ahead of an expected secret ballot to pick a speaker nominee on Tuesday. The Minnesota Republican’s problem, however, is much like McCarthy’s – he is likely to struggle to win the support of the far-right House Freedom Caucus that reviles the GOP leadership team.
The other members throwing their hat into a ring that does not include a single woman are Reps. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma, who chairs the influential Republican Study Committee; Jack Bergman of Michigan, a mainstream conservative and Marine veteran; Austin Scott of Georgia, who launched a last-minute bid against Jordan last week but quickly dropped out; Byron Donalds of Florida, a rising star Freedom Caucus member and one of the few Black Republicans in Congress; Mike Johnson of Louisiana, the GOP conference vice chairman; Pete Sessions of Texas, a congressional veteran who lost his seat in 2018 and soon returned to represent another one; Dan Meuser, a former Pennsylvania secretary of revenue and member of the Problem Solvers Caucus; and Gary Palmer of Alabama, who chairs the Republican Policy Committee.
Newt Gingrich – a former Republican speaker who is credited with inventing back in the 1990s the highly partisan style of hardball governing preferred by today’s GOP – said party leaders must choose anyone who can get to a House majority regardless of who they are, or the charade could go on for weeks. And he warned with critical government funding and budget bills looming, the GOP doesn’t just have to unite on a new speaker but on a new period of unified governance.
“That 217 has to be committed not just to elect a speaker, but to stick together for the next five or six months. They got big decisions coming down the road,” Gingrich told Fox News. “There’s a very real danger that they’ll elect somebody, and three or four or five weeks from now, you’re going to have a group of people blow up and decide to go back into the same mess.
“So they need to pick somebody to get stability.”
Putting aside the irony of those words coming from the firebrand Georgia Republican, the House GOP has shown over the last three weeks that stability is the last thing the party is able, or even wants, to deliver.",2023-10-23
CNN,House GOP Whip Tom Emmer moves to lock in support for speakership amid crowded field | CNN Politics,"House speaker candidate Tom Emmer, the GOP whip, has moved to lock in support across the ideological and geographic spectrum in the conference, giving him what many House Republicans believe is an advantage heading into a secret-ballot election to nominate their candidate Tuesday, according to Republican sources.
But it’s hard to assess his chances fully since it’s a crowded field, with at least seven candidates working the phones all weekend to win a majority of support within the conference.
Even if Emmer were to win the nomination, Republican sources are uncertain he can get 217 votes on the floor, as he could face resistance from members of the hardline House Freedom Caucus skeptical of the GOP leadership team.
House Republicans are searching for a new GOP speaker nominee after Rep. Jim Jordan on Friday became the latest exit from the race. The chamber has been without a speaker for more than two weeks after Kevin McCarthy’s historic ouster this month.
Emmer, of Minnesota, said in a letter to colleagues Saturday that he was seeking the speakership with the goal of delivering “historic change.” McCarthy has endorsed Emmer for speaker, delivering an early boost for his candidacy.
McCarthy on Sunday urged his House colleagues to elect Emmer but stopped short of ruling out another speakership run himself.
“He’s been in the room with all of our successes,” the California Republican said of Emmer. “He sets himself head and shoulders above all those others who want to run.
“This is not a time for a learning experience as speaker. Tom would be able to walk into the job and do it on Day 1,” McCarthy said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”
McCarthy once again demurred when asked about returning to wield the gavel.
“I don’t need the title. I’m going to help in any way I can,” he said. “I’m supporting Tom Emmer, but I’m going to tell you, I’m still a member of Congress, and I’m going to lead in any capacity I can to help to protect America.”

CNN,Sen. Bob Menendez pleads not guilty to charge alleging he conspired to act as a foreign agent of Egypt | CNN Politics,"Sen. Bob Menendez pleaded not guilty in federal court Monday to a charge alleging he conspired to act as a foreign agent of Egypt.
The New Jersey Democrat personally entered his plea before district Judge Sidney H. Stein.
Menendez, his wife Nadine Arslanian Menendez, and three other co-defendants were indicted last month on corruption-related offenses and are accused of accepting “hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes” in exchange for the senator’s influence. Menendez and the others pleaded not guilty to those charges. A trial date has been set for May.
In a statement released by his office after his arraignment, Menendez dismissed the charge “as outrageous as it is absurd.”
“I have been, throughout my life, loyal to only one country — the United States of America, the land my family chose to live in democracy and freedom,” he said, adding later: “I will not litigate this case through the press, but have made it abundantly clear that I have done nothing wrong and once all the facts are presented will be found innocent.”
The additional charge unveiled early this month in a superseding indictment filed against Menendez, who was chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at the time of the alleged actions, adds a new dimension to the case by alleging a US senator was working on behalf of another country.
Prosecutors allege Nadine Menendez and businessman Wael Hana failed to register as agents working on behalf of Egypt and conspired to have the senator act on behalf of Egypt. Nadine Menendez and Hana both pleaded not guilty to the superseding indictment last week.
Menendez stepped down as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee last month when he was initially charged but has rejected calls to resign as New Jersey’s senior senator.
It is illegal for a member of Congress or any public official to act as foreign agent.
The senator stressed his loyalty to the US in a statement earlier this month, arguing that the new charge goes against his “long record of standing up for human rights and democracy in Egypt and in challenging leaders of that country.”
The new charge carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison. Menendez and his wife are now facing as much as 50 years in prison if convicted.

CNN,How hurricane season is affecting the way Americans are following the Trump-Harris race | CNN Politics,"Editor’s Note 10/23/24: Since this story was first published, officials in Buncombe County, North Carolina, home to Asheville, have reported they overcounted the death toll in their region by as many as 30. Some of the death toll figures in this story are no longer accurate.
With the election less than a month away, the public’s attention has shifted to the candidates’ responses to hurricane season, according to The Breakthrough, a CNN polling project that tracks what average Americans are actually hearing, reading and seeing about the presidential nominees throughout the campaign. Former President Donald Trump’s campaign also faced renewed focus on his legal troubles in the wake of a new filing by federal prosecutors, the survey finds.
In the wake of Hurricane Helene, which has killed more than 230 people across the southeastern United States, “hurricane” was the word most frequently mentioned when respondents were asked what they’d heard about Trump. It was the second-most frequent word mentioned when they were asked about Vice President Kamala Harris, second only to “campaign.” The poll, conducted by SSRS and Verasight on behalf of a research team from CNN, Georgetown University and the University of Michigan, was fielded from October 4-7, before Hurricane Milton made landfall in Florida on Wednesday night.
Democrats and Republicans were about equally likely to mention the hurricane when talking about Harris – although their perspectives on her response often differed sharply.
Harris “was working with FEMA on providing assistance and recovery for the areas affected by Hurricane Helene,” one Democratic respondent wrote, while another credited her with having done “a great job of consoling hurricane victims in Georgia.”
By contrast, a Republican respondent wrote about hearing that Harris “is only paying $750 to those whose homes are being devastated in the hurricanes, yet sending billions upon billions of dollars to Ukraine and Israel.” The $750 is an apparent reference to a payment program at the Federal Emergency Management Agency that has been mischaracterized by Trump and others as the only assistance FEMA is providing.
Republicans were far likelier than Democrats to mention the hurricane in conjunction with Trump. When Democrats were asked what they’d recently heard about the GOP presidential nominee, they were more likely than Republicans to mention his response to the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, or simply use the word “lie.”
In the latest set of data, Americans also mentioned the October 5 rally Trump held in Butler, Pennsylvania – the site of the first assassination attempt against him this summer. And they referenced two other names in conjunction with him: Elon Musk, who appeared onstage with Trump in Butler, and Jack Smith, the special counsel whose recently unsealed legal brief laid out the government’s sweeping case against the former president for his effort to overturn the 2020 election.
Roughly 14% of respondents who’d heard something about Trump referenced words related to his legal issues, up from 7% in the previous wave of data and the highest share to do so since early September, when the sentencing in his New York criminal case was delayed until after the 2024 election.
Asked about Harris, 8% of respondents who’d heard something about her mentioned words relating to endorsements – in this case, largely a reference to Republican former Vice President Dick Cheney, who announced his support of her last month, and his daughter Liz Cheney, the former Wyoming congresswoman who recently appeared with Harris on the campaign trail. Harris also previously saw bursts of attention after endorsements from Oprah Winfrey and Taylor Swift.
The sentiment behind the words Americans used to describe what they’d heard about Harris remained modestly more positive than the words they used to describe the news about Trump. This doesn’t mean that they expressed warmer feelings about Harris personally but that what they said about her tended to be framed in relatively positive terms and tone. The tone of responses relating to both candidates were overall more negative than positive.",2024-10-13
CNN,Senate confirms FAA leader after 19-month vacancy | CNN Politics,"The Senate on Tuesday confirmed Michael Whitaker to a five-year term running the Federal Aviation Administration.
Whitaker is a former Obama-era deputy FAA administrator, and said at his confirmation hearing earlier this month that his past “time at FAA gives me some real advantage” taking the top job. Most recently he was an executive at a company developing electric air taxis, and he previously served in senior roles at several airlines, including United Airlines.
Now, Whitaker takes the reins at the FAA as the agency, in his words, “faces big challenges.”
Among his first priorities, industry officials say, is providing a steady, consistent hand atop FAA, which oversees aviation safety, air traffic control and aircraft certification. The FAA has come under scrutiny after a series of airliner close calls on US runways, flight disruptions linked to air traffic control understaffing and the killing of 346 people in Boeing 737 MAX crashes after the FAA certified the plane as safe.
Whitaker has also said he would prioritize technological and other improvements for “the aviation system of the future.”
“When I was at the FAA just a few years ago drones were new, commercial space launches were rare and flying taxis were still only in cartoons,” Whitaker said at his confirmation hearing. “All of this has changed and it requires that the agency look forward, adapt quickly and execute a plan for the future.”
He has support from a variety of aviation industry groups, including those representing airlines, pilots and airline passengers.
He is the Biden administration’s second FAA chief nominee. The first, Denver airport CEO Phil Washington, withdrew his name over criticism of his limited aviation experience and link to a political corruption investigation.
The post was vacated in March 2022 when Steve Dickson, who was nominated by President Donald Trump, stepped down midway through his five-year term. The agency has been run by a series of interim administrators, most recently the deputy transportation secretary.

CNN,Redistricting battles have mostly ended. Here’s how they could determine the balance of power in the US House | CNN Politics,"Multiple Supreme Court showdowns. Closed-door negotiations. And millions of dollars in litigation.
After months of legal and legislative skirmishes around the country, much of the redistricting drama of the 2024 election cycle is behind us. And it has ended pretty close to where it began: Just a handful of seats could determine which party controls the US House of Representatives, where Republicans now hold a threadbare majority.
In North Carolina, newly empowered GOP state legislators took an aggressive approach with their map-drawing, crafting lines that are expected to allow their party to flip at least three seats now held by Democrats. But, in recently concluded redistricting in New York, Democrats, who had final say over the map, adopted a more modest position – essentially turning just one Republican-held seat a deeper shade of blue.
In the South, Democrats are expected to gain two seats as a result of Voting Rights Act rulings out of Alabama and Louisiana. But a protracted battle over the congressional map in another Southern state, Georgia, has not changed the partisan balance of the state’s US House delegation heading into November.
“It’s amazing that with all of the states where we’ve had things going on and with all the different lawsuits, we are really only talking about a small number of districts that are guaranteed to change hands as a result of this entire shuffle,” said Nick Seabrook, a political scientist at the University of North Florida and the author of the 2022 book “One Person, One Vote: A Surprising History of Gerrymandering in America.”
“We have actually emerged nationally with a pretty fair map,” he said. “I certainly think that there are ample opportunities for either party to win.”
Adam Kincaid, the president and executive director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, sees a “tick to the right” under the new landscape, with the likely net addition of two more House seats that former President Donald Trump would have carried in 2020. But he cautioned that it was still a “tight map” and a “tight electorate.”
“From top to bottom, the country is a 50-50 country right now,” Kincaid said.
(Although Republicans control the House by a narrow margin, under the map used in the 2022 midterm elections, 17 of those GOP lawmakers were elected in communities that backed President Joe Biden in 2020.)
Democrats, meanwhile, say they emerged in a stronger position after wielding the nearly 60-year-old Voting Rights Act to prevail in legal fights in deep-red Alabama and Louisiana. Federal judges ordered lawmakers in those states to give Black residents more opportunities to elect House candidates of their choice.
“Alabama and Louisiana are just two states once thought to be unreachable in the fight for fairness that have quickly become more representative” as a result of the legal actions, John Bisognano, president of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, said in a statement. “I’m confident the House map will remain highly competitive going into 2024.”
Here’s a state-by-state look at the recent redistricting disputes and where they stand:
Louisiana
Facing a court-ordered deadline, the Republican-controlled state Legislature in January approved a map with a second Black-majority district that is expected to be in effect for this year’s elections.
The action, viewed as a win for Democrats, endangers the seat now held by Republican Rep. Garret Graves.
The implementation of the new map follows a protracted legal battle over the state’s congressional district lines.
Although Black people make up roughly a third of the state’s population, Louisiana has just one Black lawmaker – who is also the lone Democrat – in its six-member US House delegation.
A federal judge threw out the state’s Republican-drawn map in 2022, saying it likely violated the Voting Rights Act. Republican officials in the state appealed to the US Supreme Court, which put the lower-court ruling on hold until it decided the Alabama case, which it did in June this year.
Once the high court had weighed in on the Alabama case, the legal skirmishes again lurched to life in Louisiana.
A federal court had given the GOP-controlled state Legislature until the end of January to draw a new map, after deciding that the lower court had ruled correctly that the state lawmakers’ map improperly diluted the voting power of Louisiana’s Black residents.
If the Legislature had not acted by that deadline, the lower court could have proceeded to a full trial to resolve the map in time for this year’s elections. A dozen non-Black voters filed a legal challenge to the Legislature’s map, arguing it was an illegal racial gerrymander, and a three-judge panel agreed.
That set off a fresh appeal to the US Supreme Court, which on May 15 paused the panel’s ruling in an order that will likely allow the Legislature’s map to be used in this year’s elections.
New York
Republicans flipped four US House seats in New York in the 2022 midterm elections, victories that helped secure their party’s majority in the chamber.
Then, a ruling by the state’s highest court appeared to jeopardize those gains by potentially making it easier for Democrats to pick up as many as six GOP-held seats.
In the end, however, the Democratic state lawmakers, who hold ultimate control of the redistricting process, settled on a map that made only modest adjustments to the status quo lines.
First, a bit of history: A state court judge oversaw the process of drawing the map used in the 2022 elections following a long legal battle and the inability of New York’s bipartisan Independent Redistricting Commission to agree on new lines. But Democrats scored a court victory last summer when a state appellate court ruled that the redistricting commission should redraw the map.
Republicans appealed that decision, and oral arguments were held in November before New York’s Court of Appeals, the state’s highest court.
On December 12, the Court of Appeals ordered the state to once again restart the mapmaking process. As a result, New York’s redistricting commission created a new map, but the Democratic-controlled state Legislature tinkered with the commission’s lines, as permitted under state law.
The Legislature’s final product ended up putting a Central New York seat held by Republican freshman Brandon Williams at greater risk for his party. It also shored up for Democrats Tom Suozzi’s Long Island seat, which the party flipped in a February special election to succeed expelled former Rep. George Santos.
Leaders of both political parties say they can live with the map’s modest approach, which still puts the Empire State at the epicenter of the battle for the House. But some progressives have criticized New York Democrats, who hold supermajorities in the state Legislature, for not taking a more aggressive approach.
Former New York Rep. John Faso, a Republican who had been a key player in litigation over redistricting, said the map drawn by Democrats “has no material differences from the current map.”
“This turned out to be much ado about very little,” he added.
North Carolina
North Carolina’s legislature, where Republicans hold a supermajority, has drawn new congressional lines that observers say could prove a windfall for the GOP and boost the party’s chances of retaining its House majority next year.
The state’s current House delegation is split 7-7 between Democrats and Republicans.
A map that Republican state lawmakers approved put three House Democrats in what one expert called “almost impossible to win” districts.
The affected Democrats were Reps. Jeff Jackson, who currently represents a Charlotte-area district; Wiley Nickel, who holds a Raleigh-area seat; and Kathy Manning, who represents Greensboro and other parts of north-central North Carolina. All three opted not to seek reelection to the House.
A fourth Democrat, Rep. Don Davis, saw his district retooled to become more friendly toward Republicans while remaining competitive for both parties.
State-level gains in the 2022 midterm elections gave the GOP new sway over redistricting in this swing state – Republicans flipped the state Supreme Court, whose members are chosen in partisan elections. Last year, the new GOP majority on the court tossed out a 2022 ruling by the then-Democratic leaning court against partisan gerrymandering.
A map that had been created after the Democratic-led high court’s ruling resulted in the current even split in the state’s House delegation.
Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper does not have veto power over redistricting legislation. A group of Black and Latino residents of North Carolina filed a lawsuit alleging that the GOP-approved map “intentionally discriminates” against minority voters in violation of the US Constitution.
Alabama
In one of the cycle’s highest-profile redistricting cases, a three-judge panel in Alabama approved a map that created a second congressional district with a substantial Black population. Before the court action, Alabama – which is 27% Black – had only one Black-majority district out of seven seats.
The fight over the map went all the way to the US Supreme Court – which issued a surprise ruling, affirming a lower-court opinion that ordered Alabama to include a second Black-majority district or “something quite close to it.” Under the map used for the 2024 election, the state’s 2nd District now loops into Mobile to create a seat where nearly half the population is Black.
The high court’s 5-4 decision in June saw two conservatives, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Brett Kavanaugh, side with the three liberals to uphold the lower-court ruling. Their action kept intact a key pillar of the Voting Rights Act: that it’s illegal to draw maps that effectively keep Black voters from electing a candidate of their choice.
The ruling reverberated around the country and affected the outcome of similar court cases underway in Louisiana and Georgia that centered on whether Republican-drawn maps improperly diluted Black political power in those states.
Given that Black voters in Alabama have traditionally backed Democrats, the party now stands a better chance of winning the newly reconfigured district and sending two of its members to Congress after November’s elections.
The new map also could result in two Black US House members from Alabama serving together for the first time in state history.
Georgia
Georgia Republicans, who hold a governing trifecta in the state, finalized a new congressional map last year that safeguarded their party’s dominance in state politics and dashed Democrats’ hopes of adding an additional US House seat.
The new map complied with an order issued by US District Judge Steve Jones to establish an additional Black-majority district. But it preserved the GOP’s 9-5 edge in Georgia’s US House delegation by moving the Atlanta-area district represented by Rep. Lucy McBath, a Black Democrat, farther into Republican territory.
Jones had ordered state lawmakers to draw a new congressional map by December 8, arguing that the Republican-controlled legislature improperly diluted the political power of Black voters in their establishment of district boundaries following the 2020 census. In that ruling, Jones said state lawmakers’ earlier map had violated the Voting Rights Act.
In a big win for Republicans, Jones in late December ruled that the new legislature-drawn map that preserved Republicans’ 9-5 advantage “fully complied” with his order.
A separate federal case in Georgia challenges the congressional map on constitutional grounds.
Florida
A state judge in September struck down congressional lines for northern Florida that had been championed by Gov. Ron DeSantis, ruling that the Republican governor’s map had improperly diluted Black voting power.
This case, unlike the Alabama fight decided by the US Supreme Court, centers on provisions in the state constitution.
The judge concluded that the congressional boundaries – which essentially dismantled a seat once held by Al Lawson, a Black Democrat, that connected Black communities across a northern reach of the Florida – violated the state’s Fair Districts amendments, enacted by voters. One amendment specifically bars the state from drawing a district that diminishes the ability of racial minorities “to elect representatives of their choice.”
But in December, a state appeals court upheld the map DeSantis had advocated, saying the plaintiffs “failed to present any evidence” that the earlier version of the district – which connected Black communities from Jacksonville to Tallahassee – contained a singular cohesive community that would have a right to protection under Florida’s constitution.
The case is now before the all-Republican state Supreme Court, where DeSantis appointees hold most seats. The disputed map appears likely to remain in place for this year’s elections after the court denied the plaintiffs’ request to speed up the case and hold arguments before the congressional candidate qualifying period in April.
In a separate case — centered on whether the map violates the US Constitution – a federal court sided with DeSantis.
Observers say that in the end, the outcome of the state litigation is more likely than the federal case to determine the future of the North Florida district, given the state constitution’s especially strong protections for the voting rights of racial minorities and the lower burden of proof required to establish that those rights were abridged.
Kentucky
The Kentucky Supreme Court in December rejected arguments from Democrats that a map drawn by the state’s Republican-controlled legislature violated the state constitution as an “extreme partisan” gerrymander.
The dispute centered on lawmakers’ decision to move Kentucky’s capital city – Democratic-leaning Frankfort – out of the 6th Congressional District and into an oddly shaped – and solidly Republican – 1st District. Doing so helped shore up the GOP odds of holding the 6th District, represented by Republican Andy Barr.
Under its previous lines, the 6th District was a more competitive seat. (Democrat Amy McGrath came within 3 points of beating Barr in 2018; last year, Barr won a sixth term under the new lines by 29 points.)
A lower-court judge had ruled that the Republican-drawn map did not violate the state’s constitution, and the state’s high court, in a December 14 ruling, agreed.
South Carolina
A redistricting case pending before the US Supreme Court centers on the future of a Charleston-area seat held by Republican Rep. Nancy Mace, who made headlines last year for joining House GOP hard-liners in voting to remove Kevin McCarthy as speaker.
Last year, a three-judge panel concluded that the lines for the coastal 1st Congressional District, as drawn by state GOP lawmakers, amounted to an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.
The Republican lawmakers appealed to the US Supreme Court. During oral arguments, several justices in the court’s conservative majority expressed skepticism that South Carolina officials had engaged in an improper racial gerrymander and seemed inclined to reinstate the lawmakers’ map.
The 2024 elections will proceed under the current map, the three-judge panel ruled in March. The judges, in part, cited the delay in the high court issuing a decision.
New Mexico
Republicans in New Mexico argued that the congressional lines drawn by the Democrats who control state government amounted to an illegal gerrymander under the state’s constitution.
At stake: a swing district along the US border with Mexico. If Republicans had prevailed, the 2nd District seat – now held by a Democratic Rep. Gabe Vasquez – could have become more favorable to Republicans.
But a state judge in October upheld the map drawn by Democrats, and the New Mexico Supreme Court affirmed that ruling.
Utah
The state Supreme Court, in a case it heard in July, is considering whether it even has the authority to weigh in on map-drawing decisions by the GOP-controlled state Legislature.
Republican state officials have argued that the court’s power over redistricting decisions is limited.
Advocacy groups and a handful of voters are challenging a congressional map that further carved up Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County between four decidedly Republican districts.
Doing so, the plaintiffs asserted in their lawsuit, “takes a slice of Salt Lake County and grafts it onto large swaths of the rest of Utah,” allowing Republican voters in rural areas and smaller cities far away from Salt Lake to “dictate the outcome of elections.”

CNN,Donald Trump campaign manager shared posts in 2021 saying Trump’s lies caused the violence on January 6 | CNN Politics,"In the immediate aftermath of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, a number of conservatives and Republicans broke ranks with then-President Donald Trump and blamed him for the violence that day. Among them was Trump’s current campaign manager, Chris LaCivita.
In a series of reposts on X – formerly Twitter – LaCivita shared comments calling January 6 an “insurrection” that was fueled by Trump’s baseless election lies. Some of those posts have since been deleted from LaCivita’s feed, but CNN was able to review them on the Internet Archive WayBack Machine, which archives internet webpages.
On January 6, 2021, LaCivita reposted several posts that harshly condemned Trump, suggesting that even some of his closest allies once viewed the deadly outcome as a direct result of Trump’s lies.
In a statement to CNN, Lacivita said his likes and retweets on January 6 were not supportive statements.
“Retweets and likes are not endorsements. I’m focused on winning the election two weeks from now, and not distractions from CNN,” he said.
LaCivita’s shared posts included a statement on January 6 from former President George W. Bush, who expressed “disbelief and dismay” at the violent assault on the Capitol, calling it “a sickening and heartbreaking sight.”
“I am appalled by the reckless behavior of some political leaders since the election and by the lack of respect shown today for our institutions, our traditions, and our law enforcement,” read the statement by Bush that LaCivita shared. “The violent assault on the Capitol – and disruption of a Constitutionally-mandated meeting of Congress – was undertaken by people whose passions have been inflamed by falsehoods and false hopes.”
The post, which was shared on the evening of January 6, was later deleted from LaCivita’s feed.
CNN also reviewed a video showing a screen recording of posts that LaCivita liked on January 6, including one from Republican former Rep. Barbara Comstock of Virginia, who called for Trump’s Cabinet to remove him from office via the 25th Amendment.
“Twitter locked @realDonaldTrump for 12 hours. Now the Cabinet needs to lock him down for the next 14 days. #25thAmendmentNow,” Comstock wrote on the evening of January 6.
Although X has since removed the ability to view likes, a user whose tweet was liked by LaCivita confirmed to CNN that his post had indeed been liked by Trump’s campaign manager on January 6.
The 25th Amendment allows the vice president and a majority of the Cabinet to declare the president unfit for office, temporarily transferring power to the vice president.
Another post shared by LaCivita was a stark message from a Republican Senate aide, which John McCormack, then a reporter for the conservative magazine National Review, shared on X.
“Text message from a GOP Senate aide: ‘This is a disgusting tragedy. Someone literally lost their life because of a lie that Trump told, Cruz/Hawley capitalized on, and fringe media echoed. This is in no way shape or form sustainable.’”
Another since-removed post from LaCivita’s feed included a comment calling those who stormed the Capitol “thugs.” The comment from a GOP political staffer linked to a CNN tweet reading, “Pro-Trump protesters have stormed the US Capitol, where members of Congress were meeting to certify President-elect Joe Biden’s win.”
“They are not protestors. They are thugs,” the post read.
The shared comments by LaCivita, the top staffer for Trump’s quest to retake the White House this November, are notable as the former president in the closing weeks of the campaign has sought to recast the events that day.
On social media, Trump has shared unfounded conspiracies suggesting the riot was an inside job perpetrated by the federal government. He has also called the rally and events preceding it as a day of “love and peace,” and suggested that if he regains the White House, he will pardon January 6 rioters convicted of violent acts that day.
During a Univision town hall last week, Trump defended his supporters’ actions, claiming they stormed the Capitol because they believed the election was “rigged.” He continued to mischaracterize the day’s events, stating, “That was a day of love from the standpoint of the millions.”
Last week, on Truth Social, Trump also shared a post calling January 6 “the day the government staged a riot.”
The unfounded conspiracy theory that the federal government staged the January 6 attack has been widely debunked as baseless.
LaCivita, a longtime Republican political strategist with a career working on high-profile campaigns throughout Virginia and nationally, has served in the role of co-campaign manager for Donald Trump’s third presidential bid with fellow seasoned political operative Susie Wiles since 2023.
He first gained national recognition during the 2004 presidential election for his role in the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth campaign, the group that sought to undermine and attack Democratic nominee John Kerry’s military record.",2024-10-23
CNN,Supreme Court declines to intervene in Louisiana congressional map dispute | CNN Politics,"The Supreme Court on Thursday declined to intervene in a Louisiana congressional map dispute, potentially delaying the implementation of a new map that could create a district that boosts the power of Black voters in the state.
The brief order will come as a disappointment to critics who say conservative-led states are trying to stall court orders requiring new maps that would impact the balance of power in the House of Representatives next fall.
There were no noted dissents.
Liberal Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson wrote a brief concurrence saying she agreed with the court’s denial but that the decision was temporary and leaves open the possibility that the court could intervene at a later date.
In June 2022, a district court judge ordered that Louisiana’s map – with only one Black-majority district out of six in a state with a 33% Black population – should be redrawn with a second Black-majority district.
After months of litigation, the district court had scheduled a hearing slated to discuss proposals for the new map. But a federal appeals court issued an order canceling that hearing in order to give the state more time to propose new maps.
The NAACP Legal Defense Fund asked the justices to lift that order, but they declined to do so on Thursday.
The case is one of several that has come before the justices in recent months concerning race and congressional representation that could impact which party controls the House after next year’s elections.
The court previously ordered Alabama to redraw its congressional map to account for the state’s 27% Black voting population, which was introduced this month.
Earlier this month, the justices considered whether South Carolina engaged in impermissible racial gerrymandering.
Louisiana process
The Louisiana challenge is currently continuing on two tracks. The district court is seeking to remedy a Voting Rights violation, while a federal appeals court is already considering whether to put that ruling on hold.
In August, the district court judge overseeing the case ordered a hearing for early October in order to select a new congressional map in the state. It came after expansive discovery and a five-day preliminary injunction hearing. While the state chose not to propose new remedial maps, the challengers, including the NAACP-LDF, proposed their own. At the hearing the court was expected to select a new map.
But Republican officials went to a federal appeals court asking for a delay. The panel of judges on the appeals court agreed to delay the hearing, holding that the state hadn’t had enough time to propose new maps.
Lawyers for the civil rights group urged the justices to step in and reverse the order from the panel of judges on the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals.
“While the panel’s principal rationale for issuing the writ was that the Louisiana Legislature should be afforded an opportunity to enact a new map in compliance with the district court’s injunction, the Legislature has already had multiple opportunities to enact a new map and has not done so,” Stuart Naifeh of the NAACP-LDF told the justices in court papers.

CNN,Why these Republicans think voting against Trump could save the GOP | CNN Politics,"Michael Pesce is conservative in the truest sense of the word.
He speaks with an economy of words. He holds himself to a high standard but prefers not to judge others. He gets through tasks methodically, wasting no time or energy – even when enjoying his hobbies.
Pesce is a hunter, and Pennsylvania deer season overlaps with election season. Archery hunting is open now, with a rifle hunting period set to open in November. So Pesce stopped by the ranges at a state park recently to check his gear.
“Hunting season is starting,” Pesce said. “That’s more important than any election for a lot of people.”
First, several shots at the archery targets, where Pesce at one point used a dime to adjust his bow sight. Once satisfied, it was down to the nearby firearm area. Pesce set his target 100 yards down range, and set his .30-6 hunting rifle on its stand.
A few stalls down, two men were firing AR-15-style assault rifles. Dozens of shots, the empty shells piling up at their feet. Pesce quietly made note of how loud it was, then got about his business: just three shots to adjust his rifle scope, then two more to allow a visitor to test his aim and get a feel for the rifle.
Then time to pack up, taking even the empty shells Pesce recycles for new bullets. A Coast Guard veteran. A Reagan Republican. A Nikki Haley voter in the April GOP primary who will be a Kamala Harris voter a week from Tuesday.
Pesce’s conservative principles tell him he can never vote for Donald Trump. And they tell him he has to vote for Harris, to try to keep Trump out of the White House, even though Pesce doesn’t like surprises and does not believe the vice president has clearly laid out a governing vision.
“That’s the scary part,” Pesce said. “I am not voting for a candidate. I’m not voting for a policy. I’m voting against a candidate and policies, and not even all the policies. Just, you know, the unstableness. Some of the things he says are truly scary.”
Pesce is part of our All Over The Map project, an effort to track the 2024 campaign through the eyes and experiences of voters who live in key battlegrounds and are part of potentially decisive voting blocs.
In Pesce’s case, he’s one of the Republicans in the counties that surround Philadelphia who supported Haley in the primary even though the former South Carolina governor had exited the race weeks before. They’re voters who view Trump as anything but conservative or principled. In many cases, they believe Trump must be defeated again to shake their party out of his spell.
“If Trump loses, then I think Republicans will start coming back to what they were,” Pesce said. “Because they won’t have that radical right side. They won’t have the craziness and instability.”
It was our third visit in five months, and Pesce, true to his conservatism, has been consistent: He said in May he would vote for President Joe Biden even as he raised concerns about his age and took issue with some of his agenda. In conversations since the switch to Harris at the top of the Democratic ticket, Pesce has made clear he sees a duty to try to block Trump.
He recently traveled West through several states that are reliably Republican. Turning on the TV or the radio was different. He returned to Pennsylvania even more mindful that he lives in the biggest of the presidential battleground prizes.
“No one’s ever been through anything like this,” he said of the 2024 campaign. “Is this an election for Americans, or is this for those seven states?”
It is important to remember our project is anecdotal reporting; the voters we are tracking, in this case Haley primary supporters, are not necessarily representative of the full universe of such voters. Yet they still provide us with valuable and sometimes telling insights. And they live in places that will be critical to the final math of who wins Pennsylvania’s 19 electoral votes.
This time, we met Pesce at a state range in New Tripoli, which is in blue-collar Lehigh County. He lives a few miles away in Bucks County, which in recent elections has been the most competitive of the suburban collar counties that surround Philadelphia.
Those collar counties represent one of the crucial 2024 math tests: Can Harris hold or build on Biden’s 2020 suburban strength or will Trump claw back at least to his 2016 performance, when he lost the Philadelphia suburbs but by a smaller margin than in 2020? In a state so competitive, tiny shifts can make the difference.
‘American first, conservative second and Republican third’
Joan London and Berks County offer another glimpse at the battlegrounds within the battlegrounds.
Berks is still red when you look at election maps, and it is too far out to be considered a Philadelphia suburb. But as the suburbs grow and change, often the exurbs do, too. Still farmland, but more given up to homes and services. Still plenty of Trump signs, but in some pockets surprising competition.
“This neighborhood is becoming a lot like the Philadelphia suburbs,” said London, an attorney who was born closer to Philly, in Montgomery County. “This is a primarily Republican leaning borough, always has been. But when it comes to national elections, I do see more and more support for Democratic candidates.”
A walk down London’s leafy street in Wyomissing proves her point. No Trump signs but Harris signs on several of the lawns on her block.
Not her house. London’s lawn has one sign supporting a Republican legislative candidate.
But London is voting for Harris – the first time she will vote Democrat for president.
“Sometimes you have to say American first, conservative second and Republican third,” London said.
Her decision is a shift from when we first met in May. Then, London told us she voted in the GOP primary for Haley but then switched her registration to independent because she opposes Trump and what she sees as his dangerous populism.
But back then she said she would write in a conservative because she could not support Biden. She was even more firm in that belief just after Harris took over the ticket because she views the vice president as more liberal than Biden.
She had settled on Pat Toomey, a conservative former senator from Pennsylvania, as her write-in choice. Then she watched the Trump-Harris debate, and it stirred why, back at the age of 18, she chose to be a Reagan Republican.
“The last straw was what he said about the Ukraine,” London said. “When he said we have to have a negotiated settlement. … For someone who claims to be a conservative to say that was, in my opinion, outrageous. It’s appeasement. It’s dangerous.”
She slept on what that debate answer stirred in her. And she awoke a Harris voter because, like Pesce, she believes the only way to get her party back is for Trump to be defeated.
“I needed to vote against allowing him to become president again,” London said. She knows the polling in Pennsylvania and other swing states is tight and that Trump could well win.
“I don’t want it on my conscience that I contributed in some way to that,” London said.
London is reluctant to speak for others but believes she may have company among at least some fellow local conservatives.
“I was surprised by how many people came up to me and kind of whispered, ‘I feel the same way as you do,’” she said. “So I have a feeling there are quite a few private conversations that are occurring behind the scenes in Republican and conservative circles.”
It could matter if London has company. Hillary Clinton lost Berks County by 18,189 votes. Biden lost it, too, but by a slightly smaller margin: 16,841.
That 1,348 vote difference seems tiny, maybe insignificant, when you note that Pennsylvania has more than 9 million registered voters.
But ‘every vote counts’ is not a cliché in the battlegrounds: Trump’s winning margin here in 2016 was just 44,292; Biden’s in 2020 was 81,660.
Never Trump, but not yet Harris
Cynthia Sabatini is another Haley voter who now factors into the battleground math.
She lives in Media, in suburban Delaware County.
Sabatini is a registered Republican but she has never voted for Trump. And she says she never will.
“Trump is a non starter for me,” she said in a recent interview at home.
But she is not sold on Harris, either, and her questions track what we hear from a lot of voters in our travels, even committed supporters of the vice president.
“I don’t know who she is,” Sabatini said. “I really don’t. Because she had different positions than she does now. But she continues to say they are within her value system. So connect the dots for me.”
What can Harris do to win her vote in these final days?
“You need to answer questions on point,” Sabatini said. “You need to provide more details about your economic plan. You need to provide more details about your vision for this country.”
Sabatini wrote in a Republican senator in 2016 when Trump won Pennsylvania. She voted for Biden in 2020. She is well aware of the 2024 math, and friends voting for Harris aren’t shy about reminding her how critical it is for the vice president to get big margins in the suburbs.
“I don’t care what they personally think about that,” Sabatini said. “I don’t want to be forced into making a decision between one of the two.”
She meditates frequently, sometimes twice a day, and says it can clear the mind for tough choices.
As she ponders hers, she shares this: “I think Trump is going to win.” That, she said, is based on betting lines, not the polls.
Sabatini does not want Trump back in the White House. She has a mail-in ballot and plans to drop it off on Election Day. Her decision could come as late as that morning.
She will make it according to her beliefs: Either Harris will win her over or she will cast another write in, with Haley her leading choice if it comes to that.
“The lion’s share of my friends are Democrats,” she said. “They think at the 11th hour people will have such reservations about Trump that it will cause them to vote for Harris. I don’t see it that way.”",2024-10-26

CNN,Fact check: Trump makes at least 11 false claims in foreign policy interview | CNN Politics,"Former President Donald Trump did a Monday interview focused on foreign policy. And he repeated a bunch of his regular false claims on that subject and others – while sprinkling in some new inaccuracy for good measure – making at least 11 false claims in all.
In the interview with conservative commentator Hugh Hewitt, Trump also made an assertion that he has been to Gaza. Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt insisted to CNN that the claim is true, but she could not provide a single detail about Trump’s supposed Gaza visit, and CNN and other media outlets have found no evidence that Trump ever went; he certainly did not go as president. You can read more here.
Below is a quick fact check of Trump’s 11 provably false claims in the interview.
Terrorist attacks: Trump repeated his false claim that “we didn’t have one terrorist attack” during his presidency. There were multiple terrorist attacks during his presidency, including some he has spoken about himself.
The defeat of ISIS: Trump repeated his false claim that although others said it would take years to “get rid of” the ISIS terror group, “I got rid of it in a month.” Leaving aside the fact that Trump certainly doesn’t deserve sole credit, the ISIS “caliphate” was declared fully liberated more than two years into Trump’s presidency.
Iran and funding for terror groups: Trump repeated his false claim that Iran did not fund terror groups during his presidency: “They weren’t giving any money, because they had no money.” Iran’s funding for entities designated by the US government as terror groups, like Hezbollah and Hamas, did decline in the second half of his presidency, in large part because his sanctions had a major negative impact on the Iranian economy, but the funding never stopped – as Trump’s own administration acknowledged in 2020.
China’s oil purchases from Iran: Trump repeated his false claim that he successfully pressured Chinese leader Xi Jinping into ending oil purchases from Iran; Trump claimed, “He said, ‘I’ll pass.’ He passed. Everybody passed. They did no business.” China’s oil purchases from Iran briefly plummeted in 2019, but they never stopped, and they quickly rebounded while Trump was still president – back up to hundreds of thousands of barrels per day.
Nuclear weapons: Repeating a false claim he made during his presidency, Trump said, “I rebuilt our entire nuclear force.” He simply did not do so, though he did undertake efforts to modernize the US arsenal. “Long story short: then, as now, Trump’s nuclear braggadocio is utter fantasy, wholly divorced from reality,” said Stephen Schwartz, an independent expert on US nuclear weapons policy. “And not only did he not rebuild ‘our entire nuclear force,’ on his watch the total operational nuclear stockpile of warheads and bombs actually decreased by about 100 weapons!”
Global warming and sea levels: Trump delivered another version of his usual false claim about global warming, minimizing the threat by saying it will cause the ocean to rise merely “1/8th of an inch in the next 500 years.” Sea levels are currently rising more than an eighth of an inch per year.
Harris, immigrants and crime: Trump repeated his false claim that Vice President Kamala Harris, his opponent in the presidential election, let in 13,000 murderers and 425,000 criminals over the border. The statistics he was referring to are not specifically about people who entered the country during the Biden-Harris administration; rather, they cover numerous presidential administrations, including his own, over the span of decades – “over the past 40 years or more,” the Department of Homeland Security said in a September statement to CNN. You can read more here.
Pelosi and a stock sale: Trump falsely claimed that the former speaker of the House, Rep. Nancy Pelosi, sold stock in Visa “the day before the lawsuit” that was filed against the company by the Justice Department in September. An official disclosure shows the stock was actually sold by Pelosi’s husband more than two and a half months before the Justice Department filed the lawsuit.
Biden and foreign income: Trump repeated his false claim that President Joe Biden “gets a lot of money from China, or he got a lot of money from China, tremendous amount of money.” After years of investigation by House Republicans, there is still no evidence Biden has received any payments from China.
Chris Wallace in 2020: Trump repeated his false claim that journalist Chris Wallace, now of CNN and formerly of Fox News, tried to stop him, during a presidential debate Wallace moderated in 2020, from asking Biden about a supposed payment from the mayor of Moscow’s wife (which actually went to a company connected to Biden’s son Hunter Biden, not to the president); Trump claimed, “And Chris Wallace wouldn’t let me ask. (Biden) couldn’t answer the question. Chris Wallace stepped in and said, ‘Well, we’re not going to be talking about that.’”
Wallace never said anything like that. As the transcript shows, Wallace interjected during this debate exchange to try to get Trump to allow Biden to answer Trump’s question about the money, not to stop Trump from talking about the subject.
Military equipment surrendered to the Taliban: Trump repeated his false claim that $85 billion in US military equipment was left to the Taliban upon the US withdrawal from Afghanistan under Biden and Harris. Trump’s figure is a massive exaggeration; the Pentagon has estimated that this equipment was worth about $7.1 billion – a chunk of the roughly $18.6 billion worth of equipment provided to Afghan forces between 2005 and 2021.

CNN,Trump ally Mike Johnson elected House speaker three weeks after McCarthy ouster | CNN Politics,"The Republican-led House elected Rep. Mike Johnson as the new House speaker on Wednesday – a major leadership change that comes three weeks after the historic ouster of Kevin McCarthy. Johnson, a vocal supporter of former President Donald Trump and a key congressional figure in the failed efforts to overturn the 2020 election, will now take the reins of the bitterly divided House Republican majority and faces the looming threat of a government shutdown next month.
Johnson’s elevation puts an end to the paralysis the House had been stuck in after McCarthy was pushed out by hardline conservatives – an unprecedented move that plunged the chamber into uncharted territory. Republicans tried and failed three separate times to coalesce behind a new speaker nominee before ultimately uniting around Johnson, a conservative lawmaker who has so far had a relatively low profile on the national stage. In a remarkable show of unity following weeks of fierce GOP infighting, the Louisiana Republican was elected with 220 votes and no Republican defections.
The new speaker will now face a litany of pressing issues. Government funding is set to expire on November 17, and the GOP-controlled House will need to work with the Democratic-led Senate to avert a shutdown, setting up an early leadership test for Johnson. Lawmakers must also decide whether to send further aid to Ukraine as it fights a war against Russian aggression as well as aid to Israel in its war against Hamas. There is widespread bipartisan support for aid to Israel, but many House Republicans are opposed to sending additional aid to Ukraine.
Hours after the speaker election, the House passed a resolution in support of Israel in its war against Hamas. The measure passed with overwhelming bipartisan support by a vote of 412 to 10.
Johnson, fresh off his victory on the House floor, said he will pursue an “aggressive schedule” in the weeks ahead and alluded to the chaos that had paralyzed the House and distracted from the GOP agenda.
“You’re going to see an aggressive schedule in the days and weeks ahead. You’re gonna see Congress working as hard as it’s ever worked and we are going to deliver for the American people,” he said.
“We’ve gone through a little bit of suffering. We’ve gone through a little bit of character building, and you know what has produced more strength, more perseverance and a lot of hope, and that’s what we’re about to deliver to the American people,” he said.
Johnson was first elected to the House in 2016 and has previously served as vice chairman of the House Republican Conference. A Trump ally, he supported objections to Electoral College results when Congress met to certify Joe Biden’s presidential win on January 6, 2021 – the day a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol seeking to overturn the results of the election. He also lobbied fellow House Republicans to support a Texas lawsuit seeking to overturn the election. A reporter was loudly booed by House GOP members for asking Johnson after he became the speaker-designate if he stands by his decision to support overturning the election.
New speaker takes over following weeks of chaos
The fight for the speaker’s gavel has opened new rifts among House Republicans and deepened old ones. Republicans rallied around Johnson in a display of unity, but it remains to be seen how long that will hold.
Johnson secured the nomination for the speakership late Tuesday evening in a vote that capped off a chaotic day that started with Republicans picking Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer to be their latest nominee only for him to drop out hours later after facing stiff resistance from the right flank of the conference and a rebuke from Trump. After winning the party nomination, Emmer faced swift opposition from the right flank of his conference as well as a rebuke from Trump. In a post on Truth Social, Trump called Emmer a “Globalist RINO,” and said that voting for him “would be a tragic mistake.”
Emmer was the third Republican to win the GOP nomination only to then exit the race after failing to lock up the necessary votes to win the gavel, following Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and Steve Scalise also of Louisiana.
Jordan, who is known as Trump ally and a fierce conservative agitator, took his fight for the speakership to the House floor in a bid to put members on the record – but failed to secure the gavel in three separate rounds of voting that saw him lose more support with each ballot.
Some Republicans who opposed Jordan decried what they described as a pressure campaign against them by allies of the Ohio Republican. And several Republicans who opposed Jordan’s speakership bid said they experienced angry calls, menacing messages and even death threats since casting their votes. Jordan condemned the threats.
Even as he faced stiff resistance, Jordan vowed repeatedly to continue his fight. But after his third failed floor vote, the House GOP conference voted internally to push him out of the race in a dramatic turn of events. Jordan’s failure to win the gavel highlighted the limits of Trump’s influence in the speaker’s race after the former president endorsed Jordan.
As Republicans failed to coalesce around successive candidates, frustration and tensions within the conference intensified and frequently spilled out into public view as members lamented the impasse and questioned whether anyone could secure enough support to win the gavel given the GOP’s narrow majority.
Johnson emerges as new GOP leader
Johnson has a background as a staunch conservative Republican and an ardent Trump supporter.
After the election was called in favor of Joe Biden on November 7, 2020, Johnson posted on X, then known as Twitter, “I have just called President Trump to say this: ‘Stay strong and keep fighting, sir! The nation is depending upon your resolve. We must exhaust every available legal remedy to restore Americans’ trust in the fairness of our election system.’”
Johnson serves on the Judiciary Committee and the Armed Services Committee. He is also a former chair of the Republican Study Committee.
As CNN’s KFILE has reported, Johnson has a history of harsh anti-gay language from his time as an attorney for a socially conservative legal group in the mid-2000s.
In editorials that ran in his local Shreveport, Louisiana, paper, The Times, Johnson called homosexuality an “inherently unnatural” and “dangerous lifestyle” that would lead to legalized pedophilia and possibly even destroy “the entire democratic system.”
In another editorial, he wrote, “Your race, creed, and sex are what you are, while homosexuality and cross-dressing are things you do. This is a free country, but we don’t give special protections for every person’s bizarre choices.”
At the time, Johnson was an attorney and spokesman for Alliance Defense Fund, known today as Alliance Defending Freedom, where he also authored his opposition to the Supreme Court ruling in Lawrence v. Texas – which overturned state laws that criminalized homosexual activity between consenting adults.
In 2022, Johnson also introduced a bill that some have described as a national version of what critics have called Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay” bill.

CNN,CNN Poll: Most voters don’t think Trump will concede if he loses the 2024 election | CNN Politics,"Most voters think former President Donald Trump will not concede if he loses the 2024 presidential election, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS, with a sizable minority of his backers saying losing candidates have no obligation to do so. And should legal challenges related to the election find their way to the Supreme Court, a majority of all voters has little or no confidence in the high court to make the right decisions.
Overall, just 30% of registered voters think Trump will accept the results of the election and concede if he loses, while 73% say that Vice President Kamala Harris would accept an election loss.
Most registered voters (54%) believe that Harris would concede if she lost and that Trump would not, while 18% say that both candidates would do so, 15% that neither of them would, and only 11% that Harris would not concede but Trump would.
Homing in on each candidate’s supporters, a near-universal 97% of Harris supporters expect her to concede if she loses, while a much smaller 57% majority of Trump’s supporters believe he would acknowledge a loss.
That 57% represents an uptick from July, when just half of Trump’s supporters thought he would concede a loss – a shift that comes even as his campaign has laid the groundwork to weaken confidence in America’s election system and claim victory regardless of the results in November.
Harris supporters are broadly unified in their perceptions of what the candidates would do: More than 9 in 10 Harris supporters say that she would concede, but that Trump would not (92%).
Most Trump supporters think both candidates would handle the situation the same way, but they’re split over which way that would be: Thirty-three percent say both would concede, 26% that neither would. About a quarter (24%) of Trump backers say the former president would concede while Harris would not, and just 15% that Trump would not concede while Harris would.
In general, the vast majority of American voters support the basic principle that candidates have an obligation to accept the results of elections, with 88% saying that losing candidates have an obligation to concede once the results are certified in every state and 12% saying they do not. But that rises to 20% among registered voters who support Trump, compared with only 3% who feel that way among Harris supporters.
A 56% majority of registered voters say they have just some or no trust in the Supreme Court to make the right decisions on any legal cases relating to the 2024 election, little changed from January. There’s a substantial political split, with Trump supporters roughly twice as likely as Harris supporters to express at least a moderate amount of trust in the court, 61% to 31%.
Trust in the court lags among younger voters, with just 8% of voters younger than 35 saying they have a great deal of trust in the court to make decisions on the 2024 election, compared with 21% among voters ages 65 or older. Black voters (9% a great deal of trust), Democrats (4%) and liberal voters (5%) also express minimal trust in the court.
The CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS online and by telephone October 20-23, 2024, among 1,704 registered voters nationwide drawn from a probability-based panel. Likely voters include all registered voters in the poll weighted for their predicted likelihood of voting in this year’s election. Results for the full sample of registered voters have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points; it is 3.1 for likely voters, and larger for subgroups.

CNN,"Elon Musk’s super PAC awards $1 million prizes to 2 registered voters, despite DOJ warning | CNN Politics","Elon Musk’s super PAC awarded two $1 million prizes to registered voters in Michigan and Wisconsin on Thursday, after being warned by the Justice Department that the payments might be illegal.
These are the first giveaways by the pro-Donald Trump super PAC after news broke Wednesday that the Justice Department had sent a letter to the group, warning that its “daily” sweepstakes might violate federal election laws against paying for voter registrations.
Musk, the CEO of Tesla and the richest man in the world, launched the sweepstakes on Saturday and his super PAC had named a winner each day – until Wednesday. No winner was announced then, but two winners were announced Thursday on X, the social media platform that Musk owns.
The group has not provided any public explanation for the apparent one-day pause, and a spokesperson for the super PAC declined to comment on Thursday. It’s not clear when Musk received the Justice Department’s letter.
A source familiar with the PAC’s efforts said Friday that “the program never stopped.”
Asked about the lack of an announced winner for Wednesday, the source suggested that it was caused by logistical challenges and not due to the Justice Department’s warning. The super PAC has been referring to the daily winners as “spokespeople” and has framed the $1 million prize money as a salary for their public pro-Trump messaging.
“The spokespeople the PAC selects are real people with real lives and sometimes they are busy. They aren’t going to penalize anyone for not being home when they try to deliver a check,” the person familiar with the super PAC’s efforts said.
Nonpartisan election law experts immediately raised concerns about the sweepstakes after Musk’s initial rollout on Saturday during a pro-Trump campaign event in Pennsylvania.
To win the $1 million prize, people must sign a petition affirming their support for the rights to free speech and bear arms. However, the fine print on the super PAC’s website specifies that only registered voters in seven battleground states are eligible to sign the petition – which experts said is the crux of the potential illegality.
Those controversial requirements have not been changed as of Thursday night and are still on the super PAC’s website.
Federal law makes it a crime for anyone who “pays or offers to pay or accepts payment either for registration to vote or for voting.”
Legal experts previously told CNN that they believe the main problem with Musk’s giveaway was making voter registration a prerequisite to entering the sweepstakes. The problem could be solved if the sweepstakes was offered to any American, regardless of registration status.
In response to a post claiming Musk was “paying to register Republicans,” the tech magnate said winners “can be from any or no political party and you don’t even have to vote.” He has also criticized Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a Democrat and former state attorney general, for questioning the legality of the sweepstakes.
Federal filings show Musk has given nearly $119 million – including about $44 million in October – to America PAC, the super PAC he helped form to reelect Trump. He has said he hopes the sweepstakes will boost registration among Trump voters. He recently hit the campaign trail in Pennsylvania, holding events advocating on Trump’s behalf, promoting his petition and spreading conspiracy theories about the 2020 election.
America PAC also received about $3 million in October from members of the influential DeVos family, including $250,000 from former Trump administration Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who quit in the wake of the January 6, 2021, insurrection.
These additional donations in October have enabled Musk’s group to continue spending tens of millions of dollars on canvassing and field operations in key battleground states, helping the Trump campaign keep pace with Kamala Harris’ record-breaking fundraising and massive campaign spending.

CNN,How voter purge disputes have fueled the GOP ‘narrative’ of noncitizen voting | CNN Politics,"The letter that Jona Hilario, a mother of two in Columbus, received this summer from the Ohio secretary of state’s office came as a surprise. It warned she could face a potential felony charge if she voted because, although she’s a registered voter, documents at the state’s motor vehicle department indicated she was not a US citizen.
But Hilario – who immigrated to the US from the Philippines two decades ago and now works to empower Asian and Pacific Islanders in her community – was naturalized in 2022; she just had not renewed her driver’s license since 2021. So, she had to submit proof of her citizenship to remain on the voter rolls ahead of the November election.
“You feel like a second-class citizen,” Hilario told CNN in an interview. “It makes me really just upset and angry. I became a citizen because I wanted to be able to have a voice in this process.”
The episode underscores the perils of a wide-ranging campaign by Republican officials and conservative groups to highlight voting by noncitizens – a problem that voting experts say is virtually nonexistent. The debate is raging from Ohio to Texas, and the US Supreme Court could rule as soon as Tuesday on a legal battle in Virginia over an eleventh-hour effort by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin to remove nearly 1,600 suspected noncitizens from the rolls ahead of next week’s election.
This issue is certain to transcend this year’s presidential contest. Next week, voters in eight states – including the presidential battlegrounds of Wisconsin and North Carolina – will decide whether to add language reaffirming citizen-only voting to their state constitutions. Twelve states have citizen-only voting laws on their books, according to Americans for Citizen Voting, which is pushing the constitutional amendments.
Republican officials around the country claim they have uncovered thousands of noncitizens on voter rolls and are filing new lawsuits alleging the Biden administration is withholding key information that allows them to verify that only US citizens are casting ballots.
But those claims have not always stood up to scrutiny, and eligible voters – including naturalized citizens such as Hilario – have often been found among those identified by Republicans as suspected noncitizens. Two thousand people had their registrations reactivated by Alabama officials from an initial August purge list of 3,200 suspected noncitizens after further investigation confirmed their citizenship – and that was before a court order reversing the purge program.
Voting rights activists who sued over Virginia’s purge program said that within a day of getting their hands on the list of removed voters, they were able to confirm that 18 of them were in fact citizens.
Courts in those cases, which were brought by the Biden administration and outside groups, blocked those programs because of a federal law that prohibits “systematic” purges too close to an election.
That hasn’t stopped former President Donald Trump and his allies from accusing a “weaponized” Justice Department of trying to let noncitizens vote.
Cases of noncitizens actually voting – which is a crime for federal elections – are extremely rare. A recent Georgia audit of the 8.2 million voters on its rolls found just 20 noncitizens who were registered to vote in the state – and that only nine of them had actually cast ballots.
“None of the issues that any of these states are raising are new because they are not actually trying to do anything to improve the accuracy of their voting rolls,” said Jonathan Diaz, director of voting advocacy and partnerships at the Campaign Legal Center, which has represented voters in the Alabama and Virginia cases.
Rather, Diaz argued, the recent flurry of activity in Republican-led states is “about setting up a scapegoat to point at if their candidates lose, and it’s about drumming up fear among the American people about whether or not our elections are secure.”
Ohio controversies
In Ohio – home to a hotly contested US Senate race – uproar has erupted over efforts by the state’s Republican secretary of state, Frank LaRose, to identify potential noncitizens on the voter rolls.
Naturalized citizens often get caught up in purges relying on state records or federal government databases because those can be outdated and not reflect a person’s current citizenship status.
LaRose, however, blames the federal government for not giving state officials access to data that he says he needs to definitively determine whether noncitizens are on the rolls. He recently sued the Biden administration over what he characterizes is a lack of assistance in vetting voters. Florida and Texas have filed similar lawsuits.
LaRose told CNN his office has identified more than 700 noncitizens on the rolls out of 8 million registered voters in the state and has directed local boards to remove them and, in some cases, referred them to the state attorney general for prosecution.
LaRose also has forged ahead with another controversial move: requiring suspected noncitizens to provide proof of citizenship at the polls before they are allowed to cast regular ballots – despite a 2006 federal court ruling that deemed that requirement unconstitutional.
Early voting already has begun in the state, and the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio and other groups have gone to court, seeking to block LaRose’s new requirement.
Asked about the conflict with the 2006 ruling, LaRose said a citizen-only voting amendment to the state constitution approved by Ohioans in 2022 compels him to act. “I have the duty to make sure only citizens register to vote,” he said.
Noting that laws enacted since 2006 also mandate photo ID to vote, he said that requiring the presentation of naturalization papers will resolve a quandary for poll workers who are presented with drivers’ licenses from voters that state they were noncitizens at some point.
Kayla Griffin Green, the Ohio state director of the voting rights group All Voting is Local, said her organization has been trying to gain access to the lists of voters flagged as potential noncitizens by the Ohio secretary of state and has alerted the US Justice Department to its concerns about LaRose’s recent moves. She said federal officials have begun making inquiries.
A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment Monday.
Griffin Green said she fears “this narrative that we have noncitizens on the rolls is allowing people to start calling into question whether the vote is accurate before we even get to Election Day.”
Scrutiny of purge claims
When courts or outside groups have examined claims that Republicans have found thousands of noncitizens on the voter rolls, those sweeping numbers have not always held up.
An investigation by ProPublica, the Texas Tribune and Votebeat into Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s claim that 6,500 noncitizens had been removed from the state’s rolls found that number to be likely inflated. The Texas secretary of state’s office had given the governor a much smaller number of people – 581 – who had been identified as likely noncitizens, according to the report, and the thousands others who were cited by Abbott were people who did not respond to letters questioning their citizenship. The outlets were able to confirm the citizenship of at least nine of those removed, having attempted to contact 70 of them.
In Alabama, the pre-election purge program was relying in part on state Department of Labor forms where a person checked a box indicating his or her citizenship status. Additional inquiry found that 93.8% of those whose form indicated noncitizenship had documents in government files confirming their citizenship, illustrating that confusing form design can cause people to make paperwork mistakes.
Six hundred of the 1,600 people Virginia had tagged for removal under its now-blocked purge program were flagged for checking the noncitizenship box on a DMV form there.
In both cases, federal judges ordered the reinstatement of anyone removed during the so-called quiet period laid out in the National Voter Registration Act, or the NRVA, which requires that states complete “systematic” list maintenance programs 90 days before a federal election.
Youngkin, the Virginia governor, rolled out an executive order demanding more aggressive actions to cull noncitizens from the rolls – resulting in the 1,600 removals – exactly 90 days before the election. US District Judge Patricia Tolliver Giles, when she reversed the program, said it was “not happenstance that this executive order intensifying these efforts was announced exactly on the 90th day.”
The state, which is asking the Supreme Court to intervene, says the program is not the “systematic” kind of purge covered by the NVRA, while arguing the NVRA’s quiet period does not apply to removals of noncitizens.
Trump and others have seized on the dispute to express outrage at the “weaponized” Justice Department and the “radical” judge.
“Trump: THE OCTOBER SUPRISE… THOUSANDS of illegals are back on the voter rolls!” a mass fundraising text message sent Saturday from the former president’s campaign said.
A Fox News chyron falsely described the decision as “Judge rules that suspected noncitizens can vote,” when in fact, under her order, letters will be sent to those affected by the last-minute purge program reminding them that noncitizens can’t vote, even if their registrations were being restored.
Also unmentioned was that a Trump-appointed judge in Alabama halted its pre-election purge program on same grounds. Alabama has not appealed that ruling.
Disputes over government databases
When not fending lawsuits challenging purge protocols, GOP-led states and conservative groups have filed lawsuits alleging that election officials are not being given access to government databases that would help them verify the citizenship of those on the rolls.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton said, when announcing his recent lawsuit against the Biden administration, that the state needed the data to confirm the citizenship of nearly half a million voters who lack citizenship records in the state’s databases.
The federal government offers a database known as the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements, or SAVE, to help states vet registered voters. But not every state has entered into agreements with the Department of Homeland Security to use that system. And using it requires specific identification numbers – such as a Social Security number or what is known as an alien ID number – that are not available for every suspected noncitizen on the voter rolls.
In letters to state officials, DHS leaders have declined to use another citizenship database that does not require those ID numbers for the purpose of verifying voters, arguing that it’s both too cumbersome and not accurate enough to be used for voter purges.
“Those bureaucracies don’t always speak the same language,” Jason Snead, the executive director of Honest Elections Project, a conservative group focused on voter policies, told CNN. However, he pointed to bureaucratic pitfalls of using government databases to verify citizenship as a reason states should require documents proving citizenship to register to vote.
Doing so would likely require cover an act of Congress, as under Supreme Court precedent, voters without documentary proof of citizenship must be allowed to cast ballots in federal elections as long as the generic federal form used for voter registration does not include the requirement.
The recent spate of lawsuits seeking access to the federal data will take several months or even years to resolve.
The timing of the lawsuits – coupled with the attempts at last-minute purges – have some suspicious that the Republican moves are aimed at provoking headlines and press releases that propel their campaign messaging.
“Everyone knows that the National Voter Registration Act says you don’t do list maintenance in the last 90 days because the risk is too great, you’re going to screw up,” said Justin Levitt, a Loyola Marymount law professor who noted that such programs inevitably sweep up eligible citizens.
“The fact that states were asking to do this, knowing that they couldn’t, shows that they’re not serious about cleaning up the rolls,” said Levitt, who served in the Obama and Biden administrations. “It’s about producing a press release.”
LaRose said the last-minute nature of his lawsuit is the result of the federal government recently denying his data request. He said he still will need access to the federal databases for future elections.
LaRose acknowledged that noncitizen voting and other forms of voter fraud are “relatively rare” but said he has a responsibility to act.
“It’s my duty as the chief elections officer of the state to identify things that could cause problems with our election, things that are causing voters concern and that we address those proactively,” he said.",2024-10-29

CNN,Misleading text messages from ‘voter mobilization’ group create confusion in key swing states | CNN Politics,"Thousands of voters in Pennsylvania received a confusing text message this weekend claiming they already voted in the 2024 presidential election.
“Records show you voted,” the message said, directing people to an official website with information about polling places and early on-demand voting in the state.
The organization behind the texts, AllVote, said the messages contained errors and should have told voters they had cast their ballots in 2022 and directed them to a link with information about voting in 2024. However, “in 2022” was left out, causing confusion. A spokesperson said the misleading text was followed by an apology message, though those who had replied “STOP” or marked the first message as spam may not have received it.
It’s the latest case of misleading or incorrect election-related information being disseminated by the group, which has been flagged by officials from across the country – including in the key swing states of Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, North Carolina and Arizona – as a scam.
“Voters should be more cautious as we get closer to the November 5th Election, as other bad actors may attempt to send similar phishing emails/texts,” the Pennsylvania Department of State warned this summer after voters in Northampton County received confusing messages from AllVote claiming there was an issue with their voter registration status.
AllVote – which, according to its website, works to “mobilize progressive voters,” by providing information on how to vote – told CNN it doesn’t engage in phishing because it doesn’t collect data or send out links that solicit personal information.
AllVote spokesperson Charlotte Clymer told CNN the organization estimates “several thousand registered voters were affected by our error” – referring to the text messages received by Pennsylvania voters over the weekend.
The texts, Clymer said, were an “unfortunate copy-editing error by staff working long hours,” and the organization has made its “approval process substantially more rigorous to ensure this doesn’t happen again.”
The controversy in the Keystone State comes just a few days after the Wisconsin Election Commission criticized AllVote over another misleading text message campaign. The group previously sent thousands of Wisconsin voters text messages that had a link to the wrong election website, leading to complaints to the commission.
The Wisconsin Election Commission reviewed text messages from AllVote that provided a link to “what at first appeared to be the voter’s municipal website but was incorrect,” the commission said. Meagan Wolfe, the commission administrator, said groups like AllVote often attempt to represent themselves as an official source of election information, and “voters should be very careful when dealing with this type of unsolicited outreach, as the information being put forth is often inaccurate and misleading.”
Clymer told CNN last week that about 15,000 Wisconsin voters received texts from the group linking to the voting website for the wrong municipality, out of 750,000 total voters they contacted.
“We take every step to ensure we don’t send voters incorrect information,” Clymer said, adding that “we never represent ourselves as election officials.”
Little is known about the group, its founders or financial backers. A super PAC by the same name registered with the FEC earlier this month but hasn’t yet reported any money raised or spent. Clymer declined to provide information about its funding.
Howie Stanger, who is listed as AllVote’s treasurer on the FEC filings, did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. Stanger is the founder of Pocketbook Strategies, which aims to support “progressive organizations who want to dream big,” according to LinkedIn.
If voters have questions or concerns about their ballot or the election process, they should consult official sources, said Philip Hensley-Robin, executive director of advocacy group Common Cause Pennsylvania.
“A week before the general election, with election misinformation and disinformation on the rise, we highly recommend that voters rely on trusted and official sources from state and county elections offices,” he said.",2024-10-29
CNN,Jordan hits campaign trail for House GOP as he looks to shed firebrand reputation | CNN Politics,"A lot has changed for Jim Jordan since he lost his speakership bid last October.
In the year since, Jordan has been traveling the country and trying to make inroads with colleagues who once told him they couldn’t back him for House Republicans’ top job. And if House Republicans lose their majority next week, all eyes will be on whether Jordan is prepared to challenge a sitting member of leadership to lead Republicans in the next Congress.
Recently, the House Judiciary chairman has hit six states in seven days as he works to soften his hardline image and curry favor with more traditionalists within the party after 17 years in the House, according to interviews with roughly two dozen Republican lawmakers and aides.
Jordan told CNN he is refusing to discuss his political future if Republicans lose the House, saying he remains focused on the extremely close battle to keep their majority. Even so, Jordan’s fans and detractors alike expect the conservative heavyweight to mount a bid for House minority leader if Republicans lose control of the chamber – setting up a high-profile fight as at least one other prominent Republican, Steve Scalise, is widely expected to vie for the leadership job. The GOP’s current leader, Mike Johnson, could also try to keep the top slot.
Perhaps the most obvious shift for Jordan is fundraising. The Ohio Republican spent years donating mostly small sums to party groups and, in at least one instance, in early 2023 before he ran for speaker, asking a fellow member to contribute a cut of a fundraiser he hosted for them, according to two people familiar with the efforts.
Now, Jordan is showing up to help with no strings attached. In the run-up to the November elections, he has helped numerous GOP incumbents who face primary threats from the right and he’s cutting checks for dozens of members in tough districts, including members who opposed him for speaker last year, such as Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska and John James of Michigan.
In an interview with CNN, Jordan credited his failed speaker bid with helping him to appreciate the dynamics that his fellow Republicans face in competitive swing districts.
“I got to know so many of my colleagues in the course of that campaign, and it was a good thing even though I didn’t win,” Jordan told CNN, speaking just before a political event for vulnerable GOP Rep. Jen Kiggans of Virginia — another one of the roughly 20 Republicans who opposed Jordan during the speaker’s race. He recalled promising his fellow members at the time that he “would do everything I could to help us keep the majority and expand the majority.”
If Republicans keep the House, Jordan said his only leadership aspirations are to keep his gavel on the House Judiciary Committee. But pushed repeatedly about whether he’d rule out challenging a sitting GOP leader if Republicans lose their majority, Jordan would only say that House Republicans won’t lose.
“We are going to win. You can feel it.”
Republicans across the conference are closely watching Jordan’s moves and said his trek to Kiggans’ Virginia Beach swing seat is further proof that he’s learned key lessons from last year’s ugly leadership battle. They say the one-time Freedom Caucus leader’s rebranding effort has won over some of his critics. Other Republicans told CNN they are far more open to him leading the party as House minority leader — a role that emphasizes attack-dog messaging over governing — rather than speaker.
“Jim is working pretty hard to mend fences,” said one GOP lawmaker who voted for Jordan for speaker last year and spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the early leadership jockeying. The Republican member said Jordan has “stepped up involvement in the last six months,” including sending out supportive mailers to help this member, and other conservative Republicans, avoid a far-right challenger in a primary this cycle.
Jordan’s team-player approach is a far cry from the last time he lost a leadership race and after his earlier failed bid against Kevin McCarthy for minority leader six years ago.
And if the House does flip, several Republicans said they believed Jordan would have a real chance of winning the post of minority leader. Unlike in Jordan’s ill-fated bid for speaker last year, he would only need a simple majority of Republicans to elect him minority leader. Other potential GOP candidates aren’t yet clear if Republicans lose the chamber, but most Republican lawmakers believe Scalise, the current House majority leader, will almost certainly run for the No. 1 spot. Johnson is the wildcard: It’s not clear whether he would attempt to remain atop the party.
Bad blood from the speaker’s race
Jordan would still need to overcome a feeling of resentment among some members from last year’s brutal race. Multiple members who voted against Jordan said they still remember how their offices were inundated with angry calls from his supporters and some of the nasty and personal threats they received.
Those outside threats were a key reason Jordan couldn’t win the gavel during last October’s leadership fight. In one meeting among Jordan and his detractors, he asked members point-blank how he could earn their support. One by one, those members — which included GOP Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart, Carlos Gimenez, Steve Womack and others — made clear they would not support Jordan under any circumstance, voicing frustrations about what they saw as a pressure campaign orchestrated by Jordan allies to convince them to vote for Jordan on the floor.
While Jordan and his team maintained they never encouraged those kinds of threats, members who were the subject of those calls have not entirely let it go.
“I think he did himself a great deal of damage in that there is a persona, the outside appearance, of Jim Jordan, and then there is the other side. He showed us the other side, and I don’t like it,” one GOP member told CNN. “Maybe this quest got the better of him in that occasion. I’m willing to look at that. But you know, the best indicator of future behavior is what you’ve done in the past.”
Other long-serving Republicans said they still feel stung by the weeks-long saga, where they argue Jordan dragged out the drama by forcing the House GOP to go to the floor for multiple rounds of ballots that he lost. That’s particularly true among senior Republicans known as the “old bulls,” who still question whether Jordan has truly evolved from the burn-down-the-house Freedom Caucus leader who battled with former Speaker John Boehner nearly a decade ago.
“Obviously the Freedom Caucus is always going to be a part of who Jim Jordan is,” said Rep. Kelly Armstrong, who has worked closely with Jordan for years but was elected to the House after the bruising Tea Party fights in the Obama era. “The people I know who are skeptical, I think a lot of it still comes from before I got to Congress. And you know what, Jim probably earned some of that,” Armstrong said with a chuckle.
“He hasn’t mellowed. I don’t think anybody would accuse him of being a cupcake,” Armstrong added. But he said Jordan’s bulldog-style of messaging — which resonates strongly with the GOP base — would be an enormous asset to any party in the minority, particularly if they’ll be working with a President Donald Trump.
“If Trump wins the White House and we somehow lose the House, who’s the No. 1 guy?” Armstrong said. “I don’t know anybody better.”
Jordan’s evolution as a party fundraiser
Republicans say there’s one other memorable exchange during last year’s speaker race that has remained on their minds this year: How far Jordan is willing to go to help the team financially.
During last year’s GOP candidate forum for speaker, Jordan was asked a question from Rep. Ann Wagner of Missouri about his willingness to lend his own fundraising skills to support vulnerable Republicans. His answer, according to multiple people in the room: It wasn’t his job to raise money for members in tough seats.
Some Republicans recalled an instance when members asked Jordan — with his powerful conservative credentials — to help them fundraise, they were told a portion raised would be expected to contribute to Jordan’s own fundraising groups. Jordan’s team said his fundraising groups were set up to largely benefit the House GOP campaign group, the National Republican Congressional Committee.
While it’s not entirely unusual for GOP surrogates to ask other campaigns to offset travel costs and provide a cut of the fundraising if an event is highly successful, some Republicans privately scoffed at a GOP chairman using that practice.
But since then, Jordan’s mindset on fundraising has shifted dramatically. Campaign spending records show his campaign donated to roughly 50 incumbents in the last quarter, including a half dozen Republicans who opposed him on the floor last year. And not all of that cash went to incumbents in tough races: He gave $2,000 each to safe-seat Republicans, Rep. Victoria Spartz and Doug LaMalfa, who both opposed Jordan last year.
He’s also contributing widely to GOP candidates looking to flip critical blue seats in places like Maryland, Michigan, Alaska and Virginia next month. And he’s not just building ties to incoming Republicans in swing seats: Jordan phones any Republican who wins a primary to congratulate them, according to two people familiar with the conversations.
While some Republicans pointed to Jordan’s substantial campaign chest — a total of $7.3 million on hand, according to the latest financial disclosure in mid-October — others have lauded his multi-million-dollar checks this cycle. That includes $1.5 million in direct cash transfers to the NRCC this cycle. Jordan’s team says the congressman has raised an additional $1 million for the NRCC through events and other means like direct mail.
It’s a significant haul this cycle. Over his career, Jordan has given or raised $4.2 million for the NRCC and Jordan’s team says the congressman has given $2.2 million directly to candidates during his time in Congress.
One Republican who opposed Jordan for speaker last year credited the Ohio Republican’s willingness to contribute to his one-time detractors.
“When he was asked, ‘Do you want to support these guys financially,?’ He could have easily said ‘f off’ but he didn’t,” that Republican said.",2024-10-29
CNN,A survey asked what Americans were hearing most about the candidates. One of the most common words for Trump was ‘liar’ | CNN Politics,"With time ticking down until Election Day, public impressions of Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have not fully coalesced around any singular enduring news story or political issue, according to The Breakthrough, a CNN polling project that tracks what average Americans are actually hearing, reading and seeing about the presidential nominees.
For the second week in a row, the lion’s share of attention from Americans was on each nominee’s activity on the campaign trail, found the poll, conducted by SSRS and Verasight on behalf of a research team from CNN, Georgetown University and the University of Michigan and fielded from October 18-21.
The top activity mentioned for the vice president was sitting for an interview on Fox News, while the former president drew the most attention – though not by an overwhelming margin – for swaying to music onstage for more than 30 minutes at a Pennsylvania rally and for speaking at the Al Smith dinner, a Catholic fundraiser in New York. By contrast, in 2020, the coronavirus pandemic overshadowed any other topic in the final month of the campaign.
The most persistent theme of the 2024 election may be mentions of words such as “lie” and “liar” in conjunction with Trump, who has made numerous false claims over the course of the presidential campaign, including onstage during his debate with Harris and in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene. Those references have ranked among the top two words mentioned about him for four consecutive weeks. The relative consistency around Trump is a departure from 2016, when the news recalled about him ricocheted among a series of different topics, while the single word “emails” dominated much of the conversation about Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton throughout the majority of the election season.
“Donald Trump lies about almost everything,” one respondent wrote in the latest survey.
While “campaigning” was a prominent topic for both Harris and Trump, what that means breaks down differently for each candidate. In the most recent week of data, nearly half of the mentions of campaigning for Harris related to interviews she’d given, compared with about 13% for Trump, who saw more attention on his rallies.
The economy has also emerged as one of the five most frequently mentioned topics for Harris in every week dating to mid-August, although the sentiment of those mentions – whether the terms and tones used are positive or negative – varies across party lines.
“I’ve heard about her wanting to better the economy,” one Democrat wrote in the latest poll, while a Republican wrote that Harris was taking “credit for the economy being strong when, in fact, the economy was strong when Biden/Harris took over and then tanked the economy.”
The poll also finds the level of public attention to the campaign remaining somewhat below previous peaks. While about 7 in 10 Americans said they’d heard at least something about each of the main candidates, respectively, that compares with roughly 8 in 10 or higher in mid-October 2020 and 2016 – and similarly high numbers in July of this year, during the weeks when Trump was targeted by the first of two assassination attempts and President Joe Biden withdrew from the race.
Overall, the sentiment behind the words Americans used in describing what they’d heard around each candidate remained more negative than positive – although the sentiment used in describing the news surrounding both Harris and Trump remains considerably less negative than the tone used to describe the final weeks of Biden’s campaign.

CNN,Analysis: It’s been 17 days without a speaker. Here’s what needs to happen in the House | CNN Politics,"A version of this story appeared in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.
It’s been 17 days since eight Republicans were able to bounce former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy from the top position in Congress and hit pause on all legislative business on Capitol Hill.
Having moved on from McCarthy and his No. 2, Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the third Republican choice, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, failed again Friday to perform the magic trick of uniting nearly every Republican behind him to get a House majority and reopen the chamber.
Jordan, by the way, was once labeled by a Republican former speaker as among a group of “political terrorists” for the way he thought they worked to tear apart Washington.
If Jordan ultimately can’t get enough Republican votes, some Republicans could join with some Democrats behind a separate option – giving interim Speaker Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina temporary power to pass legislation.
Here’s a look at what we know and what we can expect:
Why does it matter that there’s no speaker?
The House is essentially paralyzed until someone is chosen to preside over it.
A placeholder, McHenry, has the power to bring the chamber to order. But no legislation can pass until this is resolved. No government funding bills. No policy bills. To the extent that Congress is meant to address problems with legislation, that is not happening.
What legislation needs to pass and when?
First and foremost, the government essentially runs out of money in less than a month, on November 17. A speaker will need to be involved in negotiations with the White House and the Senate, both of which are controlled by Democrats.
There is momentum for a bill to give further aid to Israel after it was attacked by Hamas this month. And Ukraine is said to be running out of munitions, although support has dropped in Congress for continued aid to Kyiv.
President Joe Biden has asked Congress for a $105 billion package that will include aid for Ukraine and Israel.
What happened to the last speaker?
McCarthy was one of the shortest-serving speakers in US history. In order to get the job in January, he agreed to give any single Republican member the power to call for a vote to “vacate” him from the top spot.
That was his undoing. Far-right members were frustrated that McCarthy relied on Democrats to pass a short-term spending bill and avoid a government shutdown late last month.
McCarthy’s replacement will now have a month to tackle the larger problem of a yearlong spending bill before the government again faces the prospect of a funding lapse.
Does Jordan have momentum?
Jordan, the chairman of the House Judiciary, was chosen last week as the Republican nominee to be speaker. He got the support of a majority of Republicans in a secret ballot vote but not enough to become speaker. He’s lost three separate votes before the full House.
He can only afford to lose three GOP votes on the floor, but opposition to him appears to be growing, not shrinking.
Why is Jordan controversial?
A founder of the far-right Freedom Caucus, Jordan made his name as somewhat of a flamethrower on Capitol Hill. A 2020 election skeptic, Jordan was among former President Donald Trump’s most vocal defenders in Congress, fealty Trump rewarded with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in his final days in office.
That such a conservative lawmaker would be elevated to the top spot in the House speaks volumes about how the GOP has evolved in the age of Trump. Jordan earned Trump’s endorsement earlier this month when it was a two-way race with Scalise.
Jordan has also faced scrutiny over his position as assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University at the time that a team doctor, Richard Strauss, was sexually abusing male students. Some of the abused have publicly argued Jordan heard and ignored their complaints in the 1990s. The Ohio Republican has vehemently denied any wrongdoing or knowledge of the abuse. CNN reported on the issue in 2020.
Who once said Jordan was one of the ‘political terrorists’?
Jordan is among the conservative members whom one former speaker, retired Rep. John Boehner, described as “political terrorists” in his memoir.
“I just never saw a guy who spent more time tearing things apart – never building anything, never putting anything together,” Boehner told CBS News of Jordan in 2021.
Jordan told CNN’s Manu Raju he can unite the party.
“I think we are a conservative-center-right party. I think I’m the guy who can help unite that. My politics are entirely consistent with where conservatives and Republicans are across the country,” he said.
Jordan has used his position as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee to begin investigations into special counsel Jack Smith and Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, who are both prosecuting Trump.
What is the math?
There are 221 Republicans and 212 Democrats in the House. Subtracting two vacant seats plus any absences from the normal total of 435 members means 217 or potentially fewer is the current threshold for a majority.
Democrats are unified behind their leader, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York.
What happens if no candidate gets a majority?
They vote again. And again. And again, until either one candidate gets a majority or there is a recess.
If this sounds familiar that’s because it took McCarthy 15 rounds of voting and multiple days to build a majority of Republicans in January.
What happens during the vote?
The clerk of the House will gavel in the chamber and call a quorum. Democrats will place Jeffries’ name into nomination, and Republicans will nominate Jordan.
Then the clerk will call the roll and each member will state the name of the person whom they are voting for. If no one amasses a majority of votes cast, it goes to a second ballot.
Are members required to vote for either Jeffries or Jordan?
There’s no rule that the speaker is a House member. Members can vote for anyone, and they can protest by skipping the vote or voting “present.” The vast majority will vote for their party’s leader.
Is there an alternative to Jordan for Republicans?
Not at the moment, but it’s important to note that Jordan is far from their first choice. All but eight Republicans had backed keeping McCarthy, but because Republicans’ majority is so small, he lost his job.
Then, Republicans nominated Scalise, the House majority leader. But Scalise was far from a universal choice, and rather than work to change the minds of his doubters by horse-trading for their votes, the Louisiana Republican withdrew his name from contention.
Anyone will face a difficult task in unifying a party that includes far-right members such as Rep. Matt Gaetz, the Florida Republican who engineered McCarthy’s ouster, as well as 18 members who represent districts that would have voted for Biden in 2020 under redrawn lines.
Will Republicans revisit the ‘motion to vacate’ rule?
It was McCarthy’s decision to give any Republican the power to call for a vote to remove the speaker at any time. There are voices in both parties who want to see that power controlled. A majority could change the rules Republicans adopted in January.
Jordan has not taken an official position but made clear the first order of business is selecting a speaker. They can revisit whether a speaker should be removed at a later date.
What about the temporary speaker option?
This makes a lot of sense to a lot of moderates. Giving McHenry power until the end of November or the end of the year would allow lawmakers to pass government funding bills and give Republicans a chance to figure out who their leader should be.
Democrats have indicated they are open to helping the plan get the majority vote it would need. But details can be difficult. Many Republicans oppose the perception of working with Democrats in a sort-of coalition government. Democrats have not entirely endorsed the plan.
It’s been 100 years
In the 200-plus years since the first two-year Congress met in 1789, such floor fights have occurred just 15 times, according to the House historian.
All but two of those multi-ballot speaker elections took place before the Civil War as the two-party system was evolving. Back then, floor fights were routine.
Until it took McCarthy 15 ballots in January, a floor fight had taken place only once since the Civil War, exactly 100 years ago, when it took nine ballots for Rep. Frederick Gillett of Massachusetts to be elected speaker in 1923.
The epic record for a floor fight
In 1855 and 1856, it took 133 separate votes for Rep. Nathaniel Banks of Massachusetts to be elected, again by a plurality and not a majority.
The process stretched over more than a month and included a sort of inquisition on the House floor of the three contenders, who answered questions about their view of the expansion of slavery. Read more from the House historian’s website.
It’s also interesting to read about Banks; his official House biography notes he was elected to office as a Republican, an independent, a member of the America Party and as a Democrat.

CNN,Lawsuit to block Trump from Colorado 2024 ballot survives more legal challenges | CNN Politics,"A judge has rejected three more attempts by former President Donald Trump and the Colorado GOP to shut down a lawsuit seeking to block him from the 2024 presidential ballot in the state based on the 14th Amendment’s “insurrectionist ban.”
The flurry of rulings late Friday from Colorado District Judge Sarah Wallace are a blow to Trump, who faces candidacy challenges in multiple states stemming from his role in the January 6, 2021, insurrection. He still has a pending motion to throw out the Colorado lawsuit, but the case now appears on track for an unprecedented trial this month.
A post-Civil War provision of the 14th Amendment says US officials who take an oath to uphold the Constitution are disqualified from future office if they “engaged in insurrection” or have “given aid or comfort” to insurrectionists. But the Constitution does not spell out how to enforce the ban, and it has been applied only twice since the 1800s.
A liberal watchdog group called Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington filed the Colorado case on behalf of six Republican and unaffiliated voters. The judge is scheduled to preside over a trial beginning October 30 to decide a series of novel legal questions about how the 14th Amendment could apply to Trump.
In a 24-page ruling, Wallace rejected many of Trump’s arguments that the case was procedurally flawed and should be shut down. She said the key question of whether Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold has the power to block Trump from the ballot based on the 14th Amendment “is a pivotal issue and one best reserved for trial.”
Wallace also swatted away arguments from the Colorado GOP that state law gives the party, not election officials, ultimate say on which candidates appear on the ballot.
“If the Party, without any oversight, can choose its preferred candidate, then it could theoretically nominate anyone regardless of their age, citizenship, residency,” she wrote. “Such an interpretation is absurd; the Constitution and its requirements for eligibility are not suggestions, left to the political parties to determine at their sole discretion.”
Wallace also cited a 2012 opinion from Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, when he was a Denver-based appeals judge, which said states have the power to “exclude from the ballot candidates who are constitutionally prohibited from assuming office.” She cited this while rejecting Trump’s claim that Colorado’s ballot access laws don’t give state officials any authority to disqualify him based on federal constitutional considerations.
Trump already lost an earlier bid to throw out the case on free-speech grounds.
The current GOP front-runner, Trump denies wrongdoing regarding January 6 and has pleaded not guilty to state and federal charges stemming from his attempts to overturn the 2020 election. His campaign has said these lawsuits are pushing an “absurd conspiracy theory” and the challengers are “stretching the law beyond recognition.”
In a statement on Saturday, the Trump campaign criticized Wallace and her rulings, saying she “got it wrong.”
“She is going against the clear weight of legal authority. We are confident the rule of law will prevail, and this decision will be reversed – whether at the Colorado Supreme Court, or at the U.S. Supreme Court,” a Trump campaign spokesperson said. “To keep the leading candidate for President of the United States off the ballot is simply wrong and un-American.”
The 14th Amendment challenges in Colorado and other key states face an uphill climb, with many legal hurdles to clear before Trump would be disqualified from running for the presidency. Trump is sure to appeal any decision to strip him from the ballot, which means the Supreme Court and its conservative supermajority might get the final say.
In recent months, a growing and politically diverse array of legal scholars have thrown their support behind the idea that Trump is disqualified under the “insurrectionist ban.” The bipartisan House committee that investigated the January 6 attack recommended last year that Trump be barred from holding future office under the 14th Amendment.
The Colorado challengers recently revealed in a court filing that they want to depose Trump before trial. Trump opposes this request, and the judge hasn’t issued a ruling.",2023-10-21
CNN,"Who is Tom Emmer, the Minnesota Republican who withdrew from House speaker race hours after nomination? | CNN Politics","US Rep. Tom Emmer, the House majority whip who withdrew his bid for the speakership after it was thrown into immediate jeopardy Tuesday afternoon, has tried to balance an at-times moderate voting record while trying to appeal to the Donald Trump-aligned base of the Republican Party.
The move comes hours after the Minnesota Republican emerged as House Republicans’ new speaker nominee in the scramble to succeed Kevin McCarthy, who was removed from the role in a historic ouster on October 3. With a razor-thin GOP majority in the House, Emmer could only afford to lose four Republicans, and 26 voted against him behind closed doors. And despite a phone call with Trump over the weekend, the former president continued in recent days to post negative messages about Emmer on his Truth Social platform.
Several Republicans who opposed Emmer told CNN Tuesday they would not change their stance and called for a new candidate.
Emmer had recently faced criticism by the right-wing of the Republican conference for, among other things, voting for the bipartisan law to avoid a debt default and to codify same-sex marriage.
Perhaps most importantly, he voted to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election, a flagrant rejection of Trump’s oft-repeated falsehoods that the results were illegitimate.
But Emmer has a history of supporting the former president. In interviews and public comments, reviewed by CNN’s KFile ahead of the speakership vote, Emmer also refused to say Joe Biden won the election and bashed the press for calling the race in the wake of the 2020 election.
The Minnesota lawmaker was first elected to Congress in 2014 and became majority whip earlier this year. Emmer, who lost a race for Minnesota governor in 2010, was a state representative from 2004-2008. He sits on the House Financial Services Committee and is a former chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee.
As majority whip, Emmer has experience with keeping the GOP’s narrow majority in line. Republican Rep. Patrick McHenry, who is currently interim House speaker, told CNN in January that Emmer helped hammer out the negotiations between the 20 hardliners and the speaker’s office that eventually won McCarthy the gavel after 15 ballots.
McCarthy had backed the Minnesota Republican for speaker and urged the conference to elect him by the end of the week.
“This is not a time for a learning experience as speaker. Tom would be able to walk into the job and do it on day one,” he said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” Sunday.
Soon after McCarthy lost the speaker job, some members floated Emmer as a contender, but he quickly rallied around House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who later dropped out after the GOP failed to coalesce around him.
South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, told CNN earlier Tuesday that although he “didn’t agree with that vote,” referring to Emmer’s decision to certify the 2020 election, he he had not yet ruled out supporting him.
“Trust is something people are looking for,” Norman said, adding: “Tom’s honest.”

CNN,These are the House Republicans running for speaker | CNN Politics,"The high-stakes race for the House speakership entered a new phase Tuesday evening, with a slate of more Republicans vying for the gavel after Minnesota Rep. Tom Emmer withdrew his bid just hours after winning the GOP conference’s nomination.
The party is under intensifying pressure to find a new leader, though it remains increasingly unclear whether any Republican can get the 217 votes needed to win the gavel on the House floor.
After Emmer’s abrupt exit, the conference pivoted toward finding a new nominee, with five candidates in the running.
Members will cast a successive series of secret ballots, and the candidate who garners the fewest number of votes in each round will be dropped from the running. The winning candidate will still need a majority of the conference behind them, meaning that it’s possible the race for speaker might not be fully settled at the end of the conference meeting.
Here are the Republican lawmakers vying for the speakership:
Rep. Byron Donalds
The Freedom Caucus member from Florida, who’s among the few Black Republicans in Congress, first announced on X that he would seek the speakership to advance a “conservative vision for the House of Representatives and the American people.”
Donalds received votes from the GOP’s far-right members in January’s speaker marathon as a protest to Kevin McCarthy, who ultimately clinched the speakership after 15-rounds of voting but was ousted earlier this month.
Donalds is serving his second term, winning his first election to Congress in 2020 after GOP Rep. Francis Rooney vacated Florida’s 19th Congressional District. The Florida State University graduate worked in the banking, finance, and insurance industries before being elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2016, according to his office.
Rep. Chuck Fleischmann
The Tennessee Republican was first elected to Congress in 2010.
A University of Tennessee law school graduate, he sits on the House Appropriations Committee, where he chairs the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee, and serves on the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology.
Fleischmann previously supported Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan for speaker.
Rep. Mark Green
The Tennessee Republican has been in Congress since 2019. He chairs the Homeland Security Committee and also sits on the Foreign Affairs Committee.
A veteran and ER doctor, Green was a Tennessee state senator before winning his election to the House of Representatives.
Rep. Mike Johnson
The Louisiana Republican, who serves as the House GOP conference vice chairman, first announced a run for speaker in a letter to his colleagues over the weekend, saying, “After much prayer and deliberation, I am stepping forward now.”
Johnson was first elected to the House in 2016 and serves as a deputy whip for the House GOP. He was previously chairman of the Republican Study Committee, and sits on the Judiciary Committee, Select Committee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, and on the Armed Services Committee.
Rep. Kevin Hern, an Oklahoma Republican who chairs the influential Republican Study Committee, dropped out of the race for speaker Tuesday evening and backed Johnson.
“I want everyone to know this race has gotten to the point where it’s gotten crazy. This is more about people right now than it should be,” he said. “This should be about America and America’s greatness. For that, I stepped aside and threw all my support behind Mike Johnson. I think he’d make a great speaker.”
Rep. Roger Williams
The Texas Republican was first elected in 2012 and previously supported former speaker nominee Jordan.
Williams is the chairman of the Small Business Committee and serves on the Financial Services Committee.
Williams had previously said that he wouldn’t launch a bid for the speaker’s gavel. In an October 21 statement posted to social media, he said that it “wasn’t the right time” to run for the position.

CNN,House remains paralyzed with no end in sight for speakership battle after Jordan’s exit | CNN Politics,"There is still no end in sight for the high-stakes speakership battle after House Republicans ousted Kevin McCarthy more than two weeks ago.
The search is on for a new GOP speaker nominee after Rep. Jim Jordan on Friday became the latest exit from the race, and it’s already shaping up to be a crowded candidate field.
Frustrations and divisions have only intensified within the conference as Republicans search for a way to resolve the impasse. That, along with the GOP’s narrow majority, has made it increasingly unclear whether any candidate will be able to secure the 217 votes needed to win the gavel on the House floor.
The House, meanwhile, remains in a state of paralysis as Republicans struggle to coalesce around a speaker candidate, with the chamber effectively frozen amid the threat of a government shutdown next month and conflict unfolding abroad.
House Republicans are expected to hold a candidate forum Monday evening and more candidates are likely to throw their names into the running before then.
The showdown over the speakership kicked off earlier this month when a bloc of hardline conservatives voted to remove McCarthy, a historic move that plunged the House into unprecedented territory. Then, in the aftermath of McCarthy’s ouster, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise’s speakership nomination met a swift downfall when the conference failed to come together on his bid.
On Friday, Republicans pushed Jordan out of the race after he failed to win the gavel for the third time in a floor vote earlier in the day. The Ohio Republican fared worse in the vote than he had in previous failed rounds.
Here are some of the candidates now vying to become the next GOP speaker nominee:
- Rep. Tom Emmer, who serves as majority whip, said in a letter to his colleagues shared on Saturday that he was seeking the speakership with the goal of delivering “historic change.” McCarthy is backing Emmer for speaker, sources tell CNN, delivering an early boost for his candidacy.
- Rep. Kevin Hern told CNN on Friday that “yes” he plans to run for speaker. When asked how he plans to get 217 votes, Hern said he’ll work “hard” to get people on his side.
- Rep. Jack Bergman is running for the speaker role, his spokesman told CNN.
- Rep. Austin Scott, who launched a last-minute bid against Jordan last week, but quickly dropped out and then supported Jordan, is now running for speaker again now that the field is wide open, his spokesperson told CNN.
- Rep. Byron Donalds, a Freedom Caucus member, announced on X that he’s seeking the speakership to advance a “conservative vision for the House of Representatives and the American people.”
- Rep. Mike Johnson, the House Republican conference vice chairman, also announced a run for speaker in a letter to his Republican colleagues Saturday, saying “after much prayer and deliberation, I am stepping forward now.”

CNN,CNN Polls: Harris and Trump locked in close races in Arizona and Nevada as pool of persuadable voters shrinks | CNN Politics,"In the critical Southwest battlegrounds of Arizona and Nevada, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump run near even in the race for the White House, according to new CNN polls conducted by SSRS. The findings come as large numbers of voters report having already cast ballots and the pool of those open to changing their mind shrinks.
Harris holds 48% support among likely voters in Arizona, according to the poll, to 47% for Trump. In Nevada, 48% of likely voters support Trump and 47% back Harris. Those 1-point margins fall within each poll’s margin of sampling error, finding no clear leader in either state.
The surveys find voters’ views largely set on who would better handle top issues, while on a range of key attributes, neither candidate has convinced a critical mass of voters that they’re the better choice. Voters in both states have at best a narrow preference for which candidate cares more about people like them, shares their vision of the country or would put the country’s interests above their own self-interest.
The Nevada poll suggests little change in the state of the race there since late August, but in Arizona, the new results point to a shift in Harris’ favor. The new poll finds Harris improving there with core Democratic constituencies such as women, Latino voters and younger voters. The shift is notably concentrated among women, who now break for Harris by 16 points, while men continue to favor Trump by a 14-point margin.
Harris’ edge with women is a bit tighter in Nevada (51% support her, 46% Trump). That closer margin is largely driven by the relative lack of a gender gap among White likely voters in the state: Trump has a 15-point lead over Harris among White men (56% to 41%) and a 12-point lead among White women (54% to 42%).
Hispanic likely voters in Nevada split about evenly between Harris and Trump (48% support Harris, 47% Trump). Harris does hold a wide lead there among voters younger than 35, though: 53% support her versus 39% for Trump.
Independent voters in both states split roughly evenly between Harris and Trump. In Arizona, 45% support Trump to 43% for Harris, a 6-point improvement in support for the vice president since August. In Nevada, independent likely voters divide 46% Harris to 43% Trump, about the same as in August.
The Democratic nominees for US Senate in each state appear to have the upper hand. In Arizona, Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego bests Republican Kari Lake 51% to 43% among likely voters in the race to succeed retiring independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, and in Nevada, Democratic Sen. Jacky Rosen leads in her reelection bid against Republican challenger Sam Brown 50% to 41% among likely voters.
Further down the ballot, a vote in Arizona to establish a fundamental right to an abortion in the state’s constitution has broad support: 60% of likely voters say they would vote in favor of it, and just 39% would oppose it.
Both states have robust early and mail-in ballot voting, and according to the poll, 55% of likely voters in Arizona and 42% in Nevada say they have already voted. In both states, more registered Republicans have cast ballots so far than registered Democrats. In Arizona, that still translates into a Harris advantage among those banked votes (53% of those who say they already voted support her compared with 44% for Trump), but in Nevada, those who’ve already voted tilt in the former president’s favor (52% Trump to 46% Harris).
Though both candidates are making late campaign stops across Arizona and Nevada, more than 9 in 10 likely voters in both states say they have already made up their minds about who they’ll support. In both states, 92% say they are locked in, with 8% potentially persuadable.
Likely voters in Arizona and Nevada are closely divided when asked to weigh the importance of the candidates’ stances on the issues against their leadership traits and approach to the presidency, with just over half prioritizing issue positions (53% in Nevada, 52% in Arizona), and just under half leadership traits (47% in Nevada, 48% in Arizona).
Harris supporters across both states largely say leadership traits are more important (55% in Nevada, 54% in Arizona), while most Trump backers (59% in Nevada, 58% in Arizona) say they prioritize the candidates’ stands on the issues that matter.
In both states, the polls find now-familiar divides on which issues each candidate is more trusted to handle, echoing trends that have been largely consistent in national and state polling throughout the fall. Likely voters trust Trump over Harris to handle immigration (by a 14-point margin in Arizona and 15 points in Nevada), the economy (by 11 points in Arizona, 9 points in Nevada) and foreign policy (by 8 points in Arizona, 7 points in Nevada). Harris is more trusted on abortion and reproductive rights in both states (by 16 points in Arizona, and 21 points in Nevada) and also holds a 5-point edge in Arizona on protecting democracy, with Nevada voters about evenly split (46% trust Harris, 45% Trump).
In Arizona, likely voters are split over which candidate cares more about people like them (45% say Harris does, 41% Trump). But the vice president has the advantage as more honest and trustworthy than Trump, 44% to 35%, and, by a narrow margin, on putting the country’s interests above her own (46% say Harris, 41% Trump). The former president holds narrow leads on bringing the change the country needs (45% Trump, 40% Harris) and sharing voters’ vision of the country (44% Trump, 39% Harris).
In Nevada, likely voters give Harris the advantage on honesty (44% to 36%) and caring about people like them (46% to 40%), and call Trump more likely to bring needed change (47% to 41%). They’re about evenly split on which candidate would put the country’s interests ahead of their own (46% say Harris, 44% Trump) and on who shares their vision (44% each).
Roughly one-fifth of voters in each state say that neither Harris nor Trump can be described as honest and trustworthy, higher than the shares who reject both candidates on any other issue or personal trait.
In both states, confidence that ballots will be accurately cast and counted has grown since late August. Roughly 8 in 10 likely voters in Nevada (81%, up 10 points since August) and three-quarters in Arizona (76%, up 8 points) say they are at least somewhat confident that ballot casting and counting will be done accurately. That increase comes more from Republicans and Republican-leaning independents (up 19 points in Nevada, 12 points in Arizona) than from Democrats and Democratic leaners.
Despite those increases, Republicans and Republican leaners remain far less trusting of the ballot process than are Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents in both states. In Arizona, 69% of Democratic-aligned likely voters say they are very confident in the system, but that drops to 21% among Republican-aligned voters. The gap is even wider in Nevada, where 71% of Democratic-leaning likely voters are very confident compared with 16% of Republican-aligned likely voters.
Interviews were conducted October 21-26, 2024, online and by telephone with registered voters, including 781 voters in Arizona and 683 in Nevada. Likely voters include all registered voters in the poll weighted for their predicted likelihood of voting in this year’s election. Results among likely voters in Arizona have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.4 percentage points; it is 4.6 points among likely voters in Nevada.",2024-10-29

CNN,"Small number of North Korean troops are already inside Ukraine, officials say | CNN Politics","A small number of North Korean troops are already inside Ukraine, according to two western intelligence officials, and officials expect that number to grow as the North Koreans complete training in eastern Russia and move toward the front lines of the war.
The North Korean troops’ presence inside Ukraine goes a step beyond what NATO and the Pentagon confirmed on Monday, which is that roughly 10,000 North Korean troops are training in eastern Russia with some en route to Russia’s Kursk region. Ukrainian troops have held territory inside Kursk since August.
“It seems that a good many of them are already in action,” one of the officials said on Tuesday, referring to the North Koreans. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said last week that Ukrainian intelligence assessed that the troops would start to enter combat zones on Sunday.
A US official said the US can not yet corroborate reports that North Koreans troops are already inside Ukraine. The US has been playing catchup, however, when it comes to North Korea’s deployments — US officials did not confirm publicly that the troops were in Russia until weeks after South Korea first alleged it.
US and South Korean diplomatic and military officials are meeting in Washington, DC this week to discuss the deployment and North Korea’s “expanding relationship with Russia” more broadly, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Monday.
Separately, top Ukrainian official Andriy Yermak is in the US capital Tuesday for meetings with National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan and Secretary of State Antony Blinken. Yermak said he and Sullivan discussed the “North Korean soldiers whom Russia is preparing for war.”
South Korean officials also traveled to NATO headquarters on Monday and briefed allies on the North Korean deployments. NATO allies have been hoping that the intelligence spurs South Korea to begin providing military aid to the Ukrainians, which would be at odds with the South Koreans’ longstanding policy of not arming countries at war. But South Korea’s president has signaled an openness to changing that policy.
“While we have maintained our principle of not directly supplying lethal weapons, we can also review our stance more flexibly, depending on the level of North Korean military activities,” South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol said last week.
It is still unclear how helpful the North Koreans will be to the Russians on the battlefield. Many of the troops deployed are special forces, the sources said, and intelligence assessments suggest that the North Korean government believes their troops have more combat power than regular Russian troops because they are better trained and specialized, officials said.
But North Korea’s military has not fought in an actual war for over 70 years, and intelligence officials believe the North Korean government sent them in large part so they could gain combat experience.
Officials also expect that at least some of the troops will desert their units once they get to the battlefield, and that the language barrier with the Russians will be a significant impediment to conducting seamless operations. The Russians have been teaching North Korean soldiers basic Russian commands in training, like “fire” and “in position,” South Korean lawmakers told reporters on Tuesday.
Some Russian troops are already raising concerns about how the North Korean soldiers will be commanded and provided with ammunition and military kit and have wondered “what the f**k to do with them,” according to audio intercepted by Ukraine’s Defense Intelligence on October 23 from encrypted Russian transmission channels.
The intercepts also reveal plans to have one interpreter and three senior officers for every 30 North Korean men, CNN has reported.
‘The number may rise’
Many of the public assessments that have emerged on North Korea’s troop movements have come to light via South Korean lawmakers speaking to the media after briefings with the country’s intelligence services.
On Wednesday, two lawmakers – Lee Seong-kweun and Park Sun-won – spoke to reporters after a closed door briefing from the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). Their assessment was that North Korea had sent members of its elite XI Army Corps to Russia, which specialize in urban terrain and infiltration. But the DIA questioned such a unit’s effectiveness in the more open terrain of the Kursk region.
The DIA added that there was not exact information on whether North Korean troops have been sent to fighting positions, but there “is a possibility that an advance team may have been sent to the frontline,” the lawmakers said.
South Korean intelligence has put the number of North Korean troops inside Russia right now at about 13,000, higher than the US and the UK. The number could go up further — the US has already revised its assessment upward from last week, when the White House assessed that only about 3,000 North Korean troops were in Russia.
“The number may rise,” a third western official said. “Allies and partners across the globe are watching and consulting and will proactively share intelligence on the matter as it affects the security of the Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific regions and beyond.”
In addition to military personnel, North Korea has provided Moscow with 11,000 containers of ammunition consisting of around 2 million artillery rounds since last year, a senior NATO official told CNN earlier this month.
The US has also been urging China, which maintains a relationship with Pyongyang, to intervene and pressure the North Koreans to pull back, officials said.
Sullivan “directed the US government to engage the PRC and to organize an effort to get other countries to reach out to the PRC as well over our concerns about DPRK sending troops into Russia and the implications of that,” a US official told CNN, referring to China.
“We have communicated with the PRC about this matter to make clear that we are concerned about it, and that they ought to be concerned about this destabilizing action by two of its neighbors, Russia and North Korea,” Miller said.
Western officials are not optimistic, however, that China will intervene with North Korea’s plans, the sources said. China has continued to be a “critical enabler” of Russia’s war effort, according to the NATO official, and is still fueling Russia’s defense industry with substantial amounts of dual-use goods like microelectronics and machine tools that can be used to build weapons.

CNN,Analysis: How the ‘uniparty’ myth shut the House down | CNN Politics,"A version of this story appears in CNN’s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.
Republicans’ House speaker morass continued Tuesday with a little help from former President Donald Trump.
Yet another lawmaker with support from most House Republicans – Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, who was picked as their party’s nominee – failed to get the support of nearly all Republicans. He dropped out of the running Tuesday afternoon, leaving Republicans again back at square one. Late Tuesday, the GOP conference selected a fourth nominee, Rep. Mike Johnson, who faces a floor vote Wednesday.
Emmer, who supports military aid to Ukraine and who voted to certify the 2020 election, saw his chances fade in the most bizarre possible way hours after being picked.
Trump lobbied against Emmer with a social media post that hit while Emmer was trying to convince a few dozen skeptics on Capitol Hill and Trump was inside a New York courtroom facing civil fraud charges. Trump later told reporters outside the courtroom, “It looks like he’s finished.”
After one fired speaker and three failed candidates who got majority but not universal support, no one seems currently capable of uniting their tiny House majority – and the idea of getting help from Democrats remains, for now, unthinkable to both Republicans and Democrats.
A picture of parties divided
It’s a situation that highlights not only Republican divisions, but also the bright line between Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill.
But it’s important to note that it was born of a fringe protest meant to demonstrate there’s no difference at all between the two parties.
What is ‘uniparty?’
The term “uniparty” has been a favorite of people like Steve Bannon, the former Trump White House official turned podcaster. He’s been using it for years in conjunction with the similarly cynical idea of Washington as a swamp that needs to be drained or the belief in a deep state that needs to be rooted out.
Bannon’s goal is to mobilize support for dismantling the current version of the US government.
The term also features prominently in the more-conservative-than-Fox-News media environment – networks like One America News, known as OAN, and Salem Radio.
‘Guerilla war’
“Right now, we are governed by a uniparty,” Rep. Matt Gaetz, the Florida Republican, told the former Trump administration official Sebastian Gorka in a September interview on the right-wing Salem News Channel in which he argued then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy was in cahoots with President Joe Biden and the Democratic leader, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York. Gaetz posted the interview on his official House website.
“You’ve got a small band of House conservatives who are fighting, really, in a lot of ways, a political guerrilla war against that uniparty,” Gaetz said. In early October, it was Gaetz who moved to successfully oust McCarthy from the speakership.
The parties actually have very different priorities
It’s indisputable that government spending has ballooned in recent years and reasonably arguable that it is out of control. But blaming a perceived “uniparty” is oversimplified nonsense.
Republicans under Trump passed a tax cut bill all by themselves. Democrats under Biden passed a spending bill without help from Republicans.
Reforming costly programs seems impossible because the two parties rarely work together, not because they secretly collude.
If there is a uniparty, where is its speaker?
Multiple Republicans who supported McCarthy have argued Democrats are to blame for the current lack of a speaker because they did not break party ranks and support McCarthy.
There has been no substantive movement toward a unity speaker of some sort, although it is becoming hard to imagine any Republican getting enough support to become speaker without help from some Democrats.
The current math is that any Republican can lose the support of only four party comrades and become speaker without Democratic help.
Next funding deadline is November 17
Another lawmaker who voted to oust McCarthy is Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, who argued back in September that allowing the government to run out of money would not be that bad.
“Don’t let the DC uniparty scare you into thinking that a government shutdown is the end of the world,” Biggs said on social media in September, before McCarthy used Democratic votes to pass a funding bill.
This is a line of thinking that will get more attention, perhaps, when the government again faces a funding lapse November 17.
RELATED: The last time the government faced a funding lapse, just last month, CNN documented how a government shutdown could impact Americans.
Any potential speaker must find a way to both get the support of people like Gaetz and figure out how to fund the government in a little more than three weeks.
Emmer’s downfall is yet another cautionary tale. The majority of House Republicans backed Emmer, their fourth choice this year to be speaker, in both secret ballot voting and a behind-closed-doors roll call vote.
He had been working to convince holdouts when the post opposing him hit Trump’s social media account. For the fringe of the party, counts against Emmer include that he is a supporter of additional funding for Ukraine to repel Russia’s invasion. Foreign aid is a chief target of those who believe there is a uniparty.
A quarter of Americans don’t feel represented by any party
Politico noted back in 2017 that the term has roots on the American left, in the rhetoric of Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate turned Green Party presidential candidate.
While there is not much polling on the idea of a uniparty, there is a lot of polling about the two main political parties.
In a Pew Research Center survey published in September, just 10% of Americans said they saw “hardly any” difference between the parties. A larger portion of the country – 25% – does not feel either party represents the interests of people like them, but that sentiment is held by roughly equal shares of Republicans and Democrats.
Similarly, about a quarter of both Republican and Republican-leaning voters and Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters do not feel well-represented by their parties.
Interestingly, despite gripes about a uniparty by the Republican fringe, Republicans are less likely than Democrats to express an interest in more party choices, according to Pew’s survey.",2023-10-24
