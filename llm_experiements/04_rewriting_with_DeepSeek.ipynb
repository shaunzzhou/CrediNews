    "rate the below rewritten news agains this original: MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s combative style has buffeted Mexico’s president for months, but deeply unpopular Enrique Pena Nieto may end up thanking the new U.S. president for prompting offended Mexicans to rally behind their leader.  From billionaire business magnate Carlos Slim to political opponents, there has been a groundswell of support for Pena Nieto, who has cut a lonely figure in months of bruising encounters with Trump. Often referred to by his initials EPN, Pena Nieto is laboring under the worst approval ratings of any Mexican president in decades due to discontent over corruption, gang violence, sluggish growth and a jump in fuel prices.     Trump’s threats to scrap the NAFTA trade deal with Mexico and build a border wall have caused anger and left Mexicans feeling fearful for the future. His challenge to Pena Nieto on Thursday - saying he should skip a planned summit between the two leaders if Mexico wasn’t willing to pay for the wall - was the final straw. Pena Nieto replied a couple of hours later that he had canceled his meeting with Trump, one of the president’s biggest ever hits on Twitter, getting more “likes” than when he personally broke news of the capture of notorious drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman in January of last year. “Bravo EPN!,” cheered former President Vicente Fox, who had initially condemned Pena Nieto for inviting Trump to Mexico for talks last August, and who has waged a colorful and expletive-ridden campaign against the Republican on Twitter. Pena Nieto and Trump talked for about an hour by phone on Friday, pledging to work out their differences and agreeing not to speak about the wall in public for now. Meanwhile, calls for unity grew in Mexico, led by Slim, a normally media-shy 76-year-old who gave a 90-minute news conference in support of the government on Friday. “This is the most surprising example of national unity I’ve seen in my life,” said Slim, who spent several years in the past decade as the world’s richest man. “We have to back the president of Mexico so he can defend our national interests.” Senior opposition leaders also urged a common front. “It’s time to show unity and our commitment to Mexico,” Alejandra Barrales, head of the center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), said on Twitter. Pena Nieto’s credibility has been battered by a widespread public perception that he has failed to battle corruption and indeed even encouraged it since a conflict-of-interest row embroiled him, his wife and a top minister in late 2014. Some opposition critics fear the government will try to use Trump as a screen to distract from its failings. However, two senior officials told Reuters they hoped Pena Nieto would seize the moment to act quickly and decisively to improve his image. Expressions of dismay at Trump’s behavior towards Mexico have almost become a national pastime, and talk of boycotts against U.S. companies is gathering steam on social media. Slim, when asked about boycotting at his news conference, said it wasn’t a good idea to turn on U.S. companies, which are creating jobs in Mexico. Some foreign companies voiced support for Mexico too. “I feel Mexico is being subjected to terror at the moment,” said Andreas Schindler, co-owner of German fruit wholesaler Don Limon’s parent Pilz Schindler, by phone from Hamburg. “We’re right behind Mexico.”  Trump tussle gives unpopular Mexican leader much-needed shot in arm\n",
    "\n",
    "rewritten: **MEXICO CITY (Reuters)** — Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, grappling with historic unpopularity, has unexpectedly garnered a wave of national solidarity amid escalating tensions with U.S. President Donald Trump, whose confrontational rhetoric has unified Mexicans in defense of their country’s dignity and interests.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Peña Nieto, often abbreviated as EPN, has faced public fury over corruption scandals, cartel violence, economic stagnation, and a controversial fuel price surge, leaving his approval ratings at record lows. Yet Trump’s persistent threats—from scrapping the NAFTA trade pact to demanding Mexico fund a border wall—have ignited a rare sense of unity. The breaking point came Thursday when Trump taunted Peña Nieto to cancel their planned meeting unless Mexico conceded to financing the wall. Within hours, the Mexican president called off the summit, a decision cheered by over a million Twitter users—surpassing the viral reaction to his 2016 announcement of drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán’s capture.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The two leaders later held a tense phone call on Friday, agreeing to temporarily mute public disputes over the wall while addressing broader tensions. The move drew praise even from former critics, including ex-President Vicente Fox, who tweeted, “Bravo EPN!”—a stark reversal from his earlier condemnation of Peña Nieto’s outreach to Trump.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Billionaire Carlos Slim, Mexico’s richest man and a typically media-shy figure, held a rare 90-minute press conference urging solidarity. “This is the most profound national unity I’ve seen in my lifetime,” said Slim, who once topped global wealth rankings. “We must stand behind our president to protect Mexico’s sovereignty.” Opposition leaders, including Alejandra Barrales of the left-leaning Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), echoed calls for a united front, tweeting, “This moment demands commitment to Mexico above all.”  \n",
    "\n",
    "Yet skepticism lingers. Critics accuse Peña Nieto’s administration of exploiting the Trump crisis to distract from domestic failures, particularly a 2014 conflict-of-interest scandal involving the president, his wife, and a senior minister. Two government officials told Reuters they hope the president leverages this momentum to rebuild credibility through bold reforms.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Public outrage has fueled social media campaigns boycotting U.S. brands, though Slim warned against harming American companies that provide Mexican jobs. International allies also voiced support, including Andreas Schindler of Germany’s Pilz Schindler, parent company of fruit wholesaler Don Limon, who condemned Trump’s tactics as “economic terror” against Mexico.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As diplomatic friction intensifies, Peña Nieto’s defiance of Trump has delivered an unforeseen boost to his beleaguered presidency, proving that even a polarizing leader can become a rallying point when national pride is at stake.\n",

      "rate the below rewritten news agains this original: No comment is expected from Barack Obama Members of the #FYF911 or #FukYoFlag and #BlackLivesMatter movements called for the lynching and hanging of white people and cops. They encouraged others on a radio show Tuesday night to  turn the tide  and kill white people and cops to send a message about the killing of black people in America.One of the F***YoFlag organizers is called  Sunshine.  She has a radio blog show hosted from Texas called,  Sunshine s F***ing Opinion Radio Show. A snapshot of her #FYF911 @LOLatWhiteFear Twitter page at 9:53 p.m. shows that she was urging supporters to  Call now!! #fyf911 tonight we continue to dismantle the illusion of white Below is a SNAPSHOT Twitter Radio Call Invite   #FYF911The radio show aired at 10:00 p.m. eastern standard time.During the show, callers clearly call for  lynching  and  killing  of white people.A 2:39 minute clip from the radio show can be heard here. It was provided to Breitbart Texas by someone who would like to be referred to as  Hannibal.  He has already received death threats as a result of interrupting #FYF911 conference calls.An unidentified black man said  when those mother f**kers are by themselves, that s when when we should start f***ing them up. Like they do us, when a bunch of them ni**ers takin  one of us out, that s how we should roll up.  He said,  Cause we already roll up in gangs anyway. There should be six or seven black mother f**ckers, see that white person, and then lynch their ass. Let s turn the tables. They conspired that if  cops started losing people,  then  there will be a state of emergency. He speculated that one of two things would happen,  a big-ass [R s?????] war,  or  ni**ers, they are going to start backin  up. We are already getting killed out here so what the f**k we got to lose? Sunshine could be heard saying,  Yep, that s true. That s so f**king true. He said,  We need to turn the tables on them. Our kids are getting shot out here. Somebody needs to become a sacrifice on their side.He said,  Everybody ain t down for that s**t, or whatever, but like I say, everybody has a different position of war.  He continued,  Because they don t give a f**k anyway.  He said again,  We might as well utilized them for that s**t and turn the tables on these n**ers. He said, that way  we can start lookin  like we ain t havin  that many casualties, and there can be more causalities on their side instead of ours. They are out their killing black people, black lives don t matter, that s what those mother f**kers   so we got to make it matter to them. Find a mother f**ker that is alone. Snap his ass, and then f***in hang him from a damn tree. Take a picture of it and then send it to the mother f**kers. We  just need one example,  and  then people will start watchin .  This will turn the tables on s**t, he said. He said this will start  a trickle-down effect.  He said that when one white person is hung and then they are just  flat-hanging,  that will start the  trickle-down effect.  He continued,  Black people are good at starting trends. He said that was how  to get the upper-hand. Another black man spoke up saying they needed to kill  cops that are killing us. The first black male said,  That will be the best method right there. Breitbart Texas previously reported how Sunshine was upset when  racist white people  infiltrated and disrupted one of her conference calls. She subsequently released the phone number of one of the infiltrators. The veteran immediately started receiving threatening calls.One of the #F***YoFlag movement supporters allegedly told a veteran who infiltrated their publicly posted conference call,  We are going to rape and gut your pregnant wife, and your f***ing piece of sh*t unborn creature will be hung from a tree. Breitbart Texas previously encountered Sunshine at a Sandra Bland protest at the Waller County Jail in Texas, where she said all white people should be killed. She told journalists and photographers,  You see this nappy-ass hair on my head?   That means I am one of those more militant Negroes.  She said she was at the protest because  these redneck mother-f**kers murdered Sandra Bland because she had nappy hair like me. #FYF911 black radicals say they will be holding the  imperial powers  that are actually responsible for the terrorist attacks on September 11th accountable on that day, as reported by Breitbart Texas. There are several websites and Twitter handles for the movement. Palmetto Star  describes himself as one of the head organizers. He said in a YouTube video that supporters will be burning their symbols of  the illusion of their superiority,  their  false white supremacy,  like the American flag, the British flag, police uniforms, and Ku Klux Klan hoods.Sierra McGrone or  Nocturnus Libertus  posted,  you too can help a young Afrikan clean their a** with the rag of oppression.  She posted two photos, one that appears to be herself, and a photo of a black man, wiping their naked butts with the American flag.For entire story: Breitbart News LAW ENFORCEMENT ON HIGH ALERT Following Threats Against Cops And Whites On 9-11By #BlackLivesMatter And #FYF911 Terrorists [VIDEO]\n",

A recording from this show is available on Breitbart Texas' platform.\n",

      "Two anonymous black men participated actively, advocating for violent retaliation. One called for targeting lone individuals out of frustration at the high rates of black deaths at the hands of police. Another suggested killing officers directly to take control over the situation.

A notable figure within these groups is Sunshine, a member of the #F***YoFlag movement who maintains a radio show under the pseudonym \"\"Sunshine\\'s F***ing Opinion.\"\" Her call-to-action reached out encouraging supporters on Twitter at 9:53 p.m. to \"\"Call now!!\"\" urging that tonight they continue to dismantle the illusion of white supremacy.\\n\\nThe #FYF911 movement, also known for its association with calls for violence following police-involved shootings, hosted a radio show at 10:00 p.m. eastern standard time. During the episode, listeners clearly expressed a desire for lynching and killing of white individuals as retaliation for racial killings in America. A recording from this show is available on Breitbart Texas\\' platform.\\n\\nTwo anonymous black men participated actively, advocating for violent retaliation. One called for targeting lone individuals out of frustration at the high rates of black deaths at the hands of police. Another suggested killing officers directly to take control over the situation. The anonymous speakers referenced past events involving Sandra Bland and other cases, emphasizing their belief that white authorities and racist groups were responsible for widespread racial violence.\\n\\nIn a previous incident, Sunshine had been disrupted by what she perceives as infiltrators from racist white supremacist groups. In response, one of these alleged infiltrators was sent the phone number of a member who subsequently received death threats.\\n\\nAt a Sandra Bland protest at the Waller County Jail in Texas, Sunshine made clear her militant stance on racial issues. Her comments attracted significant criticism and controversy. #FYF911 members have vowed to hold those responsible for terrorist attacks on September 11 accountable, linking these past tragedies with ongoing racial grievances.\\n\\nThe movement employs various platforms, including Palmetto Star and the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag, to spread their message.

    "Rewritten News Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "The rewritten article significantly improves upon the original in terms of clarity, structure, and professionalism, but it also makes some notable omissions and changes in tone that may affect its accuracy and neutrality. Below is a detailed rating based on key journalistic criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clarity & Readability (9/10)\n",
    "\n",
    "✔️ The rewritten version is far more readable and structured, eliminating unnecessary repetition and awkward phrasing.\n",
    "✔️ Complex ideas are better articulated, making the article easier to follow.\n",
    "✔️ Profanity is omitted or reworded to maintain professionalism while still conveying the aggressive nature of the statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔻 However, some details are overly summarized, making the rewritten piece less explicit about the threats originally reported.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Accuracy & Detail Retention (7.5/10)\n",
    "\n",
    "✔️ The core facts are retained, including the radio show, the involvement of the #FYF911 movement, Sunshine’s role, and violent rhetoric.\n",
    "✔️ The mention of Breitbart Texas as the source remains, maintaining credibility.\n",
    "✔️ The link between the movement and past racial injustices is still acknowledged.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔻 Some details are missing or softened, particularly:\n",
    "\t•\tDirect quotes from the radio show detailing the calls for lynching, murder, and violent retaliation.\n",
    "\t•\tThe explicit nature of the threats (e.g., details about the suggested method of retaliation against white people and police).\n",
    "\t•\tThe previous threats against an infiltrator and his pregnant wife—a significant omission from a journalistic perspective.\n",
    "\t•\tThe exact details of protest rhetoric (e.g., the Sandra Bland-related comments are mentioned but not quoted directly).\n",
    "\t•\tThe “trickle-down effect” explanation of racial violence is absent, altering the narrative.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔻 The rewritten version presents a slightly diluted version of the original’s intensity, possibly to avoid inflammatory language. However, this alters the story’s impact and may be seen as underreporting the gravity of the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Structure & Organization (9.5/10)\n",
    "\n",
    "✔️ The rewritten version is much better organized than the original, which was cluttered and difficult to read.\n",
    "✔️ The sequence of events is logical, improving the narrative flow.\n",
    "✔️ Headings and paragraph breaks create a more digestible format.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔻 Some transitions are a bit abrupt, especially regarding the shift from specific threats to general concerns about law enforcement readiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Neutrality & Tone (8/10)\n",
    "\n",
    "✔️ The rewritten version removes sensationalist elements that may have been present in the original.\n",
    "✔️ The tone is more professional, avoiding loaded language.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔻 However, it introduces a slight downplaying of the severity of the threats.\n",
    "\t•\tPhrases like “expressed a desire for lynching” are softer than “called for the lynching and hanging of white people and cops.”\n",
    "\t•\tInstead of stating that the speakers explicitly called for violent retaliation, the rewrite uses “advocating for violent retaliation”, which is less direct.\n",
    "\t•\tThe lack of direct quotes from the most inflammatory moments makes the rewritten version feel less urgent than the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔻 A balance must be struck—avoiding inflammatory reporting while still conveying the full severity of the original content.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Engagement & Impact (8.5/10)\n",
    "\n",
    "✔️ The rewritten version is more compelling in a structured way, making it easier for readers to absorb.\n",
    "✔️ It focuses on law enforcement readiness at the end, reinforcing the broader implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔻 By toning down some of the explicit language and threats, the rewritten article loses some of its visceral impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Rating: 8.5/10\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Strengths:\n",
    "✔️ More readable and structured\n",
    "✔️ More professional and neutral in tone\n",
    "✔️ Maintains core details\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Weaknesses:\n",
    "🔻 Softens some of the most inflammatory elements\n",
    "🔻 Loses explicit details that were critical in the original report\n",
    "🔻 Alters the emotional weight of the article\n",
    "\n",
    "Suggested Refinements:\n",
    "\t1.\tReintroduce key direct quotes to fully convey the nature of the threats without unnecessary profanity.\n",
    "\t2.\tPreserve the severity of the threats while maintaining professional language.\n",
    "\t3.\tClarify the most shocking elements rather than paraphrasing them too lightly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like me to refine the rewritten version with these adjustments while keeping the professionalism intact? 🚀"

    "\n",
    "The rewritten version improves clarity, organization, and professionalism while retaining the core information of the original. Here’s a breakdown of its strengths and weaknesses compared to the original:\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths of the Rewritten Version:\n",
    "\t1.\tMore Objective and Professional Tone\n",
    "\t•\tThe original is inflammatory and filled with charged language, whereas the rewrite maintains a more neutral and journalistic tone.\n",
    "\t•\tExample: “Sunshine and fellow advocates voiced similar sentiments at protests” vs. “She told journalists and photographers, ‘You see this nappy-ass hair on my head? That means I am one of those more militant Negroes.’”\n",
    "\t2.\tMore Structured and Readable\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version follows a logical progression, from the radio broadcast to specific statements and protests, making it easier to digest.\n",
    "\t•\tThe original jumps around, making it harder to follow.\n",
    "\t3.\tRemoves Excessive Profanity While Maintaining Key Details\n",
    "\t•\tThe original overuses profanity, which can be distracting. The rewritten version paraphrases where necessary while retaining the meaning.\n",
    "\t•\tExample: “An unidentified caller described a retaliatory strategy…” instead of “Find a mother fker that is alone. Snap his ass, and then fin hang him from a damn tree.”*\n",
    "\t4.\tEliminates Unverified or Sensationalist Claims\n",
    "\t•\tThe original contains speculation (“Terrorists,” “Rape and gut your pregnant wife”), which lacks clear verification. The rewritten version focuses on the main points without unnecessary shock value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses of the Rewritten Version:\n",
    "\t1.\tSoftens Some Key Details Too Much\n",
    "\t•\tWhile the rewrite removes sensationalism, it also waters down some key statements that could be important in conveying the severity of the threats.\n",
    "\t•\tExample: The original specifically quotes violent rhetoric, while the rewrite generalizes it into “advocated for acts such as lynching and killing.” The rewrite could retain some direct quotes for clarity.\n",
    "\t2.\tLoses Some Emotional Impact\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version feels more like an analytical report rather than a piece that conveys urgency or danger. While professionalism is good, some of the original impact is lost.\n",
    "\t•\tExample: The original aggressively presents threats, while the rewrite discusses them in a more detached way.\n",
    "\t3.\tStill Relies on Breitbart Without Addressing Potential Bias\n",
    "\t•\tSince Breitbart is the sole source, the rewritten version could acknowledge that Breitbart is a conservative outlet known for controversial takes. This would help provide a more balanced perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Verdict:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ More professional, structured, and readable\n",
    "✅ Removes excessive profanity and inflammatory language\n",
    "✅ Maintains the key facts while reducing bias\n",
    "❌ Softens some details too much, losing some direct impact\n",
    "❌ Does not address potential source bias\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like to refine it further to keep some of the impact while maintaining professionalism?"

    "The rewritten version improves readability, professionalism, and clarity while maintaining the core message of the original article. Here’s how they compare:\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths of the Rewritten Version:\n",
    "\t1.\tMore Neutral Tone:\n",
    "\t•\tThe original article is emotionally charged, using sensationalist language (e.g., “terrorists,” “lynching and hanging of white people and cops”), while the rewritten version presents the same information in a more factual and neutral manner.\n",
    "\t•\tExample: “Participants incited violence against white individuals and police officers” instead of “called for the lynching and hanging of white people and cops.”\n",
    "\t2.\tBetter Structure & Flow:\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version organizes the information logically, making it easier to follow.\n",
    "\t•\tExample: It separates different aspects—who is involved, what was said, and the consequences—whereas the original is more scattered.\n",
    "\t3.\tProfessionalism:\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version removes excessive profanity (while keeping it where necessary for context) and avoids inflammatory phrases that could be perceived as biased.\n",
    "\t•\tExample: The original uses phrases like “these redneck mother-f**kers murdered Sandra Bland,” while the rewritten version states that Sunshine “made controversial statements about the killing of white individuals.”\n",
    "\t4.\tImproved Clarity:\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version eliminates redundant details and focuses on key points without overwhelming the reader with excessive direct quotes and unnecessary tangents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses of the Rewritten Version:\n",
    "\t1.\tLess Emotional Impact:\n",
    "\t•\tWhile it makes the report more professional, it also removes some of the raw intensity of the original, which may lessen the urgency for some readers.\n",
    "\t2.\tLess Specificity in Some Areas:\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version avoids some graphic details, which might make it seem slightly sanitized. For example, it generalizes some of the violent threats rather than quoting them directly.\n",
    "\t3.\tCould Clarify Source Bias:\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version still relies on Breitbart as a key source but does not address the publication’s potential bias, which might be important for a reader to evaluate credibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall Rating: 8.5/10\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Great improvements in readability, structure, and professionalism\n",

    "The rewritten version significantly improves clarity, readability, and organization while maintaining the core details of the original. However, there are still areas that could be refined further. Below is a detailed analysis of its strengths and weaknesses compared to the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths of the Rewritten Version\n",
    "\t1.\tImproved Readability & Structure\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version is more concise and structured, making it easier to follow.\n",
    "\t•\tThe original is long-winded, repetitive, and contains excessive direct quotes.\n",
    "\t•\tExample: The rewrite summarizes key events before quoting relevant statements rather than presenting an overwhelming block of dialogue.\n",
    "\t2.\tMore Professional & Objective Tone\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version avoids overly sensational language, making it feel more like a news report rather than an opinion piece.\n",
    "\t•\tExample: The original states, “#BlackLivesMatter and #FYF911 Terrorists”, which labels them as terrorists outright. The rewrite focuses on what was said and done, letting the reader interpret the severity.\n",
    "\t3.\tClearer Attribution & Context\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewrite makes it clear who said what and avoids ambiguous phrasing.\n",
    "\t•\tExample: Instead of just saying “threats were made,” it provides a structured breakdown of the conversation and responses.\n",
    "\t4.\tRetains Critical Information Without Overuse of Profanity\n",
    "\t•\tWhile maintaining the core inflammatory statements, the rewrite eliminates excessive profanity, making it readable for a broader audience.\n",
    "\t•\tExample: The rewrite only keeps profanity where necessary to accurately convey the nature of the statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses of the Rewritten Version\n",
    "\t1.\tStill Some Sensationalism & Lack of Context on Bias\n",
    "\t•\tWhile much improved, the rewrite still leans toward portraying the movement as violent extremists without acknowledging broader context or alternative perspectives.\n",
    "\t•\tExample: It does not mention whether these statements were widely condemned or if they represented a fringe faction.\n",
    "\t•\tSolution: Briefly acknowledge that such rhetoric may not reflect all members of the movements.\n",
    "\t2.\tLoses Some Direct Quotes That Could Strengthen Credibility\n",
    "\t•\tWhile streamlining is good, a few important details were lost in paraphrasing.\n",
    "\t•\tExample: “Sunshine was also observed advocating in previous interviews at the Sandra Bland protest” is vague compared to the original quote, which gives more insight into her views.\n",
    "\t3.\tLack of Source Context & Potential Bias from Breitbart\n",
    "\t•\tSince Breitbart is a known right-wing source, the rewrite could briefly mention this for transparency.\n",
    "\t•\tExample: A sentence like “Breitbart Texas, a conservative outlet, reported…” would add credibility without dismissing the claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Verdict:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Much clearer and more structured than the original\n",
    "✅ Removes excessive profanity and improves professionalism\n",
    "✅ Retains the key facts while improving readability\n",
    "❌ Still lacks source transparency and broader movement context\n",

    "The rewritten version significantly improves clarity, structure, and readability while maintaining the core details of the original. It removes excessive profanity, improves professionalism, and presents the information in a more structured and digestible manner. However, there are still some areas where further refinements could enhance objectivity and transparency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths of the Rewritten Version:\n",
    "\t1.\tImproved Readability & Structure\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten article follows a logical flow, starting with the main event, then providing context, followed by quotes and reactions, making it much easier to follow than the chaotic, rambling nature of the original.\n",
    "\t•\tExample: It clearly introduces the show, quotes key statements, and provides context on law enforcement responses rather than jumping from one topic to another.\n",
    "\t2.\tMore Professional & Objective Tone\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version removes excessive profanity while keeping necessary direct quotes for impact.\n",
    "\t•\tExample: “When those motherfers are by themselves, that’s when we should start fing them up.”\n",
    "\t•\tKeeps the critical language while minimizing unnecessary vulgarity.\n",
    "\t3.\tStronger and More Engaging Headline\n",

    "\t•\tOriginal: No comment is expected from Barack Obama…\n",
    "\t•\tRewritten: Controversial Radio Show Sparks Outrage with Calls for Violence Against White People and Police.\n",
    "\t•\tThis makes the story instantly engaging without sounding biased or overly dramatic.\n",
    "\t4.\tBetter Contextualization\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version provides background on Sunshine, her show, past statements, and the broader movement’s actions without making it sound like an unstructured rant.\n",
    "\t•\tExample: It explains why law enforcement is on high alert rather than simply stating it as a fact.\n",
    "\t5.\tMore Balanced and Credible Approach\n",
    "\t•\tThe original piece reads like an angry opinion blog, while the rewrite retains key information but delivers it with journalistic integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses of the Rewritten Version:\n",
    "\t1.\tCould Acknowledge Source Bias\n",
    "\t•\tSince Breitbart Texas is a conservative outlet known for its strong opinions on racial and political issues, a more neutral rewrite might acknowledge potential bias in its reporting.\n",
    "\t•\tExample: Adding a brief mention like “According to a report from Breitbart Texas, a conservative news outlet…” would make it more transparent.\n",
    "\t2.\tStill Slightly Sensational in Some Areas\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version still leans into dramatic wording, making the story sound more inflammatory than necessary.\n",
    "\t•\tExample: “The movement’s rhetoric has prompted law enforcement to remain on high alert, particularly as threats against police and white individuals coincide with the anniversary of 9/11.”\n",
    "\t•\tSuggestion: A more neutral wording like “Law enforcement officials have expressed concern over potential threats, particularly given the timing of the movement’s planned actions on 9/11.” would still inform the reader without unnecessary escalation.\n",
    "\t3.\tSlight Loss of Direct Quotes\n",
    "\t•\tWhile trimming excessive details is good, some key inflammatory quotes are paraphrased instead of being directly presented, which slightly reduces the impact.\n",
    "\t•\tSuggestion: Include one or two additional direct quotes from the original to increase credibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Verdict:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Much clearer, structured, and professional than the original\n",
    "✅ Retains key details while reducing inflammatory language\n",
    "✅ More journalistic and neutral in tone\n",
    "✅ More engaging and readable for a broader audience\n",
    "❌ Could add source transparency to acknowledge Breitbart’s perspective\n",
    "❌ Some areas still lean slightly sensational\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Score: 9/10\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like a version that balances it even further, making it more neutral and objective while still keeping the core details?"

      "rate the below rewritten news agains this original: No comment is expected from Barack Obama Members of the #FYF911 or #FukYoFlag and #BlackLivesMatter movements called for the lynching and hanging of white people and cops. They encouraged others on a radio show Tuesday night to  turn the tide  and kill white people and cops to send a message about the killing of black people in America.One of the F***YoFlag organizers is called  Sunshine.  She has a radio blog show hosted from Texas called,  Sunshine s F***ing Opinion Radio Show. A snapshot of her #FYF911 @LOLatWhiteFear Twitter page at 9:53 p.m. shows that she was urging supporters to  Call now!! #fyf911 tonight we continue to dismantle the illusion of white Below is a SNAPSHOT Twitter Radio Call Invite   #FYF911The radio show aired at 10:00 p.m. eastern standard time.During the show, callers clearly call for  lynching  and  killing  of white people.A 2:39 minute clip from the radio show can be heard here. It was provided to Breitbart Texas by someone who would like to be referred to as  Hannibal.  He has already received death threats as a result of interrupting #FYF911 conference calls.An unidentified black man said  when those mother f**kers are by themselves, that s when when we should start f***ing them up. Like they do us, when a bunch of them ni**ers takin  one of us out, that s how we should roll up.  He said,  Cause we already roll up in gangs anyway. There should be six or seven black mother f**ckers, see that white person, and then lynch their ass. Let s turn the tables. They conspired that if  cops started losing people,  then  there will be a state of emergency. He speculated that one of two things would happen,  a big-ass [R s?????] war,  or  ni**ers, they are going to start backin  up. We are already getting killed out here so what the f**k we got to lose? Sunshine could be heard saying,  Yep, that s true. That s so f**king true. He said,  We need to turn the tables on them. Our kids are getting shot out here. Somebody needs to become a sacrifice on their side.He said,  Everybody ain t down for that s**t, or whatever, but like I say, everybody has a different position of war.  He continued,  Because they don t give a f**k anyway.  He said again,  We might as well utilized them for that s**t and turn the tables on these n**ers. He said, that way  we can start lookin  like we ain t havin  that many casualties, and there can be more causalities on their side instead of ours. They are out their killing black people, black lives don t matter, that s what those mother f**kers   so we got to make it matter to them. Find a mother f**ker that is alone. Snap his ass, and then f***in hang him from a damn tree. Take a picture of it and then send it to the mother f**kers. We  just need one example,  and  then people will start watchin .  This will turn the tables on s**t, he said. He said this will start  a trickle-down effect.  He said that when one white person is hung and then they are just  flat-hanging,  that will start the  trickle-down effect.  He continued,  Black people are good at starting trends. He said that was how  to get the upper-hand. Another black man spoke up saying they needed to kill  cops that are killing us. The first black male said,  That will be the best method right there. Breitbart Texas previously reported how Sunshine was upset when  racist white people  infiltrated and disrupted one of her conference calls. She subsequently released the phone number of one of the infiltrators. The veteran immediately started receiving threatening calls.One of the #F***YoFlag movement supporters allegedly told a veteran who infiltrated their publicly posted conference call,  We are going to rape and gut your pregnant wife, and your f***ing piece of sh*t unborn creature will be hung from a tree. Breitbart Texas previously encountered Sunshine at a Sandra Bland protest at the Waller County Jail in Texas, where she said all white people should be killed. She told journalists and photographers,  You see this nappy-ass hair on my head?   That means I am one of those more militant Negroes.  She said she was at the protest because  these redneck mother-f**kers murdered Sandra Bland because she had nappy hair like me. #FYF911 black radicals say they will be holding the  imperial powers  that are actually responsible for the terrorist attacks on September 11th accountable on that day, as reported by Breitbart Texas. There are several websites and Twitter handles for the movement. Palmetto Star  describes himself as one of the head organizers. He said in a YouTube video that supporters will be burning their symbols of  the illusion of their superiority,  their  false white supremacy,  like the American flag, the British flag, police uniforms, and Ku Klux Klan hoods.Sierra McGrone or  Nocturnus Libertus  posted,  you too can help a young Afrikan clean their a** with the rag of oppression.  She posted two photos, one that appears to be herself, and a photo of a black man, wiping their naked butts with the American flag.For entire story: Breitbart News LAW ENFORCEMENT ON HIGH ALERT Following Threats Against Cops And Whites On 9-11By #BlackLivesMatter And #FYF911 Terrorists [VIDEO]\n",

    "The rewritten version greatly improves upon the original by enhancing clarity, structure, and professionalism while still conveying the severity of the statements made during the radio broadcast.

    "\n",
    "Strengths of the Rewritten Version:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Improved Readability & Structure\n",
    "\t•\tLogical Flow: The article now follows a structured narrative:\n",
    "\t1.\tIntroduction: Outlines the key event (radio broadcast and violent rhetoric).\n",
    "\t2.\tContext: Identifies the host (Sunshine) and her promotion of the event.\n",
    "\t3.\tEvidence: Summarizes key quotes and reactions.\n",
    "\t4.\tHistorical Context: Includes Sunshine’s past statements and movement’s past actions.\n",
    "\t5.\tLaw Enforcement Response: Highlights police vigilance and the 9/11 protest plans.\n",
    "\t•\tThe original article is cluttered and jumps between ideas without a clear focus.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ More Professional & Objective Tone\n",
    "\t•\tAvoids Sensationalism: While the rewritten version still highlights violent rhetoric, it does so without unnecessary inflammatory language.\n",
    "\t•\tRemoves Unverified Claims & Bias: The original piece read like a hit piece, whereas this version lets the quotes speak for themselves.\n",
    "\t•\tExample:\n",
    "\t•\tOriginal: ”#BlackLivesMatter and #FYF911 Terrorists” (without substantiating the label)\n",
    "\t•\tRewritten: “Radical Elements within #FYF911 and #BlackLivesMatter Movements Advocate Violence in Radio Broadcast.”\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Preserves Key Information While Cutting Unnecessary Details\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten article keeps the most important quotes that prove the speakers called for violence, but removes excessive, repetitive profanity that diluted the message.\n",
    "\t•\tExample of excess cut out:\n",
    "\t•\tOriginal: “We are already getting killed out here, so what the f** do we have to lose?”*\n",
    "\t•\tRewritten: Still conveys the same sentiment without overloading the reader with expletives.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Retains & Properly Attribites Direct Quotes for Credibility\n",
    "\t•\tKeeps key incendiary statements while ensuring they are properly sourced (e.g., “Sunshine,” “Hannibal,” “Palmetto Star”).\n",
    "\t•\tUses attribution carefully (e.g., “according to Breitbart Texas”) to make it clear where the information is coming from.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Acknowledges Law Enforcement’s Concern Without Overstating It\n",
    "\t•\tInstead of making assumptions, the rewritten version states law enforcement agencies are monitoring the situation—keeping it factual.\n",
    "\t•\tExample:\n",
    "\t•\tOriginal: “LAW ENFORCEMENT ON HIGH ALERT Following Threats Against Cops And Whites On 9-11.”\n",

    "Areas for Potential Improvement:\n",

    "❌ Still Leans Slightly Sensational in Some Areas\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version removes a lot of bias, but the title still implies all of #BlackLivesMatter and #FYF911 support these views.\n",
    "\t•\tSuggestion: A more balanced title could be:\n",
    "\t•\t“Violent Rhetoric Emerges from Radical Faction of #FYF911 in Radio Broadcast.”\n",
    "\t•\tThis avoids broadly implicating the entire movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Could Add Transparency Regarding Breitbart as the Source\n",
    "\t•\tBreitbart is a highly partisan outlet, which should be noted for journalistic transparency.\n",
    "\t•\tSuggestion:\n",
    "\t•\tInstead of just “according to Breitbart Texas”, add:\n",
    "\t•\t“According to a report from Breitbart Texas, a conservative news outlet known for covering radical activist movements.”\n",
    "\t•\tThis would acknowledge bias without dismissing the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Some Context Still Missing on Broader Movement\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version focuses on violent rhetoric, but does not clarify whether this represents mainstream #BlackLivesMatter activists.\n",
    "\t•\tA short sentence stating that ”#FYF911 is a radical offshoot of broader Black Lives Matter activism, which has many factions and viewpoints,” would improve neutrality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Verdict:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Far more professional, structured, and readable\n",
    "✅ Removes unnecessary inflammatory rhetoric while keeping key details\n",
    "✅ Balances direct quotes with factual reporting\n",
    "✅ Improves neutrality compared to the original’s biased language\n",
    "❌ Could improve by acknowledging Breitbart’s partisan stance\n",
    "❌ Still slightly sensational in headline and movement characterization\n",

They encouraged others on a radio show Tuesday night to  turn the tide  and kill white people and cops to send a message about the killing of black people in America.One of the F***YoFlag organizers is called  Sunshine.  She has a radio blog show hosted from Texas called,  Sunshine s F***ing Opinion Radio Show. A snapshot of her #FYF911 @LOLatWhiteFear Twitter page at 9:53 p.m. shows that she was urging supporters to  Call now!! #fyf911 tonight we continue to dismantle the illusion of white Below is a SNAPSHOT Twitter Radio Call Invite   #FYF911The radio show aired at 10:00 p.m. eastern standard time.During the show, callers clearly call for  lynching  and  killing  of white people.A 2:39 minute clip from the radio show can be heard here. It was provided to Breitbart Texas by someone who would like to be referred to as  Hannibal.  He has already received death threats as a result of interrupting #FYF911 conference calls.An unidentified black man said  when those mother f**kers are by themselves, that s when when we should start f***ing them up. Like they do us, when a bunch of them ni**ers takin  one of us out, that s how we should roll up.  He said,  Cause we already roll up in gangs anyway. There should be six or seven black mother f**ckers, see that white person, and then lynch their ass. Let s turn the tables. They conspired that if  cops started losing people,  then  there will be a state of emergency. He speculated that one of two things would happen,  a big-ass [R s?????] war,  or  ni**ers, they are going to start backin  up. We are already getting killed out here so what the f**k we got to lose? Sunshine could be heard saying,  Yep, that s true. That s so f**king true. He said,  We need to turn the tables on them. Our kids are getting shot out here. Somebody needs to become a sacrifice on their side.He said,  Everybody ain t down for that s**t, or whatever, but like I say, everybody has a different position of war.  He continued,  Because they don t give a f**k anyway.  He said again,  We might as well utilized them for that s**t and turn the tables on these n**ers. He said, that way  we can start lookin  like we ain t havin  that many casualties, and there can be more causalities on their side instead of ours. They are out their killing black people, black lives don t matter, that s what those mother f**kers   so we got to make it matter to them. Find a mother f**ker that is alone. Snap his ass, and then f***in hang him from a damn tree. Take a picture of it and then send it to the mother f**kers. We  just need one example,  and  then people will start watchin .  This will turn the tables on s**t, he said. He said this will start  a trickle-down effect.  He said that when one white person is hung and then they are just  flat-hanging,  that will start the  trickle-down effect.  He continued,  Black people are good at starting trends. He said that was how  to get the upper-hand. Another black man spoke up saying they needed to kill  cops that are killing us. The first black male said,  That will be the best method right there. Breitbart Texas previously reported how Sunshine was upset when  racist white people  infiltrated and disrupted one of her conference calls. She subsequently released the phone number of one of the infiltrators. The veteran immediately started receiving threatening calls.One of the #F***YoFlag movement supporters allegedly told a veteran who infiltrated their publicly posted conference call,  We are going to rape and gut your pregnant wife, and your f***ing piece of sh*t unborn creature will be hung from a tree. Breitbart Texas previously encountered Sunshine at a Sandra Bland protest at the Waller County Jail in Texas, where she said all white people should be killed. She told journalists and photographers,  You see this nappy-ass hair on my head?   That means I am one of those more militant Negroes.  She said she was at the protest because  these redneck mother-f**kers murdered Sandra Bland because she had nappy hair like me. #FYF911 black radicals say they will be holding the  imperial powers  that are actually responsible for the terrorist attacks on September 11th accountable on that day, as reported by Breitbart Texas. There are several websites and Twitter handles for the movement. Palmetto Star  describes himself as one of the head organizers. He said in a YouTube video that supporters will be burning their symbols of  the illusion of their superiority,  their  false white supremacy,  like the American flag, the British flag, police uniforms, and Ku Klux Klan hoods.Sierra McGrone or  Nocturnus Libertus  posted,  you too can help a young Afrikan clean their a** with the rag of oppression.

    "\n",
    "The rewritten version improves on the original by enhancing clarity, structure, and professionalism while keeping the core details intact. However, it still leans toward a sensational tone and could be more precise in distinguishing radical elements from broader movements like Black Lives Matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths of the Rewritten Version:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Better Readability & Structure\n",
    "\t•\tMore Organized Flow:\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version follows a logical structure, moving from Obama’s lack of comment to the event, key speakers, statements made, and law enforcement responses.\n",
    "\t•\tThe original article is disorganized, jumping between ideas without transitions.\n",
    "\t•\tConcise Yet Detailed:\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version retains the most important quotes and evidence but removes excessive profanity and repetitive wording.\n",
    "\t•\tExample: The original piece overuses explicit language, whereas the rewrite includes only what is necessary to convey the violent rhetoric.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ More Professional & Objective Tone\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version avoids overt bias and inflammatory language, making it read more like a news report rather than a politically charged opinion piece.\n",
    "\t•\tExample:\n",
    "\t•\tOriginal: “LAW ENFORCEMENT ON HIGH ALERT Following Threats Against Cops And Whites On 9-11 By #BlackLivesMatter And #FYF911 Terrorists [VIDEO].”\n",
    "\t•\tRewritten: “In light of these disturbing calls for violence against police and civilians, law enforcement agencies remain on high alert.”\n",
    "\t•\tImprovement: The rewritten version removes unnecessary alarmism while still reporting the key fact.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Retains Key Quotes for Credibility\n",
    "\t•\tDirect quotes from callers advocating violence remain in the rewrite, which preserves factual accuracy and credibility.\n",
    "\t•\tImprovement: The rewritten version uses them selectively, preventing the overload of explicit language found in the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Avoids Overly Sensationalist Claims Without Evidence\n",
    "\t•\tThe original article presents unverified claims without nuance, while the rewritten version maintains a responsible tone.\n",
    "\t•\tExample:\n",
    "\t•\tOriginal: “One of the #F*YoFlag movement supporters allegedly told a veteran… ‘We are going to rape and gut your pregnant wife.’”\n",
    "\t•\tRewritten: This claim is omitted due to lack of verification, focusing instead on proven incitement to violence.\n",
    "\t•\tImprovement: The rewritten version sticks to what is directly documented rather than including potentially unverifiable inflammatory claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses of the Rewritten Version:\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Still Implicates Black Lives Matter Too Broadly\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version states that “members of the #FYF911 and #FukYoFlag movements, as well as some individuals associated with Black Lives Matter” called for violence.\n",
    "\t•\tWhy it’s a problem: Black Lives Matter (BLM) is a broad and decentralized movement with many different factions.\n",
    "\t•\tSolution:\n",
    "\t•\tInstead of saying “as well as some individuals associated with Black Lives Matter,” it would be more accurate to state:\n",
    "\t•\t“while #FYF911 and #FukYoFlag are radical offshoots, their rhetoric does not necessarily represent the larger Black Lives Matter movement.”\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Still Slightly Sensational in Tone\n",
    "\t•\tWhile improved from the original, some wording retains a sensationalistic feel.\n",
    "\t•\tExample:\n",
    "\t•\t“The movement’s rhetoric has escalated beyond peaceful protests into incitement for violent retribution—a trend that has serious implications for both public safety and racial tensions in the United States.”\n",
    "\t•\tIssue: This statement implies a broad movement shift toward violence, rather than just a specific radical faction.\n",
    "\t•\tBetter Alternative: “Statements from radical members of the #FYF911 and #FukYoFlag groups have escalated beyond peaceful protest, raising concerns about public safety and law enforcement responses.”\n",
    "\t•\tWhy? This avoids implying that the entire movement is involved in violent rhetoric.\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Could Acknowledge Potential Bias of Breitbart as a Source\n",
    "\t•\tBreitbart Texas is a well-known conservative outlet, and transparency about sources improves credibility.\n",
    "\t•\tSolution:\n",
    "\t•\tInstead of simply stating “a snippet from the show reveals,” the article could add a brief acknowledgment of the source’s political stance.\n",
    "\t•\tExample:\n",
    "\t•\t“According to Breitbart Texas, a conservative outlet that has covered radical activist movements extensively…”\n",
    "\t•\tThis helps readers evaluate the information with awareness of the source’s perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Verdict:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Much clearer, structured, and professional than the original\n",
    "✅ Removes excessive profanity and improves credibility\n",
    "✅ Keeps the key facts and violent rhetoric intact without sensationalism\n",
    "❌ Still slightly broad in implicating Black Lives Matter as a whole\n",
    "❌ Could acknowledge Breitbart’s conservative stance for transparency\n",
    "❌ Some minor wording choices could further improve neutrality\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Score: 8.5/10\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like a more neutral version that makes a clear distinction between radical factions and mainstream movements?"

    "Strengths of the Rewritten Version:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ More Professional and Structured\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version removes excessive profanity and presents information in a clearer format.\n",
    "\t•\tIt follows a logical progression:\n",
    "\t1.\tIntroduction to FYF911 and FYoFlag movements*\n",
    "\t2.\tThe 9/11-themed event as a key moment\n",
    "\t3.\tKey statements made during the radio broadcast\n",
    "\t4.\tContextualizing the movement’s broader goals\n",
    "\t5.\tA closing analysis of its implications\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Removes Sensationalism but Retains Key Details\n",
    "\t•\tThe original article was overtly inflammatory, using loaded language and excessive direct quotes to drive fear.\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version tones down this bias, keeping relevant statements while improving readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ More Balanced Ending\n",
    "\t•\tThe conclusion raises concerns about extremism while emphasizing peaceful solutions as an alternative.\n",
    "\t•\tImprovement: The original article focused only on the violent rhetoric, whereas the rewritten version acknowledges the complexity of the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses of the Rewritten Version:\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Loses Key Quotes That Provide Context\n",
    "\t•\tThe original included direct quotes from callers advocating violence, which added credibility to the claims.\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version only keeps one or two, losing specific details.\n",
    "\t•\tExample: The original included:\n",
    "\t•\t“We just need one example, and then people will start watching.”\n",
    "\t•\t“Find a mother fer that is alone. Snap his ass, and then fin’ hang him from a damn tree.”\n",
    "\t•\tThese should have been included for transparency instead of being reduced to vague summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Oversimplifies the Movement’s Intentions & Conflates Groups\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version suggests that FYF911, F***YoFlag, and Black Lives Matter share similar strategic goals, but in reality, these groups have different objectives and levels of extremism.\n",
    "\t•\tExample of misleading wording:\n",
    "\t•\t“Drawing parallels with Black Lives Matter in their strategic approach towards instilling systemic change.”\n",

    "\t•\tWhy it’s a problem: The reader cannot evaluate the credibility of the claims without knowing the source’s perspective.\n",
    "\t•\tSolution: A disclaimer like “According to Breitbart Texas, a conservative news outlet that has extensively covered radical activist movements…” would improve transparency.\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Less Clear About Law Enforcement’s Response\n",
    "\t•\tThe original article emphasized that police were on high alert due to threats.\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version downplays this aspect, making the threats seem more theoretical rather than urgent.\n",
