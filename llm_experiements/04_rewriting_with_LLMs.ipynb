    "rate the below rewritten news agains this original: MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s combative style has buffeted Mexico’s president for months, but deeply unpopular Enrique Pena Nieto may end up thanking the new U.S. president for prompting offended Mexicans to rally behind their leader.  From billionaire business magnate Carlos Slim to political opponents, there has been a groundswell of support for Pena Nieto, who has cut a lonely figure in months of bruising encounters with Trump. Often referred to by his initials EPN, Pena Nieto is laboring under the worst approval ratings of any Mexican president in decades due to discontent over corruption, gang violence, sluggish growth and a jump in fuel prices.     Trump’s threats to scrap the NAFTA trade deal with Mexico and build a border wall have caused anger and left Mexicans feeling fearful for the future. His challenge to Pena Nieto on Thursday - saying he should skip a planned summit between the two leaders if Mexico wasn’t willing to pay for the wall - was the final straw. Pena Nieto replied a couple of hours later that he had canceled his meeting with Trump, one of the president’s biggest ever hits on Twitter, getting more “likes” than when he personally broke news of the capture of notorious drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman in January of last year. “Bravo EPN!,” cheered former President Vicente Fox, who had initially condemned Pena Nieto for inviting Trump to Mexico for talks last August, and who has waged a colorful and expletive-ridden campaign against the Republican on Twitter. Pena Nieto and Trump talked for about an hour by phone on Friday, pledging to work out their differences and agreeing not to speak about the wall in public for now. Meanwhile, calls for unity grew in Mexico, led by Slim, a normally media-shy 76-year-old who gave a 90-minute news conference in support of the government on Friday. “This is the most surprising example of national unity I’ve seen in my life,” said Slim, who spent several years in the past decade as the world’s richest man. “We have to back the president of Mexico so he can defend our national interests.” Senior opposition leaders also urged a common front. “It’s time to show unity and our commitment to Mexico,” Alejandra Barrales, head of the center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), said on Twitter. Pena Nieto’s credibility has been battered by a widespread public perception that he has failed to battle corruption and indeed even encouraged it since a conflict-of-interest row embroiled him, his wife and a top minister in late 2014. Some opposition critics fear the government will try to use Trump as a screen to distract from its failings. However, two senior officials told Reuters they hoped Pena Nieto would seize the moment to act quickly and decisively to improve his image. Expressions of dismay at Trump’s behavior towards Mexico have almost become a national pastime, and talk of boycotts against U.S. companies is gathering steam on social media. Slim, when asked about boycotting at his news conference, said it wasn’t a good idea to turn on U.S. companies, which are creating jobs in Mexico. Some foreign companies voiced support for Mexico too. “I feel Mexico is being subjected to terror at the moment,” said Andreas Schindler, co-owner of German fruit wholesaler Don Limon’s parent Pilz Schindler, by phone from Hamburg. “We’re right behind Mexico.”  Trump tussle gives unpopular Mexican leader much-needed shot in arm\n",
    "\n",
    "rewritten: **MEXICO CITY (Reuters)** — Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, grappling with historic unpopularity, has unexpectedly garnered a wave of national solidarity amid escalating tensions with U.S. President Donald Trump, whose confrontational rhetoric has unified Mexicans in defense of their country’s dignity and interests.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Peña Nieto, often abbreviated as EPN, has faced public fury over corruption scandals, cartel violence, economic stagnation, and a controversial fuel price surge, leaving his approval ratings at record lows. Yet Trump’s persistent threats—from scrapping the NAFTA trade pact to demanding Mexico fund a border wall—have ignited a rare sense of unity. The breaking point came Thursday when Trump taunted Peña Nieto to cancel their planned meeting unless Mexico conceded to financing the wall. Within hours, the Mexican president called off the summit, a decision cheered by over a million Twitter users—surpassing the viral reaction to his 2016 announcement of drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán’s capture.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The two leaders later held a tense phone call on Friday, agreeing to temporarily mute public disputes over the wall while addressing broader tensions. The move drew praise even from former critics, including ex-President Vicente Fox, who tweeted, “Bravo EPN!”—a stark reversal from his earlier condemnation of Peña Nieto’s outreach to Trump.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Billionaire Carlos Slim, Mexico’s richest man and a typically media-shy figure, held a rare 90-minute press conference urging solidarity. “This is the most profound national unity I’ve seen in my lifetime,” said Slim, who once topped global wealth rankings. “We must stand behind our president to protect Mexico’s sovereignty.” Opposition leaders, including Alejandra Barrales of the left-leaning Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), echoed calls for a united front, tweeting, “This moment demands commitment to Mexico above all.”  \n",
    "\n",
    "Yet skepticism lingers. Critics accuse Peña Nieto’s administration of exploiting the Trump crisis to distract from domestic failures, particularly a 2014 conflict-of-interest scandal involving the president, his wife, and a senior minister. Two government officials told Reuters they hope the president leverages this momentum to rebuild credibility through bold reforms.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Public outrage has fueled social media campaigns boycotting U.S. brands, though Slim warned against harming American companies that provide Mexican jobs. International allies also voiced support, including Andreas Schindler of Germany’s Pilz Schindler, parent company of fruit wholesaler Don Limon, who condemned Trump’s tactics as “economic terror” against Mexico.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As diplomatic friction intensifies, Peña Nieto’s defiance of Trump has delivered an unforeseen boost to his beleaguered presidency, proving that even a polarizing leader can become a rallying point when national pride is at stake.\n",

Pena Nieto’s credibility has been battered by a widespread public perception that he has failed to battle corruption and indeed even encouraged it since a conflict-of-interest row embroiled him, his wife and a top minister in late 2014. Some opposition critics fear the government will try to use Trump as a screen to distract from its failings. However, two senior officials told Reuters they hoped Pena Nieto would seize the moment to act quickly and decisively to improve his image. Expressions of dismay at Trump’s behavior towards Mexico have almost become a national pastime, and talk of boycotts against U.S. companies is gathering steam on social media. Slim, when asked about boycotting at his news conference, said it wasn’t a good idea to turn on U.S. companies, which are creating jobs in Mexico. Some foreign companies voiced support for Mexico too. “I feel Mexico is being subjected to terror at the moment,” said Andreas Schindler, co-owner of German fruit wholesaler Don Limon’s parent Pilz Schindler, by phone from Hamburg. “We’re right behind Mexico.”  Trump tussle gives unpopular Mexican leader much-needed shot in arm\n",
    "\n",
    "rewritten: MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s confrontational approach has put Mexico’s president under pressure for months, but the deeply unpopular Enrique Peña Nieto may ultimately owe the U.S. president some gratitude for uniting Mexicans in support of their leader. From billionaire tycoon Carlos Slim to political rivals, there has been a surge of backing for Peña Nieto, who has faced a series of bruising encounters with Trump largely on his own. Often referred to by his initials EPN, Peña Nieto has been grappling with the lowest approval ratings of any Mexican president in decades, driven by public frustration over corruption, gang violence, sluggish economic growth, and rising fuel prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "Trump’s threats to dismantle the NAFTA trade agreement with Mexico and build a border wall have sparked widespread anger and left many Mexicans anxious about the future. His latest challenge to Peña Nieto on Thursday—urging him to cancel a planned summit if Mexico refused to pay for the wall—proved to be the breaking point. Hours later, Peña Nieto announced he had called off the meeting with Trump, a move that became one of his most popular tweets ever, garnering more “likes” than his announcement of the capture of notorious drug lord Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán in early 2016. “Bravo EPN!” cheered former President Vicente Fox, who had previously criticized Peña Nieto for inviting Trump to Mexico last August and has since led a colorful, expletive-laden campaign against the Republican on social media.\n",
    "\n",
    "Peña Nieto and Trump spoke by phone for about an hour on Friday, agreeing to address their differences and temporarily avoid public discussions about the wall. Meanwhile, calls for national unity grew louder in Mexico, spearheaded by Carlos Slim, the typically media-shy 76-year-old billionaire who held a 90-minute press conference on Friday to express his support for the government. “This is the most remarkable example of national unity I’ve witnessed in my lifetime,” said Slim, who once held the title of the world’s richest man. “We must stand behind the president of Mexico to defend our national interests.” Senior opposition leaders echoed this sentiment, with Alejandra Barrales, head of the center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD), tweeting, “It’s time to show unity and our commitment to Mexico.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Peña Nieto’s credibility has been severely damaged by widespread perceptions that he has failed to combat corruption and may have even enabled it, particularly since a conflict-of-interest scandal involving him, his wife, and a top minister erupted in late 2014. Some critics worry the government will use Trump as a distraction from its own shortcomings. However, two senior officials told Reuters they hope Peña Nieto will seize this moment to take swift, decisive action to rebuild his image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expressions of outrage over Trump’s treatment of Mexico have become almost a national pastime, with calls to boycott U.S. companies gaining traction on social media. Slim, however, cautioned against such measures during his press conference, arguing that U.S. companies provide jobs in Mexico and should not be targeted. Some foreign businesses also voiced solidarity with Mexico. “I feel Mexico is being subjected to terror right now,” said Andreas Schindler, co-owner of German fruit wholesaler Don Limon’s parent company Pilz Schindler, speaking by phone from Hamburg. “We stand firmly behind Mexico.”\n",

    "The rewritten article successfully refines the original, enhancing readability, structure, and engagement while maintaining journalistic integrity. Below is a detailed assessment across various criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Clarity & Readability (9/10)\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewording is smoother, with improved sentence flow.\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version replaces awkward phrasing with more natural constructions (e.g., “confrontational approach has put Mexico’s president under pressure” is clearer than “combative style has buffeted Mexico’s president”).\n",
    "\t•\tThe removal of redundancies enhances clarity without losing depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Engagement & Impact (9.5/10)\n",
    "\t•\tThe opening line is sharper, immediately setting up a contrast between Peña Nieto’s struggles and his unexpected political boost.\n",
    "\t•\tThe use of more dynamic verbs (e.g., “has faced” instead of “has cut a lonely figure”) makes the text more compelling.\n",
    "\t•\tThe final sentence is stronger, reinforcing the theme of unintended political consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Accuracy & Fairness (9/10)\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewrite preserves the facts while improving clarity.\n",
    "\t•\tThe tone remains neutral, though phrases like “rallying a divided nation behind him” add a slight dramatic flourish.\n",
    "\t•\tThe omission of excessive detail (such as exact Twitter engagement numbers) maintains accuracy without bogging down the narrative.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Structure & Organization (10/10)\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version is better structured, with paragraphs flowing logically from one idea to the next.\n",
    "\t•\tThe division of sections (Peña Nieto’s struggles → Trump’s threats → National unity response → Political implications) makes the article more digestible.\n",
    "\t•\tUnnecessary repetition is cut, improving pacing.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Style & Tone (9/10)\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version is more professional yet engaging.\n",
    "\t•\tIt avoids the slightly informal tone of the original (e.g., “his biggest ever hits on Twitter” is removed for a more polished description).\n",
    "\t•\tThe word choices are more refined (e.g., “severely damaged” instead of “battered” in reference to Peña Nieto’s credibility).\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall Rating: 9.3/10\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version significantly improves readability, engagement, and structure while preserving the integrity of the original news piece.\n",
    "\t•\tA slight reduction in dramatic language would make it a perfect neutral news report.\n",
    "\t•\tWould work well for a broader audience, including international readers unfamiliar with the nuances of Mexican politics.\n",

She has a radio blog show hosted from Texas called,  Sunshine s F***ing Opinion Radio Show. A snapshot of her #FYF911 @LOLatWhiteFear Twitter page at 9:53 p.m. shows that she was urging supporters to  Call now!! #fyf911 tonight we continue to dismantle the illusion of white Below is a SNAPSHOT Twitter Radio Call Invite   #FYF911The radio show aired at 10:00 p.m. eastern standard time.During the show, callers clearly call for  lynching  and  killing  of white people.A 2:39 minute clip from the radio show can be heard here. It was provided to Breitbart Texas by someone who would like to be referred to as  Hannibal.  He has already received death threats as a result of interrupting #FYF911 conference calls.An unidentified black man said  when those mother f**kers are by themselves, that s when when we should start f***ing them up. Like they do us, when a bunch of them ni**ers takin  one of us out, that s how we should roll up.  He said,  Cause we already roll up in gangs anyway. There should be six or seven black mother f**ckers, see that white person, and then lynch their ass. Let s turn the tables. They conspired that if  cops started losing people,  then  there will be a state of emergency. He speculated that one of two things would happen,  a big-ass [R s?????] war,  or  ni**ers, they are going to start backin  up. We are already getting killed out here so what the f**k we got to lose? Sunshine could be heard saying,  Yep, that s true. That s so f**king true. He said,  We need to turn the tables on them. Our kids are getting shot out here. Somebody needs to become a sacrifice on their side.He said,  Everybody ain t down for that s**t, or whatever, but like I say, everybody has a different position of war.  He continued,  Because they don t give a f**k anyway.  He said again,  We might as well utilized them for that s**t and turn the tables on these n**ers. He said, that way  we can start lookin  like we ain t havin  that many casualties, and there can be more causalities on their side instead of ours. They are out their killing black people, black lives don t matter, that s what those mother f**kers   so we got to make it matter to them. Find a mother f**ker that is alone. Snap his ass, and then f***in hang him from a damn tree. Take a picture of it and then send it to the mother f**kers. We  just need one example,  and  then people will start watchin .  This will turn the tables on s**t, he said. He said this will start  a trickle-down effect.  He said that when one white person is hung and then they are just  flat-hanging,  that will start the  trickle-down effect.  He continued,  Black people are good at starting trends. He said that was how  to get the upper-hand. Another black man spoke up saying they needed to kill  cops that are killing us. The first black male said,  That will be the best method right there. Breitbart Texas previously reported how Sunshine was upset when  racist white people  infiltrated and disrupted one of her conference calls. She subsequently released the phone number of one of the infiltrators. The veteran immediately started receiving threatening calls.One of the #F***YoFlag movement supporters allegedly told a veteran who infiltrated their publicly posted conference call,  We are going to rape and gut your pregnant wife, and your f***ing piece of sh*t unborn creature will be hung from a tree. Breitbart Texas previously encountered Sunshine at a Sandra Bland protest at the Waller County Jail in Texas, where she said all white people should be killed. She told journalists and photographers,  You see this nappy-ass hair on my head?   That means I am one of those more militant Negroes.  She said she was at the protest because  these redneck mother-f**kers murdered Sandra Bland because she had nappy hair like me. #FYF911 black radicals say they will be holding the  imperial powers  that are actually responsible for the terrorist attacks on September 11th accountable on that day, as reported by Breitbart Texas. There are several websites and Twitter handles for the movement. Palmetto Star  describes himself as one of the head organizers. He said in a YouTube video that supporters will be burning their symbols of  the illusion of their superiority,  their  false white supremacy,  like the American flag, the British flag, police uniforms, and Ku Klux Klan hoods.Sierra McGrone or  Nocturnus Libertus  posted,  you too can help a young Afrikan clean their a** with the rag of oppression.  She posted two photos, one that appears to be herself, and a photo of a black man, wiping their naked butts with the American flag.For entire story: Breitbart News LAW ENFORCEMENT ON HIGH ALERT Following Threats Against Cops And Whites On 9-11By #BlackLivesMatter And #FYF911 Terrorists [VIDEO]\"\n",
    "rewritten_by_qwen2_5_coder_7b = 'In an alarming escalation of rhetoric, members from radical groups such as the #FYF911 and #FukYoFlag movements have called for violence against white people and police officers, claiming this is necessary to address racial disparities in America. A notable figure within these groups is Sunshine, a member of the #F***YoFlag movement who maintains a radio show under the pseudonym \"\"Sunshine\\'s F***ing Opinion.\"\" Her call-to-action reached out encouraging supporters on Twitter at 9:53 p.m. to \"\"Call now!!\"\" urging that tonight they continue to dismantle the illusion of white supremacy.\\n\\nThe #FYF911 movement, also known for its association with calls for violence following police-involved shootings, hosted a radio show at 10:00 p.m. eastern standard time. During the episode, listeners clearly expressed a desire for lynching and killing of white individuals as retaliation for racial killings in America. A recording from this show is available on Breitbart Texas\\' platform.\\n\\nTwo anonymous black men participated actively, advocating for violent retaliation. One called for targeting lone individuals out of frustration at the high rates of black deaths at the hands of police. Another suggested killing officers directly to take control over the situation. The anonymous speakers referenced past events involving Sandra Bland and other cases, emphasizing their belief that white authorities and racist groups were responsible for widespread racial violence.\\n\\nIn a previous incident, Sunshine had been disrupted by what she perceives as infiltrators from racist white supremacist groups. In response, one of these alleged infiltrators was sent the phone number of a member who subsequently received death threats.\\n\\nAt a Sandra Bland protest at the Waller County Jail in Texas, Sunshine made clear her militant stance on racial issues. Her comments attracted significant criticism and controversy. #FYF911 members have vowed to hold those responsible for terrorist attacks on September 11 accountable, linking these past tragedies with ongoing racial grievances.\\n\\nThe movement employs various platforms, including Palmetto Star and the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag, to spread their message. A controversial meme circulating among supporters showcases an individual wiping their buttocks with an American flag, illustrating the extreme nature of this rhetoric.\\n\\nAmidst these threats, local authorities have increased their presence and preparation in anticipation of potential violence following these provocative statements, as a report titled “LAW ENFORCEMENT ON HIGH ALERT Following Threats Against Cops And Whites On 9-11” details. The recent developments serve as a stark reminder of the continued need for vigilance and careful examination of hate speech in contemporary society.'\n",

    "✔️ The core facts are retained, including the radio show, the involvement of the #FYF911 movement, Sunshine’s role, and violent rhetoric.\n",
    "✔️ The mention of Breitbart Texas as the source remains, maintaining credibility.\n",

    "\t•\tThe explicit nature of the threats (e.g., details about the suggested method of retaliation against white people and police).\n",
    "\t•\tThe previous threats against an infiltrator and his pregnant wife—a significant omission from a journalistic perspective.\n",
    "\t•\tThe exact details of protest rhetoric (e.g., the Sandra Bland-related comments are mentioned but not quoted directly).\n",
    "\t•\tThe “trickle-down effect” explanation of racial violence is absent, altering the narrative.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔻 The rewritten version presents a slightly diluted version of the original’s intensity, possibly to avoid inflammatory language. However, this alters the story’s impact and may be seen as underreporting the gravity of the situation.\n",

    "\t•\tPhrases like “expressed a desire for lynching” are softer than “called for the lynching and hanging of white people and cops.”\n",
    "\t•\tInstead of stating that the speakers explicitly called for violent retaliation, the rewrite uses “advocating for violent retaliation”, which is less direct.\n",
    "\t•\tThe lack of direct quotes from the most inflammatory moments makes the rewritten version feel less urgent than the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "🔻 A balance must be struck—avoiding inflammatory reporting while still conveying the full severity of the original content.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Engagement & Impact (8.5/10)\n",
    "\n",
    "✔️ The rewritten version is more compelling in a structured way, making it easier for readers to absorb.\n",
    "✔️ It focuses on law enforcement readiness at the end, reinforcing the broader implications.\n",

    "\n",
    "Strengths of the Rewritten Version:\n",
    "\t1.\tMore Objective and Professional Tone\n",
    "\t•\tThe original is inflammatory and filled with charged language, whereas the rewrite maintains a more neutral and journalistic tone.\n",
    "\t•\tExample: “Sunshine and fellow advocates voiced similar sentiments at protests” vs. “She told journalists and photographers, ‘You see this nappy-ass hair on my head? That means I am one of those more militant Negroes.’”\n",

    "\t•\tExample: “An unidentified caller described a retaliatory strategy…” instead of “Find a mother fker that is alone. Snap his ass, and then fin hang him from a damn tree.”*\n",

    "\t1.\tSoftens Some Key Details Too Much\n",
    "\t•\tWhile the rewrite removes sensationalism, it also waters down some key statements that could be important in conveying the severity of the threats.\n",
    "\t•\tExample: The original specifically quotes violent rhetoric, while the rewrite generalizes it into “advocated for acts such as lynching and killing.” The rewrite could retain some direct quotes for clarity.\n",
    "\t2.\tLoses Some Emotional Impact\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version feels more like an analytical report rather than a piece that conveys urgency or danger. While professionalism is good, some of the original impact is lost.\n",
    "\t•\tExample: The original aggressively presents threats, while the rewrite discusses them in a more detached way.\n",
    "\t3.\tStill Relies on Breitbart Without Addressing Potential Bias\n",
    "\t•\tSince Breitbart is the sole source, the rewritten version could acknowledge that Breitbart is a conservative outlet known for controversial takes. This would help provide a more balanced perspective.\n",

    "rewritten_by_deepseek_v3 = '**Controversial Radio Show Sparks Outrage with Calls for Violence Against White People and Police**\\n\\nMembers of the #FYF911 (F***YoFlag) and #BlackLivesMatter movements have drawn widespread attention after a radio show aired on Tuesday night, during which participants called for the lynching and killing of white people and police officers. The show, hosted by a Texas-based organizer known as \"\"Sunshine,\"\" featured inflammatory rhetoric aimed at retaliating against the systemic violence faced by Black Americans.\\n\\nSunshine, who hosts *Sunshine’s F***ing Opinion Radio Show*, used her platform to urge supporters to \"\"dismantle the illusion of white [supremacy].\"\" A snapshot of her Twitter page at 9:53 p.m. Eastern Standard Time (EST) showed her promoting the show with the hashtag #FYF911. The broadcast, which began at 10:00 p.m. EST, included explicit calls for violence. A 2-minute, 39-second clip of the show, provided to Breitbart Texas by an anonymous source referred to as \"\"Hannibal,\"\" captured alarming statements from participants.\\n\\nDuring the broadcast, an unidentified Black man advocated for targeting white individuals when they are alone, stating, \"\"When those motherf***ers are by themselves, that’s when we should start f***ing them up.\"\" He suggested that Black individuals should \"\"lynch their ass\"\" and \"\"turn the tables\"\" on systemic violence. He speculated that if police officers began losing personnel, it would create a \"\"state of emergency,\"\" potentially leading to a \"\"big-ass war\"\" or a shift in power dynamics. \"\"We are already getting killed out here, so what the f*** do we have to lose?\"\" he asked.\\n\\nSunshine echoed his sentiments, agreeing with his statements. The man further argued that such actions would create a \"\"trickle-down effect,\"\" asserting that Black people are \"\"good at starting trends.\"\" He emphasized the need for a symbolic act of violence, such as hanging a white person from a tree and photographing it, to send a message. \"\"We just need one example,\"\" he said, \"\"and then people will start watching.\"\"\\n\\nAnother participant called for targeting police officers, stating, \"\"We need to kill cops that are killing us.\"\" The first speaker agreed, calling it \"\"the best method.\"\" These remarks come amid heightened tensions between law enforcement and activist groups.\\n\\nBreitbart Texas previously reported that Sunshine had expressed frustration when \"\"racist white people\"\" infiltrated one of her conference calls. In response, she released the phone number of one infiltrator, leading to threatening calls against the individual. In one instance, a supporter of the #F***YoFlag movement allegedly threatened a veteran who had infiltrated the call, saying, \"\"We are going to rape and gut your pregnant wife, and your f***ing piece of sh*t unborn creature will be hung from a tree.\"\"\\n\\nSunshine has a history of making provocative statements. At a Sandra Bland protest in Waller County, Texas, she declared that all white people should be killed, telling journalists, \"\"You see this nappy-ass hair on my head? That means I am one of those more militant Negroes.\"\" She claimed Bland was murdered because she had \"\"nappy hair like me.\"\"\\n\\nThe #FYF911 movement has also targeted \"\"imperial powers\"\" they hold responsible for the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Organizers, including one known as \"\"Palmetto Star,\"\" have called for burning symbols of \"\"false white supremacy,\"\" such as the American flag, British flag, police uniforms, and Ku Klux Klan hoods. Sierra McGrone, also known as \"\"Nocturnus Libertus,\"\" posted images of individuals using the American flag in a degrading manner, accompanied by the caption, \"\"You too can help a young Afrikan clean their a** with the rag of oppression.\"\"\\n\\nThe movement’s rhetoric has prompted law enforcement to remain on high alert, particularly as threats against police and white individuals coincide with the anniversary of 9/11. The controversy underscores the deepening divisions in American society and the volatile nature of online activism.\\n\\nFor the full story, visit Breitbart News.'\n",

The broadcast, titled *Sunshine’s F***ing Opinion Radio Show* and aired at 10:00 p.m. EST, urged supporters to “turn the tide” by retaliating against the killings of Black Americans through targeted attacks.  \\n\\nThe show’s host, identified as “Sunshine,” a Texas-based organizer, promoted the event on her Twitter account (@LOLatWhiteFear) at 9:53 p.m., encouraging followers to join a discussion aimed at “dismantling the illusion of white [supremacy].” A 2:39-minute clip from the program, provided to Breitbart Texas by a source using the pseudonym “Hannibal,” captured multiple callers advocating the lynching and killing of white people and police officers. Hannibal claims to have faced death threats after infiltrating #FYF911 conference calls.  \\n\\nDuring the broadcast, an unidentified Black male speaker argued for organized retaliation: “When [white people] are alone, that’s when we should start f***ing them up… Lynch their ass. Let’s turn the tables.” He suggested that targeting law enforcement or civilians could provoke a “state of emergency,” leading to either a “big-ass war” or concessions from opponents. Sunshine endorsed his remarks, stating, “Yep, that’s true. That’s so f***ing true.” The speaker further asserted that graphic acts, such as hanging individuals from trees and disseminating images, would create a “trickle-down effect” to shift power dynamics.  \\n\\nAnother caller emphasized focusing on police: “We need to kill cops that are killing us,” to which the first speaker agreed, calling it “the best method.” These statements align with prior reports by Breitbart Texas detailing Sunshine’s history of incendiary rhetoric. At a 2015 Sandra Bland protest in Waller County, Texas, she declared, “All white people should be killed,” attributing Bland’s death to racial animus.  \\n\\nThe movement’s tactics have previously included doxxing perceived adversaries. After a veteran infiltrated an #FYF911 call, Sunshine allegedly leaked his contact information, resulting in threats against him and his family, including a message vowing to “rape and gut your pregnant wife” and hang their unborn child.  \\n\\n#FYF911 organizers, including “Palmetto Star,” announced plans to burn symbols of “white supremacy” on September 11th, such as the American flag, police uniforms, and KKK hoods, to challenge “imperial powers” they blame for historical oppression. Activist Sierra McGrone, alias “Nocturnus Libertus,” posted images of individuals using the American flag to wipe their bodies, captioned as rejecting the “rag of oppression.”  \\n\\nLaw enforcement agencies are reportedly on high alert following these threats. Breitbart Texas continues to monitor the situation as tensions escalate ahead of the planned 9/11 demonstrations.  \\n\\n*Note: Explicit language has been partially censored to adhere to professional tone guidelines. Direct quotes remain intact to preserve factual accuracy.*\"\n",

    "\t•\tThe rewritten version retains the most important quotes and evidence but removes excessive profanity and repetitive wording.\n",
    "\t•\tExample: The original piece overuses explicit language, whereas the rewrite includes only what is necessary to convey the violent rhetoric.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ More Professional & Objective Tone\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version avoids overt bias and inflammatory language, making it read more like a news report rather than a politically charged opinion piece.\n",
    "\t•\tExample:\n",
    "\t•\tOriginal: “LAW ENFORCEMENT ON HIGH ALERT Following Threats Against Cops And Whites On 9-11 By #BlackLivesMatter And #FYF911 Terrorists [VIDEO].”\n",
    "\t•\tRewritten: “In light of these disturbing calls for violence against police and civilians, law enforcement agencies remain on high alert.”\n",
    "\t•\tImprovement: The rewritten version removes unnecessary alarmism while still reporting the key fact.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Retains Key Quotes for Credibility\n",
    "\t•\tDirect quotes from callers advocating violence remain in the rewrite, which preserves factual accuracy and credibility.\n",
    "\t•\tImprovement: The rewritten version uses them selectively, preventing the overload of explicit language found in the original.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Avoids Overly Sensationalist Claims Without Evidence\n",
    "\t•\tThe original article presents unverified claims without nuance, while the rewritten version maintains a responsible tone.\n",
    "\t•\tExample:\n",
    "\t•\tOriginal: “One of the #F*YoFlag movement supporters allegedly told a veteran… ‘We are going to rape and gut your pregnant wife.’”\n",
    "\t•\tRewritten: This claim is omitted due to lack of verification, focusing instead on proven incitement to violence.\n",
    "\t•\tImprovement: The rewritten version sticks to what is directly documented rather than including potentially unverifiable inflammatory claims.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses of the Rewritten Version:\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Still Implicates Black Lives Matter Too Broadly\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version states that “members of the #FYF911 and #FukYoFlag movements, as well as some individuals associated with Black Lives Matter” called for violence.\n",
    "\t•\tWhy it’s a problem: Black Lives Matter (BLM) is a broad and decentralized movement with many different factions.\n",
    "\t•\tSolution:\n",
    "\t•\tInstead of saying “as well as some individuals associated with Black Lives Matter,” it would be more accurate to state:\n",
    "\t•\t“while #FYF911 and #FukYoFlag are radical offshoots, their rhetoric does not necessarily represent the larger Black Lives Matter movement.”\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Still Slightly Sensational in Tone\n",
    "\t•\tWhile improved from the original, some wording retains a sensationalistic feel.\n",
    "\t•\tExample:\n",
    "\t•\t“The movement’s rhetoric has escalated beyond peaceful protests into incitement for violent retribution—a trend that has serious implications for both public safety and racial tensions in the United States.”\n",
    "\t•\tIssue: This statement implies a broad movement shift toward violence, rather than just a specific radical faction.\n",
    "\t•\tBetter Alternative: “Statements from radical members of the #FYF911 and #FukYoFlag groups have escalated beyond peaceful protest, raising concerns about public safety and law enforcement responses.”\n",
    "\t•\tWhy? This avoids implying that the entire movement is involved in violent rhetoric.\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Could Acknowledge Potential Bias of Breitbart as a Source\n",
    "\t•\tBreitbart Texas is a well-known conservative outlet, and transparency about sources improves credibility.\n",
    "\t•\tSolution:\n",
    "\t•\tInstead of simply stating “a snippet from the show reveals,” the article could add a brief acknowledgment of the source’s political stance.\n",
    "\t•\tExample:\n",
    "\t•\t“According to Breitbart Texas, a conservative outlet that has covered radical activist movements extensively…”\n",
    "\t•\tThis helps readers evaluate the information with awareness of the source’s perspective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Verdict:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Much clearer, structured, and professional than the original\n",
    "✅ Removes excessive profanity and improves credibility\n",
    "✅ Keeps the key facts and violent rhetoric intact without sensationalism\n",
    "❌ Still slightly broad in implicating Black Lives Matter as a whole\n",
    "❌ Could acknowledge Breitbart’s conservative stance for transparency\n",
    "❌ Some minor wording choices could further improve neutrality\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Score: 8.5/10\n",
    "\n",

    "rewritten_by_deepseek_r1_7b = '**Recounting the Groups\\' call for action**\\n\\nThe groups FYF911 and F***YoFlag have emerged as influential forces in recent weeks, urging members to take drastic measures against white individuals. These actions are part of their broader efforts to challenge perceived supremacy, particularly towards cops and white people. The narrative is vividly brought to light through Twitter interactions, radio broadcasts, and a landmark event on 9/11.\\n\\n**The 9/11-Themed Events: A call for conformity control**\\n\\nOn September 11, a live broadcast was held on a F***YoFlag-affiliated media platform. The show featured calls from participants aiming to instigate violence against cops and white individuals, with explicit demands ranging from lynchings to public humiliation of white targets.\\n\\nA significant highlight occurred during the show when a recording surfaced showing participants discussing plans for \"\"turning the tables\"\" on law enforcement and white people. This included threats like hanging white victims in public places such as trees or hanging points, citing that such acts would start a social movement akin to Black Lives Matter.\\n\\n**Participant Accounts: Motivations and Logic**\\n\\nQuoting one participant, \"\"When those motherf***ers are by themselves... we should start f**ing them up.\"\" This reflects a strategy emphasizing personal conflict initiation. Another individual asserted that killing cops is the path for justice against alleged mastermind white enforcers.\\n\\n**Wider Context: The Movement\\'s Reach and Goals**\\n\\nF***YoFlag has been active in several areas, including protests against Sandra Bland, where participants advocated for accountability of law enforcement. They also promote a message of collective resistance, emphasizing that targeted killings would provoke change within societal structures.\\n\\nThe article underscores the movement\\'s aim to use fear and violence as a tool for social change, drawing parallels with Black Lives Matter in their strategic approach towards instilling systemic change.\\n\\n**Conclusion: A Caution on Extremes**\\n\\nWhile the groups\\' motivations are clear, it raises important questions about the viable outcomes of such extreme tactics. The article serves as a reminder of how radical actions can be leveraged for political or ideological purposes, though it also highlights the need to address underlying issues through peaceful and constructive means.'\n",

    "\n",
    "The rewritten version improves on the original in terms of structure, conciseness, and professionalism, but it lacks clarity, misrepresents some aspects, and oversimplifies the message in ways that reduce its accuracy.

    "Strengths of the Rewritten Version:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ More Professional and Structured\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version removes excessive profanity and presents information in a clearer format.\n",
    "\t•\tIt follows a logical progression:\n",
    "\t1.\tIntroduction to FYF911 and FYoFlag movements*\n",
    "\t2.\tThe 9/11-themed event as a key moment\n",
    "\t3.\tKey statements made during the radio broadcast\n",
    "\t4.\tContextualizing the movement’s broader goals\n",
    "\t5.\tA closing analysis of its implications\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Removes Sensationalism but Retains Key Details\n",
    "\t•\tThe original article was overtly inflammatory, using loaded language and excessive direct quotes to drive fear.\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version tones down this bias, keeping relevant statements while improving readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ More Balanced Ending\n",
    "\t•\tThe conclusion raises concerns about extremism while emphasizing peaceful solutions as an alternative.\n",
    "\t•\tImprovement: The original article focused only on the violent rhetoric, whereas the rewritten version acknowledges the complexity of the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses of the Rewritten Version:\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Loses Key Quotes That Provide Context\n",
    "\t•\tThe original included direct quotes from callers advocating violence, which added credibility to the claims.\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version only keeps one or two, losing specific details.\n",
    "\t•\tExample: The original included:\n",
    "\t•\t“We just need one example, and then people will start watching.”\n",
    "\t•\t“Find a mother fer that is alone. Snap his ass, and then fin’ hang him from a damn tree.”\n",
    "\t•\tThese should have been included for transparency instead of being reduced to vague summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Oversimplifies the Movement’s Intentions & Conflates Groups\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version suggests that FYF911, F***YoFlag, and Black Lives Matter share similar strategic goals, but in reality, these groups have different objectives and levels of extremism.\n",
    "\t•\tExample of misleading wording:\n",
    "\t•\t“Drawing parallels with Black Lives Matter in their strategic approach towards instilling systemic change.”\n",
    "\t•\tProblem: This implies BLM supports violent actions, which is misleading.\n",
    "\t•\tSolution: It should clarify that FYF911 and FYoFlag are separate from mainstream BLM activism*.\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Lacks Sufficient Attribution to Sources\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten article does not explicitly mention Breitbart Texas as the original source.\n",
    "\t•\tWhy it’s a problem: The reader cannot evaluate the credibility of the claims without knowing the source’s perspective.\n",
    "\t•\tSolution: A disclaimer like “According to Breitbart Texas, a conservative news outlet that has extensively covered radical activist movements…” would improve transparency.\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ Less Clear About Law Enforcement’s Response\n",
    "\t•\tThe original article emphasized that police were on high alert due to threats.\n",
    "\t•\tThe rewritten version downplays this aspect, making the threats seem more theoretical rather than urgent.\n",
    "\t•\tSolution: The article should restore details about law enforcement reactions to emphasize the real-world consequences of these statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Verdict:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ More structured and professional than the original\n",
    "✅ Removes excessive inflammatory language and improves readability\n",
