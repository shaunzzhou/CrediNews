Breitbart,GOP: WH May Have Illegally Altered Biden's 'Garbage' Remark,"House Republicans say the Biden-Harris White House might have broken the law when they altered President Joe Biden’s remarks in the official transcript to imply he did not call Trump supporters “garbage.”
Biden on Tuesday during a video call with Voto Latino in support of Vice President Kamala Harris’s presidential campaign said, “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.”
However, after facing immediate backlash from Republicans and even some Democrats, the White House claimed that Biden did not call Trump supporters “garbage,” but was instead referring to one Trump supporter — namely, comedian Tony Hinchliffe.
The White House released a transcript that reinforced that argument, adding an apostrophe to “supporters” to read “supporter’s,” and then adding an em-dash to make it seem like Biden had not completed his sentence.
The transcript said (emphasis added):
The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter’s — his — his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American.
Hinchliffe, known for his off-color jokes, had performed at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally on Sunday and had joked that Puerto Rico was a “floating island of garbage.”
Biden also later posted on X that he was referring to Hinchliffe’s “demonization of Latinos.”
According to House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik (R-NY) and House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY), the White House’s addition of an apostrophe may have violated the Presidential Records Act.
In a letter to White House Counsel Edward Siskel, they demanded that the White House retain and preserve all documents and internal communications related to Biden’s statement and the release of the inaccurate transcript.
They also called on the White House to correct the transcript to reflect what Biden said. They said:
President Biden’s vindictive words were unsurprising, given his previous statements regarding people who choose not to vote for his preferred candidate. Unsurprising too were the White House’s actions after he said them. Instead of apologizing or clarifying President Biden’s words, the White House instead sought to change them (despite them being recorded on video) by releasing a false transcript of his remarks. The move is not only craven, but it also appears to be in violation of federal law, including the Presidential Records Act of 1978.
“White House staff cannot rewrite the words of the President of the United States to be more politically on message. Though President Biden’s relevance continues to diminish, his words continue to matter, even as they become increasingly divisive and erratic,” they added.

Breitbart,Mavericks Principal Owners Donate $100 Million to Republicans Despite Mark Cuban Claiming Trump Has 'Fascist Tendencies',"Miriam Adelson, the principal owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks, has put down $100 million on Donald Trump to win the 2024 presidential election. This is despite the caterwauling of minority owner and extreme left-wing advocate Mark Cuban, who has been all-in for Kamala Harris.
Cuban has jumped in front of every microphone he can find to push for the election of Kamala Harris. Still, the team for which he used to be the majority owner and is now a minority owner is apparently working to the contrary, according to Front Office Sports.
Adelson has been a top Republican donor since inheriting her husband’s fortune. Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson was also a big GOP backer but passed away in 2021. Since then, his wife has kept the GOP faith and remained a top donor.
Miriam Adelson, a doctor who specializes in substance addiction, bought out Mark Cuban’s majority ownership of the Mavericks in 2023. However, Cuban still owns a bit more than one-fourth of the team.
The two, though, could not be more different politically. Cuban, who recently said Trump “absolutely” has “fascist tendencies,” is a staunch left-winger. However, he also claims he has not donated to the Harris campaign despite being a loud mouthpiece for her.
It appears Cuban is unwilling to let political differences stand in the way of making a buck, or several billion of them.
While Adelson is by far the biggest political donor for the GOP in the NBA, several other owners have also contributed hefty cash to politics.
Houston Rockets owner Tilman Fertitta donated $420,000 to several PACs working for Trump’s second term. However, he also gave $13,200 to Harris PACs.
Minnesota Lynx and Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor donated to the GOP, but it wasn’t to Trump. Taylor, who was himself a GOP state senator from Minnesota, donated $2,000 to Nikki Haley before she dropped out of the primary race.
Meanwhile, Sixers Co-Owner David Blitzer also signed on with Haley, making a personal donation of the maximum of $3,300. But since Haley failed, he turned to Harris, giving $31,600 to a Harris PAC.
Meanwhile, Indiana Pacers and Fever owner Herb Simon donated $100,000 to pro-Harris PACs.
Even excluding Adelson, NBA owners have given a bit more to Trump ($424,650) than Harris ($274,800).

Breitbart,Fact Check: Harris Campaign Twists Trump Comment on Liz Cheney to Claim He Called for Her Execution,"CLAIM: Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign implied former President Donald Trump called for Liz Cheney to be put before a firing squad.
FACT CHECK: False. Trump’s comments on “guns trained on her face” were about Cheney stoking foreign wars without being willing to fight in their front lines.
Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign took former President Donald Trump’s words out of context, to suggest that he was calling for Liz Cheney to be put before a firing squad.
Her campaign posted a video of Trump speaking to Tucker Carlson on X/Twitter, with a caption that paraphrased him:
Let’s put Liz Cheney with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her. Let’s see how she feels about it when the guns are trained on her face
Rather than suggesting she be executed, Trump was speaking about how neoconservatives are quick to send young Americans to fight overseas in war — which Trump has long opposed, particularly the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars championed by Cheney and her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney.
Trump had also said: “They’re all war hawks when they’re sitting in Washington in a nice building saying Oh gee, let’s send 10,000 troops into the mouths of the enemy.”
Karoline Leavitt, Trump Campaign National Press Secretary, blasted the Harris-Walz campaign:
President Trump is 100% correct that warmongers like Liz Cheney are very quick to start wars and send other Americans to fight them, rather than go into combat themselves. This is the continuation of the latest fake media outrage days before the election in a blatant attempt to interfere on behalf of Kamala Harris.
Cheney herself tried to spread the lie, posting on X:
This is how dictators destroy free nations. They threaten those who speak against them with death. We cannot entrust our country and our freedom to a petty, vindictive, cruel, unstable man who wants to be a tyrant. #Womenwillnotbesilenced #VoteKamala
As Democrat operatives tired to spread the false claim, even Trump critic former Rep. Joe Walsh said Trump did not call for her to be put before a firing squad.
He posted on X:
Trump did NOT call for Liz Cheney to be executed.
This is what’s so wrong with our politics today. Look, you know how I feel about Trump, and I’ve been out there every day for 2-3 months campaigning my ass off to help get @KamalaHarris elected, but this short clip is so deceptive. Trump is NOT calling for Liz Cheney to be executed in front of a firing line. He’s not. Listen to the entirety of what he said. In Trump’s typically stupid, ugly fashion, he’s trying to make a point about Cheney’s stance on war. But Aaron (who I like & respect), by posting ONLY this 11 second clip, makes it look like he’s calling for her to be executed. He’s not. He’s an utterly horrible human being who’s utterly unfit for office, but the truth should always matter. And the truth is that Trump is not calling for Liz Cheney to be executed. But…this 11 second clip will have a gazillion views, and the truth will have just a handful of views.
Both former Vice President Cheney and former Wyoming Republican Rep. Cheney has endorsed Harris, with the younger Cheney even campaigning on the trail for her.",2024-11-01
Breitbart,"Harris Co-Chair: She's Different from Biden, He Didn't Have Problem of 'Lowering Costs'","On Tuesday’s broadcast of CNN’s “Laura Coates Live,” Harris Campaign Co-Chair Mitch Landrieu stated that 2024 Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris differentiated herself from President Joe Biden “by saying, listen, I love the President, we did great work together, but I have different problems than he had, the most important of which is lowering costs for the American people. And I think she addressed it really very forthrightly and better tonight than she has in the past.”
Host Laura Coates asked, “On that point of her trying to distinguish herself from Biden, was there a key moment in that speech that you think voters will connect to to suggest, yes, she will be different?”
Landrieu answered, “Well, first of all, it was an incredible night. I was there, and there were 70,000 people there. … We were going to go to Madison Square Garden, but we couldn’t fit. So, we had to go there. It was just a huge turnout and it was exuberant and it was joyful and the environment in which she gave the speech was really uplifting and hopeful, which is what the speech was. It was a fairly detailed speech. She laid out, in clear detail, what the risks are of re-electing Donald Trump. She talked about the fact that, behind her, was the Resolute Desk, and, in seven days the people are going to decide whether she’s going to be sitting there or Donald Trump’s going to be sitting there and she reminded the public that Donald Trump has already talked about, out of his own mouth, spending his time talking about his enemies list, and the fact that she had a to-do list. And then she’s talked about how she is going to build an opportunity economy for all of us, not just some of us, and distinguished herself from Joe Biden by saying, listen, I love the President, we did great work together, but I have different problems than he had, the most important of which is lowering costs for the American people. And I think she addressed it really very forthrightly and better tonight than she has in the past.”

Breitbart,Quinnipiac Poll: Trump Takes Lead in Pennsylvania,"Former President Donald Trump has a two point lead in a hypothetical two-way race with Vice President Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania (49-47 percent), a seven point swing since September 16, Quinnipiac survey found Wednesday.
Trump’s lead is just within the margin of error of 2.1 percentage points. The poll sampled 2,186 likely voters in Pennsylvania from October 24 – 28.
The poll by Quinnipiac, which often leans left, suggests Trump holds the momentum during the period of early voting with less than a week until Election Day.
Below is the trend of the last three Quinnipiac surveys demonstrating the momentum:
October 28
- Trump: 49% (+2)
- Harris: 47%
October 7
- Harris: 49% (+2)
- Trump: 47%
September 16
- Harris: 51% (+5)
- Trump: 46%
The poll’s analysis suggested that the gender gap increased:
Men back Trump 57 – 37 percent, while women back Harris 55 – 39 percent. In Quinnipiac University’s October 9 poll, men backed Trump 52 – 41 percent, while women backed Harris 55 – 40 percent.
“The gender gap widens with Trump increasing his lead among men, as what remains a very tight race heads into the final stretch,” Quinnipiac University Polling Analyst Tim Malloy said in a statement.

Breitbart,Dem Rep. Frost: Biden Called Trump Supporters Garbage Because He Was 'Very Angry',"Representative Maxwell Frost (D-FL) claimed Wednesday during an appearance on “CNN News Central” that President Joe Biden misspoke when he called supporters of former President Donald Trump garbage because he was “very angry.”
Co-host Brianna Keilar said, “The Harris campaign, needing to refocus the narrative today after President Biden appeared to refer to supporters of Donald Trump as garbage. A remark, he later tried to clarify saying that he was referring only to comedian Tony Hinchcliffe.”
She asked, “The White House is sort of saying this was about him saying supporter’s, apostrophe s. I just wonder if when you’re debating the existence of an apostrophe if you’ve lost the argument here?”
Frost said, “The comments that we heard at that rally were completely disgusting about Puerto Rican Americans. I was very angry about it and I think the president was very angry about it, thinking about and talking about it. I think he misspoke.”
He added, “He’s someone who loves every American I think he misspoke because he was angry thinking about the bigotry we heard at Madison Square Garden. Honestly, I think that’s it.”
Keilar said, “You think he misspoke. Do you do you think that there actually is an apostrophe s, that he was talking about Hinchcliffe?”
Frost said, “The president was talking about that guy specifically, but also just everything said from that stage at that rally.”

Breitbart,Rashida Tlaib Chooses Not to Endorse Kamala Harris at UAW Rally,"Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MN) refused to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris on Friday while encouraging people in Michigan not to “underestimate the power” they have.
During a United Auto Workers (UAW) union rally in Detroit, Michigan, Tlaib encouraged Michigan voters to make their voices heard in the election and to”turn out people” to cast their vote, according to Detroit News.
While Tlaib declined to endorse Harris, in a post on X, she described former President Donald Trump as being “a proud Islamophobe” and a “serial liar who doesn’t stand for peace.”
Tlaib’s made these comments about Trump as his support among the Arab American and Muslim American community has increased and as he has received endorsements from Muslim Americans in Michigan.
“Don’t underestimate the power you all have,” Tlaib said. “More than those ads, those lawn signs, those billboards, you all have more power to turn out people that understand we’ve got to fight back against corporate greed in our country.”
The outlet noted that Tlaib “focused her speech to UAW members on down ballot races”:
She focused her speech to UAW members on down ballot races, specifically the judicial races, voicing support for Democratic-nominated Michigan Supreme Court candidates Kyra Harris Bolden and Kimberley Thomas in their respective races against Republicans Patrick O’Grady and Andrew Fink.
In May, Tlaib suggested that people vote against President Joe Biden, who was the Democrat Party’s presidential nominee at the time, because of the current administration’s handling of the Israel and Hamas war.
While Tlaib did not deliver an endorsement of Harris at the UAW rally, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) said that Michigan was “the place where miracles happen,” adding that it would “deliver a Kamala Harris presidency,” according to the outlet.",2024-11-02
Breitbart,"Ukraine and Russia Exchange Drone Strikes, Child Injured","KYIV, Ukraine (AP) – Russia and Ukraine exchanged scores of drone strikes Wednesday as North Korea’s top diplomat arrived in Russia for talks after his country reportedly deployed thousands of soldiers to help Moscow’s war efforts.
Ukraine’s air force said that Russia launched 62 drones and one missile overnight, adding that 33 of them were intercepted and 25 were jammed.
The drones struck a residential building and a kindergarten in Kyiv, injuring nine people, including a child, according to the city administration. “Russian drones did not change their constant tactics – they approached the capital from different directions, at different heights,” it said.
Russian attacks also targeted other regions of Ukraine, killing at least four and injuring about 30 others over the past 24 hours, authorities said.
At the same time, Russian forces have pressed their slow-moving offensive in eastern Ukraine. In Moscow, the Defense Ministry announced the capture of the village of Kruhlyakivka in the Kharkiv region.
The ministry said that air defenses downed 25 Ukrainian drones over several regions in the country’s west and southwest.
The new attacks come as North Korea’s Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui arrived in Moscow for talks that South Korea’s spy agency said could involve discussions on sending additional troops to Russia and what the North would get in return.
The Pentagon said North Korea has sent about 10,000 troops to Russia, and that they will likely fight against Ukraine “over the next several weeks.”
Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder, the Pentagon press secretary, said Tuesday that a “relatively small number” of North Korean troops are now in the Kursk region, where Russia has struggled to push back a Ukrainian incursion.",2024-10-30

So, she’s got to be respectful, talk more about what her economic plans are. I’ve said to them, I said a month ago, union halls don’t know who she is.

Breitbart,Brett Favre Compares America During Trump's First Term to the Packers: 'A Winner',"NFL Hall of Famer and Packers legend Brett Favre knows what a winning organization looks like, and he sees a winner when hearkens back to America under President Trump.
Speaking at Wednesday’s Trump rally at the Resch Center in Green Bay, Wisconsin, the Packer legend addressed the assembled crowd in a language they would immediately understand.
“Much like the Packers organization, Donald Trump and his organization is a winner,” Favre said. “The United States of America won with his leadership.”
Favre’s presence on the podium at a political rally shocked many, not the least of whom was Favre, who said he never envisioned himself back in Green Bay, speaking to the Packer faithful in that kind of setting.
However, as Favre explained, the state of the world and our country’s dire straits compelled him to speak.
“I think there’s never been a more important time in our lives than right now in this election,” Favre said. “First and foremost, are there any Packer fans in the house?”
Predictably, that question got a resounding roar. However, other parts of Favre’s speech would also be warmly welcomed. For example, he likened the repeated failures and struggles during the early part of his career with the Packers to the current failures of the Biden-Harris administration and the “insanity” of expecting anything to get better unless changes were made.
“Sounds like the first couple of years of my tenure here with the Packers,” Favre said. “Mike Holmgren would say, ‘What in the hell are you doing, Brett?’ I said, ‘Hell, I don’t know, Mike.’ But we figured out a way to get it done.
“It would be insane to give Kamala four more years in office,” Favre exclaimed.
The Packer legend also rebuked President Biden for calling Trump’s supporters “garbage.”
“I can assure you we’re not garbage. How dare he say that? I see police officers, teachers, nurses, grandparents, students. I see everyday Americans that make this country great,” Favre explained.",2024-11-01
Breitbart,'The Choice Is Clear to Me': LeBron James Endorses Kamala Harris for President,"NBA superstar LeBron James has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in her bid for the presidency in a statement attached to a civil-rights-themed video posted on social media.
The video casts President Trump as a spreader of “hate.”
“What are we even talking about here??” wrote James in a social media post. “When I think about my kids and my family and how they will grow up, the choice is clear to me. VOTE KAMALA HARRIS!!!”
The video features clips of Trump taken out of context and set against the backdrop of scenes from the civil rights era and more recent times of racial unrest, casting the former president as an enemy of voting rights, the civil rights movement in general, and black people in particular.
The video and James’ endorsement come at a time when Harris and the Democrats are seeing notable drops in support among black people and Latinos.
James’ endorsement should come as no surprise. The future Hall of Famer has used his platform online and on television to advocate for every leftist policy on the Democrat platform. He has also endorsed former President Barack Obama in 2008, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016, and President Joe Biden in 2020.
The animosity between Trump and James is no secret either.
In 2018, Trump blasted James for doing an interview with then-CNN anchor Don Lemon.
“Lebron James was just interviewed by the dumbest man on television, Don Lemon,” Trump wrote on social media. “He made Lebron look smart, which isn’t easy to do. I like Mike!”
In addition, in 2022, Trump invited James to join his women’s basketball team. James did not respond to the invitation.",2024-11-01
Breitbart,'This Is the 'Basket of Deplorables' Moment': Ramaswamy Says Biden 'Garbage' Comments Our 'October Surprise',"Tuesday, during an appearance on FNC’s “Hannity,” Trump surrogate Vivek Ramaswamy declared President Joe Biden’s “garbage” comments to be the GOP’s “October surprise.”
Ramaswamy speculated that Biden’s family was rooting for Trump to win on November 5, suggesting this was not necessarily linked to Biden’s apparent cognitive decline.
“Here’s the October surprise,” he said. “It just arrived. This is the ‘basket of deplorables’ moment. That’s what Hillary said in 2016 that tanked her campaign. Well, that is the Joe Biden-Kamala Harris moment right now. I am a little bit more cynical about this one, Sean, in the following way: It might look like Joe Biden’s usual cognitive deficit kicked in. But the reality is we know his family is probably rooting for Trump, not Kamala Harris to win because they feel vengeful about how they were treated. So if you are in their shoes, that comment might tank heiress but motivations to one side.”
“But regardless of motivations, it is a welcome October surprise because let’s take a big step back and look at what’s going on here,” Ramaswamy continued. “The wheels are coming off the car. They are spiraling. And now you see the accusations — the other side being Hitler or piles of garbage. You’re going to hear a lot about threats to democracy in the next week. They are flailing, Sean. Understand, Americans are not falling for their trick anymore. Donald Trump has a record that he is running on. They are frustrated by it. And it is in some ways, I think, a beautiful thing for our side to watch — to watch this completely come undone.”

Breitbart,AOC Gushes over Doug Emhoff as Ideal Man Brimming with 'Masculinity',"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) gushed over Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff on Wednesday night applauding him as the very model of modern masculinity at a campaign event for his wife Kamala Harris.
“He’s not afraid to embody and pass on these values of security and this idea that you can, you can let your girl shine,” Ocasio-Cortez told a room full of students at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, according to the Daily Mail.
“And he embodies that really well. We should all be really, really proud of him.” She told students the example Emhoff has set “has been incredibly important this presidential cycle.”
Ocasio-Cortez continued, “A lot of ideas of what being a man means putting a woman down or putting queer people down. And this idea that, like, in order to elevate one’s value, we need to diminish the people around us.”
Public praise of Emhoff as an example of secure masculinity came less than a week after a purported ex-girlfriend identified only as Jane came forward and said he slapped her at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival after believing she was flirty with a valet, as Breitbart News reported.
Emhoff has vehemently denied the accusations.
AOC echoes previous media backing for Emhoff with the Washington Post publishing an opinion piece in August calling him a “modern-day sex symbol,” “fantasy man,” and “ideal partner” despite reports he impregnated his children’s nanny while married to his ex-wife.
Catherine Rampell, a political columnist at the Post and CNN commentator, wrote, “Move over, Ryan Gosling. The modern female fantasy is embodied by the man who might soon become our first First Gentleman.”
Rampell argued Emhoff is “sexy” because he is “secure enough with his own masculinity to sometimes prioritize his wife’s ambitions over his own.”
As for the New York Democrat, she finished her public tribute with yet more praise.
“He’s able to stand beside the vice president’s side and lift her up instead of put her down,” AOC said, according to the Mail report.
“And he knows that by lifting of women, he’s also lifting up his fellow men around him. He’s not afraid to be a dad of a powerful daughter and a great son.”",2024-10-31

Breitbart,Desperation Dude: Hollywood Elite Jeff Bridges Records 11th Hour Appeal to Montana to Back ‘Man of the Land’ Democrat Jon Tester,"Hollywood star Jeff Bridges has launched a last-minute pitch to shore up support for Democrat Senator Jon Tester in Montana as the 2024 election comes down to the wire and with Tester losing support.
Bridges, famous for his “The Dude” character in the 1998 cult classic The Big Lebowski, had officially endorsed Tester back on October 18 when he appeared at a College Democrats event at Montana State University.
Now the Tron actor has floated a campaign video, insisting that “Senator Jon Tester is the real deal. He’s a farmer, cares about the people of this state, and is the backbone of Montana.”
It might seem like a desperate, last-minute attempt to boost Tester if the polls are any indication. Senator Tester is flagging in many late polls, falling behind Republican rival Tim Sheehy.
Five Thirty Eight, for instance, has Sheehy at 49.6 percent to Tester’s 44.3 percent on its October 31 survey.
Emerson College was also bullish on Sheehy with its more recent polling showing Sheehy at 50 percent to Tester’s 46 percent.
But like so many polls this year, the results are often mixed. Other polling was a tad less optimistic for Sheehy as the MSU Billings Mountain States Poll found Tester and Sheehy tied at 43 percent each.
And still, the Daily Montanan claimed the race was a “dead heat” with Tester leading 51 percent to Sheehy’s 48 percent.
The race is vitally important for the control of the U.S. Senate. If the Democrats lose Tester, that will go a long way toward throwing control of the upper chamber back to the Republicans.

Breitbart,UK Gov't Accused of Covering Up Alleged Terror Ties of Southport Suspect,"The leftist Labour Party government in Britain is facing accusations of a cover-up over the mass stabbing at a children’s dance party in Southport after the suspect was charged with terror offences.
According to reports from the BBC and The Telegraph, top-level government officials were made aware over the past few weeks that Axel Rudakubana, 18, the second-generation Rwandan migrant suspected of killing three young girls and injuring ten others at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party in Southport on July 29, faced potential terror charges over allegedly producing the deadly toxin Ricin and downloading an Al-Qaeda terror manual.
The Southport mass stabbing sparked widespread anti-mass migration protests and riots in England over the summer, resulting in over a thousand arrests and hundreds sent to prison. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, speculation ran rampant on social media about the potential motive and identity of the then-unidentified suspect.
Authorities were quick to condemn “misinformation” about the case, which seemingly led to a protest-turned-riot outside a local mosque in Southport. Police initially merely identified the suspect as having been born in Wales. However, after the Liverpool Crown Court lifted reporting restrictions on the case to quell speculation on August 1, it was revealed suspect Axel Rudakubana was born to Rwandan migrants living in Wales in 2006.
Figures, such as Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, had faced heavy criticism for questioning whether the attack was terror-related amid the information vacuum in the aftermath of the Southport killings. On Wednesday, he questioned whether the new developments may have vindicated his original position.
The Free Speech Union, meanwhile, stated of the new charges and how they may impact some of those who were jailed after the attack for social media posts: “We suspect some of the prosecutions of people for saying supposedly inflammatory things on social media may now be unsafe – for instance, the man in Cumbria sentenced to eight weeks in jail for reposting three allegedly ‘Islamophobic’ memes on Facebook. At the very least, it may be grounds for appealing their often draconian jail sentences.”
Although prosecutors still won’t be drawn on whether the mass stabbing itself was a terror attack, Rudakubana was charged on Tuesday with violating Section 58 of the Terrorism Act 2000 over allegedly downloading a pdf file named: “Military Studies in the Jihad Against the Tyrants: The Al-Qaeda Training Manual”. He was also charged with breaching Section 1 of the Biological Weapons Act 1974 over the alleged production of a biological toxin, with Ricin said to have been found in his home.
Former top Downing Street official Dominic Cummings has alleged that a cover-up is continuing, accusing the BBC of spreading “disinformation for Number 10” by reporting that the government was only made aware of the charges in the past few weeks.
Boris Johnson’s ex-chief advisor
.“The BBC uses clever wording re ‘aware of CHARGES’ to spread more disinformation. The ‘mainstream’ IS the disinformation,” Cummings said, adding that “the news has been dropped amid the budget [and] US election to try to hide the disinformation operation against the voters.”
The government has denied
the opposition Conservative Party of spreading “conspiracy theories and the undermining of public faith in our institutions and public servants.” Nevertheless, the police themselves say the Criminal Prosecution Service has advised them not to reveal further details.Both Conservative leadership candidates, former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch and former immigration minister Robert Jenrick, demanded the government disclose when it was made aware of Rudakubana’s alleged terrorist activities.
Jenrick said: “Any suggestion of a cover-up will permanently damage public trust in whether we’re being told the truth about crime in our country… Keir Starmer must urgently explain to the country what he knew about the Southport attack and when he learned it. Across the board, the hard reality of mass migration is being covered up. We need the truth – and we need to change.”
Badenoch added: “After the Southport murders and the ensuing protests and riots, some people asked me why I wasn’t commenting. This is why… Too many on all sides rush to conclusions before all the facts are clear. As more information emerges, it is quite clear that there are serious questions to be asked of the police, the CPS and also of Keir Starmer’s response to the whole situation.”
On Wednesday, during Prime Minister’s Questions, Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice questioned if Sir Keir Starmer agrees with Jonathan Hall KC, the government’s independent reviewer of terrorism laws, who “has said repeatedly recently that it is important in incidents of terrorism that the authorities put out more information sooner in order to prevent and information gap.”
Responding, Prime Minister Starmer declined to answer directly, merely taking the opportunity to score some political points. He said: “Erm, Mr Speaker, obviously, I’ll tread carefully in answering this question for the very reasons you yourself set out at the beginning of this session. I think it’s very important, first and foremost, that in all cases, including the particular difficult case that the Speaker mentioned earlier that the police and prosecutors are able to do their difficult job.”

Breitbart,"'No, Certainly Not' -- Tim Walz Denies 'Garbage' Smear Undercut Harris's 'Unity' Message","President Joe Biden’s “garbage” smear does not undercut the Vice President Kamala Harris message of “unity,”‘ Gov. Tim Walz (D) indicated Wednesday.
Biden’s smear on Tuesday overshadowed Harris’s closing argument that night in which she said she would be a president for “all Americans.”
The pledge came just days after she called former President Donald Trump a “fascist.”
“I have to ask, does that undercut this closing message of unity from your campaign,” asked CBS News’s Tony Dokoupil about Democrats long list of demonizing Trump supporters.
“No, certainly not,” Walz replied:
On ABC’s Good Morning America, George Stephanopoulos asked Walz: “Was calling Trump supporters garbage? He says he was talking about the comedian. What’s your response to that? Did it step on the Vice President’s message?”
“The President’s clarified his remarks,” Walz replied.
Biden tried to clarify his remarks by denying he referred to Trump supporters as “garbage”:
Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage—which is the only word I can think of to describe it. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation.
Walz continued to spin Biden’s comment and claimed Trump called the county “garbage”:
But let’s be very clear, the Vice President and I have made it absolutely clear that we want everyone as a part of this. Donald Trump’s divisive rhetoric is what needs to end. He called this a garbage country, and continues on from the enemy within which you heard Vice President Harris say.
Trump also posted a response shortly after midnight:
While I am running a campaign of positive solutions to save America, Kamala Harris is running a campaign of hate. She has spent all week comparing her political opponents to the most evil mass murderers in history.
Now, on top of everything, Joe Biden calls our supporters “garbage.”
You can’t lead America if you don’t love the American People. Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have shown they are both unfit to be President of the United States.

Breitbart,JD Vance to Joe Rogan: Amnesty Will End Democracy,"An establishment amnesty for the roughly 25 million illegal migrants in the United States would “end democracy,” and convert the U.S. into a one-party state like California, JD Vance, Donald Trump’s hand-picked running mate, told host Joe Rogan on Thursday.
“I’m a Reagan guy, right?” Vance said in his three-hour interview with Joe Rogan, adding:
I’m a conservative Republican. But [President Ronald] Reagan screwed up a lot … People don’t talk nearly enough about the amnesty thing … Because of what Ronald Reagan did in the 1986 amnesty, California is now effectively a permanently blue state.
“The entire country becomes that” if Democrats push through an amnesty, Vance added.
But mass migration imposes huge costs on Americans, even without an amnesty, he said.
Even when migrants do not hold citizenship, they get a share of representation in Congress, Vance said:
For example, the state of Ohio lost a congressional seat in the last census [in 2020 so] states that have high illegal immigrant populations picked up congressional seats. So you’re actually taking away congressional representation from American citizens and giving it to illegal aliens. Even if you don’t give them the right to vote, you’re still destroying the voting power [of citizens].
Immigration also imposes massive civic and economic burdens on Americans’ communities, Vance said:
You see this in some communities — because they’re small towns, and because rapid migrant influxes can happen very quickly — here the town population has been doubled. You don’t even have to assume people are criminals …[but] what does it do to the local public school when all of a sudden 1,000 [migrants] show up that don’t even speak English, right?
What does it do to the [town’s] hospital system when you now have thousands of people … that are showing up to get emergency services because they don’t have access otherwise to a doctor, and now the American citizens have to wait in line for seven hours to get to see a doctor because we’ve overwhelmed the local hospital system?
What does it do to housing prices? We’ve seen this in a number of communities, including those that I represent in Ohio. When you bring in thousands and thousands of people, you cannot build enough houses quickly enough to accommodate that. So the cost of housing becomes unaffordable for American citizens.
Those costs are largely ignored by the national media, which mostly hire pro-migration reporters– including many immigrants — to cover migration dramas.
“It is the craziest thing that we’ve seen in this country that you don’t even allow people to talk about the effects of mass migration anymore,” Vance said, adding:
One of the reasons why Donald Trump is going to be elected president, or at least should be elected president, [is] because he is one of the few guys who’s saying, “You know what, we’re going to talk about this problem. Yes, some immigrants are good [and] some immigrants are not good.” That is an obvious insight to anybody who knows human nature.
But it is money that drives the nation’s migration policy, Vance said. “I think what is obvious, and I’ve seen this in the halls of Congress,” he said, adding:
I’ve seen it very explicitly. You talk about lobbying [in other political issues], and we obviously talked about [it] in the context of other industries. There is a massive corporate lobby for cheap labor in the United States of America. That is, I think, the main thing that’s going on.
Let me tell you a story when I was in the private sector. I was at a business conference dinner, and I was seated next to the CEO of one of the largest hotel chains in America … The guy was going on and on about how much he hates Donald Trump. And I’m like, “Oh, that’s interesting, why do you hate Donald Trump so much?”
Because, again, I was, I was sort of a Trump skeptic in 2015 and at this point, I was kind of starting to really get on the Trump train.
And he said, “Well, the reason I hate Donald Trump … is because Donald Trump’s border policies have cut down the number of illegal immigrants. And because I can’t pay illegal immigrants under the table anymore, I have to pay American workers, and they want much higher wages.”
I was like, “Holy shit! This guy just admitted what is straight-up, Monopoly Man evil shit. My wife, who’s very apolitical, was actually at the dinner with me, and she’s like, “Come again, you just said you don’t want Americans to get decent wages?”
The best argument for Donald Trump’s immigration policy is that American workers are getting higher wages, and this is why this corporate CEO hates it. So whatever the industry is, you’ve got a lot of people who want cheap labor and they don’t want to pay American workers higher wages. That’s a big part of it.
But Democrats also want to get political advantage from the inflow of poor migrants, Vance added:
I do think there’s also a power dynamic to it. In particular, I think Kamala Harris and the Democrats, they want to give these millions upon millions of illegal aliens the right to vote. They want to legalize them. They want to make it easier for them to participate in our elections. And that means, fundamentally, the end of American democracy, because you’re talking about 25 million [illegal migrant] people here.
If Kamala Harris gives 10 million of those people legal status and allows them to vote in American elections. Then, say, 70/30 they go [vote] Democrat, Republicans will never win a national election in this country in my lifetime.
“It will have degraded the voting power of the people who have the legal right to be here,” he added.
Breitbart News has closely tracked the impact of migration on Americans’ blue-collar and white-collar wages, their housing, and, increasingly, on Americans’ productivity.
“We always used to think [a] shrinking population is a cause for negative [economic] growth,” BlackRock founder Larry Fink said at a pro-globalist event in April hosted by the World Economic Forum in Saudi Arabia. He continued:
But in my conversations with the leadership of these large, developed countries [such as China, and Japan] that have xenophobic anti-immigration policies, they don’t allow anybody to come in — [so they have] shrinking demographics — these countries will rapidly develop robotics and AI and technology … If a promise of all that transforms productivity, which most of us think it will [emphasis added] — we’ll be able to elevate the standard living in countries, the standard of living for individuals, even with shrinking populations.
Overall, since about 1990, the US. government has used an economic policy of Extraction Migration from poor countries to inflate the nation’s consumer economy with extra workers, consumers, and renters. That economic policy has helped grow the economy Congress helped investors to export much of the nation’s manufacturing economy to lower-wage countries.",2024-10-31
Breitbart,'Sopranos' Star Drea de Matteo Blasts Mark Cuban's Insult to Trump-Voting Women,"Actress Drea de Matteo, who starred in HBO’s The Sopranos, has blasted billionaire and Kamala Harris surrogate Mark Cuban over his insult to women who support former President Donald Trump, saying the left is “messing with the wrong breed of women.”
In a new social media video, Drea de Matteo hit back at Mark Cuban after he said during a recent appearance on ABC’s The View that no “strong, intelligent women” would support Trump.
“Guess you haven’t met me yet, buddy,” she told him. “It takes a lot of balls to come out and support the anti-war machine, and you know it.”
She added: “I support Donald Trump like my life depends on it and my kids’ lives.”
As Breitbart News reported, Trump responded Thursday to Mark Cuban’s statement on The View that he is never around “strong, intelligent women.”
Trump posted on Truth Social “I surround myself with the strongest of women” and that “all strong women, and women in general, should be very angry about this weak man’s statement.”
Actress Kristy Swanson, who played the title roll in the popular 1992 movie Buffy the Vampire Slayer, also hit back at Cuban’s insult to women.

Breitbart,"San Fran. Official: There Will Be 'Resistance' to Mass Deportations, Like We Had from Courts","On Thursday’s broadcast of WBUR’s “Here and Now,” Managing Director of the Immigration Defense Unit at the San Francisco Public Defender’s Office Francisco Ugarte stated that if 2024 Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump is elected the “idea that Trump could just simply get away with engaging in mass deportation without any semblance of a resistance is really kind of far-fetched.” And cited California’s Supreme Court saying that ICE agents shouldn’t be in courthouses because that deters people from going to court as an example of this.
Ugarte said, “They did try and do courthouse arrests. But, when they sent ICE agents, one time, to the local courthouse here in San Francisco, within a day, there was a massive rally of community members and a declaration from the Supreme Court…of California saying, don’t invade the space of the courts, because you’ll deter people from going to courts. So, this idea that Trump could just simply get away with engaging in mass deportation without any semblance of a resistance is really kind of far-fetched. Things like mass deportation or these, like, sweeping human rights abuses are really, ultimately, not very popular among the American public.”

Breitbart,"Saudi Arabia, Alienated by Biden, Hosts Summit on Creating Palestinian State","The government of Saudi Arabia hosted the inaugural meeting of the “International Alliance to Implement the Two-State Solution,” a nebulous coalition organized by Riyadh to formalize the creation of a Palestinian state.
Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan used the opportunity to accuse Israel of “genocide” for engaging in military operations against the genocidal terrorist organizations Hamas and Hezbollah. The administration of outgoing President Joe Biden sent a State Department envoy to the meeting, though meetings at press time do not indicated Washington played a prominent role in the event.
The “international alliance” is one of several diplomatic measures Saudi Arabia is taking to publicly oppose Israel’s attempts to protect itself from genocidal jihadists, pivoting away from the direction Riyadh was taking prior to Biden taking office of potential normalization with Jerusalem. Under Biden’s predecessor Donald Trump, Saudi Arabia greatly enhanced its anti-terror cooperation with the United States, establishing the Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology in 2017 and going to war with the Iran-backed Houthi terrorists of Yemen. Biden prioritized antagonizing Saudi Arabia in his foreign policy, however, vowing to turn the major Middle East nation into a “pariah” state during the 2020 presidential election and attempting to improve diplomacy with Iran.
Biden tried to make amends with the Saudi government during a catastrophic visit to the country in 2o22 that yielded no strategic deliverables for America and resulted in circulating gossip that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman mocked Biden’s “mental acuity.”
Despite Biden’s efforts, Mohammed bin Salman, commonly known by his initials MBS, did not appear to entirely abandon the possibility of normalizing ties with Israel until the unprecedented Hamas siege of Israel on October 7, 2023, which killed about 1,200 civilians, including children as young as infants, and featured extensive acts of torture, gang rape, abduction, and desecration of corpses. Shortly after the attacks, MBS began demanding the establishment of a state of “Palestine” with its capital in Jerusalem – the capital of Israel – in public addresses, which he had conspicuously omitted from other comments prior to the attacks about diplomacy with Israel.
The Saudi government first announced the creation of the “Global Alliance to Implement a Two-State Solution” in late September on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. At the time, Prince Faisal, the foreign minister, said that the alliance was a joint effort between European countries and the member of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).
“Self-defence cannot justify the killing of tens of thousands of civilians and the practice of systematic destruction, forced displacement, the use of starvation as a tool of war,” Prince Faisal denounced then, “incitement and dehumanisation, and systematic torture in its most heinous forms, including sexual violence and other crimes documented according to United Nations reports.”
Reports on the first meeting of the alliance were light on details of any active measures taken. Prince Faisal offered comments in which he condemned Israeli operations against Hamas and Hezbollah, which have eliminated much of the senior leadership of those grounds, as “catastrophic.
“A genocide is happening with the goal of evicting the Palestinian people from their land, which Saudi Arabia rejects,” he claimed on Wednesday. The foreign minister was not quoted as similarly condemning the explicitly genocidal aims of the jihadist groups in question, such as replacement Hezbollah chief Naim Qassem stating on Wednesday that a “ceasefire” with Israel was possible if the entire population of Israel was expelled from its country.
The Saudi foreign minister boasted that nearly 90 countries had attended the Alliance meeting, which is expected to last two days, and reports noted that it would also discuss defending the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) for Palestinians, which Israeli officials have found to be closely linked to Hamas terror operations in Gaza.
In addition to the summit this week, the Saudis announced that the country would host an “Arab-Islamic summit” on November 11 “to discuss countering Israeli aggression,” according to the Emirati newspaper the National.
Saudi Arabia’s leadership against Israel is a dramatic pivot away from the position the country was in during the Trump administration and even as recently as September 2023. That month, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said in an interview that his country was seeking ways to improve relations with Israel.
“For us, the Palestinian issue is very important,” MBS told Fox News. “We need to solve that part. … We hope that it will reach a place that it will ease the life of the Palestinians, and get Israel back as a player in the Middle East.”
If an agreement would “give the Palestinians their needs and make the region calm, we’re going to work with whoever’s there,” he added.
Notably, MBS did not mention the creation of a Palestinian state as a precondition to peace with Israel.
In November 2023, at an event for members of the anti-American BRICS coalition, the crown prince condemned the Israeli government for responding to the Hamas attack and explicitly demanded a “Palestinian state … with East Jerusalem as its capital.”
“We reiterate our categorical rejection of these operations that have claimed the lives of thousands of children, women, and the elderly,” the de facto ruler said. “We demand an immediate stop of the military operations, and the provision of humanitarian corridors to enable international humanitarian organizations to perform their role and aid civilians.”
MBS repeated that promise in September.
“The kingdom will not stop its tireless work towards the establishment of an independent Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital, and we affirm that the kingdom will not establish diplomatic relations with Israel without that,” the crown prince asserted.
While Saudi Arabia continues to maintain a distance from the mass murderers of Hamas, its fraught relationship with the governing entity of the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority, has improved since the October 7 attacks. In September 2023, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said that he believed the Saudis had become disillusioned with the Palestinian Authority as its leadership was corrupt and it was a hindrance to improving ties to Israel. Nearly a year after the attacks, the Saudi government reportedly ended an eight-year embargo on funding the Palestinian Authority. Palestinian officials told the radical leftist New York Times (NYT) newspaper that Riyadh would be funding the entity to the tune of as much as $60 million.",2024-10-31
Breitbart,Exclusive -- Former Acting ICE Director Tom Homan: 3 Actions Would Solve 85% of Border Crisis,"Just a few actions would solve 85 percent of the border crisis, former acting ICE Director Tom Homan said during an interview on Breitbart News Daily.
“Congress needs — they just need to pass three laws and they’d solve 85 percent of the problem on the border,” he said, calling for an end to the Flores settlement agreement as well as a change in asylum laws. He also pointed to the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA).
“Those three things would solve 85 percent” of the issues at the border, he said, but he acknowledged that Congress will not act any time soon. Because of that, former President Donald Trump, should he win, must do a “series of executive orders,” which will make a huge difference.
“Remain in Mexico is a game-changer. That was a game changer that had more effect on the border in any policy I’ve seen in my 34-year career. Put the remain in Mexico program back into executive order” as well as catch and release, which will solve the “majority” of the United States’ problems on the southern border, he explained.
LISTEN:
Homan also addressed the recently aired 60 Minutes interview featuring himself — an interview that was completely chopped up — and responded to a segment showing a family scared of being torn apart due to Trump’s immigration policies.
“Whose fault is that? When they enter the country and they choose to have a child, who put them in that position? Not Tom Homan. Not President Trump. Not the system. They choose to enter this country illegally, and while here illegally, they choose to have a child or they bring other family members in there. They put themselves in that position, knowing damn well they’re here illegally, knowing damn well they have an order of removal they’re ignoring, and they’re in hiding,” he said, responding to the critiques.
“They put themselves in position. This is their problem. They created it. They can deal with it. It’s not Tom Homan’s problem. We’re going to — if the judge orders you removed, that’s what’s going to happen,” he added.

Breitbart,'Pure Gibberish': AOC Mocked for Arabic GOTV Flyer Printed Backwards,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), also known as AOC, is being mocked for a get-out-the-vote (GOTV) flyer that is printed partially in Arabic, because the Arabic is written backwards and in disconnected script.
Arabic is read and written right-to-left, meaning that some simple text translation programs might reverse the order of the letters inadvertently. In addition, most (but not all) of the letters are meant to be connected within words.
The first Arabic word on the flyer is meant to be “voting” in Arabic, but the order of the letters has been reversed.
Evidently, no one who actually understands Arabic was brought in to proofread the GOTV flyer before printing.
Democrats hoped to rely on Arab American voters to oppose Trump. But outrage at the Biden-Harris administration over the ongoing war in the Middle East has, however improbably, encouraged some Muslim voters to choose Trump in protest.
Moreover, there are many Arab Americans, in both Christian and Muslim communities, who oppose the radical social agenda and redistributionist economic policies of Vice President Kamala Harris and her party.
Trump has been receiving unexpected endorsements from Muslim and Arab Americans, in Michigan — where there is a large Arab American community — and beyond.

Breitbart,North Korea: ICBM Fired This Week Was New 'Hwasong-19' Model,"North Korea confirmed on Friday that the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) the communist regime tested on Thursday was a new model, identified as the “Hwasong-19.”
South Korean military officials confirmed on Thursday that the North had launched an ICBM, believed to be nuclear capable and able to reach all of the continental United States. The missile flew for 86 limits, a record for North Korean technology, and its performance coupled with the novel shape of its launch pad did not match the profiles of previously known North Korean ICBM models.
Both South Korean and Japanese officials warned this week that they expect especially belligerent behavior from Pyongyang in anticipation of the upcoming American presidential election. Both warned shortly before the ICBM launch that such a display was imminently possible, as well as the potential that North Korea could detonate a nuclear weapon to intimidate America and South Korea before the election on Tuesday.
The “Hwasong-19” debuted in the greater context of a documented North Korean military presence in Europe. South Korean, American, and Ukrainian officials have warned for weeks that communist dictator Kim Jong-un has agreed to send thousands of troops to Russia to train and ultimately fight in the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told his South Korean counterpart, Yoon Suk-yeol, this week that he anticipates as many as 12,000 North Korean troops could soon be operating in Ukraine. A video circulating on Ukrainian social media on Friday claimed to show a captured North Korean soldier.
Rodong Sinmun, the official North Korean regime newspaper, celebrated the “Hwasong-19” on Friday as a “tremendously powerful absolute weapon … showing signs of new strength the world has never experienced.” It published photos of a leather-clad Kim Jong-un, alongside daughter Kim Ju-ae, attending the launch of the ICBM, claiming the dictator to have experienced “great satisfaction” at the success of the weapon.
“The successful test-fire of the new-type ICBM has come to prove before the world that the dominant position the DPRK [North Korea] has secured in the development and manufacture of nuclear delivery means of the same kind is absolutely irreversible,” Rodong Sinmun paraphrased Kim as saying.
“He clearly reaffirmed that the DPRK would never change its line of bolstering up its nuclear forces under any circumstances,” the propaganda outlet relayed. “He once again stressed that only the peace that can be defended by the strength great enough to control and deter the enemy is the reliable, secure and durable peace.”
Rodong Sinmun claimed that America and South Korea pose “a grave danger” to North Korea that necessitates a greater investment in the country’s nuclear arsenal.
“The present grave reality … more clearly emphasizes the necessity of the absolute power capable of deterring the enemy and controlling the situation at all times and the validity of its steady increase,” the newspaper asserted.
The North Korean government almost immediately confirmed the missile launch on Thursday, contrary to its typical process of waiting a day before offering any commentary on an ICBM test. Its report aligned with information published by South Korean and Japanese officials, who stated that the missile, shot at a very steep angle, flew 621 miles across and 4,300 high.
In its initial confirmation of the test, the North Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) stated the missile “fully meets the purpose of informing the rivals [South Korea and America], who have intentionally escalated the regional situation and posed a threat to the security of our Republic recently, of our counteraction will.”
In remarks to the press on Friday, according to the Yonhap News Agency, appearing to confirm the North Korean claims, South Korean officials described the Hwasong-19 as the “largest long-range missile yet.”
“A South Korean military official told reporters on condition of anonymity that the Hwasong-19 is longer than the country’s previously known largest ICBM — the Hwasong-17,” Yonhap noted. “In comparison, the Hwasong-17’s TEL, which also has 11 axles, is about 23 meters long.”
“The size of the Hwasong-19, powered by solid propellant, also indicates that it has a relatively longer range and larger payload than the smaller solid-fuel Hwasong-18 solid-fuel ICBM that is presumed to be able to target the U.S. mainland,” it continued.
South Korean officials also suggested that the shape of the missile could potentially hold more than one nuclear warhead. Despite the updated capabilities of the Hwasong-19, South Korean officials dismissed the claim that it was an “ultimate” weapon, noting that its efficacy is still not confirmed as its ability to travel on a horizontal path, rather than being shot into the sky, remains unknown.
The Hwasong-19 may not be the last North Korean surprise before the American presidential election. Both Japanese and South Korean officials suggested this week that Pyongyang has fully refurbished the Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site, unused since 2017, meaning it could soon be used to detonate another nuclear weapon.
South Korean officials “suggested the North could launch an ICBM to verify its atmospheric reentry technology, at a timing targeting the US presidential election in November,” the Japanese news network NHK reported. The officials, it added, “have not ruled out North Korea going ahead with its seventh nuclear test around the time of the US presidential election.”
Japanese government Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters this week that North Korea “may undertake further provocative actions, such as launching various missiles, a satellite, or conducting a nuclear test.”",2024-11-01
Breitbart,Hungary's Orbán Convinced Donald Trump Will Bring Peace to Ukraine,"Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán said that he is “convinced” that if Donald Trump is sent back to the White House, he will immediately bring about a diplomatic solution to the war in Ukraine, with or without the help of the European Union.
Speaking alongside former German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder from Vienna this week, Mr Orbán said that if elected next week, Trump’s team will “sit down with the Russian president in no time and negotiate,” adding, “We are preparing.”
Orbán, one of the former president’s chief allies in Europe, accused Brussels of operating under a delusion, arguing that the EU leadership has refused to accept or failed to understand that Ukraine cannot win the war, Die Welt reports.
“This war is lost,” Orbán said. “The situation is getting worse and worse. If Europe does not want to send its own soldiers, it must finally accept that. The fact that Europe is proud of not communicating with Russia is barbaric and diplomatically illiterate.”
The populist leader did admit, however, that initial negotiations will not be for a broader peace agreement between the West, Ukraine, and Russia but rather to get a ceasefire to stop the bloodshed.
Schröder, a longtime ally of Vladimir Putin, agreed with the sentiment and said it was wrong for Berlin and Paris to criticise the Hungarian leader for advocating for a ceasefire during trips to Beijing, Kyiv, Moscow, and the United States. Instead, EU leaders should support peace efforts from Budapest.
Schröder also supported Trump’s desire to bring peace to Europe, saying that while he never thought he would back the Republican candidate, “I would praise him again”.
The former German chancellor, who has faced criticism for his business ties in Russia, such as holding positions with Nord Stream AG, Rosneft, and Gazprom, again accused former UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson of scuppering an early peace deal between Ukraine and Russia at a 2022 meeting in Istanbul.
On the other hand, Orbán argued that the peace deal lacked necessary guarantees and that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky had blocked peace talks, opting instead to continue the war.
Mr Trump has claimed that if elected, he would negotiate a ceasefire between Kyiv and Moscow before he is even inaugurated in January.
The former president has so far opted to keep his negotiating tactics close to his chest. However, following a meeting at his Mar-a-Lago residence earlier this year, Prime Minister Orbán suggested that cutting off American aid to Ukraine would likely be used to force Zelensky to the table.",2024-11-02
Breitbart,CNN's Collins: 'Hard' to Buy Spin on Biden's 'Garbage' Comments When You Can Watch Video,"On Tuesday’s broadcast of CNN’s “The Source,” host Kaitlan Collins stated that it’s hard to buy the White House’s attempt to clean up President Joe Biden’s statement about supporters of 2024 Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump “when you can listen to it for yourself” by just watching the video of the remarks.
While speaking with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D), Collins played video where Biden said, “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. His — his — his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American.”
She then stated that “it sounds like he’s calling Trump supporters, there, garbage.”
Collins added, “[T]he White House is trying to say that what President Biden was saying — they’re putting an apostrophe there on ‘supporters’, saying it’s the singular, I guess referring to the comedian, that supporter’s comments. It’s hard to really look at that when you can listen to it for yourself.”

Breitbart,Israel Says It Will Ensure Safety of Lebanon's Cultural Heritage Sites,"Israel said Thursday that it would ensure the safety of Lebanon’s cultural heritage sites, even as it evacuates cities that are near ancient ruins and archaeological treasures.
Many residents of Lebanon have expressed concern this week as the Israeli military has ordered evacuations in the city of Baalbek, in northeastern Lebanon.
The city is far from the region of southern Lebanon from which Hezbollah terrorists have been firing at Israel for more than a year, but Hezbollah has established a significant presence in the city, which is near the Syrian border, across which Hezbollah smuggles weapons supplied by the Iranian regime.
Baalbek includes Roman ruins that are listed as a World Heritage Site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and that are, the BBC notes, “are among the largest and best-preserved in the world.”
Israeli government spokesman David Mencer told a press briefing, in response to questions from Breitbart News, that that Israel had seen reports of requests to ensure that historical sites will not fall within the range of fire.
“The IDF [Israel Defense Forces] will, of course, ensure that is always the case,” Mencer said. However, he added that “ultimately, it is the fault of Hezbollah” that war had reached such areas, due to its decision to attack Israel without provocation over the past year.
He noted that the number of people evacuated from their homes in Israel was currently 58,000, “due to the incessant rocket fire,” which had killed 64 people and wounded 603, even before five more were killed and one wounded in an attack earlier in the day.
The border had been quiet for 17 years when Hezbollah began firing at Israel on October 8, after the Hamas terror attack.
In 2022, Israel and Lebanon signed a deal for the development of offshore natural gas resources, under which Israel gave up gas fields that were within its territorial waters in the hope that doing so would discourage Hezbollah from launching future wars.
Asked whether that had been a mistake, Mencer said that Israel would be “changing our strategy moving forward,” though stressing that Israel still sought peace with Lebanon and the Lebanese people.
He noted that while several Arab states have been willing to make peace with Israel, including through the Abraham Accords, the Iranian regime has “decided to develop its own empire, in which there is no place for the state of Israel,” which led to the current war, as Hezbollah is controlled by Iran.
Israel had dealt Iran a “crushing blow,” Mencer said, and would continued to confront Iran over its efforts to disrupt relations between Israel and the Arab states.

Breitbart,Biden’s 'Garbage' Smear Forces Vulnerable Senate Democrats to Scramble to Distance,"Vulnerable Democrat Senate candidates are scrambling away from President Joe Biden as his “garbage” smear on Trump supporters endangers candidates’ viability, while others refuse to say whether or not they actually think former President Donald Trump’s supporters are “garbage.”
Arizona Democrat Senate nominee Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-AZ) entirely dodged Breitbart News’s comment request in response to whether or not he thinks Trump supporters are garbage.
“I am running to represent all Arizonans, regardless of who they vote for,” he said.
Breitbart News followed up, again asking if he views Trump voters as garbage and for his response to Biden’s extremely divisive comment, as well as his take on Vice President Kamala Harris’s reaction to it.
Gallego did not respond to the following questions hours after they were asked.
Biden disparaged Trump supporters during a video call with Voto Latino on Tuesday.
“The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters,” Biden said.
The clip went viral on social media and upstaged Vice President Kamala Harris’s closing argument speech at the Ellipse in Washington, DC.
Gallego’s opponent, Republcian Kari Lake, slammed him and brought receipts from when he called Trump supporters “the worst people in the world” in 2016.
“People who hate us don’t deserve the privilege of representing us,” Lake wrote in a post on X. “I don’t hate anyone. I just want to help Arizonans.”
While Gallego responded to Breitbart News’s initial comment request but avoided the follow-up, the senate offices of Sens. Bob Casey (D-PA) and Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) did not respond to Breitbart News’s multiple comment requests Wednesday asking the senators, “Do you think Trump supporters are garbage?”
According to Washington Free Beacon investigative reporter Chuck Ross, a Casey spokesman gave a similar dodging statement that Gallego did to Breitbart News regarding the “garbage” insult.
“Senator Casey respects all Pennsylvanians regardless of how they vote,” the spokesperson said.
Republican businessman Dave McCormick, Casey’s opponent, blasted the weak statement on Wednesday night.
“Bob Casey cannot bring Pennsylvania together if he is too weak to condemn Joe Biden or anyone else calling half of our state garbage,” he wrote.
Inkl reports that “Baldwin’s campaign spokesman stated that Baldwin does not agree with President Biden’s comments.”
Republican businessman Eric Hovde, who is challenging Baldwin, released an ad Wednesday showing a previous video of Baldwin trashing Trump supporters and likening it to Clinton’s “basket of deplorables” comment.
Sen. Jacky Rosen’s (D-NV) campaign gave a more vigorous rebuke to the comments than Gallego and Casey.
“Senator Rosen strongly disagrees with disparaging anyone based on who they vote for,” a Rosen campaign spokesperson told Breitbart News. “As one of the most bipartisan and independent Senators, she works hard to find common ground across party lines and represent all Nevadans.”
Rosen’s opponent, Ret. Army Capt. Sam Brown (R) blasted Biden Tuesday night for trashing half of the country.
“Tonight, Joe Biden called half of America ‘garbage,” Capt. Brown wrote. “‘Garbage’ because we believe in putting America First, securing our borders, keeping men out of women’s sports, & making life affordable for working families.”
In a similar fashion to Rosen, Sen. Brown distanced himself from Biden, saying he disagreed that Trump voters are “garbage” in a statement to Breitbart News.
“Sherrod doesn’t agree with that and fights for all Ohioans, regardless of who they vote for,” Brown campaign spokesman Matt Keyes said.
One of Brown’s donors, Vinod Khosla, notably said Tuesday that Biden’s insult did not go far enough.
“Garbage is an understatement for MAGA extremists,” he tweeted.
Brown’s opponent, Republican businessman Berno Moreno, hammered Biden, Harris, and Brown on Tuesday night.
“We always knew career politicians like Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Sherrod Brown hated American citizens,” he wrote. “It’s obvious from their policies of open borders, high prices, and massive government overreach. Now, they are just saying the quiet part out loud.”
Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), who is Michigan’s Democrat Senate nominee, scolded Biden for his remarks while appearing on a local radio program, Fox News reported.
“He shouldn’t have said it, it’s inappropriate,” Slotkin told a Michigan radio station, Fox News reported. “For me, I just think that kind of talk is the last thing we need in our politics.”
Former U.S House Intelligence Chair Mike Rogers (R-MI), the GOP nominee for Senate in the Wolverine State, called out Biden, Slotkin, and Harris on Tuesday night.
“Michiganders living paycheck to paycheck aren’t garbage, Joe!” he wrote.
“The clear and disgusting contempt that Biden, Harris, and Slotkin have for Americans who don’t support their garbage policies is all you need to know and why we’re going to win next week,” Rogers added.",2024-10-30
Breitbart,Jonah Goldberg Says Trump Made Him Lie About Trump Wanting Liz Cheney Shot,"The disgraced Jonah Goldberg’s latest act of liberal fascism involves him lying about Donald Trump on CNN and then claiming it was Donald Trump who made him lie.
Not-So-Little Lord Fauntleroy grows more pathetic and self-loathing by the day.
We all know what former President Trump said about Liz Cheney on Thursday. There was nothing ambiguous about what he said or what he meant:
Let’s put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her. Let’s see how she feels about it, you know when the guns are trained on her face. You know, they’re all war hawks when they’re sitting in Washington, in a nice building saying, ‘Oh, gee, well, let’s send — let’s send 10,000 troops right into the mouth of the enemy.’
The idea that Trump is calling for Cheney to be executed or face a firing squad is preposterous. He opens his statement by saying “Let’s put her with a rifle standing there…” If you’re calling for someone to be executed, you don’t hand them a rifle.
Trump is making a chickenhawk statement about Liz Cheney that would have won him his own MSNBC primetime show in 2006.
Anyway, here’s what Goldberg said on far-left CNN Friday morning about Trump’s statement:
He’s saying quite explicitly and unambiguously that Liz Cheney should be shot, should be executed by firing squad. That is appalling. That is a small facet of the reasons why he’s unfit for office, and the Republican Party has made a disastrous mistake. … Let’s execute a political opponent, who happens to be a woman, because I don’t like her. Does that pull more low-propensity voters in his coalition to the polls? I honestly don’t think so.
So, he’s lying. Trump’s point was clear, and allow me to once again make the crucial and incontrovertible point that in Trump’s scenario, Liz Cheney is holding a rifle. Therefore, there is no question he is not calling for her to be executed. Rather, he is calling on her to walk the war-pig walk. Duh.
It gets better…
After the blowback became too much, after leftists and Trump haters like former congressman Joe Walsh, Vox’s Zach Beauchamp, and Free Press columnist Kat Rosenfeld defended Trump’s statement and called out the corporate media for not presenting the full and obvious context of what Trump said, Goldberg xweeted that, “I need to make a statement.”
Here’s his opener:
This morning on CNN I referred to Trump’s “rifles” quote as him advocating a “firing squad” for Liz Cheney. I was reacting in haste to what were objectively appalling and irresponsible comments that had been framed in the set-up piece in the context of previous statements Trump made about shooting protestors and having generals “executed.” Still, I was wrong to say he was calling for a firing squad execution. After I said that, my co-panelist, Brad Todd made the case that I was wrong. Brad was right and, again, I was wrong. Trump was making – albeit in his customary fashion – a different argument about Cheney’s alleged foreign policy views and the use of force. I let my disgust at Trump’s comments get the better of me as this was the first time I’d heard them.
He’s blaming Trump for his lying about Trump, and yes, Goldberg lied. He wasn’t mistaken. He lied. Even in the truncated clip CNN aired in the “set-up piece,” Trump clearly says, “Let’s put her with a rifle…” How can any reasonably intelligent person hear that and then say, He’s calling for a firing squad? Granted, over these last ten years, I’ve discovered Jonah Goldberg is nowhere near as smart as I once thought he was, and obviously he’s less principled than a junkie in a bus station bathroom selling himself for ten bucks, but Goldberg is not so dumb he thinks you give the person being executed a rifle.
Jonah Goldberg is a liar, and when he got caught lying, he’s such a bottom feeder desperate to please his new corporate media masters, he blamed Trump for his own lying.
Win or lose on Tuesday, there is no going to back to a Republican Party that has anything to do with America’s Jonah Goldbergs.
Trump should sue everyone spreading this lie, including the increasingly chubby Kasie Hunt. This isn’t opinion. This isn’t reporting. This is the telling of a deliberate lie to damage a man’s reputation. This is defamation.

Breitbart,The Price of Garbage Is Up 18.5% Under Biden-Harris,"The prices Americans pay for garbage collection have jumped 18.5 percent since Joe Biden and Kamala Harris entered the White House, according to data from the U.S. Department of Labor.
The consumer price index for water, sewage, and garbage collection was up 4.75 percent in September compared with one year earlier. Trash collection inflation peaked at a year-over-year rate of 5.8 percent in June of last year.
The Harris campaign was scrambling on Wednesday after Biden called Trump’s supporters “garbage” in an interview. Biden has said he only meant to refer to some of Trump’s supporters.
“The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters,” Biden said.
The remarks are being compared to Hillary Clinton referring to Trump’s supporters as “deplorable” in 2016, fueling a backlash that helped propel Trump into office.",2024-10-30
Breitbart,North Korea Stages Its Longest ICBM Flight Ever -- Capable of Reaching U.S. in Time for Election,"Communist North Korea fired an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on Thursday that flew for 86 minutes, a record for Pyongyang, suggesting it is capable of reaching the continental United States.
South Korean and Japanese military observers tracked the missile, documenting that it traveled 621 miles across and flew to about 4,300 miles in altitude. The missile fell in the East Sea/Sea of Japan. The missile appeared to be fired intentionally at a very steep angle to not land on any populated target, but show the world it is capable of hitting America if necessary.
Pyongyang’s state-run Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) confirmed the missile launch shortly after it occurred, calling it a “very crucial test” necessary to show the world the “modernity and creditability” of North Korea’s nuclear threats.
Kim Jong-un issued a statement directly on Thursday defending the threatening launch as an “appropriate military activity,” but not directly describing it as a ploy related to the schedule of the American presidential election. The ICBM, he claimed, “fully meets the purpose of informing the rivals [South Korea and America], who have intentionally escalated the regional situation and posed a threat to the security of our Republic recently, of our counteraction will.”
“It also constitutes an indispensable process in the course of constantly developing our state’s strategic attack forces,” he continued. “We should never allow any threat to approach the security sphere under our state’s influence.”
“The security situation of our state and ever-aggravating prospective threats and challenges require us to continue to bolster up our modern strategic attack forces and more perfectly round off our nuclear forces’ response posture,” he concluded, vowing to never denuclearize his country.
The KCNA report did not identify what kind of ICBM North Korea launched on Thursday. Pyongyang often boasts of the specific model missile that it fires. South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) similarly noted that it did not have enough evidence to confirm the model launched and stated that it could potentially be an entirely new ICBM model. The latest known model of North Korean ICBM is the “Hwasong-18,” which Kim Jong-un first ordered a test-launch of in July 2023. South Korean experts predicted based on the information North Korea published on the missile model that it could potentially hit any part of the continental United States. North Korea had not launched an ICBM in about a year.
“Early assessment showed there is a possibility (North Korea) may have test-fired a new type of solid-fuel long-range ballistic missile,” JCS spokesperson Lee Sung-jun said on Thursday. The Korea JoongAng Daily also reported, citing an unnamed JCS official, that South Korean military experts believe Pyongyang used a different mobile launcher than those previously used for older models, adding to evidence that the ICBM may have been an entirely new missile.
“The launch today may have been from a new 24-wheel mobile launcher that North Korea recently revealed,” a JCS official reportedly said. “It is possible that the missile has grown in size and the warhead weight has increased.”
Lee told reporters that the South Korean military believes that the missile launch was in part timed to coincide with the days before America elects a new president, potentially to “gain leverage” over any incoming American presidential administration.
The South Korean news agency Yonhap also quoted an expert at the Korea Institute for National Unification, Hong Min, who said the missile launch was also a way to remind the world that North Korea now boasts a mutual defense agreement with Russia and is believed to be increasingly involved in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.
“Given that an ICBM targets the U.S., (the North) has boasted its proven capability to retaliate in the event its safety is threatened,” Hong said.
Officials in both Seoul and Tokyo warned on Wednesday that they had detected North Korean military activity suggesting an imminent ICBM launch or even nuclear weapons test. Members of the South Korean Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) told lawmakers that it believed that Kim Jong-un had entirely rehabilitated the Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site, used for seven previous tests and believed to be in a state of extreme disrepair. The South Korean officials, Japanese news network NHK reported, predicted the ICBM launch and “have not ruled out North Korea going ahead with its seventh nuclear test around the time of the US presidential election.”
“The officials also said preparations inside the Punggye-ri nuclear test site in the northeast of the country are almost complete,” the report relayed. Punggye-ri has not been used for a nuclear test since 2017.
While Kim Jong-un has not ordered a nuclear test in seven years, he has taken a variety of measures intended to reinforce his country’s illicit nuclear weapons program, including outlawing denuclearization and ordering an “exponential increase” in its nuclear warhead arsenal in early 2023. He repeated that call in September, after signing a mutual defense agreement with Russian strongman Vladimir Putin.
Kim has focused his foreign policy in the past four years on improving ties with Russia, distancing North Korea from its traditional patrons in communist China. Shortly after signing the defense agreement, reports began surfacing that North Korea was preparing to send troops to reinforce Russian efforts in the invasion of Ukraine. As of this week, the South Korean National Intelligence Service (NIS) informed that it believes 3,000 North Korean soldiers are in Russia, and that number could balloon to as many as 12,000 by the end of the year.
“This illegal military cooperation between Russia and North Korea is a significant security threat to the international community and could pose a serious risk to our national security,” South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol said this week. “With the war in Ukraine going on for three years, North Korea has deployed troops to Russia beyond providing weapons.”
“We must thoroughly assess all possibilities and prepare countermeasures. I urge everyone to engage in risk management with a heightened sense of vigilance,” Yoon asserted.",2024-10-31
Breitbart,"White House: Interest Rates Are Up Due to 'Stronger Economy' Under Biden, Trump's 'Destructive' Ideas","On Friday’s broadcast of Bloomberg’s “Balance of Power,” White House Council of Economic Advisers Chair Jared Bernstein stated that bond market interest rates and mortgage rates have increased and that’s partially due to “the stronger economy” under President Joe Biden, but “I also think there’s a policy element going on in that spread, in that interest rate. And I think it has to do with the idea that one of the candidates is talking about massive tariffs — acting as a sales tax on the middle class –, massive deportations — terrible idea for the labor market –, and compromising Fed independence. That may also be putting some upward pressure on rates.”
Bernstein said, “Well, we’ve seen rates in the bond market be somewhat elevated. We’ve certainly see[n] the mortgage rate go up. And part of that has to do with the stronger economy. So, look, under President Biden — we got the GDP report this week — under President Biden, the annualized growth rate for GDP has been slightly north of 3%. That is a very strong, very much above-trend growth rate. So, strong growth, solid labor market, easing prices, real wage and income gains, certainly putting some upward pressure there. But I also think there’s a policy element going on in that spread, in that interest rate. And I think it has to do with the idea that one of the candidates is talking about massive tariffs — acting as a sales tax on the middle class –, massive deportations — terrible idea for the labor market –, and compromising Fed independence. That may also be putting some upward pressure on rates. And I think that’s just a sign of some of those destructive ideas.”

Breitbart,CBS's O'Donnell: Trump 'Giving No Grace' to Biden's 'Garbage' Remarks,"CBS News anchor Norah O’Donnell accused former President Donald Trump “and his supporters” of not giving President Joe Biden “grace” over his “garbage” remarks.
O’Donnell referred to how Trump rode on a garbage truck to his rally in Wisconsin a day after Biden described Trump voters as being “garbage.”
“Former President Donald Trump was in North Carolina earlier, and tonight he’s also in Wisconsin,” O’Donnell. “He landed in Green Bay just a short time ago, and pulled, then, this campaign stunt, speaking to reporters from a garbage truck, proof that he and his supporters are giving no grace to a gaffe by President Biden, where he in his explanation, inadvertently called Trump supporters garbage.”
As Breitbart News previously reported, Biden stated:
“The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters,” Biden said, later attempting to walk it back by claiming that he was only referring to the comedian Trump’s campaign had on stage at Madison Square Garden on Sunday.
Biden’s comments come after comedian Tony Hinchcliffe made a joke about Puerto Rico being “a floating island of garbage.”
In a video posted to X, Trump was seen wearing an orange vest and saying, “250 million people are not garbage.”

Breitbart,Poll: Donald Trump Ekes Out Lead over Kamala Harris in Michigan,"More via the outlet:
Green Party candidate Jill Stein and former Natural Law Party candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has dropped out of the race but remains on the ballot, each received 1.4%, independent Cornel West received 1% and Libertarian Chase Oliver received 0.2%. Independent Joseph Kishore also got 0.2%.
Another 1.4 percent remain unsure of who they would support or did not answer.
It also examined the Senate race between Democrat Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) and Republican Mike Rogers. That is also a close race, with Slotkin garnering 47.2 percent support to Rogers’s to 45.5 percent. Five percent remain undecided — more than enough to swing the race in either direction.
This survey coincides with others telling a similar story. A Emerson College Polling/RealClearWorld survey released this week showed Trump leading Harris in Michigan by one percent — 49 percent to Harris’s 48 percent support. Weeks ago, the two were tied in that survey.
Similarly, a Patriot Polling survey released this week also showed Trump leading Harris by one in Michigan and independents swinging his way.
The current RealClearPolitics average of polls shows Harris up by an average of 0.5 percent in the state. Trump flipped Michigan for the first time in over 20 years in 2016.",2024-10-30

Breitbart,"Dem Rep., Harris Surrogate on if Unborn Have Rights: It's Right of Women to Make Choice for Their Bodies","During a town hall on NewsNation on Wednesday, Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), who is also a Harris-Walz surrogate, responded to arguments that the unborn have rights by stating that “We had Roe v. Wade for many, many years. It was a right of women to make that choice for their bodies.”
After former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin (R), ESPN host Stephen A. Smith, and former Fox host Bill O’Reilly discussed abortion and whether it’s responsible for the gender gap in polling in the presidential race and if such a gap exists, how appropriate it is for men to weigh in on the issue, and whether 2024 Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump has restricted access to abortion, other women’s health issues, and whether women have fewer rights than men, O’Reilly stated, “Democrats have been very effective in saying to women — American women, that the government has no right to interfere with your body. That’s the mantra, right? Isn’t there another body involved?” And Palin strongly agreed.
O’Reilly continued, “Especially in late-term, isn’t there another body? Okay, so, now, we never, and I mean never, hear one word: adoption. We never hear what Bill Clinton said, abortions safe and rare. What we hear from the Democratic candidate for president is, abortion any time for any reason. Do you know there are only three non-Communist countries in the world that [have] that law? And there is a reason for that.”
Palin then stated, “So, you know what we need to do a better job of is allowing easier adoptions. We need to make it something that is more attractive — if you will — that alternative to taking the life of a baby in the womb, instead of that, allowing and providing resources, even, for those who are in less than ideal circumstances, finding themselves in a situation where they’re faced with that choice.”
Host Chris Cuomo then stated, “Right. And the key word is choice, right? Because once you create a right or remove one, it then becomes about who gets to make the decisions. And then you have this whole decision chain that you’re discussing about adoption and health or whatever it is, but who gets to make the determination? That’s the issue that the Democrats are trying to isolate. How well they do it — to Stephen A. Smith’s point — is a different question.”
Cuomo then asked Khanna, “When you hear the argument about what this issue should mean and how it should be argued from Gov. Palin and others, what do you believe the Democratic response is?”
Khanna answered, “Well, the response is simple: We had Roe v. Wade for many, many years. It was a right of women to make that choice for their bodies. And it’s overwhelmingly popular. [It] explains Bill O’Reilly’s point of why there is a gender gap.”
Khanna then gave other reasons for the gender gap.
Palin then said that we’re still not addressing the point of the rights of the unborn.
The discussion then turned to whether it’s accurate to say if 2024 Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump supports a national abortion ban.
Later in the segment, Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-FL) stated that he doesn’t support late-term abortions.

Breitbart,Harris Advisory Board Member: We 'Want to Unleash Nationally' What We Did in California on Immigration,"On Wednesday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “José Díaz-Balart Reports,” Harris Campaign Advisory Board Member Sen. Alex Padilla (D-CA) stated that California “knows the value of our diversity, including our immigrant population, its contribution to the strength of our state and our economy. And we want to unleash nationally what we’ve been able to unleash here in the state of California.” And 2024 Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris is “the first to remind us we need to be thoughtful, we need to be humane, we need to be smart, and we cannot leave the millions of DREAMers and farmworkers and so many other essential workers that we depend on out of this conversation.”
Host José Díaz-Balart asked, “What is it that your message is to the people that you represent and that you work so hard for, and I’m talking about DACA recipients and I’m talking about the millions of people who [live] in mixed immigration status households that don’t hear themselves reflected in any conversation, when, for example, the main focus is that border bill?”
Padilla answered, “I have the honor, as you know, José, to represent the 40 million people of California. And I say everybody, because California, more than any other state, knows the value of our diversity, including our immigrant population, its contribution to the strength of our state and our economy. And we want to unleash nationally what we’ve been able to unleash here in the state of California. Californians and a lot of Californian activists and advocates know Kamala Harris for her talk about the borders, to address that question for the people who still may be wondering, but she’s the first to remind us we need to be thoughtful, we need to be humane, we need to be smart, and we cannot leave the millions of DREAMers and farmworkers and so many other essential workers that we depend on out of this conversation. The organizations and organizers in California know it, we’ve been deploying throughout the country to talk to our counterparts [about] why it’s important to elect Kamala Harris president of the United States and restore Democratic majorities in both houses [of] Congress so we can finally move on with a thoughtful, smart modernization of our immigration system.”

Breitbart,Report: Harris Staff ‘Privately’ Debates Breaking with Biden over ‘Garbage’ Smear,"Staff working for Kamala Harris’s campaign are debating whether to break from Joe Biden following his “garbage” smear of the many millions of Americans who support former President Donald Trump, according to the New York Times.
The newspaper reported:
After Mr. Biden’s remark, Harris campaign officials privately gauged whether his comments would require her to disagree with him publicly or support his explanation that the comments were taken out of context, according to people familiar with the internal reaction. They asked for anonymity to discuss private deliberations.
The visceral smear and political gaffe came as Biden was trying to portray Trump as hostile to Latinos. The report from the Associated Press (AP) said:
Ahead of Harris’ [campaign] remarks, Biden is reacted [sic] to a comic calling Puerto Rico garbage at a Trump rally last weekend by saying, “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.”
The uproar over the garbage smear comes after many Harris allies have described Trump’s supporters as fascists and Nazis.
The Washington Post did not mention the potential split with the Harris campaign but noted:
Democrats were not fully united in defending Biden late Tuesday night.
Asked about Biden’s comments on CNN, Josh Shapiro — the Democratic governor of Pennsylvania, a critical swing state for Harris — did not dispute that Biden had disparaged Trump supporters.
“I had not heard that until now … so I’m kind of giving you my fresh reaction to it,” Shapiro said. “I would never insult the good people of Pennsylvania or any Americans even if they chose to support a candidate that I didn’t support.”

Breitbart,Nolte: Kimmel Spreads Disinformation to Voters on His Show -- Meme Guy Sentenced to Prison for Same,"In today’s edition of Democrats Sure Got It Good, the basement-rated Jimmy Kimmel took to the publicly funded airwaves Wednesday to urge Trump supporters to vote late, like next week Thursday or Friday. Because Election Day is Tuesday, doing so would void their vote.
In 2023, Douglass Mackey, the owner of the “Ricky Vaughn” Twitter account, was sentenced to seven months in prison for doing the exact same thing — spreading disinformation in 2016 to Hillary Clinton supporters about how to vote and doing so in a way that would ensure their vote wasn’t counted:
As proven at trial, by 2016, Mackey had established an audience on Twitter with approximately 58,000 followers. A February 2016 analysis by the MIT Media Lab ranked Mackey as one of the most significant influencers of the then-upcoming presidential election. Between September 2016 and November 2016, Mackey conspired with other influential Twitter users and with members of private online groups to use social media platforms, including Twitter, to disseminate fraudulent messages that encouraged supporters of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to “vote” via text message or social media which was legally invalid.
It should be noted that it was the Biden administration that arrested and prosecuted Mackey five years later in 2021.
Mackey’s defense was that he was just having fun (his “Ricky Vaughn” account was a favorite of mine). The whole thing was a joke, he argued. Well, after the FBI investigated the joke, Mackey was put on trial, found guilty, and sentenced to seven months in prison. The Feds put the guy through a three-year-and-counting wringer over a stupid shit-post.
Now, let’s compare Mackey’s 58,000 Twitter followers to the 2.009 million viewers (in the most recent ratings I could find) Kimmel attracts. Kimmel’s audience is 35 times larger than Mackey’s ever was, and that doesn’t include the people who watch Kimmel’s clips online.
Nevertheless, here’s what Kimmel told Kamala Harris supporters Wednesday night: “Vote early, vote early. If you can’t vote early, vote on time.”
And here’s what Democrat Privilege allowed Kimmel to say to Trump supporters: “If you want to vote for Trump, vote late, vote very late. Do your voting on Thursday or maybe Friday.”
Meaning next week Thursday and Friday. Election Day is Tuesday.
Yes, Kimmel was joking.
But so was Mackey.
Kimmel is allowed to run around in blackface without consequence. He’s a Democrat.
Kimmel is allowed to use the N-word without consequence. He’s a Democrat.

Breitbart,"Dem Gov. Shapiro on Biden 'Garbage' Remark: I Wouldn't Say That, Shouldn't Attack Voters","On Tuesday’s broadcast of CNN’s “The Source,” Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) reacted to President Joe Biden’s comments about supporters of 2024 Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump by saying that Biden’s words are “certainly not words that I would choose, and I think it’s important that we remain focused on the contrast between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump and not attacking supporters of either candidate.”
Shapiro said that he had not heard the comments until that very moment, “So, I’m kind of giving you my fresh reaction to it. I would never insult the good people of Pennsylvania or any Americans, even if they chose to support a candidate that I didn’t support. I think the real issue here is Donald Trump and his inability to simply say comments like that are wrong, to simply stand up for his fellow Americans. He is incapable of doing that.”
Host Kaitlan Collins then asked Shapiro if he thinks Biden should clarify his remarks.
Shapiro responded, “Well, I think President Biden’ll decide what he wants to say. It’s certainly not words that I would choose, and I think it’s important that we remain focused on the contrast between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump and not attacking supporters of either candidate.”

Breitbart,Breitbart Business Digest: Kamala Harris’s Economic Spin Shattered by October Jobs Bust,"October’s Jobs Disaster Undermines Harris’s Economic Claims
The economy delivered some rough justice to the campaign of Kamala Harris on Friday in the form of the monthly jobs report.
Harris has inherited from Joe Biden the habit of claiming Donald Trump bears responsibility for the job losses that the economy suffered during the pandemic. Biden won the White House arguing that what he said was Trump’s mishandling of the pandemic had wrecked the economy—even though the economy was recovering much faster than anyone not named Larry Kudlow thought possible.
What happened next is a story we’ve told many times before. After running on the idea that the economy was in ruins while Trump was president, Biden could not let the economy continue to recover without significant additional stimulus. So, his administration attempted to push through trillions of dollars of new spending under the slogans the American Rescue Plan, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the Build Back Better Act, and the American Families Plan.
Fortunately, Biden’s larger ambitions were thwarted and only a fraction of the dreamed-of expenditures were enacted into law. But the results were bad enough: the worst inflation in forty years, soaring interest rates, the least affordable housing market in generations, and a crisis of confidence in our economy that even full employment and several quarters of rapid growth could not cure.
Harris’s Misguided Attack on Trump’s Manufacturing Record
It never really made much sense for the Democrats to complain about the pandemic job losses. The extended lockdowns and school closures many on the American left supported would have resulted in even worse economic outcomes. The U.S. economy recovered much faster than many other developed economies, in part because of the measures enacted during Trump’s presidency. Neither Biden nor Harris has ever explained what measures they might have taken that would have decreased the impact of the pandemic.
Not surprisingly, the Harris campaign was never going to let historical accuracy or economic logic stand in the way of attacking her rival for the White House. Harris took aim at Trump’s record on manufacturing in particular, claiming that during the Trump years the U.S. economy lost hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs. Harris also frequently claimed that the Biden policies had led to a boom in manufacturing.
At a rally in Michigan last month, Harris said, “America lost nearly 200,000 manufacturing jobs” under Trump.
In reality, the economy had 178,000 fewer manufacturing jobs when Trump left office in January of 2021 than when his presidency began. But prior to the pandemic, manufacturing employment had grown by over 430,000 jobs while Trump was president. And from the depths of the pandemic closures in 2020, the economy added back 769,000 manufacturing jobs in just the last few months of Trump’s presidency.
Under Biden and Harris, manufacturing employment did not recover to the pre-pandemic Trump level until the summer of 2022. Shortly afterward, growth in manufacturing jobs fizzled out. At its peak under Biden-Harris, the manufacturing sector employed 12.95 million, just 126,000 more than under Trump’s peak.
At that Michigan rally, Harris also claimed that manufacturing job losses had already begun before the pandemic struck. When asked by CBS News to back up this claim, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign pointed to a decline of 48,000 manufacturing jobs from January 2019 and February 2020.
Ironically, this figure almost matches the jobs lost in manufacturing just last month. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the economy shed 46,000 manufacturing jobs in October. This was the third consecutive month of jobs lost in the manufacturing sector, bringing the three-month total to 78,000. The economy has lost manufacturing jobs in seven of the last 12 months and is down 31,000 from last October.
Blame It on the Rain
The Harris campaign has been quick to dismiss the jobs numbers for October on the grounds that they were likely impacted by the hurricanes and the ongoing Boeing strike. While both are true, the political party that blamed Trump for the results of an exogenous pandemic cannot so easily ask voters to ignore the effects of weather, especially when we have no idea how many jobs the hurricanes may have cost.
You live by the exogenous variable sword, you die by the exogenous variable sword. And remember that the estimates of more than 100,000 jobs included estimates of hurricane and strike effects. In other words, we fell well short of expectations even with the strike and hurricanes included.
In any case, the Institute for Supply Management‘s survey of the manufacturing sector showed that activity contracted for the seventh consecutive month and has contracted in all but one month for two years; so, this is not just an anomalous report that can be swept aside. Production dropped to the weakest reading since April of 2021. Demand remains “subdued,” according to ISM, and companies show an unwillingness to invest in capital and inventory for fear of a resurgence of inflation or other policy errors.
Harris, Biden, and their allies in the legacy media have tried nonstop for three years to convince Americans that the economy is healthier than opinion polls and consumer surveys indicate. Friday’s jobs numbers make it much harder for Harris to argue that Democrats will be effective stewards of the U.S. economy.",2024-11-01
Breitbart,Harris: Trump's Trans Inmates Ads Have 'Misinformation' and Only 'Relate to Two People' and He Has the Same Policies,"On Tuesday’s broadcast of New York’s Power 105.1’s “The Breakfast Club,” 2024 Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris stated that the ads run by her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump about her views on taxpayer-funded sex change surgeries for inmates “relate to two people,” and he’s hitting her with “a bunch of disinformation and misinformation on this. And he’s living in a glass house, because the policies he’s speaking about in terms of those surgeries were also his policies.”
Co-host Charlamagne Tha God asked, “[T]he reason I’m stressing that I’m voting for you on November 5 is because Trump has been running these ads with myself and Envy in them, these anti-trans ads, without our permission. How do we combat that?”
Co-host DJ Envy then asked, “Can we?”
Harris responded, “Well, yes. Look, truth is always going to prevail over the misinformation and the lies. But it takes work, right? And so, having this conversation right now so all your listeners know. But there is a lot of misinformation and disinformation, because they don’t actually want to talk about the truth, because their truth is a failing truth. And so, yeah, we’ve got to keep reminding folks of the reality, which is I am blessed and honored to have your support and the support of so many communities and individuals who are — their names are known and some names your listeners may not know, but they are leaders in their community.”
Envy then followed up, “I wanted to ask about those trans ads. In the ads, he’s saying that Kamala Harris wants to spend taxpayers’ money for sex changes in jails. He’s spent millions and millions of dollars on — like Charlamagne said, having him and myself in that. How do you answer that, for people that don’t know, and what is the real news when it comes to that?”
Harris answered, “Well, first of all, to your point, he has spent tens of millions of dollars trying to hit me with a bunch of disinformation and misinformation on this. And he’s living in a glass house, because the policies he’s speaking about in terms of those surgeries were also his policies. And the reality of it is that, also, those ads relate to two people, versus the fact that he wants to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, which would impact 45 million people, he wants to get rid of our $35-a-month cap on insulin, … he wants to take away health care through Medicare, and he wants to distract from the fact that he actually — not only does he have a plan on this, versus no plan on anything else, but his plan is to get rid of healthcare coverage for the most needy.”

Breitbart,Jennifer Lopez Smears Trump as ‘Biggest Adversary America Has Internally Ever Had’ at Kamala Rally,"Hollywood star Jennifer Lopez launched a wild smear against former President Donald Trump on Thursday, calling him “the biggest adversary America has internally ever had.”
Jennifer Lopez — who is the former girlfriend of Sean “Diddy” Combs — appeared alongside Kamala Harris at a rally in Las Vegas, Nevada, where she played the race card by trashing Trump as a bigot while failing to list one accomplishment that would qualify Kamala Harris for the White House.
Instead, she attempted to rally Puerto Ricans in Nevada around Kamala Harris by rehashing comedian Tony Hinchliffe’s “garbage” joke from Sunday.
“I know what that can feel like and I wouldn’t do it to my worst enemy, or even when facing the biggest adversary I think America has internally ever had,” she said. “But over Kamala Harris’ entire career, she has proven to us who she is. She has shown up for us every day, for the people. And it’s time for us to show up for her.”
Lopez failed to mention Kamala Harris’ role in sending consumer prices skyrocketing to record levels, forcing tens of millions of American households to scrounge in order to afford groceries, rent, and insurance. She also omitted Kamala Harris’ responsibility for the disaster at the southern border, which has resulted in an unprecedented tidal wave of illegal immigration that has flooded cities around the country.
In her appeal to Nevada voters, Lopez relied on vague, feel-good emotions to sell Kamala Harris. Later, Lopez added: “You can’t even spell American without Rican.”
Jennifer Lopez’s endorsement of Kamala Harris is already provoking a backlash as numerous commenters have noted that she once dated Sean “Diddy” Combs, who is currently in prison as he faces a mountain of sexual assault charges relating to his Hollywood “freak off” orgies.

Breitbart,Exclusive -- Rob Bresnahan: GOP Sees More Low-Propensity Voters Come Out than Dems in PA,"Republicans in Pennsylvania are seeing a higher percentage of low-propensity voters turn out and vote than Democrats are, Rob Bresnahan, Republican candidate for Congress in Pennsylvania’s 8th Congressional District, said during an interview on Breitbart News Daily.
Bresnahan said the GOP currently has about 17 percent participation from low-propensity voters in the state — people who did not vote in 2020 and/or 2022 — compared to the Democrats, who are seeing 11 percent participation from that same group.
The congressional hopeful said the trends are good, and described the energy on the ground as “shocking.”
“The response that we’ve had at the door — we’ve knocked over 30,000 doors as a campaign. We just had Leader Scalise here on Wednesday the 30th, and the excitement — I mean, we had an outing, a small little rally that turned into 200 people at a manufacturing facility in the district. But even in downtown Scranton, where it is traditionally a darker blue area, people are just fed up,” he said, explaining that they are “fed up” with the economy and with “paying too much for everything.”
“They’re concerned about the crime and they’re concerned about the southern border. So all of these issues are really strong for a challenger candidate. And this is an area that Donald Trump won in 2016. He won it in 2020, and he’s going to win it again in 2024, and we’re going to win as well. We’re going to expand that House majority from at least four to five,” he continued, describing this as a “must-win race for Republicans.”
“This race could determine if Republicans have the majority in the House of Representatives,” he continued.
He emphasized the significance of low-propensity voters coming out for the GOP and said he believes the figures could be even higher due to a backlog of uncounted ballots.
LISTEN:
“Because of the early voting and the month-long activity of voting in Pennsylvania, now there was approximately 12,000 to 15,000 ballots that people have either dropped off at drop boxes or have returned in the mail after they’ve requested their mail ballot that the election bureau just hasn’t even gotten to a chance to scan in the privacy seal or the privacy envelope, so they are just sitting at the election bureau right now, and they just finally had a chance last night to actually scan these voters in,” he said.
“And you’re saying that to get 17 percent of the Republicans who haven’t voted in the last two elections is really high, at least it’s higher than the Democrats, who have only gotten 11 percent of their registered Democrats. Is that the conclusion?” host Mike Slater asked.
“These are the people that are just sick and tired that have just probably been sitting on the sidelines. Maybe they’re first-time voters, and they’re saying, ‘Listen, my voice needs to count here. We can’t continue down the path that we are on. Something is wrong. This is broken, and it’s time for a change,'” Bresnahan responded.
“And these are the people getting up off the sidelines and coming out and casting their votes even — because they want to make sure it counts,” he added.

Breitbart,Rattled Kamala Harris Turns on Nevada Rally Hecklers with Rambling Scold,"A clearly flustered Vice President Kamala Harris turned on protesters who heckled her during a Nevada rally Thursday, resorting to another well-worn display of performative hyperbole to counter them.
“You know what? Let me say something about this,” Harris said amid protest uproar mid-speech at the Reno event attended by a crowd of some 6,000 supporters.
“We are here because we are fighting for a democracy,” the vice president obliquely declared as nobody said it was at risk. “Fighting for a democracy.
“And understand the difference here, understand the difference here, moving forward, moving forward, understand the difference here,” Harris continued as the heckler voices and their message was drowned out.
“What we are looking at is a difference in this election – let’s move forward and see where we are because on the issue, for example, freedom of choice …” the Democratic nominee continued as the heckling caused her to pause and lose track yet again.
“That’s OK. That’s alright. That’s OK,” Harris said as her supporters sought to drown the protest voices.
Hours earlier, during a speech in Phoenix, the Democratic nominee for president was interrupted multiple times by anti-Israel protesters, the New York Post reports.

Breitbart,NJ GOP Surpasses Dems with Amount of Voters Registered in October,"The New Jersey Republican Party surpassed the Democrat Party in the state in the number of people they registered with the party during October.
Voter registration data for the state, released on November 1, found that the Republican Party had registered 16,945 people in October, while Democrats registered 6,015 people, according to the New Jersey Globe.
While the Republicans surpassed the Democrats with the number of people registered to vote with their party, there were 44,484 unaffiliated voters registered to vote in October.
The data also showed that altogether, there were 6,727,358 people registered to vote. Out of this number, there were 2,534,932 registered Democrats, while there were 1,628,633 registered Republicans.
In August, Decision Desk HQ’s Michael Pruser shared a chart of compiled voter registration showing that in states such as California, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Nebraska, New Jersey, North Carolina, and Oklahoma, Republicans had made increases between November 2020 and July 2024.
As Breitbart News previously reported, a poll conducted by the Hughes Center for Public Policy at Stockton University between October 10-14, 2024 of 616 registered voters, found that while 55 percent of respondents expressed that immigration was a positive thing, 51 percent expressed that immigration into the United States “should be more difficult.”
The poll also found that there was an increase from 2022 among Democrats, Republicans, and independent registered voters in the state who felt that immigration should be more difficult:
In 2022, for instance, 67 percent of New Jersey Republicans told the Hughes Center that immigration should be made more difficult. This year found that number rising to 72 percent. Independents also saw a rise in those supporting the idea of making immigration harder. In 2022 that number was at only 13 percent. But this year, 31 percent of independent voters agreed. The number also rose among Democrats with 30 percent saying it should be harder in 2022 compared to 54 percent saying so today.
Former President Donald Trump has previously expressed to Breitbart News that New Jersey is one of the states he has been attempting to “make a heavy play” for, along with New York, Virginia, New Mexico, and Minnesota.
“One of the other things I’m going to do — and I may be foolish in doing it — is I’m going to make a heavy play for New York, heavy play for New Jersey, heavy play for Virginia, heavy play for New Mexico, and a heavy play for a state that hasn’t been won in years, Minnesota,” Trump told Breitbart News in an interview.",2024-11-01
Breitbart,Fact Check: Kamala Harris Claims Trump Sent 'Armed Mob' to U.S. Capitol,"CLAIM: Vice President Kamala Harris claimed that former President Donald Trump “sent an armed mob” to the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021.
VERDICT: False.
While speaking from the Ellipse in Washington, DC, on Tuesday night, Harris delivered her closing statements. In her closing statement, Harris claimed that Trump had “sent an armed mob” to the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, though the riot had started even before Trump finished speaking.
“We know who Donald Trump is,” Harris told the crowd. “He is the person who stood at this very spot nearly four years ago and sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol to overturn the will of the people in a free and fair election. An election that he knew he lost.”
Harris’s comments come as other Democrats, such as President Joe Biden have also claimed that Trump “encouraged” protesters to go to the Capitol.
As Breitbart News’s Bradley Jaye has previously reported, Trump has previously “countered that not only did he authorize additional security after protesters entered the Capitol but in fact had requested and approved National Guard troops in advance”:
Trump countered that not only did he authorize additional security after protestors entered the Capitol but in fact had requested and approved National Guard troops in advance — information which was omitted by Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s anti-Trump J6 Committee.
“I was all set to bring in the National Guard,” Trump said, bashing the committee for only releasing information strategically to damage Trump. “They heard that, they say them coming, and they left immediately.”
Breitbart News’s Joel Pollak has previously reported that former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (R) ended up walking back a claim that Trump “incited” the riot on January 6.
Pollak noted that “the question of incitement” was key to Democrats’ argument against Trump during his second impeachment trial, adding that Trump’s defense team, at the time, pointed out that the riot had already started prior to Trump finishing his speech:
The question of incitement was central to Democrats’ argument against Trump in his second impeachment trial. Trump’s defense team noted that the riot had begun before Trump finished speaking, and that he explicitly told supporters: “I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.”
Byron York, chief political correspondent with the Washington Examiner, wrote in the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal in October 2021, that of roughly “670 people” who had been charged in the January 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, there were “82” who were facing “weapons-related charges”:
For each charge, prosecutors have specified the weapon the defendant is accused of using. Here is a representative list of those weapons: A helmet. A baton. A crutch. A walking stick. Handgun. Pepper spray. Flagpole. Knife. Baseball bat. Crowd control barrier. Police shield. Hockey stick. Axe. Metal sign. Desk drawer.
Obviously, guns are the most serious concern. Of the 670, five suspects — Christopher Michael Alberts, Lonnie Leroy Coffman, Mark Sami Ibrahim, Cleveland Grover Meredith Jr. and Guy Wesley Reffitt — are charged with possessing firearms. But none are charged with using them during the riot.
York continued:
The big picture: Only a small percentage of the people at the “armed insurrection” were armed with anything. And just five of them — less than 1% of those charged — have been charged with possessing firearms, which are the traditional weapon of choice for modern armed insurrectionists. One of them didn’t even arrive until after it was all over. And none fired the weapons. And that is the problem with the “armed insurrection” talking point.
York added in his article that while what occurred on January 6 was a “riot” and “there was fighting” and “property damage,” the Department of Justice prosecutions did “not make the case that” it had been an “armed insurrection.”
In a post on X, Trump also called for protesters to “remain peaceful” and for “no violence.”

Trump handsomely won with 52 percent of the vote, compared to just 40 percent going to Harris, the Portland Press Herald reported.
Independent candidate Cornel West received two percent, Green Party candidate Jill Stein got 1.9 percent, and Libertarian Chase Oliver got 1.8 percent.
While not necessarily an indicator of how their parents are voting, Maine students have had a “remarkable track record” with their mock elections, correctly choosing the winning presidential candidate in each election since 2008, according to the outlet.
Notably, many of the students who voted for Trump split the ticket when voting in the mock election for the U.S. Senate and House, with incumbent Sen. Angus King (I) earning 43.3 percent of the vote compared to Republican challenger Demi Kouzounas’s 23.9 percent.
Independent Jason Cherry also received 16.3 percent, and Democrat David Costello got the lowest share of the mock votes cast for Senate with just 14.9 percent, according to the Press Herald.
Meanwhile, incumbent Rep. Chellie Pingree (D) of Maine’s First Congressional District won the students’ favor with 40.9 percent of the vote, while Republican challenger Ron Russell got 38.6 percent and Independent Ethan Alcorn got 19.4 percent.
The students also voted to reelect Rep. Jared Golden (D) over Republican Austin Theriault with a tight outcome — 49.3 percent to 48.8 percent.
While it is not immediately clear how many students participated, the outlet reported that 19,530 students cast mock votes during the 2022 midterm elections.
“Hands-on learning through a mock election is a great way to teach young Mainers about our electoral process, government and the importance of making their voices heard at the ballot box,” Secretary of State Shenna Bellows (D) said in a Monday statement, the day before the mock election was held. “Broad civics education is an important building block for the rest of their lives.”",2024-10-30
Breitbart,"Dem Rep., Sen. Candidate on Anti-GOP Economists: People Struggling Know Better than Them, But Dem Plans Are Best","On Thursday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “Alex Wagner Tonight,” Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) responded to a question on how she responds to people who want to vote Republican over the economy even though Nobel Prize economists say Republicans aren’t better for the economy by stating that “I’m sure those Nobel economists are great, but there are plenty of people right now who don’t have enough money in their pocket,” “And this idea that somehow, people are just wrong about their own family finances, I take issue with, and I can show you the math on lots of people.” But ultimately, the policies championed by Democrats are the best.
After Slotkin stated that there is a manufacturing surge in the state, guest host Ali Velshi said, “I’m often confused by this, because this argument about how Donald Trump and Republicans are better for the economy, is just — it’s empirically not true, every economist that you talk to, every economist of note, all these Nobel economists — but, they say things, and people believe things. So, what does it actually take, when you knock on a door or you have a conversation with someone who tells you they want to vote for your opponent because of the economy? What’s the — what do you actually say to them?”
Slotkin responded, “Yeah, well, just to be clear, I’m sure those Nobel economists are great, but there are plenty of people right now who don’t have enough money in their pocket, right? Who feel like they’re making choices between groceries and pharmaceuticals and sending their kid to summer camp, and that’s a real thing. And this idea that somehow, people are just wrong about their own family finances, I take issue with, and I can show you the math on lots of people. It doesn’t help anyone to pretend that’s not going on.”
She continued, “But I think the conversation is sort of there are things we can do to keep more money in your pocket. Number one, again, those good jobs with dignity. Number two, attack the costs that are draining your finances, health care, prescription drugs, housing, child care, those kind of things that are just eating up your money. And then, number three, keep more money in your pocket with a tax code that actually favors middle-class people, as opposed to the ultra-wealthy. And those are the things that Democrats are championing, that I know I feel very strongly about.”

Breitbart,Top Iran Official: Tehran Can Build a Nuclear Bomb and Will in Face of 'Existential Threat',"A senior Iranian foreign policy official said on Friday that Iran could build a nuclear weapon at any time if “supreme leader” Ayatollah Ali Khamenei wishes it so – and it might soon in the event of an “existential threat” emerging.
Kamal Kharrazi, the leader of the Iranian “Strategic Council on Foreign Relations,” claimed that the only “obstacle” to Iran building a nuclear weapon is an alleged fatwa, or Islamic religious edict, issued by Khamenei outlawing nuclear weapons. No evidence exists that Khamenei has ever issued any such fatwa, despite edicts of high importance typically requiring formalization on paper. Despite this, Iranian regime sympathizers have for years used the alleged “fatwa” to claim that Tehran is a trustworthy partner for nuclear disarmament negotiations or even suitable as a reliable peaceful nuclear energy state.
Kharrazi’s remarks, published in the pro-Hezbollah Lebanese outlet Al Mayadeen, follow multiple threats from other senior officials in Iran against Israel, including high-ranking members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) terrorist organization. The IRGC officials claimed this week that the Islamist regime is preparing a “severe” attack on Israel in response to a wave of airstrikes last week by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) targeting Iranian missile manufacturing facilities and other sites that enable Iranian terrorism against Jerusalem.
“If the Islamic Republic of Iran faces an existential threat, we will inevitably change the policy of our military doctrine [to allow nuclear weapons],” Kharrazi said, according to the Iranian state outlet PressTV. “We now have the necessary capability to produce [nuclear] weapons, and the only obstacle is the Leader’s fatwa that prohibits the production of nuclear weapons.”
Kharrazi claimed that the alleged fatwa, which no evidence indicates is real, was a result of Tehran having “considered the Westerners’ sensitivity,” but that Iran may soon abandon that posture and not only produce a nuclear weapon, but enhance its development and manufacture of missiles.
The senior Iranian official used the interview to encourage America and other Western nations to “wake up and exert pressure on Israel” to stop defending itself from the mostly Iran-backed genocidal terrorists that launched a war against the democratic state a year ago.
“Unfortunately, we still see the West, including European countries and the United States, continue to support such a brutal and criminal entity and defend its actions by funding it and sending weapons,” Kharrazi said.
The Iranian proxy terrorist organization Hamas invaded Israel on October 7, 2023, prompting the ongoing war with the massacre of an estimated 1,200 people, including children as young as infants, and a wave of mass abductions, gang rape, and other atrocities. Other Iranian proxy groups – such as Hezbollah, the Yemeni Houthis, and the “Islamic Resistance in Iraq” – also declared war on Israel and have been engaging in terrorist attacks against Israel for the past year. Most attacks have been unsuccessful, though Hezbollah, headquartered in Lebanon, has managed to displace tens of thousands of Israelis in the north of the country.
While Khamenei, President Masoud Pezeshkian, and the small circle of elites ruling Iran often insist they are not interested in developing a nuclear weapon, Kharrazi is far from the first to suggest that Tehran is ready to build one imminently. In May, lawmaker Ahmad Bakhshayesh Ardestani claimed in an interview that Iran could not only build a nuclear weapon, but had already done so.
“In my opinion, we have achieved nuclear weapons, but we do not announce it. It means our policy is to possess nuclear bombs, but our declared policy is currently within the framework of the JCPOA,” Ardestani said. “The reason is that when countries want to confront others, their capabilities must be compatible, and Iran’s compatibility with America and Israel means that Iran must have nuclear weapons.”
Kharrazi at that time had again stated that the alleged fatwa could be undone if Tehran deems it necessary.
“We have no decision to build a nuclear bomb, but should Iran’s existence be threatened, there will be no choice but to change our military doctrine,” Kharrazi said at the time.
Other Iranian officials, especially those affiliated with the IRGC, made statements fuming at Israel this week for a coordinated military attack on Iranian missile facilities, which was a response to two direct Iranian missile barrages targeting Israeli population centers. Iran first attempted to bomb Israel in April, in an attack in which the IDF intercepted 99 percent of hundreds of projectiles. Iran again attempted such an attack in October and mostly failed to hit any targets. of those projectiles. A second missile attack in October was moderately more successful but also largely intercepted.
On October 26, the IDF responded, effectively neutralizing Iran’s ability to manufacture more missiles in the short term.
“Based on intelligence, IAF [Israeli Air Force] aircraft struck missile manufacturing facilities used to produce the missiles that Iran fired at the State of Israel over the last year,” the IDF explained in a statement on Saturday. “These missiles posed a direct and immediate threat to the citizens of the State of Israel. Simultaneously, the IDF struck surface-to-air missile arrays and additional Iranian aerial capabilities, that were intended to restrict Israel’s aerial freedom of operation in Iran.”
The commander of the IRGC, Major General Hossein Salami, proclaimed on Thursday that Iran’s response to the attack “will surpass all expectations.” Similarly, IRGC deputy commander Brigadier General Ali Fadavi claimed that Iran “can target everything the Zionists [Israel] possess in a single operation.” Neither offered details on what Iran is planning or how it plans to replenish its ability to manufacture missiles and other weapons.",2024-11-01
Breitbart,Brett Favre Endorses Donald Trump at WI Rally: 'Time to Bench Kamala',"Super Bowl champion Brett Favre, the former star quarterback for the Green Bay Packers, endorsed former President Trump at a rally in Wisconsin on Wednesday – a crucial swing state.
Speaking at a rally in Green Bay on Wednesday, the 11-time Pro Bowler Favre said that he finally decided to speak at a Trump rally with just six days left until Election Day.
“There’s never been a more important time in our lives than right now in this election,” Favre said.
“The stakes are incredibly high. Families across Wisconsin are struggling to make ends meet. People’s salaries haven’t kept up with inflation. It’s getting harder for younger people to buy their first home. People are losing hope in the American dream,” he added.
After citing fentanyl overdoses in Wisconsin, Favre said he wanted to throw his support behind Trump because young people now “face the prospect of World War III.”
“We’ve already had President Trump once — we’ve already seen Kamala in action. We can compare, and we know which is better,” Favre said. “The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results… It would be insane to give Kamala four more years in office.”
“So it’s time to bench Kamala and put in the star quarterback,” he added, prompting cheers from the crowd. “USA is a great country. But we all know this: Kamala broke it. Trump will fix it. I have lived the American dream, but I want to make sure that future generations get to, as well. So remember this: Let’s make America great again.”
After calling Trump a “winner,” the quarterback then knocked President Joe Biden for calling Trump voters “garbage.”
“I can assure you we’re not garbage. How dare he say that? I see police officers, teachers, nurses, grandparents, students. I see everyday Americans that make this country great,” Favre said.
Favre endorsed Trump in 2020.
“My Vote is for what makes this country great: freedom of speech and religion, 2nd Amendment, hard-working tax-paying citizens, police and military. In this election, we have freedom of choice, which all should respect. For me and these principles, my Vote is for Donald Trump,” he said in 2020.",2024-10-30
Breitbart,Speaker Johnson: 'We're Going to Have a Demographic Shift in This Electorate',"Wednesday, during an appearance on FNC’s “Jesse Watters Primetime,” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) offered his predictions on what lies ahead for the November 5 election.
Johnson said he expected the turnout would show a “demographic shift.”
“So Speaker, the House no one talks about,” Watters asked. You hear about the Senate. No one talks about the House much. If Donald Trump wins back the White House and the Democrats control the House, what’s that going to look like?
“Well, they won’t, if they did, they would impeach Donald Trump on day one,” Johnson replied. “I mean, it would be an absolute disaster. But luckily, that is not going to happen, Jesse. I’ve been traveling around the country nonstop. I’ve done campaign events now in over 240 cities across 40 states. There is an energy out there. Something is happening. President Trump said that at Madison Square Garden the other night, he is exactly right. It is difficult to articulate, but there’s a real energy out there. We’re going to have a demographic shift in this electorate, Jesse. Mark my word: We’re going to have a record number of Hispanic and Latino voters who have come into the Republican Party, a record number of African American and Black voters. We are going to have a record number of Jewish voters, union workers — demographics that have not historically been with us in large numbers. They are there now.”
“I mean, her speech tonight — I had to listen to it, too because we were going to comment on it,” he continued. “I mean, it was empty. I mean, it was uninspired. It was angry. Eric said it right. There is no substance to Kamala Harris. People say she’s an empty suit. It’s worse than that. She’s actually a costume. She’s wearing a costume. She’s trying to be something that she’s not. And you said well earlier, her record, she had the most liberal voting record of the modern era in the U.S. Senate. She is a San Francisco radical. So, the empty campaign rhetoric is just not working. The people aren’t buying it, and they’re on our side. We’re going to grow the House Majority. We’re going to take back the Senate, and Donald J. Trump is going back to the White House, that’s what’s going to happen.”

Breitbart,Joe Biden Seen Biting 'A Baby' During Trick-or-Treating at White House,"President Joe Biden was seen appearing to “bite a baby” during the Biden family’s last Halloween celebration at the White House on Wednesday night.
In a photo posted to X by Corinne Perkins, the North America Editor for Reuters Pictures, Biden was seen appearing to be leaning forward, biting a baby’s leg.
“U.S. President Joe Biden bites a baby during a trick-or-treaters celebration for Halloween at the White House in Washington,” Perkins wrote in her post.
People took to social media to comment that it made them feel “uncomfortable,” while others expressed they enjoyed the “carefree” version of Biden.
“This makes me uncomfortable,” Abigail Jackson, the Communications Director for Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) wrote in a post.
“Quick! We gotta get that ‘garbage’ video out of the news cycle,” one person wrote, referring to how Trump had ridden in a garbage truck to his Wisconsin rally, a day after Biden called Trump supporters “garbage.”

Breitbart,Multi-Millionaire Movie Star George Clooney Narrates Kamala Harris Ad Aimed at Working Class Men,"Hollywood star George Clooney is attempting to persuade working class men to vote for Kamala Harris and has narrated a new commercial aimed at convincing them to abandon former President Donald Trump — without telling their fellow MAGA bros.
The ad, which was released Wednesday, comes from a left-wing evangelical organization called Vote Common Good, according to a report from The Hill.
It shows a group of blue collar men entering a polling station, with one of them saying “Come on boys! Let’s make America great again!” In a shamelessly manipulative twist, two of the men change their minds and vote for Kamala Harris after reflecting on the female members of their families, including a young daughter.
“Before you cast your vote in this election, think about how it will impact the people you care about the most,” Clooney says. “Remember, you can vote any way you want, and no one will ever know.”
Kamala Harris is faring poorly among male voters of all races.
A recent New York Times/Siena College survey found that 51 percent to 40 percent of male voters prefer former President Donald Trump over Kamala Harris.
Clooney was one of several celebrities who participated in the infamous Hollywood fundraiser for Joe Biden in June during which the president exhibited clear signs of cognitive decline. The actor later admitted in a New York Times op-ed that he witnessed Biden experiencing serious mental issues at the event, even though he kept it a secret from the public at the time.
Clooney’s commercial follows a similar one from Julia Roberts aimed at white suburban women, encouraging them to intentionally deceive their Trump-supporting husbands by secretly voting for Kamala Harris — in effect, canceling out their husbands’ votes.

What Is a Gold IRA?
A gold IRA, or individual retirement account, is a type of self-directed IRA that allows investors to own physical gold, silver, platinum and palladium instead of the more traditional assets like stocks and bonds. This investment option offers individuals the opportunity to diversify their retirement portfolio with tangible precious metals, which can serve as a hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty.
What’s the difference between a gold IRA and a traditional IRA?
A gold IRA differs from a traditional IRA primarily in the types of assets it holds. While a traditional IRA typically includes investments in stocks, bonds and mutual funds, a gold IRA focuses on physical precious metals such as gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
The management and storage of assets within a gold IRA require adherence to specific IRS rules and regulations, including the use of an approved custodian for asset storage. Like other types of IRAs, gold IRAs aim to provide tax advantages for retirement savings, but a gold IRA’s inclusion of precious metals offers a distinct approach to risk management and wealth preservation.
How Does a Gold IRA Work?
Establishing a gold IRA involves a few critical steps to ensure compliance with IRS regulations and to protect the investment. First, an investor must choose a trusted custodian who specializes in handling self-directed IRAs, as they are required by law to administer these accounts. The custodian manages the account paperwork and facilitates the purchase and storage of the precious metals.
After selecting a custodian, the investor needs to open the gold IRA account and fund it. This funding can be done through a rollover from an existing IRA or another qualified retirement plan, or through direct contributions, adhering to the IRS contribution limits. Once the gold IRA is funded, the investor works with their custodian and metal dealers to purchase the desired precious metals. It’s essential to ensure that the chosen metals meet the IRS’s requirements for purity and type. Common options include specific gold bullion bars or coins that adhere to these standards.
After the purchase, the metals are stored securely, typically in an IRS-approved depository that offers advanced protection against physical theft or damage. The custodian oversees these assets, maintaining their integrity and compliance. Throughout the investment period, the value of these metals may fluctuate with market trends, but they provide a form of diversification that can help protect against inflation and economic uncertainties, aligning with long-term retirement goals.
Pros and Cons of Gold IRAs
Pros
- Ability to hedge against inflation: Gold has historically been considered a strong hedge against inflation. Unlike paper currency, its value tends to remain stable or even appreciate over time, especially during periods of economic uncertainty. This stability can help preserve your purchasing power over the long term, making gold a reliable component of a diversified retirement portfolio.
- Portfolio diversification: Including gold in your IRA helps to diversify your investment portfolio. Diversification is a crucial strategy for reducing risk because it spreads investments across different asset classes. Gold often exhibits low or negative correlations with traditional classes like stocks and bonds, meaning it can help mitigate losses during market downturns.
- Tangible asset: Unlike most financial assets, gold is a physical commodity, offering you peace of mind with tangible ownership. This can be especially appealing during times of political or financial instability when the reliability of digital or paper assets might come into question.
- Potential for appreciation: Over the past decades, the price of gold has witnessed substantial growth, and while past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, many see gold as an asset that could increase in value over time as demand expands and resources become more scarce.
- Safe haven asset: Gold is often referred to as a “safe haven” asset due to its ability to retain value during economic crises. Investors tend to flock to gold during times of market volatility, financial instability or geopolitical uncertainty, driving up its price and maintaining its demand.
Cons
- Higher fees and expenses: Gold IRAs typically have higher fees compared to traditional IRAs or other investment accounts. These fees can include account setup fees, storage fees and custodian management fees. Over time, these costs can erode the returns on your investment, making it less cost-effective, especially if you do not hold the gold for a significant duration.
- No income potential: Unlike stocks or bonds that may offer dividends or interest, gold does not provide any income. This lack of income generation means the investment relies solely on price appreciation for returns. Consequently, during periods when gold prices are stagnant or decreasing, investments may not yield the same level of income or growth as other investment vehicles.
- Complex management: Investing in a gold IRA involves dealing with additional regulations and requirements set by the IRS. This includes choosing an approved custodian and selecting a trustworthy depository to hold the physical asset. Increased complexity can demand more time, effort and knowledge on the part of the investor.
- Market risks and volatility: While gold is often seen as a stable asset, it is not immune to market fluctuations. The gold market can experience periods of significant volatility that may lead to short-term fluctuations, which could be concerning for those seeking stable returns.
- Liquidity constraints: Selling physical gold from a gold IRA can be more challenging compared to more liquid assets like stocks or mutual funds. There may be restrictions on when and how you can liquidate your holdings, potentially resulting in delays or additional costs.
Who Gold IRAs Are Right For
Gold IRAs can be an excellent investment option for individuals looking to diversify their retirement portfolio and safeguard their wealth against economic uncertainties and inflation. This investment vehicle appeals to a range of investors with specific financial goals and risk tolerances. Investors fitting these profiles may find that adding a gold IRA to their retirement strategy aligns well with their financial objectives and mitigates risks associated with other investment types.
These are some individuals who might find gold IRAs particularly beneficial:
- Risk-averse investors: Individuals concerned about market volatility and seeking a more stable, diversified portfolio may benefit from the security gold IRAs offer. Gold’s reputation as a safe haven can provide peace of mind during economic downturns.
- Inflation-wary savers: Those looking to protect their retirement savings from inflation will find gold IRAs attractive due to gold’s historical ability to maintain or increase its value over time, even as currency values diminish.
- Long-term investors: Investors with a long-term horizon who are willing to hold onto their assets for extended periods can take advantage of gold’s potential for appreciation. They might benefit from its value increase as demand grows and resources become scarce.
- Tangible asset enthusiasts: Those who prefer owning a physical asset rather than digital or paper investments may appreciate the tangible nature of gold. This aspect is particularly appealing in times of political or financial instability.
- Sophisticated investors: Individuals who understand and are willing to navigate the complexities and regulations involved in managing a gold IRA can leverage the tax advantages of this retirement account while enjoying a diversified asset base.
How to Choose a Gold IRA
Selecting the right gold IRA is crucial for optimizing your investment strategy and achieving your financial goals. With various providers and options available, it’s important to carefully evaluate and compare each choice to ensure you make an informed decision. Below are the key steps to take when comparing and choosing a gold IRA, along with explanations for each step:
- Research and select the best gold IRA companies. Begin by researching different custodians who specialize in gold IRAs. Look for a company with a solid reputation, transparent fees and strong customer reviews. A reputable custodian will securely manage your investments and provide expert guidance.
- Evaluate available fee structures. Compare the fee structures of various custodians, including account setup fees, annual maintenance fees and storage fees. Understanding the total cost of ownership will help you choose a gold IRA that aligns with your budget and financial strategy.
- Assess storage options. Ensure the custodian offers secure storage options for your physical gold. Consider whether each option provides segregated or commingled storage and the security measures in place to protect your assets.
- Understand IRS regulations and compliance. Familiarize yourself with IRS rules regarding gold IRAs to ensure compliance. Choose a custodian who fully adheres to these regulations and offers guidance to simplify account setup and management.
- Review customer support and educational resources. Quality customer support and access to educational resources are critical when managing a gold IRA. Select a custodian that provides responsive customer service and offers resources to help you make informed investment decisions.
- Consider the range of investment options. Investigate the variety of gold products and other precious metals available for investment. A diverse range of options will allow you to tailor your portfolio to meet specific goals and risk tolerance.
- Examine historical performance and market insights. As with other investments, past performance doesn’t guarantee future results, but understanding historical trends and insights can aid in your decision. Choose a custodian who offers market insights and analysis to help guide your investment decisions.
How to Open a Gold IRA
To successfully open a gold IRA, it’s essential to follow a series of steps to ensure a smooth process and compliance with all regulatory requirements.
- Choose a qualified custodian. Before opening a gold IRA, select a custodian approved by the IRS to manage precious metal investments. Look for a custodian with a strong reputation, experience in gold IRAs and excellent customer service.
- Complete the application process. Fill out the necessary application forms provided by your chosen custodian. This step typically involves submitting your personal information, financial details and account preferences to establish your account.
- Fund your IRA. Transfer funds into your new gold IRA by rolling over an existing retirement account, such as a 401(k) or traditional IRA, or by making a direct contribution. Ensure the transaction complies with IRS guidelines to avoid penalties or tax implications.
- Select your precious metals. Work with your custodian to choose the specific gold products or other precious metals you’d like to include in your portfolio. Consider factors such as purity, type and current market performance to align your investments with your goals.
- Arrange for secure storage. Once you select your metals, coordinate with the custodian to arrange for secure storage. Choose between segregated or commingled storage options at an approved depository to ensure your assets are protected and meet IRS requirements.
- Monitor and manage your investments. Regularly review and manage your gold IRA holdings with the support of your custodian’s resources. Stay informed about market trends and assess how your assets align with your long-term financial goals, making adjustments as necessary.
Gold IRA Alternatives
In addition to gold IRAs, there are several other investment strategies that individuals can consider to diversify their retirement portfolios and hedge against market volatility. Each option provides unique benefits and may better suit different financial goals and risk appetites.
- Traditional IRAs: Investing in a traditional IRA allows individuals to benefit from tax-deferred growth on earnings. Contributions may be tax-deductible, and distributions during retirement are taxed at the retiree’s current income tax rate.
- Roth IRAs: Unlike traditional IRAs, Roth IRA contributions are not tax-deductible. However, these accounts grow tax-free and allow withdrawals during retirement to be tax-free if certain conditions are met. Because contributions are after-tax, Roth IRAs are often a good choice for individuals expecting higher tax rates in retirement.
- Real estate investments: Direct investment in real estate properties can provide income through rental yields and potential appreciation. Real estate investments also add tangible assets to your portfolio, offering a buffer against inflation and market downturns.
- Stocks and bonds: These conventional investment options remain popular for their liquidity and potential for long-term growth. Stocks provide ownership stakes in companies, while bonds offer fixed-income returns, which can stabilize a more volatile portfolio.
- Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS): TIPS are government bonds designed to protect investors from inflation. The principal value of TIPS increases with inflation, ensuring your investment maintains its purchasing power over time.
- Cryptocurrencies: For those seeking cutting-edge alternative investments, cryptocurrencies may offer a high-risk, high-reward option. However, these digital assets are volatile.
Gold IRA FAQ
Is a gold IRA a good investment in 2024?
A gold IRA can be a strategic investment in 2024, offering portfolio diversification and a hedge against economic instability. Its value tends to rise during market downturns. However, consider market conditions, fees and your financial goals before investing. Consulting a financial advisor can provide tailored advice for your specific circumstances.
Are gold-backed IRAs a good idea?
Gold-backed IRAs can be a good idea for diversifying your retirement portfolio and protecting against inflation. However, they’re not suitable for everyone. Consider factors like investment goals, risk tolerance and fees before proceeding. Consult a financial advisor to ensure a gold-backed IRA aligns with your overall strategy and long-term financial objectives.
Do you pay taxes on a gold IRA?
Taxes apply to a gold IRA similarly to traditional IRAs. Contributions are typically tax-deductible, and withdrawals are taxed as ordinary income during retirement. However, early withdrawals before 59 1/2 may incur penalties and taxes. Rollover transactions are tax-free if IRS guidelines are followed. Consult a tax professional for personalized advice.
Are gold IRA companies trustworthy?
Gold IRA companies can be trustworthy but always perform due diligence to choose a reputable company. Look for firms with strong reputations, transparent fee structures and excellent customer service. Check for accreditation with regulatory bodies like the Better Business Bureau and read customer reviews. Consulting financial advisors can also help you choose a reputable company for your investments.
Is a gold IRA the best investment for a senior citizen?
A gold IRA is typically not the best investment for a senior citizen because there are age-related requirements that make IRAs less beneficial for seniors. In addition, the short investment horizon of seniors often means older investors won’t benefit from the tax advantages available with IRAs. Senior citizens who are interested in buying gold can explore doing so outside a gold IRA.
Where is the physical gold stored in a gold IRA?
Physical gold in a gold IRA is stored at an approved depository, ensuring it meets IRS requirements for security and compliance. Investors can typically choose between segregated storage, where their assets are stored separately, or commingled storage, where they’re stored with others’, depending on personal preference and the custodian’s available options.
Can I withdraw the physical gold from a gold IRA?
You can withdraw physical gold from a gold IRA, but it involves a distribution process. Upon withdrawal, the gold is subject to taxes and potential penalties if you’re under 59 1/2. There’s also a mandatory withholding period. Consult with your custodian to understand the procedure and implications before proceeding with the withdrawal.
How We Chose the Best Gold IRA Companies of 2024
Selecting the best gold IRA companies in 2024 involved carefully evaluating several key elements that play a crucial role in determining the reliability and suitability of a gold IRA provider.
- Reputation and credibility: We assessed the companies based on their track record, customer reviews and ratings from the Better Business Bureau and Trustpilot.
- Fee structures: Transparent and reasonable fee structures were a priority to ensure investors understand all potential costs involved.

- Investment options: We evaluated the range of investment products offered, including the variety of precious metals available for purchase.
- Storage solutions: Secure and compliant storage options were considered.
- Educational resources: Companies offering educational materials and resources were given preference to help investors make informed decisions.",2024-10-30
Breitbart,"Kamala Harris Should Champion Transgenderism, Says NY Times Author","Kamala Harris and Democratic Party leaders should celebrate the transgender ideology rather than hide their views from voters, says Masha Gessen, a pro-transgender activist who is also a New York Times columnist.
The very progressive Gessen said:
In my imagination, there can be a [Democratic] politician who says [to Americans], “Look, [transgenderism] is not a big deal. You can still love your child. We can live in a world that’s organized not like the world of our parents. That’s what political leadership and invention and futurism are about, and it’s going to be OK because we’re all going to figure it out together.”
But the Democratic Party’s leaders do not have “the courage to say: Social change is great,” said Gessen who has a long family history of supporting far-left causes, adding:
We change. There’s progress. The greatest thing about humanity is that we invent things that have never been done before. That’s what actually lies at the root of political hope. Instead of saying that, they downplay it. And when they downplay it, they come off as disingenuous or perhaps not connected to the world that people are actually living in.
Instead, Harris and the Democrats are largely downplaying the transgender movement, even as it advances through society, said Gessen, who insists that her claimed male gender is more important than her female sex.
In contrast, GOP candidates are spending heavily on effective anti-transgender ads to show Democrats imposing radical changes on normal American cities and towns.
There is much evidence that Democrats facing the voters in 2024 are trying to minimize any public debate on transgenderism — even as they refuse to admit how transgenderism denies the biological differences between the two sexes. That denial damages the complicated cooperation and competition of the two sexes in dating, sports, sexual privacy, education, and much else.
One result of the Democrats’ stealth support for transgenderism is that many women are aligning themselves with the Republicans who recognize the existence and different needs of the two sexes.
Republicans likely will gain votes by loudly opposing the transgender movement, Gessen admitted:
I think that the Republican Party and the Democratic Party perceive these issues very, very differently. And I think that the Republicans may have it a little bit more right in terms of what voters feel and fear than the Democrats.
…
What Republicans are seeing or feeling is that people are anxious about the future. They’re anxious about their economic future. They’re anxious about their social future. And it can all be boiled down to this anxiety about one’s children — that one’s children are going to come home from school one day and speak a different language than the parents or use a different name and generally be a stranger.
“We basically see populism on steroids in the Republican Party, where the whole point of the entire politics is to reflect what a majority of voters want,” the progressive activist complained.
Gessen also supports mass migration for the same reason many other progressives support migration and transgenderism: The causes would allow individuals to ignore the borders and definitions that help ordinary Americans manage their complicated society.
Other pro-transgender activists insist the GOP Democrats can win by championing transgenderism.
They added:
There’s an effective rejoinder Democrats could be deploying: Call out the bullshit, explain the motivation behind it, and sandwich this between an affirmation of what nearly all of us value and must vote to protect — freedoms.…[An effective pro-transgender] ad kicks off by creating a big “we,” declaring: “Black, white, or brown, Native or newcomer, transgender or not, Americans will not let anyone dim our light.” It then calls out the opposition for their assaults on our freedom, “MAGA Republicans ban books and health care,” and our economic well-being, “they “rig the rules for corporations,” explaining their MO: they “try to distract us by singling people out to bully based on our races or genders.” Finally, it employs a known persuasive social proof approach, telling viewers that their response to this is: “We call BS. We show up for each other and we vote for leaders like Kamala Harris.” With this wording, we’re telling folks that people like them already believe and do the right thing here.
Many polls say otherwise. For example, a Rasmussen Reports survey of 2,008 likely voters showed that 65 percent declared their opposition to men competing in women’s sports. The October survey showed that 50 percent expressed that they “strongly oppose” the idea, while 15 percent said they “somewhat oppose.”",2024-10-30
Breitbart,Meghan McCain Rips Biden for 'Garbage' Smear -- 'Honestly Breaks My Heart',"Meghan McCain ripped President Joe Biden Tuesday night after his off-the-cuff comments calling Donald Trump’s supporters “garbage.”
Biden’s comments came in the final week of a tense campaign in which Vice President Kamala Harris has slowly but steadily fallen in the polls – and overshadowed a rally in which she made her final appeal to voters.
The departing president in a Zoom call with the organization Voto Latino said “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters,” referencing Trump.
The comment met quick condemnation from Republicans and a mixture of horror and denial from Democrats.
McCain, who has praised Biden in the past, said his comments broke her heart.
“We are all collectively exhausted from this entire election cycle but Biden calling half the country garbage just really honestly breaks my heart this is where we’re at,” she tweeted Tuesday night.
McCain, daughter of the late Sen. John McCain, has been one of Trump’s most ardent foes since his rise almost a decade ago.
Trump and the elder McCain butted heads often, with Trump opposing the American overseas military adventurism McCain was identified with by critics.
McCain notoriously killed Trump’s effort to reform the American healthcare system. The melodramatic McCain, who always loved the camera even if it did not love him back, kept his vote a mystery until the final moments of the Senate vote, giving a thumbs down on the floor to signify his opposition.
Meghan McCain has indicated she will not vote for Harris or Trump.

Breitbart,REPORT: NFL Waiting Until After the Election to Decide Nick Bosa's Fate for Crashing Interview with MAGA Hat,"In an election year full of political maneuvering, the NFL appears to be making its own calculated political move.
According to a report from CBS Lead NFL Insider Jonathan Jones, the NFL is postponing its decision over whether to fine 49ers star defensive end Nick Bosa for crashing an NBC post-game interview while wearing a MAGA hat until “later next week,” in other words, after the election.
“Source to @NFLonCBS: The NFL is looking into Nick Bosa wearing a MAGA hat Sunday postgame,” Jones wrote on X. “There will not be a determination on any potential fine until later next week. I’m told there is no consideration for any potential suspension.”
Last Sunday, Bosa ran up during Melissa Stark’s post-game interview with 49ers QB Brock Purdy and pointed to his MAGA hat before running off.
According to the NFL Football Operations website, fines for the previous week are posted at 4 P.M. EST on the following Saturday. The reported delay in a determination in Bosa’s case until several days later is highly unusual.
Why would the league wait before deciding whether to fine Bosa and for how much?
As Breitbart Sports reported earlier this week, the NFL has had a policy of not allowing former President Trump to “weaponize” the league, going back to the Kaepernick protests.
If the NFL were to announce a Bosa suspension on Saturday, It would give President Trump ample time to blast the league before Tuesday’s election.
The league has rules on the books prohibiting what Bosa did Sunday night.
As the NFL rulebook states in Rule 5, Section 4, Article 8, “Throughout the period on game day that a player is visible to the stadium and television audience (including in pregame warm-ups, in the bench area, and during postgame interviews in the locker room or on the field), players are prohibited from wearing, displaying, or otherwise conveying personal messages either in writing or illustration, unless such message has been approved in advance by the League office.”
As for rules about political messaging, the rulebook is clear.
“The League will not grant permission for any club or player to wear, display, or otherwise convey messages, through helmet decals, arm bands, jersey patches, mouthpieces, or other items affixed to game uniforms or equipment, which relate to political activities or causes, other non-football events, causes or campaigns, or charitable causes or campaigns. Further, any such approved items must be modest in size, tasteful, non-commercial, and non-controversial; must not be worn for more than one football season.”
The 49ers have a bye week. Their next game will be on November 10 against the Bucs.",2024-11-01
Breitbart,Astronaut Buzz Aldrin Endorses Trump: US Is 'Best Served by Voting' for Trump,"Famed astronaut Buzz Aldrin endorsed former President Donald Trump, highlighting how under the his first administration the United States “saw a revitalized interest in space.”
In a press release on Wednesday, Aldrin highlighted the accomplishments the Trump administration made to elevate “human space exploration” and how the Trump administration “reinstituted the National Space Council,” and created the U.S. Space Force.
Aldrin added that as the nation faces “serious and difficult realities on the global security landscape,” the nation was also experiencing “economic challenges, stability in our communities, and rule of law concerns,” adding that he feels that the United States is “best served by voting for” Trump.
“Most citizens rightly consider it an honor to cast their vote for a leader they believe will best serve the Nation — our government by, for and of the people. For me, for the future of our Nation, to meet enormous challenges, and for the proven policy accomplishments above,” Aldrin said, “I believe the nation is best served by voting for Donald J. Trump. I wholeheartedly endorse him for President of the United States. Godspeed President Trump, and God Bless the United States of America.”
Aldrin explained in his press release:
A half-Century ago, I was part of an important effort to put a human being on the Moon. It was an honor to serve my country in that capacity. I am proud of what we accomplished then. While it has been 55 years since Americans set foot on the Moon, the only nation ever to do so, that effort continues to inspire new generations of Americans – to press ahead, blaze new trails of understanding, and expand our presence in space, For All Mankind. I have dedicated my life to the pursuit of scientific understanding, exploration, and an enduring human presence in space. The importance of that mission, that calling, runs through every fiber of my being.
Aldrin added that he had watched the “government’s approach to space wax and wane” throughout the years, noting that the Trump administration “elevated” human space exploration, and “reignited national efforts to get back to the Moon, and push on to Mars.”
Over the years, I have seen our government’s approach to space wax and wane, a fluctuating dynamic that has disappointed me from time to time. But under the first Trump administration, I was impressed to see how human space exploration was elevated, made a policy of high importance again. Under President Trump’s first term, America saw a revitalized interest in space. His Administration reignited national efforts to get back to the Moon, and push on to Mars — programs that continue today.
The Trump Administration also reinstituted the National Space Council, so leading voices could advocate for the importance of space to America. Finally, under President Trump, the Nation’s defense was enhanced with the creation of the U.S. Space Force-increasingly important as space becomes a contested domain. At the same time, I have been enthused and excited by the great advancements in the private sector space economy, led by visionaries like Elon Musk. These are concrete accomplishments that align with my concerns and America’s policy priorities.
Being the President of the United States “requires an understanding of human nature, clarity in judgement, decisiveness, knowledge, understanding, and calm under pressures,” that very few people “have a natural ability to manage,” Aldrin added in the press release.
“It is a job where decisions are made that routinely involve American lives — some urgently but not without thought,” Aldrin continued. “The job requires sober analysis of frightening scenarios, and the instinct to lead with resolve.”
Aldrin graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, served as a pilot in the U.S. Air Force, and fought in the Korean War. He rose to fame after he piloted NASA’s Apollo 11 mission, and became the second man to walk on the moon, just minutes after the mission’s commander, Neil Armstrong.",2024-10-30
Breitbart,VIDEO: Biden Appears to Bite Several Babies for Halloween,"President Joe Biden appears to be doing his best to steal the above-the-fold headlines from Vice President Kamala Harris.
Biden apparently bit two babies on Wednesday at a White House Halloween celebration, according to video footage, causing the media to divert its attention to his awkward impulses instead of staying on task.
Video:
Biden’s shocking behavior, reported by the establishment media elites as “playfully” munching on babies, raised concern among others.
Newsweek‘s Flynn Nicholls reported how Biden “greeted a line of children and parents and distributed candy in signature White House wrappers”:
Photographers and videographers captured moments of Biden bending down to interact with the children, including playfully biting the leg of a baby dressed as a turkey.
The president also put the toe of a child in an ice cream cone costume in his mouth and nibbled at a third baby wearing a blue dress.
Former President Donald Trump, meanwhile, spent Wednesday campaigning in Wisconsin against Harris and underscoring Biden’s smear of Trump supporters as “garbage.”
“Joe Biden finally said what he and Kamala really think of our supporters,” Trump said Wednesday at a rally in Wisconsin. “He called them garbage. And they mean it.”
Trump arrived at the rally in a garbage truck wearing an orange garbage collector’s vest, a moment that nearly broke the internet once again.
“We gotta lock him up,” Biden said of Trump on October 22, before backtracking on his remarks. “Lock up him politically. Lock him out, that’s what we have to do.”

Breitbart,Schumer Blasted for 'Greatest Coverup of Antisemitism in American History',"Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) was blasted Thursday by Jewish critics after documents emerged indicating that he told Columbia University’s leaders to ignore criticism of antisemitism in campus protests.
As Adam Kredo of the Washington Free Beacon reported, the Republican staff report of the House Education and Workforce Committee, which spent the past year investigating the explosion of antisemitism on university campuses, included text messages sent by then-Columbia president Minouche Shafik to trustees.
Columbia was the site of some of the most radical, antisemitic, and violent protests.
In the text messages, Minouche reported that Schumer had told her that only Republicans were concerned about the issue of antisemitism on campus since the Hamas terror attack of October 7 in Israel. In addition, she wrote, a Schumer staffer had advised her “that best strategy is to keep heads down” and ignore the problem, as well as criticism of the university’s handling of it.
Shabbos Kestenbaum, a graduate student at Harvard who ended up speaking at the Republican National Convention, was furious at what he called “the greatest coverup of antisemitism in American history”:
Former Democrat Dov Hikind, who served in the New York state legislature, referred to Schumer as a “kapo,” an derogatory term referring to Jews whom the Nazis appointed as guards in concentration camps in the Holocaust.
Shafik eventually resigned before the start of the school year, following several other resignations among senior officials at the university.
Notably, Senate Democrats did not hold hearings of their own into antisemitism on campus until one in September, at which Senate Judiciary Committee chair Sen. Dick Durbin (D-IL) argued against “prioritizing” antisemitism.
Schumer largely avoided the issue of antisemitism issues except for a speech in which he made a point of criticizing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whom he later said should be ousted by the Israeli people through early elections. He also refused to shake Netanyahu’s hand — at least in public (he shook Netanyahu’s hand in private).

Breitbart,"Maher: The Economy's Good, Biden 'Tamed' Inflation He and Trump 'Caused'","During his closing monologue on Friday’s broadcast of HBO’s “Real Time,” host Bill Maher argued Democrats should have run on the economy being good and that while prices have gone up, “what caused the inflation was shutting the entire country down and paying everyone $6 trillion to stay home because a bad flu was going around, and Trump and Biden both did that.” But Biden “tamed” inflation.
Maher said that undecided voters “wanted more reassurance that the Democrat isn’t going to go along with every aggressively anti-common-sense idea that comes out of the woke mind virus, which, yes, is a thing. And if she loses, that will be mainly why. And part of that mind virus is progressophobia, Steven Pinker’s term for the liberal fear of ever admitting when things are actually good. As The Economist puts it about America today, ‘an economy with an unemployment rate of 4% and a per-person GDP of $85,000 does not have to be made great again; it is great.’ And yet, the economy is the Christmas Eve voters’ other big issue, and they think it’s terrible, when, actually, it’s bigger and better than ever. … When we were coming out of the pandemic, every economist predicted we were headed for a recession, and all the horrible things that come with it. But — much like Trump’s girlfriends — those things never came. The truth about America today — what Democrats should have been selling is — everything that should be low and down, is. Unemployment, low. Black unemployment, low. Poverty rate, low. Gas prices, down. And everything that should be up and high, is. Manufacturing, real wages, the stock market, personal spending, personal savings, oil production. The U.S. now produces more energy than it uses. … If Trump was president with this economy, it would be 24/7 of, we have the greatest economy, ever, in the history of the world, maybe the universe, many people are saying it.”
He added, “Yes, everything at the dollar store costs $1.50 now, but Biden didn’t invent food costs money. And what caused the inflation was shutting the entire country down and paying everyone $6 trillion to stay home because a bad flu was going around, and Trump and Biden both did that. Everybody took the money, and I don’t see [Trump supporters] handing back the checks. But who brought inflation down further and faster than any other country? The United States, bitches. It peaked here in 2022 and since has dropped like a rock to 2.4%. Biden tamed it without causing a recession, which is like catching a SpaceX rocket with your butt cheeks. The phrase I hear so much that makes me just want to unalive myself is, how’s she going to help me? Like the president is your personal genie. … You think you’re living in the second Great Depression because you can’t buy a full foot of sandwich for $5? Maybe you’re not looking at the actual numbers. Maybe your hat’s too tight. And undecideds, you should be voting Harris because of the economy, but undecideds don’t get that message, because Democrats can’t make the words, things aren’t so bad ever come out of their mouths, lest someone, somewhere accuse them of not caring enough about people who are struggling. But even in a good economy, some segment of society will always struggle with money, mostly liberal arts majors. And so, dear Christmas Eve voter, I say to you: Things aren’t that bad, but they might get a hell of a lot worse under the rule of a mad king.”

Breitbart,White House Clarified Biden's 'Garbage' Smear on Trump Supporters Without Speaking to Biden,"President Joe Biden’s aides defended his smear of Donald Trump’s supporters Tuesday night by clarifying his words despite not speaking to the president after his unscripted comments, a report suggests.
White House aides insisted Biden’s comment that “the only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters” does not reference Trump’s supporters but comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who made a joke during a Trump rally that the Harris campaign has latched onto.
The White House released a transcript of Biden’s remarks in a flimsy effort to suggest Biden referenced Hinchcliffe.
Axios‘s Alex Thompson reports a White House spokesperson refused to answer on the record when asked if aides had spoken to Biden before issuing the statement.
“Asked if they had spoken to the president to ask him what he meant before sending the transcript, the Biden spokesperson requested to go off the record,” Thompson wrote. “Axios declined and the White House did not respond further.”
Even before Thompson’s revelation, the White House’s characterization of Biden’s wording clearly contradicted his statement. But by refusing to confirm they had spoken with Biden after his gaffe, the already tenuous official White House clarification of Biden’s comments is further undermined.
It is unknown how Biden’s aides could have divined his intent — in unwritten, off-the-cuff remarks — without having spoken to him. And the White House’s bungled response simply adds fuel to the fire.
Vice President Kamala Harris has not commented on the escalating scandal, which has overshadowed her Tuesday night rally — intended to be her final appeal to voters — and threatens to derail her campaign.
Biden’s remarks are already being compared to Hillary Clinton’s “basket of deplorable” comment about Trump’s supporters in 2016. Trump went on to win that election.

Breitbart,Exclusive: Rep. Andy Ogles' Bill Would Block Funds for Child Mutilation,"Rep. Andy Ogles (R-TN) introduced legislation to ban federally funded child mutilation, a bill that would legislatively address a campaign promise by former President Donald Trump.
The Stopping the Mutilation of Children Act of 2024 would prohibit any federal funds from going to institutions that provide medical or surgical intervention to any person for the purpose of disassociation from the individual’s sex.
“Children deserve every protection,” he said in an exclusive statement to Breitbart News. “The efforts of the radical Left to sexualize young people is as outrageous as it is grotesque – there is absolutely no justification for needlessly destroying young, healthy bodies. Any physician participating in this travesty ought to be ashamed.
“God created everyone either male or female, and no one can change this through drugs or surgeries,” she said in an exclusive statement to Breitbart. “Pharmaceutical companies prey on confused young children and pressure them into making decisions they will regret for the rest of their lives. The left exploits gender confusion among young people for their own political gain. I am glad to stand with Rep. Ogles in prohibiting federal funds from going to any organization that harms our children.”
Sen. JD Vance (R-OH), Trump’s running mate, discussed the issue on an episode of the Joe Rogan Experience released Thursday. Vance and Rogan suggested pharmaceutical companies and parents eager for acceptance in leftwing social circles are to blame for the rising crisis.
“Are you not at all a little bit worried about how rich people are getting by prescribing experimental therapeutics to 9, 10, 12-year-old kids?” Vance told Rogan.
Vance described conversations with his own children that demonstrate children should not be permitted to make life-altering decisions about their long-term health.
“My four-year-old will come to me and say ‘daddy, I’m a dinosaur,’” Vance said. “Want me to take him to the dinosaur transition clinic and put scales on him?”
Rogan said some parents are eager for their children to join the LGBT community to acquire a “flag of virtue they can post in their front lawn.”
Though Ogles staff did not work with Trump on the bill (Trump is occupied with a presidential campaign), the legislation appears to align with the spirit of Trump’s campaign platform. “Cut federal funding for any school pushing critical race theory, radical gender ideology, and other inappropriate racial, sexual, or political content on our children,” the platform reads.
Trump has wielded transgender issues as a powerful campaign message in 2024, the Daily Wire‘s Mary Margaret Olahan reported. As the extent of the transgender movement’s harmful effects on children has come to light, more voters have embraced the need to push back.
Other Republican down ballot have followed Trump’s lead, most notably in the Texas Senate race. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) has effectively weakened his challenger, Rep. Colin Allred (D-TX), by highlighting his record supporting federal funding for transgender initiatives.
Allred has attempted to walk back his earlier positions, earning condemnation from key elements of his progressive base.
Laws in the United States have long recognized that there are individuals who lack the capacity to make certain decisions – most prominently, children. For example, children are legally incapable of forming a contract, getting tattoos, or providing informed consent.
Ogles wants to fight back against those who believe that children and other individuals lacking capacity can consent to life altering surgeries that mutilate their bodies, believing a well-formed society would wholeheartedly reject that position.
The Stopping the Mutilation of Children Act of 2024 would prohibit any federal funds from going to an institution that permits such butchery.
Ogles included a rule of construction in the legislation to clarify this the bill does not apply to treatment of developmental anomalies, genetic anomalies, or accidents.

Breitbart,Nolte -- Bill Maher Rips Media for Liz Cheney Firing Squad Hoax: ‘Just Don’t Lie to Me’,"Left-wing comedian Bill Maher tore into the corporate media during his Real Time Overtime segment for lying about Donald Trump calling for Liz Cheney to be executed.
“I woke up to the headline ‘Donald Trump had called for a firing squad for Liz Cheney,’ said Maher, adding, “and this is what I really don’t like about the media — No, he didn’t.”
Maher goes on to explain what Trump clearly said. “He’s criticizing her for being a war hawk. I mean she is Dick Cheney’s daughter.” Maher then read Trump’s full and unambiguous quote. Here it is:
Let’s put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her. Let’s see how she feels about it, you know when the guns are trained on her face. You know, they’re all war hawks when they’re sitting in Washington, in a nice building saying, “Oh, gee, well, let’s send — let’s send 10,000 troops right into the mouth of the enemy.”
“Just to be clear,” Maher continued, “this is exactly what hippies always said. This is exactly what peaceniks always said. [Trump is saying], ‘You know what, it’s very easy to sit in your building and send young men to die.’”
He then said to the media, “Just don’t lie to me. I don’t like Donald Trump. Don’t lie to me and tell me he wants her in front of a firing squad. He was saying something that … again, sounds like what hippies used to say.”
Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) quickly agreed that the media lied. “I agree with you on the lying,” he said. “That’s ridiculous and absurd and counterproductive.”
Raskin went on to criticize Trump, but Maher interrupted him. “I’m not defending Trump,” Maher explained. “Just don’t lie to me.”
The corporate media — including liars like CNN’s Kasie Hunt, Eric Bradner, Kate Sullivan, and Jim Acosta; Politico’s Andrew Howard, Jonathan Martin, and Jonathan Lemire; the Washington Post’s Aaron Blake; Reuters’ Andy Sullivan and Susan Heavey; National Review’s Jim Geraghty; Rolling Stone’s Nikki McCann Ramirez; and the Bulwark’s Not-So-Little Lord Fauntleroy Jonah Goldberg — believed it was 2008 again and that they could get away with fabricating an October Surprise that could be dry-humped straight through Election Day.
And the reason these soulless liars fabricated it was to drown out the real October Surprise, which was that, throughout October, the Harris-Biden economy created only 12,000 jobs — all government jobs. Private sector jobs fell by 28,000, and manufacturing lost 44,000 jobs.
The problem for these soulless liars is that it is not 2008. No more can the corporate media lie with impunity. New Media now has the credibility and muscle to debunk media lies in real time. This New Reality has the corporate media so confused and angry, they have chosen to proudly and publicly debase themselves in the hope that whoring out their integrity might push CacklyMcNeverBorderBorderCzar over the finish line.
Well, maybe it will, but the media are destroying themselves in the process, and it is glorious to watch.
Also, this is a clear case of malice. No one accusing Trump of calling for a firing squad believes it. Want to know how I know that? Easy. Even in the selectively edited video the media play, Trump says, “Let’s put her with a rifle standing there[.]”
Riddle me this, Ever-Expanding Kasie Hunt: Who hands a rifle to someone facing a firing squad?
They know they are lying. That is malice, pure and simple, and…
Trump should sue every person named above, their editors, and their outlets, for defamation.

Prior to the life sentence being issued in the state case, DePape’s attorneys reportedly requested a new trial, according to ABC News. This request was denied by San Francisco County Judge Harry Dorfman.
In May, DePape was sentenced to 30 years in prison in a federal case for having attacked Paul with a hammer at the Pelosi residence in California. DePape was also found guilty of attempting to kidnap Nancy, who was not home at the time DePape showed up.
LISTEN: Paul Pelosi’s 911 Call
San Francisco Police DepartmentThe Pelosi family issued a statement in response to DePape’s “sentence of life without parole,” noting that it gives their “Pop some measure of legal justice” and hopefully sends a “message to others that political violence against elected officials or their family members” is not okay:
Since the violent break-in and shout of “where’s Nancy?” two years ago, not a day goes by that we do not think of this devastating assault, its trauma — or the possibility of future attacks. Today’s sentence of life without parole gives our Pop some measure of legal justice and, we hope, a message to others that political violence against elected officials or their family members will not be tolerated, minimized or condoned. We must each do our part to build a peaceful democracy.
DePape, who is a former Canadian nudist activist, arrived at the Pelosi home in October 2020 with the intention of talking to Nancy about Russian interference that took place in the 2016 presidential election.
The Guardian reported in November 2023, DePape had testified that along with speaking with Nancy about the Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, he had “planned to” dress up in an “inflatable unicorn costume and upload his interrogation of her online.”
During his testimony before a federal jury, DePape expressed that he was “sorry” he had hurt Paul and added that “he was never” his target.
As Breitbart News’s Nick Gilbertson previously reported, body camera footage showed the front door of Nancy and Paul Pelosi’s home opening, and a police officer can be heard saying, “Hi, how are you doing?” as DePape and Paul — who appears to be wearing a button-down shirt and underwear, are standing inside.
Police officers instructed DePape to “drop the hammer,” and both men can be seen with one hand on the hammer. DePape responds with, “Nope,” before he can be seen wrestling the hammer out of Paul’s hand and swinging toward him.
WATCH: Paul Pelosi Attack Footage
In a letter to Judge Dorfman, Paul wrote that “it took many months” after the attack to “reclaim” his home and “well-being”:
It took many months to reclaim my home and well-being. I still keep away from media and video of the attack for my own peace of mind. Even after testifying in federal and state criminal trials, I do not read the coveragae or willingly revisit the events. My family and friends were traumatized by the attack — and many political spouses with whom I have grown close during my wife’s service in Congress have been both sympathetic to me and scared for their own safety. To protect my healing, I still do not address the assault with my wife or anyone else. Nor do I discuss the trauma experienced by my wife who remains under 24-hour security two years later even though she is no longer serving as Speaker of the House. Even now, we do not answer our landline phone or our front door due to ongoing threats. We cannot fully remove the stain on the floor in the front entryway where I bled. As recently as this summer, we had to improve security measures at our home due to ongoing threats.
CNN reported that in the aftermath of the attack, Paul was left with a skull fracture and sustained other injuries to his arms. Paul underwent surgery for his skull fracture and other injuries, a spokesman for Nancy confirmed to the outlet.",2024-10-29
Breitbart,Republicans and Independents Outvoting Democrats in North Carolina,"Republicans and independents are outvoting Democrats in North Carolina, according to the latest data.
Early voting numbers out of battleground North Carolina are concerning for Democrats, as Republicans have boasted a strong performance thus far. On the first day of early voting in the state, Republicans saw an 18-point shift from figures seen on the first day of early voting in 2020. Republicans saw 353,166 ballots cast, besting the previous record made in 2020 with 348,559 ballots cast.
Overall, Republicans have led the charge in the state with early voting, and currently, Republican votes are outnumbering Democrats’ — 1,148,634 to the Democrats’ 1,106,358. Perhaps what is more, independents are also outnumbering Democrats with 1,113,426 ballots cast.
“North Carolina added 266,000 votes in this morning’s report, bringing their total vote to 3.37 million. This represents roughly 62% of the expected electorate,” Decision Desk HQ’s Michael Pruser wrote, sharing the breakdown and noting that “Democrats are now third in total turnout and will likely stay there for the remainder of the early voting period.”
“Four days remain to vote early in person, and while we will not reach the 4.63 million early votes we saw in 2020, we should be able to break 4.2 million,” he continued.
This reality follows an update from Donald Trump Jr. on October 19, telling Breitbart News Saturday that Americans are showing up to vote in hard-hit areas — including western North Carolina — in record numbers.
“This week, I was in Michigan, I was in Arizona, I was in North Carolina twice, both visiting the damage as well as doing get-out-the-vote stuff. All of that stuff looked really positive,” he said.
WATCH — Massive Line Appears for Early Voting in Apex, North Carolina:
“I saw the same thing in North Carolina. I was visiting some of the places that the hurricane destroyed. And, you know, I didn’t even want to ask them what they’re doing about voting. And it turns out, Yancy County, where I was, where I saw incredible damage, where FEMA was totally missing. I mean, these people are voting in record numbers,” he revealed.
“They lost loved ones. They lost homes, and they’re like, they would crawl through broken glass right now to vote because they understand their government is failing … so people are getting it. We just can’t take anything for granted,” Trump Jr. concluded.

Breitbart,Report: WH Pressured Stenographers to Edit Biden's 'Garbage' Smear,"White House press officials reportedly pressured stenographers to cover up President Joe Biden’s “garbage” smear by editing the transcript to alter its meaning.
The coverup was “a breach of protocol and spoilation of transcript integrity between the Stenography and Press Offices,” according to a stenographer supervisor’s email obtained by the Associated Press (AP).
“The only garbage I see floating out there is his [Trump] supporters,” Biden said Tuesday.
The White House stenographers added an apostrophe to “supporters” and an em-dash to alter the meaning of Biden’s statement.
The change was made after the press office “conferred with the president,” according to an internal email from the head of the stenographers’ office that was obtained by The AP. The authenticity of the email was confirmed by two government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters.
…
According to the email, the press office had asked the stenographers to quickly produce a transcript of the call amid the firestorm. Biden himself took to social media to say that he he was not calling all Trump supporters garbage and that he was referring specifically to the “hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally.”
…
The supervisor, a career employee of the White House, raised the concerns about the press office action — but did not weigh in on the accuracy of the edit — in an email to White House communications director Ben LaBolt, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and other press and communications officials.
“If there is a difference in interpretation, the Press Office may choose to withhold the transcript but cannot edit it independently,” the stenographer supervisor wrote. “Our Stenography Office transcript — released to our distro, which includes the National Archives — is now different than the version edited and released to the public by Press Office staff.”
Vice President Kamala Harris claimed on Wednesday that Biden clarified his statement and disagreed with demonizing “people based on who they vote for.”
Biden’s smear overshadowed Harris’s closing argument that night in which she said she would be a president for “all Americans.”
“There’s no way to spin it: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris don’t just hate President Trump, they despise the tens of millions of Americans who support him. Kamala does not deserve four more years,” Karoline Leavitt, Trump campaign national spokesperson, said Tuesday.

Breitbart,WATCH: Stirring Trump Ad Channels 'Make America Great Again' Vision,"Donald Trump’s campaign released an ad before the final weekend of the campaign that encapsulates Trump’s optimistic vision for the country.
The ad uses clips from Trump’s 2020 State of the Union address to the nation to drive home the central theme of his campaign: Make America Great Again.
“This is a place where greatness is born,” Trump says, adding “we are making it greater than ever before.”
The message is a stark contrast to Kamala Harris’s closing appeal to voters that “We aren’t going back.”
The transcript of the ad is as follows:
What will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered?
Look at the opportunities before us. America is a land of heroes. This is a place where greatness is born. Our ancestors sailed the Wild West, lifted millions from poverty, disease and hunger, vanquished tyranny and fascism, ushered the world to new heights of science and medicine, and we are making it greater than ever before.
The people dreamed this country, and it’s the people who are making America great again, no
matter the trials, no matter the challenges to come, we must keep freedom alive in our souls, that
one nation under God must be the hope and the promise and the light and The glory among all
the nations of the world and thank you.
God bless you and God bless America. Thank you.

Breitbart,Manhunt Underway for Illegal MS-13 Gang Member Wanted for Murder,"A manhunt is currently underway for an illegal alien MS-13 gang member accused of murder in the sanctuary jurisdiction of Baltimore County, Maryland.
Brayan Rodriguez, a 16-year-old illegal alien MS-13 gang member from Honduras, is on the run from police after allegedly murdering another 16-year-old at a Ramada hotel in Pikesville, Maryland, a suburb of Baltimore.
According to local media, Rodriguez and other teens were inside a hotel room at the Ramada when suddenly gunshots were heard. The teenager who was shot was rushed to a nearby hospital but died of his injuries.
“In Baltimore County, a manhunt is underway for 16-year-old Brayan Rodriguez. He’s wanted in connection to a deadly shooting at the Ramada hotel in Pikesville,” a local reporter wrote on X. “Several sources tell FOX45 he’s an alleged undocumented immigrant and MS13 gang member.”
Police believe Rodriguez first crossed the United States-Mexico border sometime in 2018, perhaps as a so-called “got-away” — that is, illegal aliens who successfully cross the border without being detected by Border Patrol agents.
Residents who know of Rodriguez’s whereabouts are asked to call 911, and those wishing to share information anonymously can call Metro Crime Stoppers at 1-866-756-2587.

Breitbart,Trump: 'I Will Stop the Suffering and Destruction in Lebanon',"Former President Donald Trump pledged Wednesday to “stop the suffering and destruction in Lebanon” if reelected.
In a post on X (formerly Twitter), apparently aimed at Arab-American voters, Trump said that he would work to achieve “a lasting peace” and “preserve the equal partnership among all Lebanese communities,” a reference to the complex Christian, Muslim, and Druze demography of Lebanon. He did not mention Israel or Hezbollah specifically.
The message came as Trump is attempting to court Arab and Muslim voters in swing states like Michigan. Though Arab and Muslim voters have, in the past, opposed Trump’s pro-Israel policies, there are some who are voting for Trump to punish the Biden-Harris administration for its support — however limited — for Israel’s war in Gaza.
Others in the community, noting that Trump presided during four years of peace in the Middle East, and forged the Abraham Accords between Israel and several Arab and Muslim countries, believe that he can end the ongoing wars — partly because Israel, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, trust him and will listen if he urges compromise.
Several Muslim leaders in Michigan have endorsed Trump, as Breitbart News has reported, partly because they believe that he can end the ongoing wars in the Middle East, as well as in other regions, through dealmaking.
It is also possible that Arab and Muslim leaders sense a political opportunity to shift Trump’s policy, given that mainstream Jewish organizations have treated Trump badly or with indifference, despite his support for Israel.
Trump’s specific appeal to Lebanese American voters could also have unique impact in Michigan, where the Lebanese Christian community has been described as the “granddaddies” of the Arab American community in general.
Domestic politics aside, there is growing evidence Israel is moving toward ending the war in Lebanon anyway. A source told Breitbart News that an acceleration of attacks on Hezbollah, such as on the northeastern Lebanon city of Baalbek, is a sign that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) is seeking to defeat Hezbollah quickly in anticipation of a ceasefire. The Times of Israel also reported that the Israeli government decided Wednesday to explore a ceasefire.
One reason Israel may be ready for compromise is that it is winning the war. Israel’s defense minister, Yoav Gallant, said this week that Hezbollah was down to 20% of its prewar rocket supplies. Its leadership has also been decimated.
Israel’s goal is that residents of its northern cities, Jewish and Arab, be able to return safely to their homes without fear of attack, following Hezbollah’s decision to open fire on those communities last October. Israel’s public demands for a ceasefire are that United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701 be enforced, meaning that Hezbollah would have to withdraw from the area between the border and the Litani River, and that its weapons be removed there.
Netanyahu has repeatedly stressed that Israel’s war is with Hezbollah, and not with Lebanon, adding that Israel wants good long-term relations with the Lebanese people as part of broader regional peace based on the Abraham Accords.
Israel had pursued diplomatic efforts, through U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, to resolve the conflict with Hezbollah. The Iran-backed terror group demanded Israel withdraw from Gaza and from its own border with Lebanon, which would have given Hezbollah the opportunity to expand its attacks across all of the Galilee.
After negotiations broke down, Israel decided to accelerate its attacks, and has routed Hezbollah since the “pager” attacks of mid-September.
The conflict has had a heavy human toll, despite Israeli efforts to warn civilians and avoid harm to them. Over a million Lebanese people have been displaced, and thousands have been killed, including some innocent civilians.
Hezbollah deliberately places its weapons and fighters in civilian areas, as well as near United Nations peacekeepers, to deter Israel from attacking them and to inflict diplomatic harm on Israel in the event that Israel decides to do so.

Breitbart,Watch: AI-Generated 'Babies for Trump' Rap that Donald Will Bring Back 'Cash for the Crib',"AI is not always a bad thing — especially in the hands of creative conservatives. The new AI-generated “Babies for Trump” rap video shows artificial intelligence can be harnessed for funny and cute things too.
The song and vocals for the “Babies for Trump” rap were completely generated using AI by Newzy.com, a recently launched website crafting news and entertainment parody with artificial intelligence technology.
Watch Below:
“Diapers costin’ bucks, dad’s wall feeling thin, mom says binkies down, can’t afford the spin. Orange man talkin’ change, says he got our back, young hustlers in the crib dropping mom and dad some facts,” the “Babies for Trump” song’s lyrics begin.
“Vote for the orange man, cash for the crib, no more binkie budget, we just want to live. Pocket change pumping, diaper stash grow, vote for the orange man, let the savings show,” the lyrics continue.
The song was produced by Jeremy McCarthy and Justin Hart, who are also the producers of the content featured on Newzy.com. According these AI masterminds, “‘Babies for Trump’ combines that universal appeal with a playful twist, giving voice to babies who just want a better future, and maybe a fully stocked diaper stash. This video captures the charm and humor of little ones endorsing big ideas, all while poking fun at the everyday challenges parents face.”
“Newzy articles are curated, created and posted by an Artificial Intelligence we’ve named Arthur. Arthur has a wicked sense of humor and can write parody and satire better than most humans,” the Newzy website’s description reads.
“Stay tuned as Arthur continues to expand his functionality on this site and will be able to answer questions, interact with visitors, and create custom content just for you,” the description adds.

Breitbart,Schweizer: Election Lawyer Marc Elias Is the 'Master of Political Dark Arts',"He’s the man with the biggest influence over the last several elections that you’ve probably never heard of.
His influence over how Americans vote, and how those votes are counted, has made him a Democratic “super-lawyer,” and his handiwork has been on elections around the country for more than a decade.
He is a man who understands that elections can be won in the days or weeks after voting has completed. He is Democratic election law specialist Marc Elias, and he’s the topic on the last pre-election episode of The Drill Down with Peter Schweizer.
“We’re talking about a master of the dark political arts,” says host Peter Schweizer. “The way he shapes the manner in which elections are cast, how names stay on voter rolls… This guy is presented as the champion, the biggest protector of democracy, to the extent that Donald Trump is seen by so many as the biggest threat to democracy.”
Marc Elias is behind efforts to kick third-party candidate Cornel West off the ballots in several states, and simultaneously keep the libertarian candidate on the ballots. His law firm files state-level suits to allow unsecured ballot drop boxes, to extend deadlines for absentee ballot counting, and other efforts to increase the likelihood of Democratic victories.
Operating with money from billionaire leftists like George Soros, Elias’s mission is to oppose election integrity measures in various states. In five pages of background contained in his 2018 book FRAUD, co-host Eric Eggers zeroed in on Elias’s influence, noting his starring role in soliciting and paying for the now-debunked Steele Dossier. His client then was Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign.
“Elias’s job is to manipulate the laws and the rules to skew them in a direction that benefits his clients,” Schweizer says. “He’s done this more successfully than anyone else in this space.”
Hillary Clinton is not Elias’s only famous client. Back in 2008, former Saturday Night Live comedian Al Franken ran for Senate in Minnesota and lost very narrowly according to the election tallies. Franken hired Elias to contest ballots, and what had been a narrow victory by his challenger, Republican Norm Coleman, eight months later became a Franken victory through aggressive Elias lawyering. Franken recently featured his old friend on his podcast.
Elias is hard at work right now for clients such as the campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democratic National Committee. He scored a big victory over the summer when Wisconsin’s progressive-dominated Supreme Court reversed its own prior ruling and threw out the state’s redistricting plan, as the Wall Street Journal noted. Eggers summed up Elias’s strategy as “sue until blue.”
Elias is of course at the center of Democratic legal shock teams to contest election results across the country, with “hundreds” of lawyers already on board, drafting legal briefs in advance of the election. As many as 10,000 lawyers around the country are standing by to become involved, should Elias beckon. This is a major operation for the Democrats, and they clearly plan to contest close races in every state. With tightening polls in many of the swing states, they are expecting many battles.
As Eggers notes, in 2015 Elias worked for the white-shoe Washington law firm of Perkins-Coie, handling Hillary Clinton’s campaign. He arranged for a company called Fusion GPS to solicit the debunked Steele Dossier from a former MI-6 operative, and masked that it had been funded by Clinton’s campaign. After his investigation of the dossier and alleged Russian “collusion” by Trump, John Durham found that Elias “intentionally sought to conceal Hillary Clinton’s role,” and her campaign paid a fine to the Federal Elections Commission of $113,000.

Breitbart,Report: Migrants Voting Would Allow Democrats to Win 12 Extra States,"The non-citizen population in the United States has grown so fast that it could swing 12 states toward the Democrats’ presidential candidate if the foreigners were allowed to vote, says the non-partisan Center for Immigration Studies.
“Census Bureau data collected earlier this year indicates that there are 23.2 million voting-age non-citizens in the country, roughly half of whom are illegal immigrants,” said the report by the group’s research chief, Steven Camarota, which continues:
Our analysis does show that in a dozen states … the non-citizen population in 2024 is potentially large enough to exceed the state winner’s margin in 2020.
Of course, just because it is mathematically possible for non-citizens to decide a state’s presidential outcome does not mean it will actually happen, but it illustrates the potential seriousness of the non-citizen voting issue.
Migration advocates and Democrats argue that very few migrants cast votes in presidential elections.
But GOP critics say that Democrat activists routinely register foreigners so that their ballots can be filled out and illegally returned by the activists.
“This phenomenon of noncitizens appearing on the voter rolls is real,” Kyle Brosnan, chief counsel for the Oversight Project at The Heritage Foundation told Breitbart News. He added:
[In] the recent voter-roll cleanups in Texas and Virginia …. Texas removed people from their voter rolls, — 6,500 of which were non-citizens …. In Virginia, in their most recent voter-roll cleanup, 6,300 individuals were removed from the voter rolls as noncitizens …
When you have the border wide open, a mass form of illegal immigration, things are going to slip through the cracks. And when the margins of these elections are so close, every vote matters.
In 2020, President Joe Biden won the prize by getting an extra 44,500 votes counted in three states — 20,500 votes counted in Wisconsin, 11,000 voters counted in Arizona, and 14,000 votes in Georgia. In 2016, Trump won by a total of 107,000 votes in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania.
The CIS report continued:
In Georgia, 1.5 percent of adult non-citizens in 2024 would need to vote to equal the state winner’s margin of victory in the last presidential election. In Arizona, 1.71 percent of non-citizens would have to vote to potentially change the outcome.
… North Carolina where 10.26 percent would have to vote, in Nevada it would require 12.98 percent, in Pennsylvania 15.61 percent, in Wisconsin 15.96 percent, in Texas 18.01 percent, in Florida 19.23 percent, in Michigan 56.87 percent, in Nebraska’s 2nd district 63.63 percent, in New Jersey 72.96 percent, in Virginia 79.54 percent and in New Mexico 82.65 percent.
“We know of no polling to indicate that foreign-born voters are likely to favor former President Trump over Vice President Harris,” the report added.
However, the migrants shift political power towards Democrats even without casting a vote, Donald Trump’s running mate JD Vance said on October 31 Joe Rogan Show:
For example, the state of Ohio lost a congressional seat in the last census [in 2020 because] states that have high illegal immigrant populations picked up congressional seats. So you’re actually taking away congressional representation from American citizens and giving it to illegal aliens. Even if you don’t give them the right to vote, you’re still destroying the voting power [of citizens].
If today’s migrants get amnesty and are allowed to vote, he said, the United States will become a one-party nation like California, he added.",2024-11-01
Breitbart,Pennsylvania Poll: Trump in 5 Up the Crucial Swing State,"Former President Donald Trump is up in Pennsylvania by five percentage points, according to an Echelon Insights survey released just days ahead of the pivotal 2024 presidential election.
The survey asked respondents either who they already voted for or plan to vote for in the presidential election. Most, 51 percent, said Trump, followed by 46 percent who said Vice President Kamala Harris — a five-point gap.
Another one percent said Green Party candidate Jill Stein, one percent said someone else, and one percent reman unsure.
The survey also phrased the question this way: “If the 2024 presidential election were being held today, would you vote for Donald Trump or Kamala Harris?”
In that scenario, 52 percent of Pennsylvania voters said they either definitely will support Trump, probably would support Trump, or lean Trump. Just 46 percent said the same of Harris — a six point gap in this case.
For greater perspective, the survey asked if they approve or disapprove of the way President Joe Biden, who has Harris as his vice president, is handling the country. Most, 58 percent, said they either strongly or somewhat disapprove, compared to 40 percent who strongly or somewhat approve. On the flip side, 50 percent said they either strongly or somewhat approve of the way Trump handled his job as president, compared to 49 percent who do not.
The survey also found that the vast majority, 92 percent, identify themselves as extremely or very motivated to vote, and most, 59 percent, plan to vote in person on Election Day.
The survey was taken October 27-30,2024, among 600 registered voters. It has a +/- 4.5 percent margin of error.
Thursday’s RealClearPolitics average of polls showed Trump up by an average of 0.7 percent in the Keystone State.

Breitbart,Media's Liz Cheney Hoax Falls Apart as Democrat Desperation Builds,"The ludicrous hoax claiming that former President Donald Trump called for former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) to be executed is already collapsing.
Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign, the left, and legacy media have seized on a remark Trump made to Tucker Carlson Thursday night, where he contended Cheney is keen to send American troops to the front lines of battle without appreciation for the danger they face.
After spending seven minutes detailing American would-be warring “in 50 different countries” if it were up to Liz Cheney and recounting the warhawk attitudes of her father, Vice President Dick Cheney, Trump, who is vehemently anti-war, wondered how keen Liz Cheney would be on going to war if she were the one heading to the front lines:
[Dick Cheney’s] daughter’s a very dumb individual, very dumb. She’s a radical Warhawk. Let’s put her with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her, okay? Let’s see how she feels about it, you know, when the guns are trained on her face. You know, they’re all Warhawks when they’re sitting in Washington in a nice building saying, “Aw gee, well, let’s send ten thousand troops into the mouth of the enemy.” But she’s a stupid person.
After distorting his words, including with the contention from the Harris campaign that Trump wants Cheney put before a “firing squad,” out of full context, the campaign and establishment media outlets are getting called out.
Zach Beauchamp, a senior correspondent for left-leaning Vox, blasted the spin unfolding Friday.
“Folks, Trump didn’t threaten to execute Liz Cheney. He actually was calling her a chickenhawk, something liberals said about her for ages,” he wrote.
“Look at the context — Trump is talking about giving her a weapon. Typically, people put in front of firing squads aren’t armed,” he added.
Ian Bremmer, a political scientist who is president of the political risk consulting firm Eurasia Group, slammed Drudge Report for its “extraordinary irresponsibility.”
The aggregation website ran the false front page headline, “Trump Calls for Cheney’s Execution.”
“[N]o, he did not,” Bremmer wrote in a tweet sharing an image of the headline. “[T]his is extraordinary irresponsibility, made worse only by the fact that it’s increasingly common across the political spectrum in the united states [sic].”
Conservative influencers and officials were quick to debunk the false narrative as well.
Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) emphasized, “Trump explained that Liz Cheney is a radical War Hawk who never served in our military & doesn’t understand the devastating cost of war.”
“Democrats & media are taking this out of context AGAIN & using it to slander President Trump,” he added.
Donalds added that the left sees the GOP’s momentum and said, “Don’t fall for this hoax.”
Commentator Colin Rugg blasted CNN Friday morning for launching “a full scale disinformation campaign to confuse voters just four days before the presidential election.”
“The network is deceptively editing a comment Trump made during a campaign event in Arizona about Liz Cheney,” he added.
“The context is being completely ignored by the media who now claims that Trump wants to execute Cheney,” he wrote, predicting the “tactic will likely be replicated in the coming days.”
Journalist Jack Posobiec also debunked the lie.
“Trump is talking about Liz Cheney’s stance on war,” Posobiec wrote. “He is discussing how elites will send our kids to war but never do themselves.”
The popular social media account @LibsofTikTok blasted media outlets for the hoax.
“Trump did not call for her to be killed. The media know this and are purposely misleading their readers and leaving out the context,” @LibsofTikTok tweeted.",2024-11-01
Breitbart,GOP Demands Federal Probe into Illegal Accused of Killing Grayson Davis,"Republicans are demanding President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris’s Department of Homeland Security (DHS) investigate how a twice-deported illegal alien, accused of killing 29-year-old Grayson Davis in Bastrop County, Texas, was able to routinely get into the United States.
As Breitbart News reported, 35-year-old illegal alien Jorge Miguel Peralta was arrested this month and charged with intoxicated manslaughter with a vehicle, a second-degree felony, after allegedly drunk driving and hitting Grayson Davis, who died from crash-related injuries three days later.
“I’m begging that someone watching understands that this cannot continue. It’s not okay,” Angel Mom Ashley Davis told local media. “… [T]his is all about making change so it doesn’t happen again because it’s not fair to the family and it’s not fair to Grayson.”
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Rep. Michael Cloud (R-TX), and State Rep. Stan Gerdes (R- HD17) now reveal that Peralta was twice deported from the U.S. — once under the Obama administration and once under the Trump administration.
In 2021, though, Peralta illegally crossed the southern border again and successfully got into the U.S., as have more than two million so-called illegal alien “got-aways.”
The Republicans are asking Biden and Harris’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to open a probe into how Peralta was able to routinely get across the border.
“The lives of American citizens appear to be a secondary concern for the Biden-Harris administration, whose priorities lie in shielding criminal illegal migrants rather than safeguarding our communities,” Cloud told Breitbart News.
“ICE’s refusal to provide answers only underscores a troubling, systemic disregard for our nation’s laws,” Cloud said. “We will continue to press ICE for full accountability until our border is secure and Americans are safe once again in their own neighborhoods.”
Among other questions, the Republicans want DHS officials to answer whether federal immigrant officers knew Peralta had crossed the border and the failures that allowed him to remain in the U.S. despite his prior deportations.
“Yet another Texan is dead directly because of the Biden-Harris border crisis,” Cruz said:
Texans deserve answers about why this illegal alien was allowed back into our country after being deported twice. This crime was both infuriating and avoidable, but the Biden-Harris administration has made a cynical decision to keep the border open for political purposes. The resulting crimes are avoidable, infuriating, and unacceptable. [Emphasis added]
Gerdes similarly accused Biden and Harris of imposing policies at the border that have “cost countless lives” in American communities.
“While Senator Cruz and Congressman Cloud carry on the fight at the federal level, I will be filing legislation this coming session, ‘Grayson’s Law,’ that addresses illegal immigrant crime at the state level,” Gerdes said.

Breitbart,JD Vance Calls Out Kamala Harris's 'Mass Amnesty Bill',"Sen. JD Vance (R-OH) is calling out legislation promoted by Vice President Kamala Harris on the campaign trail that he says is a “mass amnesty bill” to effectively legalize illegal immigration to the United States.
During a three-hour-long interview on Joe Rogan’s podcast, Vance detailed the so-called “Senate border security bill” repeatedly championed by Harris, who claimed that it received bipartisan support despite failing to ever gain steam among all Democrats and a swath of Republicans.
“Okay, here was the bill … number one, it sets a maximum cap on the number of illegal immigrants we can have before the border shuts down. That maximum cap is two million illegal aliens a year,” Vance told Rogan:
[The bill] codified what’s called ‘Catch and Release’ where a person comes into our country, an illegal immigrant, but they say ‘Oh no, I’m not an illegal immigrant, I’m an asylum seeker,’ and so their claim for asylum gets adjudicated but because there’s a backlog, because we have so many, their claim isn’t going to be adjudicated for 15 years. So rather than having that person wait in Mexico, we give them a work a permit, we give them legal status, and we let them come into the United States of America. That’s called ‘Catch and Release.’ Donald Trump’s policy was you have to wait in Mexico … [the bill] codified that. [Emphasis added]
In other words, even if Donald Trump became president, this is why he really hated [the bill], is because he would not be able to undo Catch and Release if he won the election, it would codified into American law.
[Emphasis added]Third thing it did: Nothing on the border wall, nothing on the system known as parole which is supposed to be a case-by-case, you grant parole to people who are fleeing tyranny, but Harirs has used parole by the millions of millions — mass parole, whole categories of parole for entire countries.
[Emphasis added]
In effect, Vance said, the bill “wasn’t a border security bill” but actually a “mass amnesty bill” that offered “scraps to Border Patrol” which he said has allowed Harris “to hinge onto that one thing and say it’s a border security bill. No, no, no, it was a mass amnesty bill.”
Vance also noted that several Senate Democrats and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, made up entirely of Democrats, lobbied against the bill.
“By the way, like six Democrats voted against that piece of legislation because they thought it was a disaster,” Vance said:
So, it was not a bipartisan border bill, in fact it was much more bipartisan in opposition to the legislation, but it has allowed Kamala Harris to go around and dishonestly claim that she cares about the southern border even though when they came into office, they bragged about doing all of Donald Trump’s border policies. [Emphasis added]
On Harris’s and President Joe Biden’s watch, the number of migrants encountered at the nation’s borders is approaching 10.5 million — the largest wave ever recorded in U.S. history. Several millions of those migrants have been welcomed to American communities while awaiting their deportation hearings.

Breitbart,'Wet Ass P**sy' Rapper Cardi B to Endorse Kamala at Wisconsin Rally After Saying Biden ‘Really F**ked' Up the Country,"“Wet Ass Pussy” rapper Cardi B is set to endorse Kamala Harris at an upcoming rally in the battleground state of Wisconsin one year after the star publicly blasted President Joe Biden by saying he “really fucked” up the country.
Cardi B will appear at a Milwaukee rally on Friday, according to multiple reports, but it remains unclear if she will actually perform. The Kamala Harris campaign was burned badly last week when Beyonce didn’t perform during a Houston rally, despite leaks to the media promising that she would be singing.
The Friday rally in Wisconsin will also reportedly feature the singers Gorilla, Flo Milli, MC Late, The Isley Brothers, and DJ Gemini Gilly.
In a statement, the Kamala Harris campaign described Cardi B as a “trusted” voice for her fans.
“These artists and public figures are trusted voices for millions of Americans, who listen to their music, follow them on social media, or otherwise are inspired by them. The Harris-Walz campaign believes that by using their voices to lay out the stakes of this election, it will further encourage and mobilize people to go vote.”
As Breitbart News reported last year, Cardi B told her tens of millions of Instagram followers she’s never endorsing another aspiring president after backing President Joe Biden in 2020.
“I’m not endorsing no fucking president no more,” the rap star vowed, adding that while New York City is facing massive budgetary cuts, “Joe Biden’s talking about, ‘Yeah, we can fund two wars.”
Kamala Harris recently said on ABC’s The View that she wouldn’t do anything differently than Biden.
“There is not a thing that comes to mind,” she said.

Breitbart,Read -- IDF Chief of Staff Herzi Halevi: The 'Balance' of the Hero Soldier,"Israel Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi delivered an address Thursday to a graduation ceremony for combat officers in which he described the fundamental principle of the “hero” soldier as one who has “balance.”
Halevi spoke alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who told graduates: “We are dismantling the axis of evil that we face, with calculated blows. No longer will terrorist armies be on our borders. Hamas will no longer rule in Gaza and Hezbollah will not sit on our northern border.” He added that “[w]e can go anywhere that we need to in Iran,” and promised that Israel would eventually achieve its goal of halting Iran’s nuclear weapons program.
But it was Halevi’s speech that stood out, partly because of the circumstances: it was a group of trainees who killed Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar, carrying out their ordinary duties in Gaza, performing exactly as they had been taught.
Moreover, the burden of fighting during the war has been carried by ordinary people — often reservists, with jobs and families, who have returned to their military duties, risking everything for the sake of the common defense of their nation.
The following is the full text of Halevi’s address, translated from the original Hebrew by the IDF:
A year of the war has passed. Four seasons have come and gone. This year, you came from the battlefield, and now you return to it as commanders. You have gained extensive combat experience, learned what the battlefield is, and have become experienced in the actions of war. As young officers, you are at the beginning of the most fascinating journey of all – the journey of command.
Prime Minister, Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu,
Minister of Defense, Mr. Yoav Gallant,
Honored Shaykh Mowafaq Tarif,
Commanders, family members, dear officers.Only recently, on Simchat Torah, we returned to asking for rain, hoping for blessed rains for the fields of the communities near the Gaza Strip to the orchards along the Lebanon border. In Tractate Berakhot, the Mishnah speaks of the might of rain. Through the might of rain, I wish to speak about the might of command. When rain falls in heavy doses, it can be damaging. Its absence also causes harm, but it is needed in the precise, appropriate measure; that is its strength.
The same is true of command: a commander must understand might. The hero is said to control his urges – not suppress them, nor leave them unchecked – the hero expresses the balance between them and the correct measure.
Instruct and explain to your subordinates, but also allow them to gain experience and become independent. Demonstrate determination in achieving the mission, and show them thoughtful decision-making in choosing the right path to fulfill. Teach them to take risks for the security of the state in a professional and appropriate manner.
Whether a platoon commander or a squad commander leads his soldiers to search a house in Lebanon, the approach he chooses: quiet or noisy, through the entrance or by breaching the wall, and the way he decides to search the building – each decision like this will impact the mission and your subordinates.
Recently, I met a platoon commander in the Tel al-Sultan area in Rafah. He was directed to a building where a terrorist had fled after our troops fired in his direction. The platoon commander entered the staircase of the two-story building and told me he saw fresh blood on the stairs, realizing that the wounded terrorist had gone up to the second floor.
Since there was no urgency, he acted with the right measure – he activated a drone to scan the building, identified the terrorist, exited the building, opened fire through the windows, and directed a tank to fire on the second floor. From this strike, the terrorist Yahya Sinwar was eliminated. The wisdom of commanders leads to good results at an appropriate cost. In this incident, one of our soldiers was seriously wounded. I met him this week; he is recovering and proud of his comrades who continue to fight. We wish him a full recovery.
Consider one of your soldiers, someone struggling to continue as a combat soldier. On the one hand, determination and expectation are the right approach, but on the other hand, you may break his spirit and lose a good soldier. Listen to him, often, simply listening to a struggling subordinate is most of the solution. I share with you insights I didn’t have as a young officer at the beginning of my journey.
Today, you, the graduating officers, join the ground forces’ commanders who have led us for over a year in defense and offense along the borders and deep within enemy territory, in winter and summer, in cold and heat, in dust and mud.
This past year, we have dealt a heavy blow to Hamas, eliminating hundreds of its commanders and thousands of its operatives, destroying manufacturing and combat infrastructure, and neutralizing many of its military and governmental capabilities.
We have inflicted severe operational and moral damage on Hezbollah, disrupted its chain of command, weakened its confidence, and degraded its abilities. We prevented wide-scale escalation in Judea and Samaria, eliminated hundreds of terrorists, and thwarted numerous terrorist attacks. Our long arm reached as far as Yemen and Iran with precision and sharpness. Our mission continues.
In recent weeks, we have settled scores with the master murderers leading Hezbollah and Hamas. Wars come with costs, and alongside our many achievements, this morning civilians were severely injured by a rocket while working in the fields in Metula. We extend our support to their families and to all the bereaved families.
During this entire period, we have not forgotten the hostages held captive by Hamas and are working to bring them home. Four seasons in this war. Some have felt them underground, the heat and humidity of summer and the cold of winter. This is a war goal set by the political echelon for the IDF, and rightly so. We have done to achieve it, bringing many back. We are responsible for them being there, and we must continue to act with urgency. We must move quickly to bring them home, this is our moral duty.
The strength of the IDF’s work this past year, alongside the renewed strength standing here on the parade ground – this is the power that allows us to fight, to give, and to persist; until we succeed and we return all the hostages. This strength will not cease and will continue to fight Hamas with all might and wisdom. We will not forget, and we will not stop. We will bring victory, of which the return of the hostages is an essential part.
Course commanders, you have led a professional and ethical training program during wartime. You understand well that our force-building rests first and foremost on people, and for that, we extend our deepest gratitude. You have built exemplary officers.
And you, the families, are the heart and support of the graduates. From you, they draw the strength and encouragement to shoulder the burden of command and its accompanying responsibilities. Your influence on every choice they made is substantial, and we greatly appreciate it.
Dear officers,
I am proud of your choice to be commanders in the IDF at this critical time for the future of the State of Israel. Be brave, know the right measure, think of it—not drought or flood, but command that brings blessing. Rise and succeed!
The idea of a “balance” between two extremes is one with deep roots in Jewish religious thought, especially the works of Maimonides, who was in turn influenced by the Greek philosophy of Aristotle, and the “doctrine of the mean.”
Halevi faced calls to resign following the October 7 terror attack, and has suggested that he will do so when the war is over, but has stayed on to lead Israel’s fight back — which, judged by historical standards, has been a massive success.

Breitbart,Frank Luntz: Biden’s Garbage Gaffe May Be 'Turning Point' Leading to Trump Victory,"Pollster Frank Luntz said Wednesday on CNN’s “News Central” that President Joe Biden’s garbage comment could have a “huge” impact and might be the “turning point” that leads to former President Donald Trump’s victory in the election.
Luntz said, “It’s going to be huge because this is not some comedian saying something stupid and offensive at a rally where he should have been just basically disinvited. This is the president of the United States endorsing his vice president, saying something — and I know that there’s different interpretations about what he said — it’s still inappropriate. He still shouldn’t be doing it. And I’ve watched Trump already seize this. The ‘basket of deplorables’ was significant, was meaningful in 2016. In 2024, I can promise you that this is going to drive Trump turnout. And he’s doing it already. I can see — I’m sure there’s going to be ads on as soon as tonight about this. This may be a turning point for those final 3% — and that’s all it is — who still need to be persuaded.”
He added, “Focusing on these last persuadables I will tell you that Trump offends them and they don’t like him as a person but Harris scares them because they don’t know where she stands. They feel that she hasn’t been clear on some of the key issues.”

Breitbart,Harris Co-Chair: 'Don't Understand Why We Put So Much Emphasis' on Her Past Praise of Defund the Police,"On Tuesday’s broadcast of CNN’s “The Lead,” Harris-Walz Campaign Co-Chair Rep. James Clyburn (D-SC) responded to 2024 Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris’ past praise of the Defund the Police movement by stating that “I don’t understand why we put so much emphasis on that,” she’s gotten criticized for being too aggressive as a prosecutor, and “when you pursue your profession, sometimes, people tend to misrepresent exactly what the real facts are. So, I think that she has done a tremendous job in all the professions she has had. None of us are perfect. But all of us are in pursuit of perfection.”
Host Jake Tapper said, “Vice President Harris has never specifically called for defunding the police, but, in 2020, when the movement was big, she did praise the Defund the Police movement for questioning police budgets. And I wonder if you fear at all that these nuanced abstractions make her vulnerable to people not knowing exactly where she stands on issues. For example, in June 2020, I asked you about the Defund the Police movement, and you said, ‘Nobody is going to defund the police.’ A pretty explicit position that she did not take.”
Clyburn responded, “Well, that’s right, because I believe very strongly in the police, I also believe there’s probably unfairness, and I also know that we have rogue cops and we have ministers that need to be defrocked. We have these in all professions. There are lawyers that get disbarred. And when this happens, we don’t get rid of the profession. We get rid of those who…in some way, do something untoward. So, the same thing goes with police. We believe in the police, we support the police, we want to call upon them when we need them, and we will fund them for that purpose. But that doesn’t mean we’re not going to hold them accountable like we hold all other professionals accountable.”
Tapper then said, “But that’s my point. You’re kind of proving my point, because that is a very clear policy statement. And that’s not what Kamala Harris was saying in 2019, 2020, when she was talking about, well, it’s good that they’re bringing attention to police budgets, etc. And that gives Trump the room to say, she’s all over the map on this issue, just like she is with fracking and others.”
Clyburn responded, “Well, I don’t understand why we put so much emphasis on that, and when we see the other side accusing her of over-policing when she was a district attorney, I’ve heard people accuse her of being too forceful in that job. She was attorney general, she has been accused in that regard as well. So, we all have these detractors, no matter what you do. Very few people will really admit to wrongdoing. And so, when you pursue your profession, sometimes, people tend to misrepresent exactly what the real facts are. So, I think that she has done a tremendous job in all the professions she has had. None of us are perfect. But all of us are in pursuit of perfection.”

Breitbart,"4 Years of Biden-Harris ‘Woke’ Military Policies Have Left America Dangerously Weak, Vulnerable, Unprepared","As the Biden-Harris administration’s term ends, its four-year focus on social reforms over combat readiness has left America’s armed forces woke, weak, and dangerously unprepared — with historically low military recruitment numbers, lowered standards, and compromised morale at a time of rising global threats.
The administration’s military policies prioritizing social agendas over readiness have resulted in a politicized, underfunded, undermanned, and unprepared force. Furthermore, under Biden and Harris, the military faced a recruitment crisis, with major branches repeatedly missing targets and standards lowered to meet numbers — impacting readiness.
Social Reform over Readiness
From day one, the Biden-Harris administration vowed to “cleanse” the military by ridding the ranks of what it labeled “racists and extremists.”
Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, requiring a congressional waiver to serve due to recent military service, immediately issued mandates to root out alleged extremism — which he deemed “absolutely unacceptable” — and promote diversity.
By early 2022, Pentagon data revealed that service members spent $1 million and nearly six million man-hours on “stand-down” days and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) training rather than on mission-critical exercises, a move critics argue pulled focus from combat preparedness.
“We face real threats across the world, yet the Biden administration is more focused on promoting its leftist social agenda in the military instead of countering China, Russia and Iran or creating an effective counterterrorism plan,” said a dozen Senate Armed Services Committee Republicans in a joint statement at the time.
The senators noted that, after a year-long study, the Biden-Harris administration’s Countering Extremism Working Group found fewer than 100 cases of “extremist activity” among service members, despite the military spending a whopping 58,000 hours on extremism training, which they argue is excessive given that existing defense bills already address such cases.
“Woke” Policies and Lowered Standards
Throughout the Biden-Harris term, the military faced criticism for pushing a “woke” agenda at the expense of focusing on protecting the country.
One of the first actions the Biden-Harris administration took at the Pentagon was to undo Trump’s order to allow transgender persons to serve in the military only in their biological sex. Biden and Harris would go on to champion policies on LGBTQ rights, including support for transgender rights in the military and policies allowing for gender-affirming medical care, with TRICARE covering hormone therapy and counseling, and waivers available for “medically necessary” surgeries for the treatment of gender dysphoria.
Within months, then Acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Harker released a memo outlining his efforts to promote DEI in the Navy. The memo was intended to serve as a framework for ongoing DEI efforts in the Navy and directed the Chief Diversity Officer of the Navy, Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Manpower and Reserve Affairs) Cathy Kessmeier, to lead a Strategic Planning Team and develop an action plan to promote DEI.
Meanwhile, the appointment of transgender Vice Admiral Rachel Levine (formerly Richard Levine) as HHS Assistant Secretary for Health, also faced criticism as a symbol of the administration’s shift from traditional military values. Levine claimed “gender-affirming care” for youth, a far-left euphemism for child mutilation, is “lifesaving” and a medical necessity. The assistant secretary for health also called to “empower” children to use puberty blockers and undergo sex reassignment surgery.
Military experts have raised alarms that the focus on diversity is creating a force that may be less prepared to face increasingly sophisticated international threats.
Already in 2021, Republicans ordered a report that concluded the Navy’s top brass is more focused on wokeness and diversity training than on winning wars. As a result, the report revealed, sailors have been left feeling unprepared to face a 21st century conflict with China.
The Navy would go on to release a training video teaching sailors to use the “right” pronouns, “show that we’re allies,” and create “a safe space for everybody,” while instructing servicemembers on how to proceed after having “misgendered” someone.
In addition, a report from 2022 recommended the Marine Corps drop gender-specific salutations for drill instructors, claiming that “gender identifiers” can “remind recruits of negative stereotypes they hold” and “subconsciously” affect the reactions of recruits; “prime” them to consider a drill instructor’s “gender first, before their rank or role”; and possibly lead to “misgendering” instructors.
Shortly after a report revealing a shocking rise in “woke” materials featured within DODEA schools, DEI chief Kelisa Wing was removed from her role as officer in Department of Defense’s Education Activity (DODEA) after being accused of anti-white posts and spreading “woke” ideologies within its school systems.
Wing had been accused of using her position in military children’s schools to promote woke ideologies through her personal writings. Following an investigation, the DOD reassigned Wing to another position after having been exposed denigrating white people in several posts.
Republicans have long warned of the damaging effects of wokeism in the Armed Forces, describing it as a distraction from warfighting and a vital factor in driving servicemembers out of active duty “in droves.”
Former Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-WI), who then served as the top Republican on the House Armed Services Military Personnel Committee, called out the military’s woke DEI agenda, criticizing military leaders for “asking us to embrace a brand of identity politics that is fashionable on the left right now, one which judges people explicitly by the color of their skin rather than on their merits as individuals.”
Last year, Republican Reps. Mike Waltz (R-FL), Chair of the Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness, and Jim Banks (R-IN), Chair of the Subcommittee on Military Personnel, warned of the “major threat to democracy” posed by the Department of Defense’s “wokeness” — which they blamed for undermining the military’s apolitical character and harming recruitment, which had hit a “historic” low. They also demanded “transparency” regarding its effects.
The administration’s approval of drag-queen story hours on military bases and hiring of drag “ambassadors” for recruitment also drew significant backlash, with House Republicans and Navy veterans calling the move “radical” and “reckless” and asserting that “a woke military is a weak military.”
In addition, during the Biden-Harris term the U.S. Navy announced it was granting sailors a “one-time reset” of past physical fitness assessment (PFA) failures in hopes of improving retention, while the Department of Defense (DOD) revealed taxpayer dollars would be used to pay for servicemembers’ abortion travel fees.
Despite the efforts, these policies, along with lowered physical and skill standards, have reportedly damaged cohesion and readiness within the ranks.
Vaccine Mandates
In 2021, the administration ordered all military members and reservists to take the COVID-19 vaccine or face discharge from the military. As a result, more than 8,000 service members were discharged, with an unknown number choosing not to re-enlist and contributing to an enlistment crisis.
The policy left reinstated members frustrated and morale low across the ranks.
Republicans in Congress eventually forced the administration to rescind the mandate in the 2023 National Defense Authorization Act. However, affected veterans service members continue their fight for accountability and restitution for time and pay lost.
Impact of Biden-Harris’s Afghan Pullout
Since taking office, the Biden-Harris administration has made a series of failed foreign policy moves, many of which have shifted long-standing U.S. strategies, impacting military readiness and compromising stability, having weakened America’s strategic position and strained the military’s ability to effectively respond to global threats.
The chaotic Afghanistan withdrawal in 2021 was described by military leaders as a costly lapse in coordinated planning and accountability, leaving allies and veterans questioning the administration’s commitment to effective military strategy. It not only shook U.S. credibility but left an estimated $7 billion worth of military equipment in Taliban hands after the radical Islamist terrorist group’s takeover of the country, despite the billions of dollars spent by the U.S. and NATO over nearly two decades to build up Afghan security forces.
The hasty evacuation saw vast stockpiles of weapons, vehicles, aircraft, and advanced technology abandoned. The move bolstered Taliban forces and emboldened other adversaries, compromising national security and dealing a blow to troop morale, as many service members felt years of sacrifice were erased.
The military would subsequently see a notable increase in suicide rates, with many active members and veterans expressing disillusionment with what they perceived as a purposeless mission and lack of support — concerns only deepened by the administration’s focus on non-combat priorities.
According to a survey released by Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA) last year, nearly 49 percent of veterans are suffering from trauma as a result of the events of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, the report said.
Hostage Trades, “Shameful” Concessions and Deterrence
The Biden-Harris administration’s handling of high-profile trades has drawn heavy criticism for weakening U.S. military deterrence.
The administration faced criticism after arranging a trade of WNBA player Brittney Griner, detained in Russia, for notorious Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout, described as “one of the most dangerous men on the face of the Earth.”
Critics labeled the trade lopsided and dangerous, with one congressman calling it a “major propaganda victory” for Russia.
With Griner’s release celebrated by the administration, many questioned the strategic focus on trades for high-profile civilians over the concerns of military personnel, warning it risked signaling weak negotiation principles to adversaries.
Republican officials would later criticize the Biden-Harris administration for paying “ransom” to the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism after it approved a “shameful” deal with Iran to pay the Islamic regime $6 billion in exchange for five detained Iranian-American citizens on the anniversary of the September 11 attacks. In addition, the Biden-Harris administration reached a plea deal removing the death penalty for three accused 9/11 terrorists, allowing them to plead guilty in exchange, but backtracked after intense bipartisan backlash.
Moreover, the recent U.S.-Russia prisoner swap — where eight Russian criminals, including high-profile cybercriminals Vladislav Klyushin and Roman Seleznev, were exchanged for American hostages — has raised concerns, as both had previously been convicted for major cyber offenses targeting U.S. institutions, posing a significant victory for Putin’s influence strategy.
Such concessions set a dangerous precedent, weakening the U.S. stance and risking morale among military forces who rely on strong, uncompromising leadership in matters of national security.
Environmental Mandates
The Biden-Harris administration has elevated climate change as a cornerstone of its policy agenda, embedding it across federal departments, including the Department of Defense (DOD).
In 2022, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin issued a directive mandating the Army to incorporate climate considerations into strategic planning, resulting in a 50-page document focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
With the administration pushing ambitious environmental targets for the military, including a goal of carbon neutrality by 2050, military analysts have warned that this mandate could compromise combat readiness by diverting resources toward emissions reductions.
This focus could intensify under a Harris administration, especially with her likely appointment of key environmental allies, among them being Democrat vice presidential nominee Tim Walz, who has called for using algae to power the U.S. Navy as part of his efforts to fight climate change.
However, critics contend that his approach favors long-term environmental goals over urgent national security and energy needs, potentially raising costs and creating reliability issues in defense infrastructure.
Republican vice-presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance (OH) has criticized Walz, asserting he “wants to make the American people more reliant on garbage energy instead of good American energy.”
Chinese Spy Balloon Incident
In another high-profile incident, a Chinese spy balloon was allowed to traverse U.S. airspace for days, allegedly after collecting intelligence from sensitive military sites before being shot down. The delayed response raised questions about U.S. air defense vigilance and readiness under the command of Biden and Harris.
The U.S. House of Representatives Homeland Security Committee account blamed the Biden-Harris administration for having “left our nation’s military intelligence and critical infrastructure at risk to the CCP’s espionage,” while Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) declared that the balloon was a “test on America to collect data and intelligence.”
Bloomberg reported the Biden administration had hoped to hide its existence from the public so as not to ruin Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s planned trip to Beijing.
Election Implications
As the election nears, national security has become a leading issue, particularly in swing states where veterans and active-duty families reside.
Concerns over the Biden-Harris administration’s handling of defense matters have only intensified with revelations of a “lack of transparency” within the Department of Defense when Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was hospitalized for several days without informing key officials.
The incident sparked outrage and raised serious questions about security protocols and chain-of-command procedures during his absence. It also added to ongoing critiques, with many arguing it reflects a troubling lack of accountability, further straining an already underprepared and morale-challenged military force.
Trump’s campaign has positioned itself in sharp contrast, promising a return to “strength and deterrence” in military policy. The former president, who signed the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act that officially created the Space Force — the sixth and first new military branch since 1947, has vowed to refocus it on combat preparedness and national defense amid concerns it has become politicized.
For undecided voters, especially those concerned with national defense, the perceived “woke” and “weak” military may be a deciding factor.
Furthermore, Harris’s inexperience could leave her ill-prepared to handle complex defense issues, with fears that the military’s readiness will continue to decline, especially as her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, faces scrutiny over alleged ties to China’s influence campaigns and undisclosed past relationships with CCP-affiliated individuals.
With Biden and Harris’s disastrous four-year record, voters may seek a candidate focused on restoring combat readiness and stability within the military, rather than on social policies that have left America’s forces vulnerable to growing international threats.
This month, former President Donald Trump’s campaign slammed wokeness in the military under Biden and Harris, calling for making “our military great again.”
He also agreed to set up a task force to root out wokeness and DEI training, as well as other initiatives fostered under Biden and Harris.

Breitbart,CNN's Tapper Fact Checks Harris: Trump Was 'Talking About Protecting Women',"CNN host Jake Tapper said Thursday on “The Lead” that Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris was not correct when discussing former president Donald Trump’s comments about women.
At a campaign event in Arizona, Kamala Harris said, “Did everyone hear what he just said yesterday that he will do what he wants, quote, and here’s where I’m going to quote ‘whether the women like it or not.’ We must vote. This is the thing, you know, there’s a saying that you have to listen to people when they tell you who you are and this is not the first time he has told us who he is. He does not believe women should have the agency and authority to make decisions about their own bodies.”
Tapper said, “Two tiny little fact checks. First of all, she keeps referring to the Trump proposal on tariffs as a sales tax. It’s not a sales tax. You can dispute the tariffs and whether or not there a good idea, but it’s not a sales tax. And the second thing is when Trump said, he was going to do something for women, whether they like it or not, whether the women like it or not, he was talking about protecting women, protecting women whether they like it or not. Certainly, you can take issue with the language, but it wasn’t he wasn’t saying he was just going to do whatever he wanted, regardless.”
He added, “I mean but you take my point. He’s saying I’m gonna protect them, whether that women want me to protect them.”
Former Spokesperson for Hillary Clinton, Karen Finney said, “Some would say that’s misogynists.”
Tapper said, “But it’s not as as she presented it.”

Brian Mast, (R-FL), Bill Huizenga (R-MI), and Mike Waltz (R-FL) sent a letter to Austin on Wednesday, saying they have “grave concern over deficiencies in the Defense Department’s protocols” when service members claimed absentee ballots had not been made available to them because their base’s stockpile was “depleted and had not been replenished.”
The service members, who were not named in the letter, also complained there has been “inadequate education” on how they are meant to vote while deployed on active duty, and with just four days until Election Day.
“Our nation’s brave men and women in uniform brought to our attention that there has been inadequate education at the administrative level on how to register to vote, request an absentee ballot, and fill in a federal write-in absentee ballot if their state-issued ballot does not arrive in time,” the lawmakers wrote.
“Other service members also stated that when a request for a federal write-in absentee ballot was made, they were told the base’s stockpile of such ballots was depleted and had not been replenished.”
At the end of the letter, the congressmen asked Austin a series of questions to verify if the military had, in fact, diminished service members’ right to vote.
“Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have mobilized federal manpower, resources, and tax dollars to block state-level election integrity measures, including in Georgia and Virginia, through lawsuits and smears,” Mast said in a press release. “They claim to care about democracy and the right to vote, yet they’ve failed to plan accordingly to facilitate the right to vote for every single one of our nation’s brave men and women in uniform.”
“This is absolutely unacceptable,” he added. “Our nation’s elite warriors deserve to have every opportunity to vote for the next commander-in-chief, especially since that person will be making life-and-death decisions for our troops.”
According to Waltz, “Both Joe Biden & Kamala Harris have dismissed our warfighters serving in combat zones by either falsely claiming the U.S. has suffered no casualties under this administration or by claiming thousands of these service members aren’t in active combat zones.”
“We need assurances these service members who are putting their lives on the line for our country have the information and tools they need to cast their ballot to vote,” the Florida congressman stated.
Huizenga added that it is “completely unacceptable that our men and women serving overseas are not receiving the proper information and resources necessary to cast their ballot.”
“Sadly, this is the latest example of the Biden-Harris Administration failing to stand up for our servicemembers.”
The complaints were brought up “during recent visits with active duty service members,” the congressmen said.
In a statement to Fox News, a DOD official said that the number of voting materials are based on local need and demand.
“In addition to designating Voting Assistance Officers, every installation commander ensures voting assistance is included in the administrative in-processing as well as pre- and post- deployment checklists required of reporting and detaching personnel,” the official said.",2024-11-01
Breitbart,Tim Walz Allegedly Told Former Player Dealing with Alcohol Issues to Keep Playing: 'Don't Care About That Other Stuff',"Minnesota Governor and Democrat Vice Presidential nominee Tim Walz reportedly told a former player to “keep playing” as he battled criminal and alcohol-related issues.
An article in The Ringer on Wednesday featured a story about a member of Walz’s 1998 Mankato West High School football team in Minnesota.
Dan Clement, a former linebacker for Mankato West, told The Ringer how his experimentation with alcohol in high school eventually turned into an alarming situation in the summer between his junior and senior seasons when he was arrested multiple times for underage drinking.
Faced with a suspension going into his final season, Clement decided not to play at all. That decision reportedly did not sit well with Walz, the team’s defensive coordinator at the time, who told Clement the team “needed him.”
“We need you,” Walz reportedly said.
“He knew I was struggling,” Clement told The Ringer. However, regarding his off-the-field struggles, Clement said Walz was insistent: “I don’t care about that other stuff,” Walz reportedly said.
Clement did as Walz advised and played the second half of the season. Though his problems with alcohol persisted and wouldn’t be conquered for several more years, Clement believes the advice Walz gave was correct.
“The caring attention he gave, that positive support can pull you through really dark times in your life,” Clement said. The troubled linebacker told Walz, “I’m leaning on you. I’m trusting you here. I think partying is a better idea. You don’t think so. And I’m going to trust you on that.’”
Clement added, “And he was right. I was wrong. And later in life, when I continued to do that, when I continued to trust other people who love me, then it led my life in this beautiful direction. Just like it did back then.”
Walz’s status as a former assistant high school football coach has been a focal point of the Harris-Walz campaign’s attempt to portray the Minnesota governor as a “man’s man,” embodying the right balance between masculinity and liberal politics.
That plan hit the skids over the weekend as Walz – or someone posting on his X account – made a glaring and nonsensical football statement by crediting New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with knowing how to “run a mean pick 6” after she played the governor in a game of Madden during a live stream.
As almost everyone, with the apparent exception of the person who wrote the post, knows, you can’t “run” a pick-6. A pick-6 is an unplanned play in which a defender returns an interception for a touchdown.",2024-10-31
Breitbart,Pennsylvania Poll: More Voters Say They Will 'Definitely' or 'Probably' Support Trump over Harris,"More Pennsylvania voters say they will “definitely” or “probably” support former President Donald Trump over Vice President Kamala Harris, according to the latest Monmouth survey released less than one week from the election.
The survey found that, among all registered voters surveyed, 47 percent said they will “definitely” or “probably” vote for Trump, while 46 percent said the same for Harris. Another four percent said they would “definitely” or “probably” choose other.
Overall, the survey observed that Trump’s victory lies in low propensity voters.
Via Monmouth:
Harris does best among high-propensity voters, while Trump’s path to victory relies on turning out enough low-propensity voters. The current state of the U.S. Senate race is a little better for Democrats, but not by much.
…
The current results represent statistically insignificant movement from Monmouth’s Pennsylvania poll taken five weeks ago. Support for Harris has decreased nominally by one percentage point from 48% in September while her definite support ticked up from 40% to 42%. Trump’s total support has increased slightly by 2 points from 45%, with his definite support going from 38% to 42%. At the opposite end of the spectrum the number of voters who have definitely ruled out a vote for Trump increased slightly from 46% to 49% and the definitely not number for Harris went up by a bit more, going from 44% to 50%.
Patrick Murray, director of Monmouth University Polling Institute, reiterated in a statement that Trump’s path lies with these low propensity voters.
“Trump’s path to victory in Pennsylvania is by turning out low-propensity voters. In a normal election this may be difficult to do. For many, their lack of participation is due to an underlying distrust in government itself,” he observed.
The survey was taken October 24-28, among 824 Pennsylvania registered voters. It has a +/- 3.8 percent margin of error.
Republicans across the country have been keenly aware of this, however, and some of them are doing something about it. In September, Breitbart News Saturday spoke to Cliff Maloney, who heads up the Pennsylvania Chase, quite literally tasked with chasing ballots in the Keystone State. They aim to motivate voters, “particularly in light of the fact that 141,000 Republicans who requested mail-in ballots in 2020 never turned them in,” as Breitbart News reported at the time.
“I think when you look at that compared to the fact we lost by 80,000, it’s like, yeah, we just got to solve that problem,” he said, explaining that they have 120 full-time ballot chasers.
“We are going to low-propensity Republicans, those that are unlikely to vote, and we are asking them if they will request a mail-in ballot. We’re not going to Election-Day voters; they’re likely voters. We’re going to unlikely voters that happen to be Republican, and we’re asking them to request,” he said, explaining that their strategy would change once ballots went out, as they would then target voters aligned with them to get them committed to turning in their ballots.
Maloney stressed the importance for Republicans to play the game to successfully close the gap in Pennsylvania and deliver a victory for former President Donald Trump.
Wednesday’s RealClearPolitics average of polls showed Trump up by an average of 0.6 percent in the state.",2024-10-30
Breitbart,Supreme Court: Youngkin Can Remove Noncitizens from Virginia Voter Rolls,"WASHINGTON, DC – Federal law allows Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R) to stop noncitizen voting by removing noncitizens from Virginia voter rolls, the U.S. Supreme Court ordered on Wednesday in a massive win for President Donald Trump, Republicans, and election integrity supporters.
Youngkin removed 6,303 noncitizens from the voter rolls in Virginia between January 2022 when he took office and July 2024, pursuant to a state law in place since 2006. Then in August, Youngkin issued an executive order (EO) directing election officials to continue this program in advance of November’s election.
Under Youngkin’s EO, if a person getting a driver’s license checked a box on the license application saying that the person is not a U.S. citizen, but somehow that person eventually ended up on the voter rolls anyway – almost certainly by later registering to vote – election officials would send that person a letter informing them that it is illegal for noncitizens to vote, and that if the person did not show proof of citizenship to election officials within 14 days of receiving the letter, their names will be removed from Virginia’s voter rolls.
In addition to the initial 6,300, another 1,600 persons have been removed from voter lists in the Old Dominion pursuant to Youngkin’s EO.
The Biden-Harris Department of Justice (DOJ) sued Youngkin, claiming that the 90-day “quiet period” in the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA, or “Motor Voter”) does not allow these removals for three months prior to Election Day. DOJ argued that perhaps all of these noncitizens had since become U.S. citizens or had checked the wrong box when they told the government they were not citizens.
Youngkin and Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares (R) fought back, explaining that while NVRA does not allow “systematic” removals during the 90-day window before an election, these 1,600 were instead individualized removals on a case-by-case basis because these individuals voters had individually declared they were not citizens.
The case went to a liberal federal trial judge in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, who ruled in favor of Biden and Harris and ordered those noncitizens restored to the voter rolls by Election Day. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit – one of the most liberal appellate courts in the nation – affirmed that judgment, though acknowledging that part of the trial judge’s order was unworkable.
Youngkin applied to the U.S. Supreme Court to issue a stay that would block the lower court’s order, directed to Chief Justice John Roberts as the justice who supervises the Fourth Circuit. President Trump supported Youngkin’s fight, and the Republican National Committee (RNC) filed a brief supporting Youngkin. Roberts received legal briefs from both sides and circulated them to his colleagues Tuesday night.
RELATED — Trump: Non-Citizens Being on Virginia Voter Rolls Is “Election Interference”
C-SPANOn Wednesday morning, the Supreme Court issued the stay by a 6-3 vote, upholding Youngkin’s EO and keeping the noncitizens off the voter rolls in Virginia. This stay will remain in place while the Fourth Circuit goes through the full appeals process in the months ahead, after which the losing side can ask the Supreme Court to hear the case and issue a formal opinion on the legal argument.
Liberal Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Kentanji Brown Jackson voted to deny the stay.
“This is a spectacular victory for election integrity and the rule of law,” Ambassador Ken Blackwell, who is chairman of the Center for Election Integrity at the America First Policy Institute, told Breitbart News in an exclusive reaction to the ruling. “Americans overwhelmingly support the federal law that forbids noncitizens from voting in federal elections, and I applaud both the Supreme Court for upholding the law here and Governor Youngkin for cleaning up Virginia’s voter rolls.”
The case is Beals v. Virginia Coalition for Immigrant Rights, and the application for a stay is 24A407 in the Supreme Court of the United States.

Breitbart,Kamala Harris Vows to Unite 'All Americans’ After Calling Trump a 'Fascist',"Vice President Kamala Harris claimed on Tuesday during her campaign’s partisan closing pitch in Washington, DC, that she would be a “president for all Americans.”
Harris’s claim appears disingenuous after she told CNN last week that former President Donald Trump is a “fascist” and a threat to democracy.
Trump, who received tens of millions of votes in 2020 and 2016, represents a large portion of the electorate.
Nevertheless, Harris told supporters on the National Mall that she pledged to “seek common ground” and that she is “not looking to score political points.”
She also promised to “listen” to people “who disagree” with her, “unlike Donald Trump,” she said, who claimed he wants to “put them in jail.”
“This is not a candidate for president who is thinking about how to make your life better. This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power,” she continued.
“I pledge to be a president for all Americans — to always put country above party and above self,” she added. “We have to stop pointing fingers and start locking arms. It is time to turn the page on the drama and the conflict, the fear and division. It is time for a new generation of leadership in America.”
Moments before Harris spoke, on WISN 12 NEWS in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, she refused to walk back inflammatory statements by Gov. Tim Walz (D). Her running mate equated Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden to a 1939 Nazi rally at the New York City arena:
Trump believes the Democrat rhetoric puts his life in harm’s way. “She’s going out and only criticizing, talking about Hitler and Nazi because her record is horrible,” Trump said Tuesday at Mar a Lago.
“Perhaps more than anything else, it’s a campaign of hate, a campaign of absolute hate,” he said. “After two assassination attempts in just over three months, her lies and her slanders are very shameful and really inexcusable.”

Breitbart,Fact Check: Kamala Harris Falsely Claims Trump Would Impose A National Sales Tax,"Claim: Kamala Harris on Tuesday night accused Donald Trump of proposing a national sales tax.
Harris said that Trump would pay for his proposed tax cuts with a “20 percent national sales tax on everything you buy that is imported.”
Verdict: False.
President Trump has not proposed a national sales tax.
Harris was likely referring to Trump’s proposal to raise tariffs on imports. Tariffs are paid by companies that import goods from abroad and not by consumers. They are not a sales tax.
Studies of the tariffs Trump imposed during his 2017-2021 term have shown that some of the cost of tariffs ultimately fell on importers and some fell on the exporting countries. The tariffs were not passed through to consumers and did not act as a tax on households, as the low level of consumer inflation during the Trump years shows.
Tariffs do not tend to raise consumer prices. As Mary Amiti of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s Research and Statistics Group, Princeton University’s Stephen Redding, and Columbia University’s David Weinstein wrote in one of the most widely cited studies of Trump’s tariffs, “trade theory has long stressed that tariffs applied by a large country should drive down foreign prices.” (That study was not friendly to tariffs, by the way. It concluded that U.S. firms paid for most of the tariffs. But it did not find that the tariffs were passed through from businesses to households.)
As Breitbart Business Digest explained:
When Trump came into office on a promise of tearing up international agreements and imposing tariffs, many of his critics were quick to claim the president was starting a trade war. Establishment economic forecasters on the left and right confidently predicted that Trump’s tariffs would hurt the U.S. economy and raise consumer prices.
Eight years ago, these claims were at least plausible on their face. It had been generations since the U.S. had invoked a muscular trade strategy that included broad tariffs rather than just piecemeal tariffs on products that were illegally being dumped into U.S. markets. The anti-tariff crowd did not have much evidence to support their claims, but it had been so long since we had used trade tariffs strategically that there was not all that much direct evidence on the other pro-tariff side either.
What Trump had on his side was economic theory. You would not know it from the way many economists talk about tariffs, but standard economic theory supports Trump’s claim that tariffs are often paid for by the country whose exports are subject to the increased duties and not by the country importing the goods. Trade theory has long found that tariffs applied by a large economy such as the U.S. tend to drive down foreign prices, as exporting nations have no other choice to offload their excess production.
In fact, it’s long been known to economists that imposing a tariff can improve the terms of trade so much that domestic prices of imported goods subject to the tariff actually fall. This is known as the Metzler Paradox after economist Lloyd Metzler who first wrote about the idea all the way back in 1949. What’s more, by increasing the incentives to invest in domestic production, the tariffs can increase global output of the tariffed goods, which also puts downward pressure on prices.
Price theory also tells us that tariffs are unlikely to raise consumer prices. Although many people imagine that the prices they pay at the cash register are an accumulation of the costs of their inputs, the reality is pretty much the opposite. Consumer demand determines the price of the final product, which then determines the prices of the components and labor that go into making the product. So, when a tariff raises the cost of imports, in a competitive economy there’s no real way for merchants to pass on the cost.
In any case, imports make up only a small portion of consumer purchases so even if the cost of tariffs were passed through to consumers, the effect would not amount to a national sales tax.
There were similar claims that tariffs would raise consumer prices when Trump imposed tariffs in 2019 but consumer prices did not rise.",2024-10-29
Breitbart,Trump Campaign on Harris Dark Speech: She Lies to Cover Results of 'Her Terrible Policies',"The Trump campaign said that Vice President Kamala Harris lied, name-called, and clung to the past in her closing argument speech “to avoid admitting the truth” about her and President Joe Biden’s “terrible policies.”
After Harris trashed Trump in her highly partisan remarks, which were packed with insults and lies, at the Ellipse in Washington, DC, Trump Campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt issued a statement.
“Kamala Harris is lying, name-calling, and clinging to the past to avoid admitting the truth — the migrant crime crisis, sky-high inflation, and raging world wars are the result of her terrible policies,” Leavitt said.
“Kamala’s first day in office was over 1,300 days ago, and she has spent the past four years working hand-in-hand with Joe Biden to destroy our country – but now, she is lying about her record because she has zero policy solutions to offer,” she added.
Leavitt concluded that Trump’s closing argument “is simple: Kamala broke it; he will fix it.”
Harris opted to open her speech with a vicious attack on Trump, who she has begun equating to a fascist and a “petty tyrant” in the home stretch of the campaign.
“This is not a candidate for president who is thinking about how to make your life better. This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power, ” Harris said after baselessly and falsely claiming Trump would use the military against American citizens if elected.
Hours earlier, Trump, who faced two assassination attempts in recent months, was highly critical of Harris and her nasty rhetoric, saying she is running a campaign of “absolute hate.”
“She’s running on a campaign of demoralization and really a campaign of destruction,” Trump said. “But really, perhaps more than anything else, it’s a campaign of hate, a campaign of absolute hate.”",2024-10-29
Breitbart,"WH Adds Apostrophe to Biden's 'Garbage' Remark, Says He Meant 'Supporter's'","The White House released a transcript of President Joe Biden’s remarks in which he called Trump supporters “garbage,” but added an apostrophe to “supporters” and an em-dash to make it seem like he did not mean all Trump supporters but just one.
The transcript read:
And just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a ‘floating island of garbage.’ Well, let me tell you something. I don’t — I — I don’t know the Puerto Rican that — that I know — or a Puerto Rico, where I’m fr- — in my home state of Delaware, they’re good, decent, honorable people. The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporter’s — his — his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American. It’s totally contrary to everything we’ve done, everything we’ve been.
Biden’s account then posted a statement on X to reinforce the claim he meant one Trump supporter, presumably comic Tony Hinchliffe, who performed at Trump’s Madison Square Garden rally.
The Biden account posted:
Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage — which is the only word I can think of to describe it. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation.
Hinchliffe — a comic who has a history of making edgy jokes — joked at the rally: “I don’t know if you guys know this, but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it’s called Puerto Rico.”
Since that rally, which saw a lineup of diverse speakers, including Elon Musk, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., and former Democrat Tulsi Gabbard, Democrats have tried to use Hincliffe’s joke to claim that Trump is racist towards Latinos.
Now, Democrats have found themselves trying to defend Biden’s comments, instead.

Breitbart,JD Vance Blasts Kamala Backer for Doubling Down on Biden Calling Trump Supporters 'Garbage',"Sen. JD Vance (R-OH) blasted Silicon Valley investor and Vice President Kamala Harris supporter Vinod Khosla, as he doubled down on President Joe Biden calling Trump supporters “garbage.”
Khosla is one of the many billionaires backing Harris and he is completely undeterred by Biden’s now viral remarks about half the country.
“Garbage is an understatement for MAGA extremists,” he said in part:
This prompted Vance, Trump’s running mate, to openly wonder if Harris will return his contributions.
“One of Kamala Harris’s biggest donors is doubling down on calling half the country ‘garbage,'” Vance observed, asking, “Will Kamala and her campaign return his contributions?”
“Or will they continue to insult half of the country for the sin of thinking Kamala Harris isn’t good at her job?” he pressed.
Biden’s remark largely overshadowed Harris’s D.C. Ellipse speech, as he stated that, “Donald Trump has no character,” later adding, “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.”
Biden tried to save face, and the establishment media was more than willing to help with the spin, as the 81 year old attempted to make it seem as if he was only referring to the comedian Trump’s campaign had on stage at Madison Square Garden on Sunday.
“Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage—which is the only word I can think of to describe it,” he said.
“His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation,” he added, to no avail.
“A mother mourning her son who died of a fentanyl overdose is not garbage. A truck driver who can’t afford rising diesel prices is not garbage. A father who wants to afford groceries is not garbage,” Vance said right after the news of Biden’s comments broke.
“Kamala Harris and Joe Biden ought to be ashamed of themselves,” he added.
Trump issued a direct response shortly after midnight, contrasting his campaign of “positive solutions to save America” with Harris’s “campaign of hate.”
“She has spent all week comparing her political opponents to the most evil mass murderers in history. Now, on top of everything, Joe Biden calls our supporters ‘garbage,'” he said.
“You can’t lead America if you don’t love the American People. Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have shown they are both unfit to be President of the United States,” he continued, adding that he is “proud to lead the biggest, broadest, and most important political coalition in American history.”
“We are welcoming historic numbers of Latinos, African Americans, Asian Americans, and citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed,” Trump added. “It is my desire to be the President of all the people.”",2024-10-30
Breitbart,"EU Should Create Its Own CIA-Style Spy Agency, Urges Commission","A report commissioned for EU chief Ursula von der Leyen argued that the European Union should institute a bloc-wide international intelligence service to coordinate the espionage efforts of the 27 member states.
Former Finnish President Sauli Niinistö called for forming a “fully-fledged EU service for intelligence cooperation” in light of the European Union’s various challenges.
In a report published this week, Niinistö cited Brussels’s being caught flat-footed by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Chinese coronavirus crisis as examples of why the bloc should create a CIA-style intelligence service.
The neoliberal politician said that the EU “requires a new mindset” to strengthen its preparedness for potential crises.
He argued that the “territorial integrity and political independence of every Member State are inextricably linked” and, therefore, “if the security of one Member State is breached or its sovereignty violated, this directly concerns the other 26 and the Union as a whole. We share a single security.”
The former Finnish president said that during emergencies, it is imperative for “rapid decision-making and action,” and thus, the EU “requires greater clarity of organisation”.
In addition to creating a supranational intelligence service, Niinistö urged for a new legal framework to enable “lawful access to encrypted data” — something spy chiefs seemingly clamour for everywhere — to combat espionage, sabotage, terrorism, and organised crime.
The EU has been in a protracted battle with tech firms over encryption, arguing that the ability to break through the privacy system is important to combat crimes such as child sex abuse. However, technology companies and civil liberties advocates have warned that giving such a tool to governments would endanger individual privacy rights.
Niinistö also called for EU nations to “strengthen their cooperation on European defence,” potentially hinting at forming a European Union Army, an apparent goal of leading Eurocrats such as President von der Leyen.
The former Finnish leader said increasing military spending and seeking to “close longstanding gaps in our military and defence industrial readiness” would also be necessary to “support Ukraine in the long term in a way that creates the conditions for a lasting peace on Ukraine’s terms.”
The report comes as the EU Commission created its first-ever Defence Commissioner, with President Ursula von der Leyen appointing former Lithuanian PM Andrius Kubilius to the role last month. Kubilius has been tasked with overseeing the €1.5 billion European Defence Industry Programme (EDIP), which will seek to organise the production of various defence contractors across the bloc.
Commenting on the report from Niinistö on Wednesday, Ursula von der Leyen said: “Being adequately prepared for major threats requires working in a whole-of-government approach… This means, the ability to use in a concerted and coordinated fashion all the necessary tools and resources of public policy, mobilising authorities at all levels – national, local, and EU – according to their different roles.”
“But this also requires a whole-of-society approach. Therefore, engaging the private sector, civil society and citizens. In other words, preparedness cannot be built in silos. Instead, preparedness requires interaction.”",2024-10-31
Breitbart,‘Trump Wins Big’ Meme Stock Surges in China,"A private company in China with a name that riffs on “Trump Victory” surged by ten percent in value on Monday and Tuesday, even as blue-chip stocks on the Chinese market slid by up to one percent.
The stock in question is for a company called Wisesoft in English, whose Chinese name is “Chuan Da Zhi Sheng.” The name becomes something of a pun in Mandarin Chinese, because it sounds like “Trump Victory,” or more precisely, “Trump Wins Big.”
Chinese investors are fond of choosing obscure stocks based on their amusing names, or “meme stocks,” as analysts call them. At the dawn of the Year of the Dragon in 2023, stocks whose names alluded to dragons sold extremely well.
“It’s fair to say that China’s stock market still lacks maturity, and investors often act irrationally,” market researcher Wang Zichen sighed to the Hindustan Times on Wednesday.
The “Trump Wins Big” stock definitely seems to sell more briskly when Chinese investors are feeling bullish about Donald Trump’s political fortunes. The stock exploded in value when Trump launched his 2016 presidential campaign, for example. It surged again in October when Trump’s social media company reportedly surpassed Elon Musk’s X in market valuation.
“The stock has doubled to 19.98 yuan (US$2.80) over the past month, against an around 20 per cent rise of the index on China’s stimulus plan,” the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Tuesday.
Sadly for Wisesoft’s investors and management, the company’s actual products do not ride Donald Trump’s coattails. Wisesoft makes computer hardware and software for air-traffic controllers. About 90 percent of its customers are in China. The company has been posting quarterly losses for years, including a $3.8 million loss for the first nine months of 2024.",2024-10-30
Breitbart,"Daughter of CA Man Executed by Iran: Biden-Harris 'Did Nothing' for My Dad, Gave Iran $6 Billion","The daughter of a California man abducted by Iran and executed on Monday condemned outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden and his vice president, Democrat presidential candidate Kamala Harris, for abandoning her father while freeing billions of dollars in funding for the terror regime.
The Iranian judiciary confirmed on Monday that it had killed Jamshid Sharmahd, a dual German-Iranian citizen, after sentencing him to death in February 2023 on dubious charges of “terrorism.” Sharmahd was abducted during a business trip while on a layover in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE). The California resident left behind a long record of advocacy for human rights and civil liberties in Iran, including involvement in dissident media and activism.
Sharmahd hosted radio and video broadcasts for Tondar, a human rights website, Amnesty International explained in its profile the political prisoner.
“The website included statements from the Kingdom Assembly of Iran claiming responsibility for explosions inside Iran. Jamshid Sharmahd has repeatedly denied his involvement in the violent acts attributed to him by the authorities,” the human rights organization noted.
Daughter Gazelle Sharmahd has advocated for her father’s freedom since his abduction in 2020, vocally condemning the Biden administration a year ago after a negotiation released five Americans imprisoned in Iran, apparently in exchange for the freeing of $6 billion in Iran’s assets. Biden administration officials insisted the payment was “not a ransom” despite widespread disapproval of the deal, while the loved ones of Americans and others left behind by the swap lamented that the Biden White House had abandoned them.
The $6 billion in freed assets preceded Iran’s proxy terrorist organization Hamas conducting one of its most devastating massacres in history, the killing of an estimated 1,200 people in the October 7, 2023, invasion of Israel, which also featured widespread atrocities including gang rape, mass abductions, torture, and the desecration of corpses.
Gazelle Sharmahd published a video on the social media site Instagram on Monday accompanied by an extensive rebuke to the “incompetent governments” of Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Schulz, where Sharmahd held citizenship.
“The German foreign ministry and US state department will talk to me shortly and I will assess if they have any proof that the cowardly jihadists of the occupying Islamic Regime have murdered you in fear of your very breath,” the younger Sharmahd noted, offering a list of questions for the governments in question.
“As an American-German national was brutally and shamelessly kidnapped, tortured, held hostage for 4 years and (if confirmed) murdered by the biggest terrorist Organisation in the world,” she wrote, “apparently for retaliation of Israeli strikes on the regime, this must have immediate and unmistakable grave consequences for them now.”
“Where is our president? The VP? The secretary? The German chancellor? No call?” she asked. “Are you seriously still going to ignore our family and leave even my father’s presumed corpses [sic] defenseless in terrorist hands? We do not want any statements or condolences that do not include the immediate return of my father (dead or alive) and a severe punishment for the Islamic Regime murderers.”
In other online comments Sharmahd condemned Biden’s deputy special envoy for Iran, Abram Paley, for not doing enough to protect her father, and the administration generally, saying it “did nothing” and tried to “shift responsibility” to Germany.
“YOU left him to die, while the Biden-Harris Administration handed $6 billion to his captors and, if confirmed, his murderers,” she accused.
Paley issued a statement this week calling the execution of Sharmahd “abhorrent” and an example of “transnational repression.”
“Mr Sharmahd should never have been imprisoned in the first place. His kidnapping and rendition, as well as sham trial and reports of torture, were reprehensible,” he asserted, claiming he “stands with his family.”
Gazelle Sharmahd had in previous statements noted that her father had “chosen” America as his ultimate home and had an extended family of U.S. citizens – and could have one day become a citizen had he not been abducted.
“My dad chose the United States as his home, worked hard, followed all the rules, belongs to a family of four generations around him of U.S. citizenship, lived here for 20 years as a tax-paying, law-abiding resident and would already have his citizenship if it wasn’t for the terrorists and qualifies as a U.S. national under the Levinson law,” Sharmahd told Fox News in 2023.
In September 2023, shortly after the hostage deal that gifted Iran $6 billion, Gazelle Sharmahd granted an interview to the Emirati newspaper The National, accusing Biden of having “left [her father] behind to die” and calling the hostage deal “horrific.”
“I am happy for the freedom of every unjustly detained, but my happiness is overshadowed by the immense amount of injustice and threat this negotiation has brought upon the … dozens of other hostages that were left behind,” she said at the time, noting that she had evidence Iran had tortured her father “year after year in solitary confinement.”
“Our government has failed to explain that when you release an unprecedented amount of money for a few hostages, what do you plan to do now to free the ones you abandon in this negotiation?” she asked. “Instead of wasting your time on national TV trying to convince us that our hostage takers will use the money for humanitarian reasons, explain to us how and when will you bring Jimmy Sharmahd back home to us?”",2024-10-30
Breitbart,"WATCH: Trump Gets Warm Welcome in Majority-Arab Dearborn, Michigan","Former President Donald Trump became the first major party presidential candidate to visit Dearborn, Michigan, on Friday, venturing into the majority-Arab and predominantly Muslim town, which had once been hostile territory.
Trump’s message there was simple: he is asking for the people’s vote, and he is promising peace in the Middle East.
The former president received a raucous welcome inside a restaurant, with fans shouting: “The best president ever!”
Journalists, following Trump, shouted questions. “What about the Muslim ban?” one yelled, referring to Trump’s travel ban on terror-prone states (which was never a Muslim ban, an idea he proposed on the campaign trail in 2015 but then discarded.) “There was never a Muslim ban,” a Trump supporter shouted, as he ignored the question.
“You’re gonna have peace in the Middle East — not with the clowns that are running the U.S. right now,” Trump said. He also said that he was determined to bring about an end to the ongoing war in Lebanon, reiterating a promise he made earlier this week. (Israel has reportedly begun talking about a ceasefire, after major battlefield successes.)
Trump senses an opportunity with Arab and Muslim voters, who first soured on President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris due to frustration over the war in Gaza, then began — however improbably – to consider the staunchly pro-Israel Trump as an alternative, believing that even if he backed Israel, he could put a stop to the war.
(Harris courted the mayor of Dearborn, whose views are radical and even antisemitic; he ended up endorsing no one.)
Many Arab and Muslim voters also support Republican positions on social issues and on the economy as well.
Michigan is a key battleground state, and a few votes in either direction could affect the outcome on November 5th.

Breitbart,Christine Todd Whitman: I Want to Smack Trump 'Across The Face',"Former Governor Christine Todd Whitman (R-NJ) said Thursday on CNN’s “New Central” that she wants to “smack” former President Donald Trump across the face.
Whitman said, “Well, frankly, that comment of his, ‘whether they like it or not,’ is just infuriating! And I think there are a lot of women who are still somewhat hesitant. Those women who are on the fence to whom that will be extremely offensive, and it will sway the vote.”
She added, “And I don’t know why we’re still talking about the trash thing of the fact that Joe Biden mentioned that when Donald Trump has been denigrating people, men, women, minorities. They’re calling them trash, calling them vermin, you know, poisoning our blood. We have to stop talking about the things he’s talking about and say, look at the things that he’s done and how his language is affecting the way we look at this election, the undermining of the public’s confidence in the electoral system. It’s all part of this package. And I do agree that his base loves this, but there are still amazing to me number of people who haven’t quite made up their mind. And it’s comments like he’s going to take care of women whether they like it or not. That just makes you clench your fists. It makes me clench my fist. I want to smack him across the face. He’s not taking care of me or my body.”

Breitbart,PA GOP Senate Candidate McCormick: Biden Should Apologize to Trump Voters for Garbage Comment,"Pennsylvania Senate GOP nominee Dave McCormick during Wednesday’s broadcast of Fox News Channel’s “Fox & Friends” called on President Joe Biden to apologize for saying the supporters of former President Donald Trump were “garbage.”
Co-host Lawrence Jones said, “We just got to get your reaction to the latest comments. The president was supposed to be watching Kamala Harris’s speech yesterday. That’s what he told us. Unfortunately, we learned that he was on a live stream in front of a laptop and he called Trump supporters garbage. What’s your response?”
McCormick said, “Yeah, listen, anytime you call half of Americans garbage because half the population supporting President Trump. I think this is the kind of divisive rhetoric that we need to get out of politics. I think it’s terribly polarizing. And so not only is President Biden, Kamala Harris and Bob Casey had policies that have hurt more than half of Americans with skyrocketing prices, the Fentanyl crisis. Now they’re actually showing disrespect for him. So I hope the president will apologize for that. And we need to get that kind of horrible rhetoric. I think it shows how they really feel about people that support President Trump.”

Breitbart,"Hollywood Elite Actor Jon Cryer: ‘Nice Try Douche Bags,’ Biden Misspoke When He Called Trump Voters ‘Garbage’","CBS’ Two and a Half Men star Jon Cryer is attempting to spin for the Kamala Harris campaign and help contain the fallout from President Joe Biden’s latest insult to Trump supporters, claiming that Biden misspoke when he called Trump supporters “garbage.”
Jon Cryer joined the Democrat clean-up crew following Biden’s disastrous comments, which the president made Tuesday in a virtual conversation with journalists.
“Biden misspoke, and quickly clarified his meaning,” Cryer wrote in an X post, later adding, “But nice try, douchebags.”
However, video from Biden’s virtual event shows the president unambiguously calling Trump supporters “garbage.”
“The only garbage I see floating out there is his [Trump’s] supporters,” he said.
As Breitbart News reported, Biden later attempted to spin his comment, claiming rather bizarrely in an X post that his comment wasn’t directed at Trump supporters but rather was in response to comedian Tony Hinchcliffe, who cracked a joke about Puerto Rico during Sunday’s Trump rally at Madison Square Garden.
Biden’s insult overshadowed Vice President Kamala Harris’s closing argument just one week before the election as she held a rally in Washington D.C. that was meant to remind voters of January 6 — a subject that ranks very low on the list of voters’ concerns.

Breitbart,"As Election Nears, Texas NGO Migrant Shelter Receives Highest Numbers Since May","SAN ANTONIO, Texas — As election day nears, a non-profit migrant shelter in San Antonio saw the number of housed migrants rise since May. As Texas border border cities begin to experience a rise in crossings, the San Antonio Migrant Resource Center has housed nearly 12,500 migrants since October 1, 2024.
The center is a cooperative endeavor between the City of San Antonio and several non-profit organizations, including Catholic Charities. Since opening in 2022, it has assisted nearly half a million migrants in finding transportation out of the city.
Breitbart Texas visited the facility on Wednesday and observed several buses from the border region dropping off migrants at the heavily secured facility. The city provides police officers to keep out unauthorized visitors and to keep the peace at the facility.
Migrants moved about outside the facility as commuters traveled on the busy roadways of Mission City. Migrants, including family units and single adults, stood on the street corners or walked from the shelter to local businesses wearing clothing provided by Customs and Border Protection contractors at migrant processing facilities along the border.
One family from Venezuela spoke to Breitbart Texas and said they had been treated well since being released by the Border Patrol in Eagle Pass earlier this month. Maria and Trinidad walked the streets with their children, ages nine and 12. Trinidad says he ultimately hopes to travel to New York but has no funds or family members to assist him in his travels. He says sometimes families wait longer for travel money from the shelter since it’s more expensive to fly out with an entire family than a single person.
“I think we are going to be leaving here soon. It’s been more than a week, and we are tired of being here, but we know we have to wait our turn,” he told Breitbart Texas in Spanish. Trinidad’s wife says she is anxious to get up to New York City and find work as a maid or in the restaurant industry.
“I’ll work anywhere, we have no relatives there and it’s important that we find work fast. Until then, we will just keep up our faith that something happens,” she added.
Venezuelans top the list of the ten most sheltered nationalities being served since the shelter opened in July 2022. Since then, more than 60,000 Venezuelan nationals have been sheltered at the facility. According to the City of San Antonio, Nicaraguans followed in second place, with more than 26,000 sheltered at the facility. Cubans, Hondurans, Haitians, and Colombians round out the top six nationalities, with a combined total of 78,393 being served at the facility since opening day. The shelter has served migrants from across the globe, including some considered by the FBI and DHS to be Special Interest Aliens.
The facility was slated to run out of federal funding in March 2024 but received a reprieve after President Joe Biden signed a $1.2 trillion funding package passed by Congress. The FEMA Shelter and Program (SSP) was provided $650 million to reimburse non-government migrant shelters like San Antonio’s Migrant Resource Center for costs related to services for non-citizens.
Nearly $17 million in FEMA SSP funding was allocated to the City of San Antonio and other local non-profit organizations to assist in operating the city’s Migrant Resource Center.
As reported by Breitbart Texas, migrant crossings, including large single groups, Special Interest Aliens, and unaccompanied migrant children, have been on the rise in recent weeks in Eagle Pass, Texas, more than 150 miles west of San Antonio. Migrants released in Eagle Pass by the Border Patrol after being processed for asylum travel to the San Antonio Migrant Resource Center, where air travel to other parts of the United States is coordinated.

Breitbart,"Russia Practices 'Massive Nuclear Strike' in Air, Sea, and Land Launches","“Important to have modern and constantly ready-to-use strategic forces” says Vladimir Putin as Russia rattles its sabre with tests meant to simulate a “massive nuclear strike”.
Russia says it has launched a large scale nuclear exercise, which they claim included flying a land-launched missile over 3,500 miles across the country as well as submarine launches and strategic bombers. The Kremlin has now published video footage of several tests that took place Tuesday, with senior figures making the purpose of the exercises.
Defence Minister Andrei Belousov said the purpose of the launches was practising “a massive nuclear strike by strategic offensive forces in response to a nuclear strike by the enemy”, a clear warning to the West that follows now-years of heightened nuclear talk as Moscow moves to dissuade the U.S. and allies from becoming further involved in its invasion of Ukraine.
Meanwhile Russian President Vladimir Putin said that although he didn’t want to see the country “involved in a new arms race”, nevertheless “we will maintain nuclear forces at the level of necessary sufficiency” and new launch systems and missiles were being developed. These would sharpen Russia’s response times by being faster to launch, and would have new capabilities to evade missile defence screens, it was asserted, even if nuclear weapons are an “extremely exceptional measure”.
Putin further remarked of the exercising of his Strategic Deterrent Forces: “Given the growing geopolitical tensions and the emergence of new external threats and risks, it is important to have modern and constantly ready-to-use strategic forces”.
The launches were concentrated around the extreme north-west, and the extreme east of Russia. In the case of a Yars ICBM launch test, Russian state media asserts it began at the the ‘Plesetsk state test cosmodrome’ near Archangesk on the White Sea, the missile flying across the north of the country some 3,500 miles to the ‘Kura test site in Kamchatka’, the Peninsula in far-eastern Russia on the Bering Sea and Sea of Okhotsk.
The seaborne missile tests Sineva and Bulava ballistic missiles were also, broadly speaking in the enormous geographic terms of the vast Russian federation, in these neighbourhoods. The test of one submarine-launch nuclear missile was from the Barents Sea, the Arctic-circle Atlantic fringe waters north of the White Sea from the nuclear submarine Novomoskovsk. The other was from Russia’s Pacific coast, launched by the Knyaz Oleg nuclear submarine from the Sea of Okhotsk.
Russia also published footage of a series of “Tu-95MS strategic missile carrier” strategic bombers taxiing and taking off.
At the same time, but not officially linked, South Korea has warned that North Korea — now a closer Russian ally as the two collaborate over the Ukraine War — was preparing for nuclear and missile tests of its own.
Moscow has drilled its nuclear forces in recent years, including in 2024, 2023, and 2022, but this week’s latest series of tests comes shortly after the country announced a change in its nuclear doctrine earlier this year. Under the new rules as articulated by President Putin, ” aggression against Russia by any non-nuclear state, but “with the participation or support” of a nuclear one, should be considered a joint attack”. Further, Russia said it could use nuclear weapons even against a non-nuclear threat, if such an attack against Russia or Belarus constituted a “critical threat to sovereignty”.
The West has also exercised its nuclear deterrent this year. NATO held its annual nuclear drills as normal earlier this month with Operation Steadfast Noon, involving eight military bases, 2,000 personnel and 60 aircraft from 13 nations and focussed on the North Sea.",2024-10-30
Breitbart,WaPo Show Implodes After Hewitt Abruptly Quits During 'Unfair' Segment,"Hugh Hewitt, an establishment media conservative commentator, abruptly departed a live episode Thursday of Washington Post Live’s First Look after its host berated him for recapping election integrity initiatives that were held up in court.
A recent Gallup poll found Americans’ trust in the media to report current events “fully, accurately and fairly” has plummeted to a record low. Only 31 percent of Americans have a “great deal” or “fair amount” of confidence in the media to tell the truth, one point below its low watermark of 32 percent in 2016 and 2023.
“I just gotta say we’re news people, even though we’re at the opinion section, it’s got to be reported,” Hewitt said, rebutting claims that former President Donald Trump’s election integrity efforts were meant to incite protests.
Hewitt’s comments, which included relevant facts about election integrity court cases won by Republicans, did not sit well with Capehart. The host took offense at “being lectured” to by Hewitt about journalism.
Hewitt then took out his earpiece and left show: “I won’t come back, Jonathan. I’m done. I’m done. This is the most unfair election ad I’ve ever been a part of. You guys are working. That’s fine. I’m done.”
Capehart tried to get the show back on track by asking Ruth Marcus, an associate Post editor and columnist, a follow-up question. But her video feed vanished and Capehart was left hanging, forcing him to end his show:

Breitbart,RNC Chair: We Are 'Cautiously Optimistic' Election Results Will Be Fair,"Republican National Committee (RNC) Chair Michael Whatley is “cautiously optimistic” that election results will be fair come Election Day, he said during a press call on Wednesday discussing the RNC’s election integrity efforts this election cycle.
Whatley walked through some of the recent victories, noting the RNC supported Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s (R-VA) case with an amicus brief, “because the American elections should be decided by Americans,” touting that recent decision — the Supreme Court issuing the stay by a 6-3 vote — upholding Youngkin’s executive order and keeping noncitizens off the voter rolls in his state.
WATCH — Vote, Vote, Vote! Massive Lines Seen for Early Voting in Tulsa, Oklahoma:
Michael Moyzes / TMX“This is a major victory for election integrity. This is exactly why our efforts are so important. While Democrats continue to push to have illegals on the rolls, and for States not to have to clean up their voter rolls, we are protecting the vote for all Americans today,” he said, also pointing to a recent victory in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.
“We have heard that we won this lawsuit, and Bucks County has extended pre-Election Day voting through November 1. This is a landmark victory that will allow our voters to cast those votes pursuant to Pennsylvania,” he said, making it clear the “RNC will leave no stone unturned in ensuring a fair, accurate and secure and transparent election, not just for Republican voters, but for all voters.”
During the Q&A portion of the call, a reporter asked if the RNC is concerned that the election results will be fair come Election Day.
“Well, what I would say at this point in time, we feel that we have an infrastructure in place to work with local officials and monitor the elections as they’re moving forward,” Whatley said, pointing to “significant improvements in election law made in a number of states all across the country.”
“So we are cautiously optimistic that we’re going to we’re going to feel very comfortable with it. As I said, you know, we want to see fair, accurate, secure and transparent elections, and we’re, we’re very hopeful that that’s what’s going to happen on November 5,” he added.
WATCH — Stacey Abrams: Record “Turnout Does Not Mean There Is Not Voter Suppression”:
RNC Co-Chair Lara Trump said these concerns are exactly why they designed the extensive election integrity program.
“We are incredibly confident in the team we put together. And as you’ve seen, when we identify an issue, we are dealing with it in the moment. We are not waiting. There’s no days, weeks or months later that we want to wait on anything. And I think that’s why we felt so good so far about what we’ve been able to do now,” she continued.
“We’re going to take every day as it comes, and every day may be different, but we are very hopeful that on November 5, we have a result of this election, and we feel very confident again in the team we put in place and the program we established,” she added.
This comes as roughly one-quarter have low confidence that the election will be conducted fairly, per a recent survey from the Economist/YouGov.
Among Republicans specifically, 36 percent said they have a “moderate” amount of confidence the election will be fair, while 23 percent have “only a little” confidence and 11 percent have “none at all.” Another 15 percent said they have “quite a bit” of confidence, but only 12 percent have “a great deal’ of confidence it will be fair.",2024-11-01
Breitbart,"Chicago Trucking Exec: Truckers Are 'Concerned' About Regulations Under Harris, Most Support Trump","Small business owners in the trucking industry are “concerned about Kamala Harris’ impact” regarding increased regulations and costs, a major Chicago-based trucking company executive said.
Mike Kucharski, co-owner and vice president of JKC Trucking, the city’s biggest specialty contract carrier, told Fox News on Thursday there are five main reasons why truckers are supporting former President Donald Trump over the vice president.
“Costs, increased regulatory burdens, infrastructure, driving range of the trucks and less cargo capacity due to the battery” are the top issues of many truckers Kucharski has employed and communicated with, the outlet reported.
While the business owner said he does not typically vote along party lines, he holds the opinion that Harris’s impact would be bad for business.
“I personally don’t vote along party lines, but I support candidates with policies. And I would say policies are the gateway to truckers’ vote — policies that help small business thrive,” he told the publication. “Right now, a lot of small business owners in the trucking industry are seriously concerned about Kamala Harris’ impact on our industry if she takes office.”
“Truckers are already struggling to stay afloat due to issues like skyrocketing diesel costs. It’s pouring too much for diesel. Truckers are driving less miles, paying more for fuel,” Kucharski said of the industry’s top concern.
“Another blow to truckers is this increased regulatory burdens. Truckers are overregulated,” he added.
While the Harris campaign denied supporting electric vehicle (EV) mandates in a statement to Fox News, the Biden-Harris administration used the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to rule that up to two-thirds of all new car sales to be electric by 2032 back in March, Breitbart News reported.
According to a September analysis from the America First Policy Institute (AFPI), the administration’s EV requirements could “wipe out 123,000 auto manufacturing jobs.”
Kucharski noted that while truckers are overall supportive of electric trucks, the industry is not ready to be forced to comply with the stringent mandates put in place by Biden-Harris’s EPA.
“The small trucking companies simply can’t absorb these extreme costs. And people are saying the larger companies could do it. But I think they’re going to have an issue. It’s a great idea, but I don’t think it’s going to work,” Kucharski said of the rule.
“Trump has a little different perspective,” he continued. “Donald Trump, during COVID, brought truckers to the White House and thanked them for being essential workers.”
“Truckers really have hope that he’ll walk back on just some of these regulations, because we’re overregulating the trucking business,” Kucharski explained. “Truckers are very excited because when Trump was talking about the economic plan, he brought up tariffs. And Trump is saying that he wants to bring more businesses, more production back into the U.S., which would be awesome.”",2024-10-31
Breitbart,Democrat Ad Hits Republican Rep. Valadao -- for Voting to Impeach Trump,"An ad run by Democrats in California’s hotly contested 22nd congressional district knocks incumbent Republican Rep. David Valadao for voting to impeach President Donald Trump, hoping to suppress GOP turnout in the district.
The ad, the Wall Street Journal notes, is “sponsored by the Democratic group Voter Protection Project, which is funded by House Majority PAC, which is associated with the House Democratic leadership,” which pushed impeachment.
Rather than defending their impeachment, Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives are criticizing impeachment in a race that could be decided by a few votes, and which could determine control of the House.
Valadao voted against Trump’s first impeachment, but was one of ten Republicans who voted for the second. Many of those later retired or were defeated in primary races. Valadao is popular in his district, but could still face a reckoning — though voters may see through the Democrats’ ruse.
The incumbent Valadao was one of seven Republicans who lost their seats in California in the 2018 midterm elections, when Democrats pioneered the use of “ballot harvesting.” The practice, legal for the first time in the 2018 election, allows anyone to turn in unlimited numbers of other people’s ballots, no questions asked.
Valadao lost by fewer than 1,000 votes, likely due to ballot harvesting. Republicans then adopted the practice themselves, and Valadao won his seat back in 2020.
Valadao is facing former California State Assemblyman Rudy Salas.

Breitbart,Channel Migrant Who Made 'Death Threats' Against Nigel Farage Detained,"Brexit leader Nigel Farage castigated the French navy for escorting a boat of Channel migrants including one man who is said to have made death threats against the Parliamentarian to British shores.
A boat migrant who has turned himself into a minor social media celebrity has been detained after allegedly illegally crossing to the United Kingdom, and following a complaint by Reform UK party Member of Parliament Nigel Farage that the man had issued death threats against him. Distinguished by the Kalashnikov-type rifle tattooed on his face and known as ‘Mada Passa’, Mr Farage said he had been told by the Metropolitan Police that the individual had been “detained by Immigration Officers, he is currently in secure detention and will be investigated for immigration and criminal offences.”
Mr Farage reflected while he was glad the migrant had been detained, at the same time he felt “appalled that a migrant who threatened to kill me was escorted into British waters by the French Navy” and asked “Is this the kind of man we really want in Britain?”.
Social media footage posted by ‘Mada Passa’ purported to show the man crossing the English Channel in a smugglers’ dinghy escorted by a French government vessel. While this practice of France escorting migrants directly into British waters was once regarded as a conspiracy theory, Mr Farage obtained evidence in his early reportage of the Channel Migrant Crisis and it has since been accepted and been passed into common knowledge.
British newspaper The Daily Telegraph states the Metropolitan Police say they had received reports of “threats to kill towards an MP” on October 18th and that a man had been detained on Thursday “for immigration offences”. They said: “The Met takes the safety and security of MPs extremely seriously and we are committed to ensuring that they, their families and staff can go about their work and lives without feeling unsafe or intimidated.”
Farage has previously said ‘Mada Passa’ is believed to be an Afghan migrant who had previously lived in Sweden. Yet as more European countries start to crack down on economic migrants posing as refugees, many naturally turn their eyes to the United Kingdom, which in practice doesn’t really deport people at all and is an attractive prospect for arrivals.
Breitbart News reported in October when the aggressive posture and threats of ‘Mada Passa’ against Mr Farage first emerged. As was stated at the time:
…Pasa is shown seemingly making gun gestures with his hands while saying “pop, pop, pop” in reference to Mr Farage. The video was apparently made in reference to previous critiques made by Farage of his exploits.
“English man Nigel. Don’t talk shit about me. You not know me,” the Tik Toker said. “I come to England because I want to married with your sister!”
“Don’t talk about me more. Delete the video. It is not good my friend, you do not know me. I am going to come to England.”
…
Pasa frequently imitates using firearms in his Tik Tok videos, including one instance in which he pretends to shoot at three young women sitting across his lap.
However, his content has featured more than imitation, with another clip showing him in a tent with two hooded men, one of whom was holding what appeared to be an actual gun.
Commenting last week on the migrant Tik Toker, Farage said: “I want you to watch this film and think to yourself is this the kind of person we want to come and live in our country? Is this the kind of person you would like to live next to you?”",2024-11-01

FOX 13 reported the incident occurred near an area where “hundreds of people were celebrating Halloween at bars, clubs, and restaurants.” There was the sound of gunfire followed, minutes later, by more gunfire.
The 17-year-old was tackled by officers and apprehended.
WESH noted that Orlando Police Chief Eric Smith indicated the 17-year-old “has a previous arrest record” and that he was not at the Halloween celebration long before alleged opening fire.
Smith said, “He pretty much walked into downtown, walked into the street and did what he did.”
He is alleged to have used a handgun in the incident.
The six wounded individuals are all in stable condition.

Breitbart,Media Ripped for Spin of Biden's 'Garbage' Smear After Report of Cover- Up,"After the Associated Press reported that the White House altered the record of President Joe Biden smearing Trump supporters as “garbage,” critics ripped the media for trying to spin the edit as being taken out of context.
The cover-up was “a breach of protocol and spoilation of transcript integrity between the Stenography and Press Offices,” according to a stenographer supervisor’s email obtained by the Associated Press (AP).
“This would be called lying in a public document,” Clay Travis, founder of Outkick, reacted on X. House Conference chair Elise Stefanik (R-NY) along with others, said the edit violated the Presidential Records Act.
White House stenographers added an apostrophe to “supporters” and an em-dash to alter the meaning of Biden’s statement.
Politico’s White House bureau chief, Jonathan Lemire, immediately suggested the edit was correct. “The full Biden quote from the Zoom tonight, which is being taken out of context,” he posted on X.
A recent Gallup poll that found Americans’ trust in the media to report current events “fully, accurately and fairly” has plummeted to a record low. Only 31 percent of Americans have a “great deal” or “fair amount” of confidence in the media to tell the truth, one point below its low watermark of 32 percent in 2016 and 2023.
Fox News commentator Joe Concha suggested Lemire, who also works with MSNBC, will not get away with his spin:
The edit was also touted by various outlets, Breitbart News reported:
Outkick writer Ian Miller questioned if CNN’s Brian Stelter and Daniel Dale would try to cover up the AP report:
The change was made after the press office “conferred with the president,” according to an internal email from the head of the stenographers’ office that was obtained by The AP. The authenticity of the email was confirmed by two government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters.
…
According to the email, the press office had asked the stenographers to quickly produce a transcript of the call amid the firestorm. Biden himself took to social media to say that he he was not calling all Trump supporters garbage and that he was referring specifically to the “hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally.”
…
The supervisor, a career employee of the White House, raised the concerns about the press office action — but did not weigh in on the accuracy of the edit — in an email to White House communications director Ben LaBolt, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and other press and communications officials.

Co-host Emma Rechenberg said, “Sometimes you wonder, does it come down to those last-minute errors or gaffes on the campaign trail? Could it be this garbage comment that encourages, you know, some Republicans who are more hesitant to actually show up and vote for Donald Trump this time around? President Biden had released a statement on X clarifying his remarks again, he was saying that the garbage comment was in response to that one comment and not Trump supporters at large. Even the White House going on to defend what he meant by that. Let’s listen to how they describe what happened.”
Jean-Pierre said, “Just to clarify, he was not calling Trump supporters garbage, which is why he put out. This is why he wanted to make sure that we put out a statement that clarified what he meant and what he was trying to say. So I just want to make that very clear for folks who are watching.”
Rechenberg said, “Like I said, he was calling out that specific insult comic that appeared at the Madison Square Garden rally. Do you think that that explains it away?”
Johnson said, “No, his spokeswoman is lying. It’s obvious Joe Biden thinks half of Americans that support Donald Trump are garbage. He thinks we’re potential domestic terrorists. Hillary Clinton thinks we’re deplorables. President Obama thinks we get bitter and we cling to our guns and religion and remember again that transformation of America. You don’t you don’t transform something that you love and that you like. So, no, the Democrat leadership, they don’t like this country.”

Breitbart,"Harris Co-Chair: Pro-Lifers Don't Get if Mom Dies, 'the Fetus Has No Way to Live', Lose 'What Could Have Been a Child'","On Friday’s broadcast of MSNBC’s “All In,” Harris-Walz Campaign Co-Chair Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) stated that the supporters of Texas’ abortion laws fail to understand that “if the mother is dead, the fetus has no way to live.” And so you lose both the mother “as well as, potentially, what could have been a child. It doesn’t make any sense.”
While discussing the death of a pregnant woman in Texas that she blamed on the state’s abortion law, Crockett said, “[T]he reality that these dumb lawmakers that were my colleagues in the state House, because this did pass when I was in the state House, it’s like, no, no, no, you’ve got to worry about the fetus. Well, let me tell you something, if the mother is dead, the fetus has no way to live. Like, it doesn’t make any sense, and I don’t know what it’s going to take for people to wake up in this country and recognize that the people that claim that they are pro-life are anything but pro-life, because you lost this young, 18-year-old girl, as well as, potentially, what could have been a child. It doesn’t make any sense.”

Breitbart,Exclusive -- NM Republican Candidate Nella Domenici: New Mexico's Border Is Wide Open,"New Mexico’s border is wide open, Republican candidate for the United States Senate for the state Nella Domenici said during an appearance on Breitbart News Daily, walking through the dire state of affairs as Republicans hope to flip the state red.
The border issues are “huge” in the state, Domenici explained, noting that New Mexico has “the highest crime rate of any state in the country.”
“We’re the most dangerous state. Albuquerque is a top ten most dangerous city. We also have the worst education in the country, so we have the highest usage of drugs in the country. So all of these failures make — the cost of living is really impactful in New Mexico, because the average family income is low,” she said, explaining that all of these things are making residents “angry.”
Further, Domenici explained that Albuquerque is “basically run by three dominating cartels.”
“And, you know, they’re like a distribution business there. And it’s a travesty. You know, they distribute fentanyl. Fentanyl is everywhere in New Mexico. We have a huge death rate of fentanyl. But they also, sadly, have many, many children and young, unattended minors that are coming into our state. There’s lots of sex abuse, labor abuse — it’s horrific. Homicides are very, very high, carjackings, you name it. That crime is there in Albuquerque, flourishing,” she said, fleshing out the problem and noting that, in addition to the Mexican cartels, “there’s been about 65,000 Chinese people that have come through our border in the last two years.
“I think 35,000 just this year. And in New Mexico, for example, they run huge, huge marijuana plants, and they are taking over that entire industry. But the cartels in New Mexico — and I’m sure around the country — are powerful. They’re well well-organized, and they’re machines, and it’s going to take a lot of effort to get rid of them now, and we have, we have to thank these radical progressives for inserting that terror into our lives,” she said, explaining that her state has the “third biggest border accessing Mexico.”
Despite that, she said half the border has no wall. “It has nothing. It’s just wide open. And [Democrat Sen.] Martin Heinrich and the other leaders haven’t fought. Martin hasn’t fought to get federal funding here, so our Border Patrol is weak. He doesn’t fight to make sure the FBI is here.
LISTEN:
“So, you know, we’re the widest open border now in the country, because Texas has barricaded themselves, their border,” she said, noting that the Lone Star State is not relying on the federal government. “They’ll do what’s right. Arizona is the same thing. These other border states have strong conservative leaders, and we have weak, radical progressives who want — they want these borders open,” she added, describing what she has seen.
“Literally, I’m going there today, but I was there just like two months ago, and there’s this huge wall, and then it just completely stops, and there’s nothing,” the Senate hopeful said. “There’s no border control and there’s no wall. There’s no hidden technology. It’s just open.”

Breitbart,Jake Paul Endorses Trump: 'Don't Judge' People from Media's Portrayal,"YouTube personality and boxer Jake Paul endorsed former President Donald Trump, encouraging voters to not “judge people” based on the mainstream media’s portrayal.
In a video posted to X, Paul noted the United States is dealing with issues relating to “wars, health, guns, jobs, economy,” inflation, and border control.
Paul pointed out that the Democratic Party had been “in power for 12 of the last 16 years,” and that if people are unhappy with the current state of things, the Democrats are to blame.
“Do I think Donald Trump is a perfect human being? No,” Paul said:
I don’t think anybody on this planet is a perfect human being, myself included. Don’t judge people off of a character that the media has portrayed them to be, because Democrats control 90 percent of the U.S. media, so they will paint a picture to y’all and that picture is what they want you to see. And, to be frank, I’m not concerned with Donald Trump’s character flaws, or what he’s done in the past. What I’m concerned with is how good of a president is he? Because that is his job and that is what’s going to affect the people of this nation.
Paul admitted that because he had “moved to Puerto Rico,” he “rescinded” his right to vote in elections, adding that it did not mean he was unable to present his followers with “proper facts, numbers, and data to encourage them to vote.”
“I don’t come to you to make this video to create more division, I believe love is the key to the universe, and that we should all love each other more and more and more,” Paul explained. “It saddens me that in the current political state of the world in America, people can’t have opinions without outrageous backlash. And, I truly believe we can all agree on, that things just don’t feel right. America doesn’t feel good.”
The boxer, who has previously stated that God “stepped in and saved” Trump from being assassinated at his July 13 rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, added that the nation was “more divided than ever.”
“I can’t sit back and watch this blasphemy unfold in front of me any longer,” Paul continued. “What is the problem? Democrats have been in power for 12 of the last 16 years, so if we aren’t happy with the current political state, economic state, environmental state, then who is to blame?”
Paul continued to speak about topics such as abortion and how Trump was being accused of not protecting women’s rights.
“That’s what the media has painted to you and it’s absolutely not true,” Paul added. “Donald Trump was the president before for four years. What rights as a woman were taken away from you? The answer is none. Donald Trump wants to put the power into the hands of each state to determine whether abortions will be legal there or not. So, if you live in a Democratic state like California, yes, Democrats will vote to allow abortion in California, putting the power in the hands of the people.”",2024-10-31
Breitbart,Never-Trumpers Debunk Liz Cheney Execution Hoax: 'So Deceptive',"Never-Trumpers and some in the establishment media condemned the Harris campaign’s suggestion that former President Donald Trump called for Liz Cheney to be executed.
The condemnation from Trump’s critics underscores the Harris campaign’s desperation to smear Trump before Tuesday’s election.
Rather than speaking about executing Cheney, Trump’s remarks citing Cheney as a war hawk were about the establishment’s willingness to send Americans to die in foreign wars.
“They’re all war hawks when they’re sitting in Washington in a nice building saying Oh gee, let’s send 10,000 troops into the mouths of the enemy,” Trump said. “Let’s put Liz Cheney with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her. Let’s see how she feels about it when the guns are trained on her face.”
Never-Trumpers and some in the establishment media condemned the hoax:
- Joe Walsh, former congressman: “Trump did NOT call for Liz Cheney to be executed. This is what’s so wrong with our politics today. … This short clip is so deceptive. Trump is NOT calling for Liz Cheney to be executed in front of a firing line. He’s not. Listen to the entirety of what he said. … [H]e’s trying to make a point about Cheney’s stance on war. But Aaron (who I like & respect), by posting ONLY this 11 second clip, makes it look like he’s calling for her to be executed. He’s not.”
- Zach Beauchamp,Vox Senior Correspondent: “Folks, Trump didn’t threaten to execute Liz Cheney. He actually was calling her a chickenhawk, something liberals said about her for ages. Look at the context — Trump is talking about giving her a weapon. Typically, people put in front of firing squads aren’t armed.”
- Kat Rosenfield, Free Press columnist : “…I also don’t support journalists lying to their audiences, and when he says (paraphrased) ‘these pro-war people wouldn’t be talking such a big game if they were on the front lines’ it is actually not the same thing as saying they should be shot”
The hoax was the second in two days. Vice President Kamala Harris accused Trump on Thursday of wanting to “control” women’s bodies “whether they like it or not.”
Trump’s full statement shows Trump said he would “protect” women from migrant crime and from foreign adversaries.
Trump’s statement was not in the context of abortion.
Harris suggested Trump’s remark was “very offensive to women in terms of not understanding their agency, their authorities, their right, their ability to make decisions about their own lives, including their own bodies.”
Trump said in Wisconsin:
I said, ‘well, I’m going to do it, whether the women like it or not.’ I’m going to protect them. I’m going to protect them from migrants coming in. I’m going to protect them from foreign countries that want to hit it, hit us with missiles and lots of other things.

Breitbart,Desperate Times: Hillary Clinton to Stump for Kamala Harris in Florida,"Twice-failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is heading to Florida just days before the election to encourage Floridians to back Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D).
An email from the Harris-Walz campaign previewed the event, as Harris is expected to join supporters Saturday morning to “encourage Floridians to vote for the Democratic nominees for president and vice president, as well as other Florida Democrats running for their respective offices,” as WTSP detailed.
Later that day, Clinton will appear at the Straz Center to talk about her book Something Lost, Something Gained: Reflections on Life, Love, & Liberty:
Clinton meeting with supporters in Florida is notable given that it is not viewed as a swing state in this particular election. Former President Donald Trump has a firm grip on the state, which boasts over one million more registered Republican voters than Democrats.
RELATED — Too Late! Kamala Accuses Trump of Dividing Americans Day After Biden Calls MAGA Voters “Garbage”
C-SPANTo make matters worse for Democrats, Republicans are leading the charge in early voting and mail-in voting combined in the Sunshine State, with traditionally blue counties such as Miami-Dade going red.
As Breitbart News reported this week:
Miami-Dade technically has a voter registration advantage over Republicans. Data from September 30 showed Democrats with roughly 44,000 more registered voters in the area. However, last week, Miami-Dade flipped red in early and mail-in voting combined, and that trend has continued following the Trump rally at Madison Square Garden.
The establishment media has ignored the bulk of the rally to focus on jokes that fell flat from comedian Tony Hinchcliffe about Latinos and Puerto Rico. Trump campaign senior adviser Danielle Alvarez even distanced former President Donald Trump and his campaign from the remarks, one of which referred to Puerto Rico as a “floating island of garbage.”
While the establishment media attempts to turn that into a racist trope directly from Trump, voters in south Florida clearly do not feel that way. Republicans are still ahead of Democrats in Miami-Dade in early voting and mail-in combined, and that figure has only grown since last week.
The latest results shortly after noon on Thursday showed Republicans leading Democrats in early voting and mail-in voting combined by 751,056 votes. In Miami-Dade, the difference is +33,459 for Republicans over Democrats.

Breitbart,Report Exposes Biden-Harris Alliance with UN to 'Fast-Track' Migrants into U.S.,"A bombshell report from the House Judiciary Committee, exclusively reviewed by Breitbart News, details President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris’s coordination with the United Nations (U.N.) to “fast-track” migrants into the United States, using American taxpayer dollars.
The report exposes how the Biden-Harris administration has worked alongside the U.N., funneling tens of millions of American taxpayer dollars to the international organization, to bring migrants to American communities.
Since Biden and Harris took office, nearly eight million migrants have entered the U.S.
In particular, the report accuses Biden and Harris of “teaming up with open-borders bureaucrats at the United Nations” to allow migrants to bypass the southern border when trying to get into the U.S.
“Under President Biden and Vice President Harris, in June 2023 the State Department announced its Safe Mobility Initiative, which allows aliens to sidestep the southwest border and, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), ‘avoid the risks associated with onward movement,'” the report states:
In other words, this new Biden-Harris program fast-tracks aliens into the United States out of sight of the American people and without the politically damaging optics at the border. The initiative’s Safe Mobility Offices (SMOs) allow aliens outside the United States to consult with foreign national employees from UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), who then provide the aliens with several options to resettle in the United States, including through family reunification parole, labor pathways, and additional expansions of the Biden-Harris Administration’s illegal abuses of humanitarian parole. The U.S. taxpayer-funded SMOs are located in 13 cities across Guatemala, Costa Rica, Colombia, and Ecuador. [Emphasis added]
Since 2023, the Committee on the Judiciary and its Subcommittee on Immigration Integrity, Security, and Enforcement have conducted rigorous oversight of the Biden-Harris border crisis, including the Administration’s abuses of immigration law. This oversight has uncovered the Biden-Harris Administration’s open-borders alliance with United Nations bureaucrats to ensure that additional aliens are fast-tracked into the United States on the U.S. taxpayers’ dime. [Emphasis added]
The report estimates that:
More than 18,000 aliens from Central and South America have departed for resettlement in the United States through the Safe Mobility Initiative, with nearly 67,000 total aliens referred to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program for potential resettlement in the U.S. and at least 7,000 aliens identified by IOM as potentially eligible to enter the U.S. through other means.
When migrants do not qualify for resettlement through the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, the U.N. counsels them on alternative routes to the U.S. Close to $70 million in American taxpayer dollars have funded Safe Mobility Offices while the IOM has spent nearly $15 million to fund the initiative.
“This interim staff report highlights how the Biden-Harris Administration has directed U.S. taxpayer money to the open-borders United Nations to allow foreign national bureaucrats to expedite more alien arrivals into the United States,” the report states.
The bombshell report is significant as Harris, while on the campaign trail, has sought to downplay her role in the Biden administration’s immigration policy that is centered on welcoming millions of migrants to American communities regardless of the impact on American citizens.
Small towns Lockland Village, Ohio; Logansport, Indiana; and Charleroi, Pennsylvania have been inundated with waves of migrants that have driven up home prices, rents, and exacerbated city budget shortfalls as a result of the Biden-Harris policy.
“We’re all wanting to get out of here, the Americans,” a resident of Lockland Village, who says one part of town is now known as “African Village” due to the migrant influx, told Fox News Digital’s Adam Shaw.

Breitbart,Video: Robert De Niro Calls Trump ‘A Piece of Sh*t’ at Harris Pennsylvania Rally,"Days before President Joe Biden called the tens of millions of Americans who support former President Donald Trump “garbage,” Hollywood actor Robert De Niro called Trump “a piece of shit” while speaking at a rally in Pennsylvania for Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign.
“It makes me so fucking angry that we’re here talking about a piece of shit like Donald Trump,” De Niro said, eliciting cheers from the audience.
Watch Below:
As Breitbart News reported, De Niro joined fellow actor Leonardo Di Caprio, along with several other celebrity elites, in an attempt to boost Harris in the crucial battleground state of Pennsylvania on Saturday.
Notably, the Raging Bull star’s “piece of shit” remark came just before President Joe Biden attacked millions of Americans by calling Trump supporters “garbage.”
“Donald Trump has no character. He doesn’t give a damn about the Latino community — just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage?” Biden said, adding, “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.”
Actor James Woods shared the clip of Biden trashing millions of Americans to social media, telling the public, “Let’s send this worthless fool back to his basement, send his cackling border czar back to San Francisco, and reclaim America from these vermin.”
Watch Below:
The president was referring to statements made by roast comedian Tony Hinchcliffe during Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden in which he referred to the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico as a floating island of garbage during a stand-up bit.
Biden, who is not a roast comedian, faced heavy backlash from both Democrats and Republicans for his remarks. The soon-to-be former president then issued a follow-up statement to social media in an attempt to spin the narrative as just being about Hinchcliffe.
“Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage — which is the only word I can think of to describe it,” Biden said. “His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation.”
“Does anyone actually believe Joe Biden wrote this at 11 o’clock last night? Does it even remotely sound like him? We heard him he was very clear… Surprisingly clear for Joe Biden,” Donald Trump Jr. reacted.
“The hate of the Harris Biden administration is shining through & no intern is going to cover it up!” he added.

Breitbart,Canada’s Liberals Call for Secret Ballot to Oust Prime Minister Trudeau,"Members of the Liberal Party of Canada are calling for a secret ballot to determine if Prime Minister Justin Trudeau should step down as the leader of the party, Canadian media reported on Monday.
“I’m very much in favor of a secret ballot. I think it’s time that we clear the air,” Liberal MP Helena Jaczek told CTV News on Monday.
Jaczek said she had “no idea” if Trudeau would reconsider his determination to remain as party leader and prime minister candidate against the Conservative Party, which is currently about 20 points ahead in the polls.
“I would hope that he is considering what he heard from his caucus, from a number of people in his caucus, I think that is significant. Our duty is to report to the prime minister what is going on in our constituencies, and a number of people shared that information,” she said.
Jaczek was referring to a feisty caucus meeting last Wednesday in which Liberal back-benchers lashed out at the increasingly unpopular Trudeau and asked him to step aside.
The unhappy Liberals wrote Trudeau a letter, setting Monday as the deadline to make his decision, but he did not even wait that long, insisting shortly after the caucus meeting that he would remain as party leader.
“I do think that a secret ballot where everyone agrees to accept the results of that vote would help ensure unity with the caucus, unity within our party,” Ontario MP Yvan Baker told CTV, seconding Jaczek’s sentiments.
“Frankly, a secret ballot is the best way for MPs to vote without being worried about consequences or attribution of any kind,” Baker added, pointing to one of the major reasons the rebels want a secret ballot. Some of them are convinced the number of Liberals who wish to oust Trudeau is much larger than the handful who have signed a petition to that effect, but they are afraid to speak out because Trudeau will retaliate against them.
Liberal MP Sean Casey, an outspoken Trudeau critic who signed the petition, seemed confident a secret ballot would draw far more anti-Trudeau votes than the petition has.
“He’s convinced he’s the right guy. I think he’s getting bad advice,” Casey said of the prime minister.
Some of Trudeau’s critics wistfully suggested he was only putting on a show by insisting he will stand for election again because the moment he agreed to resign he would become a crippled lame duck. Others sounded notes of weary resignation, suggesting they want a secret ballot so they can take some concrete action to clear their consciences, even if the ballot fails and Trudeau remains.
The vast majority of the Liberal caucus seems unwilling to force Trudeau out, and so does the majority of the Liberal electorate. CTV cited polls that said only 32 percent of Liberal voters think Trudeau should step aside, while 52 percent want him to remain.
Trudeau’s cabinet rallied in his defense on Tuesday and rejected the secret ballot idea, insisting it is time to “move on” from the notion of dumping the party leader.
“If you want to express yourself in the Liberal caucus, you stand up and talk. But the Prime Minister has been very clear: he’s the Leader. He’s going to take us into the next election,” said Employment Minister Randy Boissonnault.
Other cabinet ministers argued that continuing to talk pointlessly about jettisoning Trudeau would only weaken the Liberal Party in a tough race against the Conservatives and their leader, Pierre Poilievre.
“One thing that unites us all is we want to beat Poilievre and we have to remain focused on organizing and planning a campaign to do that,” said Tourism Minister Soraya Martinez Ferrada.
Not everyone in the caucus thinks they can beat Poilievre and a few of the most apprehensive Liberals are talking about bailing out.
“I’m a Liberal and I’m a proud Liberal, but there’s also a time when I’m going to have to look in the mirror and say, ‘OK, what do I do here? How do I sit in a caucus where I don’t really agree with who’s leading that caucus?’” New Brunswick MP Wayne Long told the Times-Colonist on Monday.
“That’s just something I think to myself, and I think maybe a lot of other MPs are just going to have to decide for themselves over the coming day or week,” Long said.
Long, and any other Liberals who feel as he does, might need to start packing their parachutes quickly. Next Tuesday brings a deadline set by the Bloc Quebecois party to receive certain legislative concessions from the Liberals. If they do not get what they want, the Bloc has threatened to throw in with the Conservatives to hold a no-confidence vote and bring the Trudeau administration down. Trudeau has survived a few recent confidence votes, but only with the help of the Bloc Quebecois.
“The Bloc has received absolutely nothing from Justin Trudeau. Trudeau offered them nothing. It’s time for the Bloc to work for Quebecers rather than working for Trudeau and vote for a carbon tax election,” Conservative leader Poilievre taunted at a press conference on Monday.",2024-10-29
Breitbart,Tabatabai Reassigned After Iran Concerns,"Ariane Tabatabai, an official who has drawn public scrutiny due to her apparent links to the Iranian regime, has reportedly been reassigned following months of inquiries and complaints by Republican members of Congress.
As Breitbart News reported in June:
Several lawmakers who previously demanded the Biden administration revoke the security clearance of a high-level State Department appointee and conduct an investigation into her troubling ties to the hardline anti-American Iranian regime refused to back down, resolving to continue to “ring the bell” and demand real answers and accountability, after the Biden administration rebutted and stonewalled their demands while refusing to provide a serious explanation.
…
In the letter, which is addressed to President Biden and provided in full to Breitbart News, the lawmakers expressed “serious concerns” over the Biden administration’s choosing to hire Ariane Tabatabai as a senior advisor to the Office of the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security.
“Tabatabai, in multiple public appearances, has echoed Iranian regime talking points and has made excuses for Iran’s oppressive government,” it continued. “She has downplayed the significance of dissatisfaction that Iranians have with their government, stating that protesting is a ‘feature in the Islamic Republic’ and is an ‘inherent part of Iranian public life.’”
The letter also blasts Tabatabai for having argued that “the U.S. must acknowledge Iran’s presence in Syria and accept Iran’s support of militants” as well as having claimed that Iran has “affirmed its place as a significant regional force.”
Describing Iran as “one of American’s greatest adversaries” that poses a “significant threat” to the region and U.S. allies there, the letter goes on to blast Iran for its radical ideology and policies.
…
After demonstrating Iran’s clear determination to obtain nuclear weapons for non-peaceful purposes, the letter notes Tabatabai’s father’s role as a senior faculty member at the state-controlled University of Tehran as well as his alleged role in President Hassan Rouhani’s “inner circle.”
In addition, the letter describes Tabatabai’s father’s public appearances with President Rouhani as well as being photographed with the grandson of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Islamic Republic’s founder and leader of the 1979 revolution.
The Biden-Harris administration had defended Tabatabai’s role and assured Congress that she had passed background checks.
In recent weeks, however, her name emerged in unconfirmed reports that the U.S. had been leaking information about Israel’s plans to attack Iran. It was never confirmed that there was a leak, nor that Tabatabai was the supposed leaker, but her documented support for the Iranian regime made her a target.
Ynet, an Israeli news website, reported Tuesday that the Biden-Harris administration chose to “move her to a position overseeing education and training within the Defense Secretary’s office.”
Ynet added:
Tabatabai served as the head of the Office of Special Operations and Low-Intensity Conflict, a role that gave her unique access to high-level classified intelligence and information on nearly all U.S. covert operations. Her new position, by contrast, provides significantly limited access to intelligence and classified operational plans.
…Tabatabai, an American of Iranian descent, previously held access to highly classified information. She formerly worked with Robert Malley, President Joe Biden’s ex-special envoy for Iran, who was dismissed about a year ago over improper connections with the Islamic Republic.
There are several people with radical past associations currently serving in key positions in the Biden-Harris administration. Maher Bitar, the director of intelligence for the National Security Council in the White House, was an activist in the radical Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP), which lately has been responsible for anti-Israel, antisemitic, and sometimes violent “encampments” on university campuses all across the United States.

Breitbart,"Dem Gov. Murphy: 'Not Wild About' Taxing Unrealized Capital Gains, But I'm 'Wild About' Democracy, Bipartisanship","On Wednesday’s broadcast of CNBC’s “Squawk Box,” New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy (D) said he’s “not wild about” taxing unrealized capital gains, but “I’m wild about a democracy that works. I’m wild about the rich history of our country continuing for the future. I’m wild about opponents having a voice and having a seat at the table, as opposed to being thrown in jail or hunted down by our military.”
While Murphy was talking about New Jersey’s tax policies in the broader context of tax policy fairness, co-host Joe Kernen cut in to ask, “Are you in favor of taxing unrealized gains?”
Murphy responded, “I’m not wild about that.”
Murphy added, “I’m not wild about unrealized gains. But I’m open-minded –.”
Kernen then cut in to ask, “What are you wild about? Not Trump?”
Murphy answered, “Here’s what I’m wild about: I’m wild about a democracy that works. I’m wild about the rich history of our country continuing for the future. I’m wild about opponents having a voice and having a seat at the table, as opposed to being thrown in jail or hunted down by our military. That’s what I’m wild about.”

Breitbart,'You Should be Ashamed': Fans Blast LeBron for 'Stitched Together' Endorsement of Kamala Harris,"In news that shocked no one, NBA superstar LeBron James posted an endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris’s bid for the presidency on social media Thursday night, claiming that for him, the “choice” in this year’s presidential race, is “clear.”
However, while James’ decision to endorse a radical liberal like Harris comes as no shock or surprise, how he did it has drawn sharp criticism, even from some of his allies.
On Thursday night, James posted a statement and video endorsing Harris.
“What are we even talking about here??” wrote James in the social media post. “When I think about my kids and my family and how they will grow up, the choice is clear to me. VOTE KAMALA HARRIS!!!”
As Breitbart Sports reported earlier, “The video features clips of Trump taken out of context and set against the backdrop of scenes from the civil rights era and more recent times of racial unrest, casting the former president as an enemy of voting rights, the civil rights movement in general, and black people in particular.”
In sum, the video is a propaganda piece seeking to show former President Trump as a purveyor of hatred.
While the animosity between Trump and James is no secret, even some of the NBA superstar’s supporters took exception to his use of a highly edited, out-of-context, and utterly dishonest propaganda video in his endorsement of Harris.
“From your biggest fan, clipping together a bunch of unrelated sound bites to these racially charged videos is sad propaganda and embarrassing work,” one commenter opined. “You should be ashamed. There is so much real content you could’ve posted to get your message across, you didn’t need to fabricate this narrative. I’m embarrassed my goat posted this.”
“King, these were all taken out of context,” said another.
“Those clips in the beginning are literally stitched together. If you cannot see that, you are blind,” another commenter said.
Others weighed in as well.
James has also endorsed former President Barack Obama in 2008, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016, and President Joe Biden in 2020. His endorsement of Harris was always assumed, though it’s unknown why he decided to use such an obvious propaganda video as part of his endorsement,

Breitbart,Big Tech Brainwashing: Wikipedia Works Overtime to Label Donald Trump a Fascist,"A detailed analysis of Wikipedia’s editing patterns has uncovered systematic changes to articles related to political content, revealing a focused effort to tie Donald Trump to fascism. The Wikipedia article on “Trumpism” contains 31 references to fascism, with more than half of the article’s content added by a single editor.
PirateWires reports that recent investigations into Wikipedia’s editing practices have revealed significant patterns in how political content is being shaped on the platform, particularly regarding articles related to former President Donald Trump. The analysis shows that several interconnected articles have been created and modified with a specific focus on associating Trump with fascism.
The investigation identified multiple Wikipedia articles, including “Trumpism,” “Donald Trump and Fascism,” “Fascism in North America,” and “Racial views of Donald Trump,” that demonstrate coordinated editing patterns. The “Trumpism” article alone contains 31 distinct references to fascism, with one particular editor, JJMesserly, contributing 50.5 percent of the article’s content.
A detailed examination of the sources used in these articles reveals a pattern of selective citation. For instance, a 2016 Scientific American article by professors Stephen Reicher and Alexander Haslam was used to support certain characterizations, despite the authors explicitly stating in their original work: “We are not comparing Trump, his supporters or their arguments to the Nazis in any way.” The authors had actually written their piece to critique media practices that demonize constituencies to advance political agendas.
The timing of article creation has also raised questions about coordination with external media. The “Donald Trump and Fascism” article was created on September 21, 2024, the same day the Guardian published a 4,000-word essay titled “Is Donald Trump a Fascist?” Two users, Di (they-them) and BootsED, are responsible for 91.2 percent of this article’s content.
Wikipedia’s coordinated effort to label Trump as a fascist is particularly important because of the great weight left-wing Google puts on Wikipedia entries. These entries are typically found at the very top of search results or featured in “Knowledge Panels.” Google has pumped millions of dollars into the Wikipedia smear machine, which in the past has paid off by labeling the California GOP as “Nazis,” a precursor to the current attack on Trump and his supporters.

Breitbart,613K Georgians Who Did Not Participate in 2020 Have Voted Early,"A massive number of Georgians who did not participate in the 2020 presidential election recently voted early as former President Donald Trump (R) and Vice President Kamala Harris (D) battle for the White House, an analysis shows.
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC) and GeorgiaVotes.com found that over half a million of the people living in the state who did not vote in 2020 have already cast their ballot, the outlet reported on Wednesday.
The article continued:
As of Wednesday morning, those 613,000 voters include new residents, Georgians who weren’t old enough to vote four years ago, as well as residents who have moved back after a time living in other states and voters who were registered for decades but just skipped 2020.
“We think of the electorate as being really static,” said Bernard Fraga, a political scientist at Emory University, referring to conversations about candidates winning back voters, “when the much bigger pool of people is not folks who are switching (parties), it’s folks who couldn’t have voted, didn’t vote or couldn’t have voted in previous years.”
In a social media post on Thursday, AJC political reporter Greg Bluestein pointed out, “The highest early voting turnout in Georgia isn’t in Democratic strongholds such as DeKalb County or the fiercely contested suburbs that surround metro Atlanta.”
“It’s in sparsely populated rural counties where Republicans dominate,” he added.
The AJC’s final survey before the election showed Trump was leading Harris with 47 percent of the vote while she had 43 percent support, Breitbart News reported on October 22.
“Technically, that four-point difference is outside of the survey’s +/- 3.1 percent margin of error,” the article noted, adding, “However, eight percent of voters in the Peach State, according to this survey, have indicated that they are undecided. If that’s true, that is more than enough to swing the race in either direction.”
Breitbart News reported on Friday that Americans had already cast 30 million votes in the first weeks since early voting began, the University of Florida’s Election Lab found.",2024-10-31
Breitbart,Report: Harris Campaign's Astroturf Machine Pushes Ethical Boundaries with Foreign Volunteers,"An ongoing investigation of the Harris campaign’s astroturf machine has exposed her team actively recruiting foreign volunteers, according to a report by the Federalist.
The Federalist reports that a recent investigation has uncovered troubling practices within the Kamala Harris presidential campaign, raising questions about the involvement of foreign nationals in the 2024 election. The probe, conducted by the popular Twitter account @reddit_lies, alleges that the Harris campaign is actively recruiting foreign volunteers and providing them with guidance on how to circumvent campaign finance laws.
The investigation centers around a Discord server where Harris campaign employees coordinate with a vast network of volunteers to inundate social media platforms with pro-Harris content. The server, which boasts over 35,000 members, is also allegedly used to manipulate online discussions by artificially boosting pro-Harris posts and downvoting content critical of the campaign. Previous installments of the investigation focused on the astroturf machine’s manipulation of Reddit and the “community notes” feature on Elon Musk’s X/Twitter.
The latest installment focuses on the apparent involvement of foreign nationals in the campaign’s efforts. The investigation found multiple instances of non-U.S. citizens expressing their eagerness to volunteer for the Harris campaign, with some even discussing plans to travel to the United States to engage in door-to-door canvassing.
While the Federal Election Commission (FEC) permits foreign nationals to volunteer for U.S. political campaigns on an uncompensated basis, the Harris campaign’s actions appear to push the boundaries of what is considered acceptable. Moderators on the Discord server, who wield significant power within the community, were seen openly encouraging foreign volunteers and providing them with information on how to exploit legal loopholes to make financial contributions to American political causes.
In one example, the campaign urged foreign volunteers to participate in a phone banking effort aimed at reaching 5 million Wisconsin voters on Kamala Harris’s birthday. When a foreign user expressed concerns about “meddling in US elections,” a moderator quickly dismissed their worries, assuring them that their involvement was legal and encouraging them to participate.
The revelations have sparked outrage among those who believe that American elections should be decided by Americans alone. While the Harris campaign’s actions may not directly violate election laws, they raise serious ethical questions about the extent to which foreign influences should be allowed to shape the outcome of U.S. elections.
The investigation’s findings are particularly ironic given the Democratic Party’s long-standing accusations of foreign interference in the 2016 election and their repeated warnings about the threat posed by foreign actors to American democracy. The fact that a prominent Democratic campaign is now actively courting foreign volunteers is sure to raise eyebrows among voters across the political spectrum.

Breitbart,"Colonies Owe UK a 'Debt of Gratitude', Says Tory Leadership Candidate","Conservative Party leadership hopeful Robert Jenrick rebuked the growing call for reparations to Caribbean countries and argued that former British colonies instead owe the United Kingdom a “debt of gratitude” for the enduring institutions leftover from the Empire.
While the governing Labour Party has fallen into kowtow mode in the face of demands from anti-British leftist radicals and Caribbean politicians to hand over reparations for historical colonialism, former immigration minister Robert Jenrick has called for a rejection of the “bizarre, unpatriotic belief that we should be embarrassed about our history.”
“It has seeped into our national debate through universities overrun by Leftists peddling pseudo-Marxist gibberish to impressionable undergraduates,” the Conservative MP wrote in the Daily Mail, adding: “Our island story is remarkable in many ways. One thing we have never been, however, is uniquely bad.”
The Tory leadership contender, who has tracked to the right while facing off with former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch to replace failed PM Rishi Sunak at the helm of the Conservative party, called for a more “balanced” approach to British history, in which the ills of the past are acknowledged while at the same time being “proud” the Empire’s achievements.
“I’m not ashamed of our history. It may not feel like it, but many of our former colonies – amid the complex realities of Empire – owe us a debt of gratitude for the inheritance we left them,” he declared.
Jenrick pointed to the various British political and judicial institutions which have remained largely intact in post-colonial nations to this day and noted that countries that the Empire previously ruled are in a far better position than ex-colonies of other European powers, such as France.
The Conservative leadership candidate’s article comes as members of the Labour Party are urging Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer to consider reparations for slavery and colonialism.
MP Bell Ribeiro-Addy, for example, argued that reparations are needed to confront “the deep-rooted inequalities that still shape our world today.”
While Starmer initially said that London would not consider financial payments to former colonies, the prime minister appeared to potentially walk this back by signing a Commonwealth communique calling for “discussions on reparatory justice with regards to the trans-Atlantic trade in enslaved Africans and chattel enslavement” to come to a “a common future based on equity”.
Conversely, Jenrick put forward that Britain has already made great sacrifices in atoning for historical wrongs, such as the great expense, in both blood and treasure, spent to eradicate the Transatlantic slave trade by the British, which the former immigration minister said “cost an estimated 1.8 per cent of our GDP between 1808 and 1867 – over twice what we spend on overseas aid today.”
“The British Empire broke the long chain of violent tyranny as we came to introduce – gradually and imperfectly – Christian values,” the MP wrote.
Jenrick also contended that Britain could have preserved much of its Empire had it chosen not to take on the scourge of Nazi Germany but, under the leadership of Sir Winston Churchill, “willingly gave up our imperial treasures” for the betterment of others.
“The result was a free Europe, and a lost Empire. Of that we can be proud,” he proclaimed.",2024-10-30
Breitbart,House of Horrors: U. of Michigan Hosts X-Rated 'Lesbian-Feminist' Halloween Event,"The University of Michigan unveiled an X-rated “lesbian-feminist haunted house” for Halloween meant to scare students with “political indoctrinators.”
For an entire semester, the university is hosting a so-called “Gender Euphoria” symposium featuring the lesbian and feminist-themed haunted house, as well as a drag performance by one of the school’s very own professors, according to a report by College Fix.
The symposium seeks to “make art and find queer joy” with a “state of emergency” through performances, exhibitions, conversations, and provocations. It is being hosted by University of Michigan’s Stamps School of Art and Design.
Saturday’s event will include something called “Killjoy’s Kastle Unplugged,” which is described as a “lesbian-feminist haunted house” meant to help participants “unpack, reject or critically recover” feminist history for the “queer present.”
Other performances, which have already been completed at the publicly-funded university, have involved attendees being guided by a “Demented Women’s Studies Professor” through haunted house rooms featuring “political indoctrinators” and “lesbian avengers.”
Some of the rooms are called “The Crypt of Dead Lesbian Organizations, Businesses, and Ideas,” “The Giant Bearded Clam and Her Familiar,” “The Terrifying Tunnel of Two Adult Women in Love,” and “The Intersectional Activist Wrestling with the Crumbling Pillars of Society.”
On the walls of one room signs can be seen reading, “Don’t slip on the pussy juice,” “Don’t trip over the severed penises,” and “Expect nudity.”
While waiting in line to enter the haunted house, performers also encourage guests to read anti-men books, one of which is titled, SCUM Manifesto: Society of Cutting Up Men.
Professor Larry La Fountain-Stokes will also perform at the symposium as a drag queen named “Lola von Miramar,” who will come “out of the closet to provide everyone with a very spooky time,” according to a report by Hyperallergic.
Moreover, the university’s art school is also offering a three-credit course called “Gender Euphoria.”
The course explores “how bodies labeled ‘different,’ not only in terms of gender and sexuality, but as in terms of size, ability, and race/ethnicity, are not only sites of trauma and alienation but of desire, dissent, creativity, and celebration,” according to its description on the university’s website.
“An overview of social construction/queer theory, and the history of artists/designers who have made work by, for, and with different/dissident bodies, will inform our creative work,” the course description adds.

Breitbart,Trump Praised by Arab Americans: 'Look to Trump Presidency with Hope',"Former President Donald Trump was praised by Arab-Americans in Dearborn, Michigan, on Friday, who revealed that they were looking to a “Trump presidency with hope.”
In a video posted to X by the Trump War Room, a restaurant owner in Dearborn criticized the Biden-Harris administration for failing “miserably in all aspects of humanity.”
“A wise man once said, peace is the prize, and I stand before him today,” the restaurant owner said. “As Arab-Americans, we unite against the betrayal of those in power. Our families back home suffer — their cries for help echoing across borders while the world remains silent. It is time to prioritize our nation’s best interests and foster lasting peace for all. This current administration has failed miserably in all aspects of humanity.”
The restaurant owner added that Arab Americans were “proud Americans enriching” the United States with their “hospitality, education, and hard work.”
“From doctors to humanitarians, and poets to politicians, we embody the spirit of resilience and progress,” the restaurant owner continued. “We look to a Trump presidency with hope, envisioning a time where peace flourishes, particularly in Lebanon and Palestine, maintaining the integrity of our borders.”
Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Joel Pollak reported that Trump’s visit to Dearborn represented the first time the presidential candidate of a major political party had visited the city:
Trump’s message there was simple: he is asking for the people’s vote, and he is promising peace in the Middle East.
In a video posted to X by Margo Martin, the Deputy Director of Communications for Trump, the former president was seen bonding with the Muslim American community in Dearborn.
In another video, during Trump’s visit to The Great Commoner cafe in Dearborn, someone could be heard yelling, “Dearborn is Trump country!”
Trump’s visit to Dearborn comes as his support among the Arab American and Muslim American communities has increased, especially as many voters in those communities have become increasingly unhappy with how the Biden-Harris administration has handled the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas.
Imam Husham Al-Husainy revealed during a Michigan Republican Party call that he was leaning “towards” Trump because he “found him closer to the Bible, and Torah, and the Quran.”
While Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud, the city’s first Muslim and Arab American mayor, has declined to endorse “any single candidate” in the presidential election, Hamtramck Mayor Ameer Ghalib has previously endorsed Trump, calling him the “right choice” during a “critical time.”
During a recent Trump rally in Novi, Michigan, several Muslim leaders in the state endorsed Trump, noting that he “promises peace, not war.”",2024-11-01
Breitbart,Kamala Harris Exploits Liz Cheney Execution Hoax to Smear Trump,"Vice President Kamala Harris harnessed a media-generated hoax about former President Donald Trump’s views on foreign war to smear him just days before Election Day.
Harris suggested that Trump called for guns to be pointed at Liz Cheney, but rather than speaking about executing Cheney, Trump’s remarks were about the establishment’s willingness to send Americans to die in foreign wars.
“All I’m saying about Liz Cheney is that she is a War Hawk, and a dumb one at that, but she wouldn’t have ‘the guts’ to fight herself,” Trump said Friday on Truth Social:
It’s easy for her to talk, sitting far from where the death scenes take place, but put a gun in her hand, and let her go fight, and she’ll say, “No thanks!” Her father decimated the Middle East, and other places, and got rich by doing so. He’s caused plenty of DEATH, and probably never even gave it a thought. That’s not what we want running our Country!
Harris, nevertheless, took the opportunity to tell the media that Trump “increased his violent rhetoric … about political opponents and in great detail suggested rifles should be trained on former Rep. Liz Cheney.”
“This must be disqualifying,” Harris claimed. “Rep. Cheney is a true patriot”:
Trump and fellow Republicans were not the only ones to condemn the hoax. NeverTrumpers and some in the establishment media also condemned the hoax:
- Joe Walsh, former congressman: “Trump did NOT call for Liz Cheney to be executed. This is what’s so wrong with our politics today. … This short clip is so deceptive. Trump is NOT calling for Liz Cheney to be executed in front of a firing line. He’s not. Listen to the entirety of what he said. … [H]e’s trying to make a point about Cheney’s stance on war. But Aaron (who I like & respect), by posting ONLY this 11 second clip, makes it look like he’s calling for her to be executed. He’s not.”
- Zach Beauchamp, Vox senior correspondent: “Folks, Trump didn’t threaten to execute Liz Cheney. He actually was calling her a chickenhawk, something liberals said about her for ages. Look at the context — Trump is talking about giving her a weapon. Typically, people put in front of firing squads aren’t armed.”
- Kat Rosenfield, Free Press columnist: “I also don’t support journalists lying to their audiences, and when he says (paraphrased) ‘these pro-war people wouldn’t be talking such a big game if they were on the front lines’ it is actually not the same thing as saying they should be shot.”

Breitbart,"D.C. Boarding Up Buildings, Preparing for Riots on Election Night","Boards are going up in Washington, DC, less than a week from the election, at it seems some businesses are anticipating riots on election night.
Andrew Leyden, a freelance photographer in DC, said he caught wind that some in DC were beginning the process of boarding up, so he decided to check it out himself. Indeed, he found that the back entrance of the Post Office near the White House has been covered with plywood boards, and workers are currently boarding up the front side of the office as well.
The McDonald’s next to the White House also has plywood going up over the building, as well as the building next to it. Video shows workers actively putting up the boards.
The move comes just days ahead of Tuesday’s election, as both sides hope for a victory. Recent polls — as well as early voting data — indicate that the momentum is with the Trump campaign, as he has the edge in most battleground states. Final polls coming out of these states bode well for him as well. For example, a Suffolk/USA Today survey released this week examining the race in Michigan showed Trump with the slightest edge over Harris in the key swing state.
Meanwhile, early voting data for Republicans is strong in places like North Carolina. As Breitbart News reported on Wednesday, both Republicans and independents were separately leading Democrats in the state in terms of ballots already cast.
RELATED — Chicago Business Boards Up in Anticipation of DNC Riots
The boarding up of businesses is reminiscent of the chaos that unfolded with the riots — and destroying of countless businesses — in 2020, and it follows President Joe Biden throwing another wrench in the Harris-Walz campaign after referring to former President Donald Trump’s supporters as “garbage.”
Trump seized the opportunity, riding in a garbage truck to his rally upon his arrival in Wisconsin.

Breitbart,"Kamala Camp Continues Cringey Male Outreach: Billy Eichner, Will Ferrell Direct White Men on the Street to Shout 'I Support Kamala!'","Far-left comedian Billy Eichner has revived his once popular “Billy on the Street” videos, with the help of actor Will Ferrell, in a cringey push to get people to vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, with less than a week to go before Election Day.
Re-branding his schtick as “Loud White Men for Kamala,” Eichner and comedian Will Ferrell are seen in the video running around the streets of New York City urging people to vote for Harris.
In the video, the pair badger people on the street to admit whether they would “have sex with a Trump voter,” asking them who they are voting for, and quizzing them on their favorite Will Ferrell film.
Eichner’s publicist told the media that the comedian aims to “do everything we possibly can to protect Americans from Donald Trump in these crucial final days of Early Voting and exactly one week before Election Day,” according to Deadline.
Ferrell had long since endorsed Harris, but was also recently in a controversial video urging newly naturalized American citizens to view America as flawed and to hate Republicans.
Eichner is also along-time, left-wing activist, and recently warned the party that it was “time to panic” as Donald Trump and Republicans have surged in polling show that the elephant party is coming close to winning the 2024 elections and have erased all the gains that Harris and the Democrats had made after she was anointed as the Democrat nominee.
“It is time to fucking panic, okay? And not just panic but to do something about it. Because like many people are saying today, the polls are not good,” Eichner said in a social media video. “Trump has the momentum.”

Breitbart,NYT Columnist Shredded on X for Omitting Key Details of Miscarriage Story,"A post by a New York Times columnist was thoroughly debunked by the Community Notes feature on X after he left out crucial details of a tragic Nevada miscarriage story seemingly to encourage people to vote for pro-abortion Vice President Kamala Harris.
Columnist Nicholas Kristof, who has 1.9 million followers on the platform, referred to recent reporting by The Washington Post and wrote on Oct. 29:
A struggling Nevada mom suffers a miscarriage. Then the police show up and arrest her for manslaughter, and she’s sentenced to 2.5-8 years in prison. Only when a pro bono lawyer steps up and appeals does a judge reverse the conviction and set her free to return to her children. This is family values? Think about that as you vote.
However, Community Notes was quick to fill in the gaps in Kristof’s post. The Community Note pointed out that the woman in the story, Patience Frazier, did drugs while pregnant, admitted to trying to cause her own miscarriage, and that her baby was well past viability. The note also points out that the miscarriage occurred in 2018, well before the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision overturned Roe v. Wade and returned to issue of abortion to individual states.
“She didn’t miscarry. She took drugs to try to have a home abortion and kill her baby. Her baby was around 30 weeks old when she delivered him,” Live Action Founder and President Lila Rose responded. “It’s unclear if the baby was born dead or alive. She hid the baby in a bag and buried her in the backyard. The baby deserves justice.”
“Possibly the most thoroughly devastating community note ever issued on this site,” Washington Free Beacon investigative reporter Chuck Ross commented.
“Writers like this fit in perfectly at the NYT,” the American Life League posted.
“You’re lying. She didn’t miscarry. She did an at home abortion on a 30-week baby and hid the baby’s body in a bag. Abortion intentionally kills a baby which is why it’s immoral and should be illegal,” CEO and President of 40 Days for Life Shawn Carney wrote.
The Washington Post article — which does not hide its bias or pro-abortion position — rehashes Frazier’s case, along with interviews, photos, and records to fill out the story. The Nevada Independent also reported on the case while it was ongoing, providing a more concise account.
According to the report, Frazier was 26 when she took a positive pregnancy test in February of 2018. She did not have regular periods and did not know how far along she was. Frazier had been abused by various people in her life since she was a child, had struggled with homelessness and drug use, and already had two children.
It should be noted that Nevada is a pro-abortion state. A state statute upheld through a referendum vote in 1990 allows abortion through 24 weeks of pregnancy. The law allows abortions throughout pregnancy when the life of the mother is in danger or for health reasons.
She decided she wanted to abort the baby, but the closest abortion clinic to Winnemucca, where she lived, was two hours away, according to the report. Her car was broken, and she could not find a ride.
So instead, “she looked to the internet for home remedies for an abortion,” the report states.
“She ate large amounts of cinnamon every day for the next month. She smoked marijuana daily. She lifted heavy objects,” the report continues.
Frazier allegedly had a stillbirth at her house on April 21 — officials were unable to prove whether the baby boy, named Abel, was born alive.
“She wrapped the remains in a black bandana and placed them in the arms of a monkey stuffed animal. She added a few more layers in a mesh bag before burying the bundle in the backyard,” according to the report.
A later autopsy revealed Abel was between 28 and 32 weeks. The medical examiner also found traces of marijuana and methamphetamine in his body, the report states.
After the birth, Frazier posted a photo of a wooden cross sticking out of the ground and wrote:
[On] April 21st at 2 am my life stopped. I was so scared and afraid. I didn’t know who to talk to. I didn’t know what to do I was so scared. I’m so sorry Abel. I’m sorry I’m a horrible person I don’t deserve to continue after what I did.
Forty days after the birth, Frazier was arrested. Frazier’s babysitter reported the cross on the property to authorities, along with the grieving Facebook post.
After the babysitter reported Frazier, detectives arrived at the house she was staying at with a search warrant. Narcotics investigators came too “because the house was known for drugs and as a stomping ground for felons,” the report states, citing court records.
Frazier was “afraid and confused” about why law enforcement was at her door, according to the report.
“Why is having a miscarriage a problem?” she asked, according to a court transcript of the conversation. “Why is this illegal apparently?”
Detectives told her at the time that they did not know how far along she was and that there are reporting requirements for late-term miscarriage. Then, they dug up Abel’s remains underneath the cross in the backyard and sent it to the Washoe County Crime Laboratory.
On May 30, Frazier told detectives while catching a ride with them to the sheriff’s office that she had tried to miscarry, according to the report. She also told them about how she had researched online how to self-manage an abortion and how she could not travel to an abortion clinic because her car was broken. She also told detectives she did not want to “bring another kid into this world,” according to the report.
After questioning, detectives arrested her for concealing a birth, a gross misdemeanor, and manslaughter, a felony.
The manslaughter charge was brought through a 1911 Nevada law which makes it a felony for a woman to terminate her pregnancy with “any drug, medicine or substance, or any instrument or other means,” after the 24th week of pregnancy.
Frazier ended up pleading guilty to manslaughter in May of 2019, per her counsel’s advice, so that the misdemeanor charge would be dropped, potentially lessening her sentence.
The judge instead sentenced her to between 30 and 96 months in prison, according to the report.
Frazier was released after two years in prison when Laura FitzSimmons, a Carson City-based lawyer, took up her case pro-bono. FitzSimmons took up the case after a Planned Parenthood employee told her about it, according to the report.
Ultimately, FitzSimmons argued in May of 2021 that Frazier’s public defender did not argue that Frazier would have had to know that Abel was past 24 weeks for her to violate the statute. FitzSimmons also argued that the state was never able to prove that Frazier’s actions explicitly caused the baby’s death, which the state did not dispute.
The judge ended up ruling in Frazier’s favor and called the case a “total miscarriage of justice.” Frazier was released in July of 2021 from a Las Vegas prison. FitzSimmons later asked the Nevada Supreme Court to declare the 1911 law unconstitutional, but the court declined to rule on the statute, the Post reported.
The case is not closed, meaning Frazier could be sent back to prison if a prosecutor decides to retry her, according to the report.
Frazier ended up moving with her children to a trailer home in South Dakota and had another baby a year after her release. When she found out she was pregnant again, “she’d wrestled for weeks with whether to have an abortion,” but ultimately decided not to go through with it, according to the report.
“Abel’s face just kept flashing through her mind,” the report reads.",2024-10-31
Breitbart,Nasty Kamala Glooms in Highly Negative Closing Speech Bashing Trump,"WASHINGTON, DC – Vice President Kamala Harris brought a dark and gloomy tone to her highly partisan closing argument speech on the Ellipse Tuesday night, which was delivered to an audience clearly culled from the Democrat base.
Harris’s remarks were in utter contrast to the “joy” she and Democrats attempted to manufacture at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago just two months ago.
She opened her speech with a vicious attack on Trump rather than a policy platform or a positive vision for the future if she wins. Harris baselessly and falsely said Trump would use the U.S. military against American citizens, and claimed he is “unstable.”
“This is not a candidate for president who is thinking about how to make your life better. This is someone who is unstable, obsessed with revenge, consumed with grievance, and out for unchecked power, ” Harris said.
“Donald Trump has spent a decade trying to keep the American people divided and afraid of each other. That is who he is,” she added in her extremely divisive speech.
She also referred to him as a “petty tyrant.”
The inflammatory rhetoric comes as Harris has taken to equating Trump, who was nearly assassinated twice since July, to a fascist in the home stretch of the race, as he dominates Democrats in early and mail-in-voting numbers compared to the margins from four years ago, in what turned out to be a razor-thin election.
Harris’s attacks come as Trump was highly critical of her rhetoric while he addressed reporters from Mar-a-Lago earlier Tuesday. Trump said that Harris is running a campaign of “absolute hate.”
“She’s running on a campaign of demoralization and really a campaign of destruction,” Trump said. “But really, perhaps more than anything else, it’s a campaign of hate, a campaign of absolute hate.”",2024-10-29
Breitbart,"Israeli Air, Ground Forces Continue the Fight in Gaza, Lebanon","Israeli air and ground forces continue to work together in both the Gaza Strip and southern Lebanon to eliminate terrorist targets. While airstrikes make headlines, much of the war’s progress depends on the ordinary soldier.
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) issued an update on Friday, noting that its combined air and ground forces were continuing the fight.
Regarding Gaza, it noted:
IDF operational activity continues throughout the Gaza Strip.
In the Jabaliya area, the troops eliminated dozens of terrorists from the air and ground and conducted targeted raids on military structures.
In central Gaza, the troops identified and eliminated several armed terrorists who were operating in the area.
In the Rafah area, the troops identified terrorists operating within a military structure that had an underground tunnel shaft. The IAF [Israeli Air Force] then struck and eliminated the terrorists.
Regarding Lebanon, the IDF said: “Over the past day, IDF troops continued their limited, localized, and targeted activity in southern Lebanon, eliminating terrorists, locating weapons, and dismantling terrorist infrastructure sites and launchers.”
In sum, the IDF said: “Over the past day, the IAF struck over 200 terror targets belonging to Hamas in the Gaza Strip and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, including command and control centers, launchers, and terrorist infrastructure sites.”
Many of the IDF personnel — in every branch of the service — are reservists, meaning that they have already completed their compulsory military service and are leaving jobs and families behind to fight for their country.
The number of IDF deaths so far has reached 778 as of Friday, November 1. The number of Israeli lives saved is in the millions.

Breitbart,Biden-Harris Administration Reiterates Push to Ban AR-15s,"The Biden-Harris administration used social media on Wednesday to renew the push to ban AR-15s and similar rifles.
The White House posted to X:
President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have consistently pushed a ban against America’s most popular rifle–the AR-15–throughout the tenure of their administration.
Moreover, Harris, as the Democrat presidential candidate, has continued to push the ban as part of her campaign. Her running mate, Democrat Tim Walz, also supports the gun control.
On August 8, 2024, Breitbart News reported that the ban was front and center during Harris and Walz’s first campaign event together.
At the event, Harris lauded Walz’s success in securing gun control as governor of Minnesota, adding, “And together, when we win in November, we are finally going to pass universal background checks, red flag laws, and an ‘assault weapons’ ban.”
The U.S.. had an “assault weapons” ban from 1994 to 2004, and the Department of Justice’s National Institute of Justice (NIJ) indicated the ban could not be credited with any reduction in crime.
The Washington Times quoted University of Pennsylvania professor Christopher Koper, author of the NIJ report, saying, “We cannot clearly credit the ban with any of the nation’s recent drop in gun violence. And, indeed, there has been no discernible reduction in the lethality and injuriousness of gun violence.”
The report continued, “The ban’s effects on gun violence are likely to be small at best and perhaps too small for reliable measurement.”
Yet Biden, Harris, and Walz are pushing to reinstate the ban under the guise of delivering safety.
On July 21, 2022, Breitbart News pointed to National Shooting Sports Foundation numbers showing there were more AR and AK-style rifles in circulation than Ford F-Series trucks on the road.

Breitbart,Donald Trump Answers Biden: 'You Can’t Lead America if You Don’t Love the American People',"“You can’t lead America if you don’t love the American People,” former President Donald Trump responded in the uproar after President Joe Biden described millions of Republican supporters as “garbage.”
Trump tweeted his response shortly after midnight:
While I am running a campaign of positive solutions to save America, Kamala Harris is running a campaign of hate. She has spent all week comparing her political opponents to the most evil mass murderers in history. Now, on top of everything, Joe Biden calls our supporters “garbage.”
You can’t lead America if you don’t love the American People. Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have shown they are both unfit to be President of the United States.
I am proud to lead the biggest, broadest, and most important political coalition in American history. We are welcoming historic numbers of Latinos, African Americans, Asian Americans, and citizens of every race, religion, color, and creed. It is my desire to be the President of all the people.
Biden’s “garbage” insult came as he and other Democrats were arguing that Trump’s alleged contempt for Latinos was revealed by a comedian at his rally in Madison Square Garden. The Associated Press reported Biden’s comments;
“Just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage. Well, let me tell you something, I don’t, I don’t know the Puerto Rican that I know, the Puerto Rico where I’m fr — in my home state of Delaware. They’re good, decent honorable people,” he said.
The president then added: “The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American. It’s totally contrary to everything we’ve done, everything we’ve been.”
Trump’s description of Harris’ campaign as “a campaign of hate” comes after Harris, Biden, and many other Democrats smeared Trump and GOP voters as unAmerican, racists, fascists and Nazis.
For example, on October 28, Barack Obama said the Trump rally included “the most racist, sexist, bigoted stereotypes.”
On October 23, CNN host Anderson Cooper asked Harris “Do you think Donald Trump is a fascist?”
“Yes, I do. Yes, I do,” she replied.
In the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton described Trump’s supporters as “irredeemables” and as a “basket of deplorables.”",2024-10-30
Breitbart,Kamala Harris Twists Meaning of Trump’s Rally Comments on Women,"Vice President Kamala Harris accused former President Donald Trump of wanting to “control” women’s bodies “whether they like it or not.”
Harris’s smear is seemingly designed to distract from President Joe Biden calling Trump supporters “garbage.” The smear dominated much of the news cycle since Tuesday.
WATCH — Kamala Yells at Protesters “I Am Speaking!” After Saying She’s Fighting for the Right to Be Heard:
C-SPANTrump’s full statement shows Trump said he would “protect” women from migrant crime and from foreign adversaries.
Trump’s statement was not in the context of abortion.
Harris suggested Trump’s remark was “very offensive to women in terms of not understanding their agency, their authorities, their right, their ability to make decisions about their own lives, including their own bodies.”
Trump said in Wisconsin:
I said, ‘well, I’m going to do it, whether the women like it or not.’ I’m going to protect them. I’m going to protect them from migrants coming in. I’m going to protect them from foreign countries that want to hit it, hit us with missiles and lots of other things.

Breitbart,British Band Mumford and Sons Shredded for Endorsing Kamala After Cancel Mob Forced Out Member Who Praised Book Exposing Antifa,"The British band Mumford and Sons is seeing its endorsement of Kamala Harris backfire on them after commenters noted the band was targeted by a left-wing cancel mob that forced out one of the band members, Winston Marshall, for the crime of praising a book that exposed Antifa.
Mumford and Sons performed Wednesday at a Kamala Harris rally in Madison, Wisconsin. At one point, lead vocalist Marcus Mumford spoke about his support for the Harris-Walz ticket.
“I know it might not sound like it, ’cause I grew up in England, but I was born in America. I was born in California. And, last week it was my great privilege to vote for Vice President Kamala Harris and Governor Tim Walz to be president and vice president of the United States of America,” he said.
“And I would encourage you to get with your mates, make a voting plan, and go out and vote, ‘cause every vote will matter.”
Not long after his comments hit social media, the backlash began, with commenters noting that Winston Marshall had to quit the band after a left-wing cancel mob labeled him a “fascist” for praising Andy Ngo’s book exposing the far-left radical Antifa movement.
As Breitbart News reported in 2021, Winston Marshall wrote in a Medium post Thursday that he was called a “fascist” and was inaccurately categorized as “far-right” for praising Ngo on his book Unmasked, which details the inner workings of Antifa, the violent left-wing activist group.
“To call me ‘fascist’ was ludicrous beyond belief,” he wrote.
“I’ve had plenty of abuse over the years. I’m a banjo player after all. But this was another level. And, owing to our association, my friends, my bandmates, were getting it too. It took me more than a moment to understand how distressing this was for them.”
Marshall said leaving the band will enable him to “speak my mind” without inflicting more pain on his bandmates.
Kamala Harris has publicly supported the Minnesota Freedom Fund (MFF), a left-wing fund that bails out criminal suspects. It has faced accusations that it bailed out Antifa members during the race riots of 2020.

Breitbart,"Seoul, Japan Warn North Korea Preparing Nuclear Test Site -- Possibly in Time for U.S. Election","The South Korean Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) reportedly told lawmakers on Wednesday that it had reason to believe communist North Korea has refurbished the Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site, unused since 2017, and could potentially detonate a nuclear weapon in time for the U.S. presidential election.
Separately, a Japanese government spokesman said on Wednesday that Tokyo is considering the possibility that the communist Kim regime conducts a nuclear test in the near future, citing “relevant data.”
North Korea has illegally tested its nuclear weapons seven times in its history, the majority of them during the tenure of former American President Barack Obama. The last test occurred in 2017, fueling rumors that the bombs had damaged Punggye-ri beyond repair. In 2018, North Korea staged the “dismantling” of the site with a small explosion outside of its entrance, charging journalists $10,000 to attend the event. Pyongyang also limited its belligerent rhetoric at the time in response to the successful policies of former President Donald Trump.
Dictator Kim Jong-un has increased his talk of violence since current President Joe Biden took power. In January 2023, Kim ordered an “exponential increase” in the number of nuclear weapons his officials should manufacture to prepare to potential active war with South Korea and America. He repeated that call in September and reportedly tested the readiness of nuclear-capable missiles last week.
According to South Korean lawmakers who attended a closed-door DIA briefing, Seoul believes that Kim successfully completed reparations of the Punggye-ri site.
“The officials suggested the North could launch an ICBM to verify its atmospheric reentry technology, at a timing targeting the US presidential election in November,” the Japanese news network NHK reported. “The officials also said preparations inside the Punggye-ri nuclear test site in the northeast of the country are almost complete.”
NHK added that officials “have not ruled out North Korea going ahead with its seventh nuclear test around the time of the US presidential election.”
The South Korean news agency Yonhap quoted lawmaker Reps. Lee Seong-kweun and Park Sun-won, who shared that the DIA said “preparations are nearly complete for an ICBM-class long-range missile, including a space launch vehicle.” They also shared the possibility of a nuclear test or intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test timed to coincide with the American election.
In Japan, government spokesman Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters that the government there also has reason to believe that North Korea “may undertake further provocative actions, such as launching various missiles, a satellite, or conducting a nuclear test.” The Japanese government offered less information than what was reported out of Seoul; the spokesman said the government was analyzing “relevant data” to lead to that conclusion.
During his public appearance last week to inspect nuclear weapons facilities, Kim suggested that North Korea needs to have its nuclear weapons ready to fire as a result of alleged threats from the United States.
“As I have stressed on several occasions recently, the U.S. strategic nuclear means pose an ever-increasing threat to the security environment of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea,” North Korean state media quoted Kim as saying, “and the prospective threats urgently demand that the DPRK [North Korea] bolster up its war deterrent definitely and take a thoroughgoing and strict counteraction posture of its nuclear forces, he said.”
Kim’s visit reportedly involved ensuring the “readiness for action of the strategic deterrent [nuclear weapons] directly related with the security of the country, including the functions and capabilities of the elements of launch-related facilities.”
The potential of a North Korean nuclear test also surfaces as reports indicate that Pyongyang is deploying thousands of troops to Russia to aid in the ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Kim signed a mutual defense agreement with Russian strongman Vladimir Putin in June whose terms remain unknown but many observers feared could require North Korea to aid the Russian war effort. South Korea’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) suggested this week that North Korea has already deployed at least 3,000 soldiers to Ukraine. South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Tuesday, offering intelligence assistance but not committing to direct military interference in the war.
“We must thoroughly assess all possibilities and prepare countermeasures. I urge everyone to engage in risk management with a heightened sense of vigilance,” Yoon said during a cabinet meeting on Tuesday.
Yoon, a conservative, has suggested that Seoul could potentially develop its own nuclear weapons program to protect itself from a North Korean attack.
“The Republic of Korea could deploy tactical nuclear weapons or possess its own nukes,” Yoon said in January 2023, shortly after Kim Jong-un vowed to “exponentially increase” the number of nuclear warheads at his disposal. The comment prompted panic in Washington, where Biden sent a U.S. nuclear submarine to South Korea’s port city of Busan to assure Yoon that he was committed to protecting Seoul.
Multiple polls in the past decade indicate that the idea of developing an independent nuclear arsenal is popular among South Koreans.
“When asked to choose between a domestic nuclear weapons program and the stationing of U.S. nuclear weapons in South Korea, similar to that of the past, the public overwhelmingly preferred an independent arsenal,” the Washington Post detailed in 2022, “underscoring the desire among South Koreans for greater autonomy over how and when nuclear weapons would be deployed on their behalf.”",2024-10-30
Breitbart,Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson Appoints 'Vile Jew Hater' to Head Chicago Schools,"Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson’s choice of Mitchell L. Ikenna Johnson to head the Chicago Public Schools is facing heavy criticism and spurring calls for the latter to resign after revelations that he engaged in a long series of antisemitic comments on social media.
After looking over his months of antisemitic posts, the Consulate General of Israel to the Midwest said it is “unfathomable” that he was been put in such an important position, and some have even called him a “vile Jew hater.”
Johnson has rebuffed the calls to resign, but he has apologized and pledged to protect all students, even Jewish students, as he takes over the school system.
Johnson told Chicago’s aldermen that he is “deeply sorry for not being more precise and deliberate in [his] comments” and admitted that some of his social media posts “could be construed as antisemitic,” WBEZ reported.
“Let me start by apologizing to the Jewish community for the remarks I posted, which were clearly reactive and insensitive,” Mitchell Johnson said. “Since that time, I have asked for and received feedback from my Jewish friends and colleagues who helped me be more thoughtful as I addressed these sensitive matters.”
Still, Johnson has engaged in a lot of hateful comments about Israel and Jews, not to mention coming to the support of Hamas, especially in the wake of the terror attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. But he has also engaged in antisemitic sentiment at least since 2018, according to WBEZ.
Since the October 7 attack, Johnson has shared dozens of posts praising Hamas and justifying the murder, kidnapping, and rapes of Israeli civilians.
In one post in December, for instance, Johnson asked, “How can a group of people who have suffered from the Holocaust; today join with the Alt Right Community?”
In other posts, Johnson compared Israel to Nazi Germany, according to JewishInsider.
“The Nazi Germans’ ideology has been adopted by the Zionist Jews,” Johnson wrote in February. “The Israeli government offers a renewal of Nazi language once directed toward European Jews, ‘savages, dogs, vermin,'” he wrote in March.
In another post, Johnson claimed that Hamas has “an absolute right to attack their oppressors by any means necessary!”
In other posts, he demanded that people “stop blaming Hamas,” said people “must move away from supporting Israel,” and called Jewish people he has known as “former friends.”
He also endorsed and echoed claims that Israel has been engaged in “genocide.”
“Let us go into 2024 with a commitment to change the narrative and force, yes force Israel to attone [sic] for its shameful attempt at genocide against the Palistinian [sic] people,” Johnson wrote.
Johnson also insisted that Jews in the U.S. must renounce Israel’s “crimes.” He even claimed that Zionists are “Luciferians.”
With the long list of antisemitic comments, many at city hall have worried about Johnson’s ability to protect Jewish students in the Chicago Public Schools.
Debra Silverstein, 50th Ward alderman, for one, said the social media screeds called “into question his ability to fairly represent Jewish students and families in Chicago Public Schools.”
Indeed, 26 aldermen joined together on a letter questioning Johnson’s suitability.
“We are deeply troubled by antisemitic and pro-Hamas comments made by Rev. Mitchell Ikenna Johnson,” the letter says. “This situation is a failure of leadership and judgment on the part of Mayor [Brandon] Johnson and his executive team,” the letter says.
“[Rev. Johnson’s] comments have crossed major red lines into overt antisemitism, both in his explicit support for Hamas and his insistence on collectively blaming all Jews for Israel’s military actions,” they said, calling for his resignation. “His continued role on the school board is non-negotiable.”
The American Jewish Committee Chicago and the Anti-Defamation League Midwest have also called on Johnson to resign.
The Consulate General wrote, “We find it appalling that Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson’s newly appointed president of the Chicago Board of Education, Rev. Mitchell Ikenna Johnson, has a history of making antisemitic statements, as reported by Jewish Insider.”
“It is unfathomable that a person such as Rev. Johnson has passed the vetting process. He is not fit for a public position, let alone a position with the responsibility to educate the next generation,” the organization added.
“This is the latest example of the antisemitic hate that pervades the inner circle of Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson. We expect that Mayor Brandon Johnson will disavow this inflammatory rhetoric and make a commitment to combatting antisemitism in Chicago, in both words and actions,” they wrote.
For his part, Mitchell Johnson has apologized but has refused to resign.
“The remarks I posted were reactive and insensitive, and I am deeply sorry for not being more precise and deliberate in my comments posted last year,” Johnson wrote in a statement, according to Chalkbeat. “Since then, I have asked for and received feedback from my Jewish friends and colleagues, who helped me be more thoughtful in the way I address these sensitive matters.” He added that he is “committed to making sure that antisemitism and hate of any kind have no place in Chicago Public Schools.”

Breitbart,Kamala Harris Surrogate Jennifer Lopez Ambushed with Diddy Questions While Signing Autographs,"Hollywood star Jennifer Lopez, who recently endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris during a wild anti-Trump rant, was ambushed by fans who asked about disgraced music mogul Sean “Diddy” Combs while signing autographs in Los Angeles, California, on Monday.
“JLo, do you have any comments about Diddy and the allegations?” a woman asked Lopez while she signed an autograph as she left a screening of her latest film, Unstoppable, according to a report by Fox News.
The “Love Don’t Cost A Thing” singer appeared to ignore the inquiry and moved along to an elevator with her security guards after the question was posed.
Notably, Lopez had dated Combs from 1999 until 2001, eventually parting ways due to the music mogul’s infidelity.
The public is now curious about the details surrounding Lopez’s past relationship with the Combs, who has been in jail since September 16 following a federal indictment accusing him of more than a decade of abusing, threatening, and coercing women and others, racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice, among other crimes.
Moreover, Combs was acquitted on charges of bribery and illegal weapons during his relationship with Lopez, who was also present during the incident that sparked the case.
Since September 16, Combs has been denied bail three times after a New York judge ruled that the “I’ll Be Missing You” singer must remain behind bars at the Metropolitan Detention Center while he awaits his upcoming sex trafficking trial, set for May 5.
The indictment included allegations that Combs had hosted what are known as “Freak Offs,” which involved days-long sexual activity with prostitutes and others who were given “a variety of controlled substances” by the music mogul in order to keep them “obedient and compliant.”
Combs allegedly arranged, directed, masturbated during, and electronically recorded “Freak Offs,” and would give victims “IV fluids to recover from the physical exertion and drug use,” and would use the recordings “as collateral to ensure the continued obedience and silence” of the victims.
The music mogul is also facing at least 120 separate lawsuits brought by Buzbee Law Firm and AVA Law Group on behalf alleged victims who are accusing Combs of a laundry list of crimes.
Last month, Buzbee’s lead counsel Tony Buzbee announced that the firms would be filing civil cases against Combs, his associates, and other entities, accusing the defendants of crimes spanning from 1991 to 2024. About a dozen of these lawsuits have already been filed.
“The names we’re going to name, assuming our investigators confirm and corroborate what we’ve been told, are names that will shock you,” Buzbee said.
On Friday, former Playboy model Rachel Kennedy told Daily Mail that Combs had made her watch one of Lopez’s music videos on a continuous loop during one of his now-infamous “Freak Offs.”

Breitbart,NC GOP Senators File Ethics Complaint Against Dem Supreme Court Justice,"Democrat North Carolina Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs is up for reelection and has made abortion central to her campaign.
In one web advertisement, Riggs — who is endorsed by pro-abortion groups EMILY’s List and Planned Parenthood — said: “As women, we should be in charge of our own reproductive health care, but our rights are at risk. [Lt. Gov] Mark Robinson says he wants to ban abortion with no exceptions, and my opponent could decide if his ban becomes law. I’ll fight for your rights, protecting families like mine and yours.”
In response, three Republican state senators, who are also attorneys, filed a complaint against her with North Carolina’s Judicial Standards Commission, The Carolina Journal reported this month. An October 14 letter written by Republican state Sens. Buck Newton, Amy Galey, and Danny Britt and circulated to other Republican senators discusses the complaint and accuses Riggs of “blatantly violating” the code.
“As attorneys who value the integrity of our judicial process, it has become clear that Justice Riggs is guided more by the politics of winning an election rather than honoring the Code of Judicial Conduct,” the senators wrote.
“The Code prohibits any judicial candidate, regardless of the office they seek, from taking a position on any issue that may appear before their court,” the letter continued.
“However, Justice Riggs is blatantly violating the Code,” the senators wrote. “She is currently running attack ads against Judge Jefferson Griffin, outlining her position on specific issues that may appear before the court while stating what she perceives to be her opponent’s position.”
The letter further outlines how Newton asked the state Judicial Standards Commission to conduct a “full investigation.” The letter urges lawmakers to “monitor any future actions she may take between now and election day.”
“If judicial candidates are allowed to run campaigns on legislating from the bench, then we legislators will need to take action in the upcoming session to prevent such a breach of judicial conduct from ever happening again.”
Soon after the complaint was filed, an ad for Riggs’ challenger Republican Court of Appeals Judge Jefferson Griffin was released accusing Riggs of being a “radical liberal” who is “under investigation by the Judicial Standards Commission for her false ads.”
Subsequently, Riggs made the letter about the complaint lodged against her public on X on October 21 and denied any wrongdoing.
As the Journal noted, Judicial Standards Commission proceeding are typically confidential “unless the commission recommends some form of penalty against the judge.”
“Over the past 22 months on the campaign trail, you’ve heard me speak boldly about my values–including transparency, integrity, reproductive freedom, and democracy. Last week, I learned that three Republican senators falsely accused me of violating the code of judicial conduct,” Riggs wrote:
Let me be clear: I will not be intimidated by these Republican attacks on judicial independence and free speech. All voters deserve to cast an informed vote, which means knowing about my values and seeing the receipts on my opponent’s record.”
This is a troubling moment for judicial independence in our state. Members of the legislature should never be able to weaponize the nonpartisan Judicial Standards Commission to assist a political ally in winning a judicial election.
But this moment reminds all of us about what’s at stake in this election–integrity, transparency, and the separation of powers. Over the next fifteen days—and beyond—I will continue to speak boldly and fearlessly to make sure that North Carolinians can hold judges accountable.
On October 29, Riggs and her lawyer, Pressly Millen, who is the husband of State Board of Elections member Siobhan Millen, sent a cease-and-desist letter to the North Carolina GOP over accusations that Riggs is under investigation for her conduct.
“You are hereby on notice that that statement is both false and defamatory,” the letter reads in part. “Ms. Riggs has inquired of the North Carolina Judicial Standards Commission as to the truth of that statement and learned that no formal investigation of Justice Riggs is ongoing, and that Justice Riggs will be issued a notification only “in the event that [the issue] becomes germane to Justice Riggs.”
The NCGOP responded with its own letter the same day, stating that Millen’s letter “demanding a retraction hinges on a strained distinction between a “formal investigation” and the fact that Justice Riggs’ conduct is, indeed, presently under scrutiny by the Judicial Standards Commission.”
“The North Carolina Republican Party simply informed the public that a review of Justice Riggs’ ethical compliance is currently underway—a statement that is factually accurate and beyond dispute. Pretending there is no ‘investigation’ because a specific procedural label hasn’t yet been applied is nothing more than a semantic smokescreen,” the letter reads:
Senator Newton and other legislators formally requested an investigation into what they, and many others, view as a blatant disregard for judicial ethics by Justice Riggs.
The distinction you draw is a desperate ploy to obscure the fact that Justice Riggs’ actions are currently under ethical review. Whether you call it a “review,” a “scrutiny,” an “investigation,” or some other term, the reality remains: Justice Riggs’ conduct is under the microscope.
We have every right to keep voters informed of Justice Riggs’ wanton behavior. We will not retract truthful statements simply because Justice Riggs finds transparency inconvenient. Nor will we be intimidated by hollow threats of legal action designed to shield questionable conduct from public view.
The North Carolina Republican Party will continue to uphold the public’s right to know about the behavior of those seeking our state’s highest judicial offices.
Democrat Gov. Roy Cooper put Riggs into her current position in September 2023 and in her previous position on the state appellate court in 2022, The Center Square reported. Before that, she worked for the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, tending to various left-wing causes.
“My opponent spent her career at the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, leading some of the most polarizing and political litigation in our state. I believe the role of a jurist is to interpret the law, not make the law,” Griffin told The Center Square.
Riggs has accused Riggs of “extremism” because he believes in interpreting the Constitution as it was written.
“He is someone who embraces a judicial philosophy called originalism,” she said at a Democratic “Taking Back the Courts” event. “These folks who embrace originalism do so in a really rigid, extreme way. They use this judicial philosophy to chip away at my rights and your rights.”
Republicans currently hold a 5-2 majority on the state Supreme Court. The balance of the court would remain the same if Riggs is reelected. If Griffin wins, Republicans will hold a 6-1 majority.",2024-11-01
Breitbart,Election Interference: Arizona's AG Probes Cheney Execution Hoax,"Arizona’s Democrat Attorney General, Kris Mayes, launched an investigation into a media-generated hoax about former President Donald Trump allegedly threatening Liz Cheney with death.
Critics immediately called the probe election interference. “Total abuse of office and election interference,” Senior Writer at RealClearInvestigations Mark Hemingway posted on X.
“The perfect illustration of the intersection of media disinfo, political opportunism, & abuse of investigative power, all in service of election influence,” said Jerry Dunleavy IV, ex-senior investigator for the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
https://twitter.com/MSNBC/status/1852425525999857819
The Harris campaign and its media allies claim Trump called for guns to be pointed at Liz Cheney, but rather than speaking about executing Cheney, Trump’s remarks in Glendale were about her willingness to send Americans to die in foreign wars.
“They’re all war hawks when they’re sitting in Washington in a nice building saying Oh gee, let’s send 10,000 troops into the mouths of the enemy,” Trump said. “Let’s put Liz Cheney with a rifle standing there with nine barrels shooting at her. Let’s see how she feels about it when the guns are trained on her face.”
Mayes told “Sunday Square Off” on Friday that she “already asked my criminal division chief to start looking at that statement, analyzing it for whether it qualifies as a death threat under Arizona’s laws.”
“I’m not prepared now to say whether it was or it wasn’t, but it is not helpful as we prepare for our election and as we try to make sure that we keep the peace at our polling places and in our state,” she added.
“All I’m saying about Liz Cheney is that she is a War Hawk, and a dumb one at that, but she wouldn’t have ‘the guts’ to fight herself,” Trump said Friday:
It’s easy for her to talk, sitting far from where the death scenes take place, but put a gun in her hand, and let her go fight, and she’ll say, “No thanks!” Her father decimated the Middle East, and other places, and got rich by doing so. He’s caused plenty of DEATH, and probably never even gave it a thought. That’s not what we want running our Country!
“This must be disqualifying,” Harris claimed. “Rep. Cheney is a true patriot.”

Breitbart,James Woods Rips Biden Calling Trump Voters 'Garbage': 'Send This Worthless Fool Back to His Basement',"Actor James Woods sounded off on Tuesday after President Joe Biden referred to Trump voters as “garbage” just as before Vice President Kamala Harris could deliver her closing argument.
Sharing a clip of the president’s comments on social media, Woods said, “So, here is the president calling any American voting for the Republican candidate ‘floating pieces of garbage.’ Let’s send this worthless fool back to his basement, send his cackling border czar back to San Francisco, and reclaim America from these vermin.”
President Joe Biden overshadowed Vice President Kamala Harris’s closing argument just one week before the election by trashing American voters and calling Trump supporters “garbage.” She delivered her closing argument in front of the White House on Tuesday night, but soon-to-be former President Joe Biden said the following in an interview just before her speech: “Donald Trump has no character. He doesn’t give a damn about the Latino community … just the other day, a speaker at his rally called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage? … The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.”
The president was referring to statements made by comedian Tony Hinchcliffe during former President Donald Trump’s rally at Madison Square Garden in which he referred to the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, home to American citizens, as a “floating island of garbage.”
After serious political blowback from both Democrats and Republicans, Biden sent out a social media post attempting to spin comments as just being about the comedian Trump’s campaign had on stage at Madison Square Garden on Sunday.
“Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage—which is the only word I can think of to describe it. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation,” the president said.
The president and the White House spin of his comments on Tuesday have not resonated, with even Democrats and CNN saying his statement was directed at Trump voters. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro (D) said that he disagrees with the president’s statement and that he does not hold his view.
“I’m giving you my fresh reaction to it. I would never insult the good people of Pennsylvania or any Americans even if they chose to support a candidate that I didn’t support,” said Shapiro.",2024-10-30
Breitbart,"50 Cent: Where's Jay-Z Amid Diddy Scandal, Beyonce's Kamala Endorsement","Music and television mogul 50 Cent is wondering why fellow mogul Jay-Z has been largely out of the public spotlight amid his longtime friend Diddy’s sex trafficking prosecution and his pop megastar wife, Beyoncé’s, primetime endorsement of Kamala Harris.
The election silence is certainly a question. In years past, Jay-Z was very open about his support for whatever Democrat was the latest to be touted by Hollywood and the entertainment industry. But this election cycle, he has been uncharacteristically muted.
Jay-Z’s wife, Beyoncé, has formally endorsed Harris, though she made many fans mad by not performing any of her hit songs during the recent Harris rally — not to mention the Democrat National Convention, where fans expected her to appear on stage to sing.
Even with his wife’s activism on the record, though, Jay-Z has been rather quiet on the 2024 election.
Another area the rapper has remained silent is on the mounting troubles for his friend Sean “Diddy” Combs, who is under investigation and prosecution for sexual assault and other improprieties.
Diddy was arrested in September after a grand jury indicted him on a series of charges including sex trafficking and racketeering. He quickly pleaded not guilty to the charges, but was denied bail and remains in jail awaiting trial.
But the silence on these issues has 50 Cent wondering, just where is Jay-Z?
“When’s Jay-Z coming to Summer Jam? No brunch, no lunch, no dinner… It’s hot out here, man, it’s hot out here. You know what I’m saying? Nowhere,” the rapper asked on Hot 97, according to Hot New Hip Hop.
There is certainly no love lost between 50 Cent and Jay-Z. Especially after 50 Cent said he found out that Jay-Z tried to keep him from performing at the 2022 Super Bowl Halftime show.
Still, Jay-Z was very public about his support for Joe Biden, Barack Obama, and Bill Clinton. Yet, this time he has been mysteriously quiet.
Perhaps it is because polls are showing that black men are not that excited about voting for Kamala Harris, and many are streaming to Donald Trump.
Perhaps Jay-Z has decided that discretion is the better part of valor this election cycle.

Breitbart,NYC Daycare Owner Pleads Guilty After Toddler Dies from Fentanyl,"A New York City woman has pleaded guilty to federal drug charges in the case of a toddler who died after ingesting fentanyl at her daycare in September 2023.
The child who died was identified as Nicholas Dominici, the Associated Press (AP) reported Tuesday:
An image shows the little boy who was yet another tragic result of the Biden-Harris administration’s open border policies:
The AP article said, “Grei Mendez entered the guilty plea in Manhattan to charges including conspiracy to distribute narcotics resulting in death.”
The woman’s husband, 35-year-old Felix Herrera Garcia, was recently sentenced to 45 years in prison for running a fentanyl mill out of the daycare, Breitbart News reported on October 17.
The outlet noted he was “caught in Mexico and brought back to the U.S. after he fled the country, the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York said in a Wednesday press release announcing his sentencing.”
The AP report detailed Mendez’s statements regarding the case and noted she faces a mandatory minimum of 20 years and the possibility of life in prison:
Mendez, 37, cried briefly as she explained that she agreed with her husband and another person to possess and distribute drugs, then in September 2023 helped the pair package and store the narcotics in the Bronx apartment where she ran Divino Niño day care.
…
Mendez said her husband encouraged her to open the day care center, and she believed he was doing it to help her. But she said as soon as the doors opened, she realized that it was actually a “perfect way to conceal his drug business.”
At the scene in the Bronx, law enforcement discovered a large amount of fentanyl and drug paraphernalia concealed in the children’s play area as they were executing a search warrant, while more fentanyl was found stored on play mats the children used. Three other children who were exposed to the drug were given Narcan and survived.
In state court, the woman was charged with murder, manslaughter, and assault but entered a not guilty plea.
About 34.3 tons of fentanyl that crossed into the United States through the southern border have been seized since President Joe Biden (D) and Vice President Kamala Harris (D) took office, Breitbart News reported October 25.
The outlet noted it was “enough to kill more than all the people on Earth.”
A Georgia father who lost his 30-year-old son to fentanyl said the “Biden-Harris Administration have done nothing” to take care of the problem, Breitbart News reported on Monday.",2024-11-01
Breitbart,"Louisiana: Illegal Accused of Raping, Molesting Young Boys, Including 4-Yr-Old","An illegal alien is accused of raping and molesting several young boys in Kenner, Louisiana — including a four-year-old preschooler.
Luis Renan Bonilla-Alfaro, a 17-year-old illegal alien from Honduras and a student at Bonnabel High School, has been arrested by the Kenner Police Department and charged with first-degree rape, two counts of sexual battery, two counts of child pornography involving children under 13 years old, and two counts of indecent behavior with minors.
Bonilla-Alfaro allegedly molested the young boys at the Airline Oaks Trailer Park.
Bonilla-Alfaro, police allege, admitted to molesting a four-year-old boy as well as a seven-year-old boy. After the admission, police said they reviewed evidence showing Bonilla-Alfaro had sexually assaulted an eight-year-old boy and another boy they believe is under 13 years old.
After police obtained a search warrant for Bonilla-Alfaro’s cellphone, they found photos and videos of the illegal alien sexually assaulting three young boys — two of whom were identified and another who has not yet been identified.
“I consider this person to be a serial sex offender, given by the actions by [sic] these three children, that he documented himself for whatever reason,” Kenner Police Chief Keith Conley said in a statement.
Bonilla-Alfaro, according to police, has more child victims. Police allege that Bonilla-Alfaro befriended the children with the intent of sexually assaulting them.
The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has taken custody of Bonilla-Alfaro.

Breitbart,Vance on Harris Bragging About Economy: 'Lost' 28K Private Sector Jobs,"Sen. JD Vance (R-OH) criticized Vice President Kamala Harris for bragging about the economy in the United States despite recent data showing 28,000 private sector jobs have been lost.
During a rally in Portage, Michigan, on Friday, Vance, the vice presidential running mate of former President Donald Trump spoke about the “effect” of the Biden-Harris administration’s “policies” on the economy.
Vance referenced the recent jobs report from the Department of Labor’s Bureau of Labor Statistics, which found 28,000 private sector jobs had been lost in October.
“I hate to say it, my friends, it’s not just plans and it’s not just proposals,” Vance told the crowd. “We are seeing, in action, the effect of Kamala Harris’s policies. Did anyone see the jobs report that came out this morning? While Kamala Harris goes out there and brags about the economy being great, we’ve got Michigan families who can’t afford the price of groceries, and importantly, over the last month, our country lost 28,000 private sector jobs.”
“And — it actually, it gets even worse than that,” Vance continued. “We lost 46,000 manufacturing jobs. This is what happens when you double down on the failed policies, not just of the last four years, but the failed policies of the last forty years. You get less Americans working and more Americans on welfare. You get less self-reliance and more dependence on the government.”
As Breitbart News’s John Carney previously reported, the jobs report for October, found that only 12,000 jobs had been added to the U.S. economy last month. Carney noted that the “last time the private sector as a whole shed jobs” had been in April 2020.
The jobs report also found that 46,000 manufacturing jobs had been lost last month, a decrease of “44,000 in transportation equipment manufacturing that was largely due to strike activity,” according to the report.
In the government sector, there were 40,000 jobs added, “similar to the average monthly gain of 43,000 over the prior 12 months,” according to the jobs report.",2024-11-01
Breitbart,Colorado Sheriff Warns of 'Dinnertime Burglaries' by 'South American Theft Groups',"Luxury homes are being targeted in Colorado’s Arapahoe County, perpetrated by “South American theft groups” allowed into the country thanks to the Biden-Harris border crisis, according to the county sheriff there.
In a message to his constituents, Arapahoe County Sheriff Tyler S. Brown is warning homeowners in Cherry Hills Village, Columbine Valley, Littleton, and the unincorporated areas to be on the lookout for gangs who are breaking into high-end homes between the hours of five and eight p.m.
The Denver area department is calling them the “dinnertime burglaries” because they happen when homeowners may be out to dinner. However, some of these robberies have also taken place when homeowners are still in their residences.
Law Enforcement Investigating Nine Dinnertime Burglaries at Luxury Homes in Arapahoe CountyBetween February 2, 2024…
Posted by Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office on Thursday, October 31, 2024
“Between February 2, 2024 and October 18, 2024, at least nine high-value, single-family homes throughout Arapahoe County have been burglarized during the dinner-time hours, usually 1-2 hours after sunset,” an X post by the sheriff’s office tells citizens. “The burglaries are happening in homes which back to open space, green belts, canals, trails, golf courses or have heavy tree cover along their property line.”
The department added that the home invasions seem to be part of a “nationwide” trend perpetrated by “multiple South American theft groups.”
Nine such burglaries have been reported in the county, and the sheriff’s department went on to describe the modus operandi of the criminals:
The majority of burglaries have occurred on a Friday between 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. when homeowners are not home. Two to four suspects work together wearing masks, hoodies, gloves, and sometimes carrying a backpack. They will smash an exterior glass door, then rummage through closets, dressers and bathrooms. They steal valuable items such as jewelry, designer purses, cash and safes. At least one burglary in Cherry Hills Village was interrupted by a homeowner who was home at the time.
The department added that similar robberies have occurred in Scottsdale, Arizona, and in California’s San Fernando Valley among other places.
The department added some recommendations for what homeowners can do to help limit their vulnerabilities and offered phone numbers to report issues (303-795-4711 and 720-913-STOP):
The break-ins are being investigated by Arapahoe County Sheriff’s Office, along with the Cherry Hills Village Police Department, Columbine Valley Police Department, and the Littleton Police Department.
Migrant theft rings have sprung up all across the country thanks to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’s open borders policies, and the country has become engulfed in wave after wave of migrant crime.
To name a few, in August a migrant burglary ring was busted on Polk County, Florida. In January, Chicago and its suburbs became inundated by migrant theft rings, with criminals hitting stores and homes all around the area. And in March, a migrant theft ring was identified as operating up and down the east coast.

Breitbart,Harris Hate Brigade: Smokey Robinson Disses Trump-Voting Women & Minorities in Kamala Endorsement,"R&B legend Smokey Robinson dissed women and minorities who are voting for former President Donald Trump in a video in which he endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. “Wake up,” the singer proclaimed.
“I really don’t understand how any person of color or any woman could find it in their hearts to vote for Donald Trump,” Robinson declared in a video posted to his social media on Thursday.
“I’ve never felt the need to campaign publicly until now,” the “The Tears Of A Clown” singer said. “This is the most important election of my lifetime, and as far as I’m concerned, it’s a choice between good and evil.”
“I hope that you all wake up,” Robinson added. “You need to make sure that a man like that does not run our country.”
The “Agony And The Ecstasy” singer concluded, stating, “I think we’re voting for good or evil, so you make the choice. I hope you get out and vote, and I hope you vote for Kamala.”
Watch Below:
Social media users took to the comment section to inform Robinson that they would not be following his advice.
“Nah. I’m voting for Donald Trump,” one X user wrote. “I don’t listen to millionaires & coastal elites for advice on voting.”
“Sorry buddy but you are on the wrong side of history,” another commented.
“Smokey, I love you. PLEASE stay the hell out of politics. I love your music. Couldn’t care less about your politics,” a third remarked.
“People don’t vote based on what singers tell them,” another X user echoed.
“Love your music, but Harris is a no for me,” another chimed in.
“You did not give one coherent argument for why they should vote for her,” another pointed out. “Just because you said he is bad does not mean it is true.”
As Breitbart News reported, billionaire investor Mark Cuban also insulted women associated with Trump, saying, “Donald Trump, you never see him around strong, intelligent women. Ever. It’s just that simple.”
Meanwhile, President Joe Biden called Trump supporters — which equates to millions of Americans — “garbage.”

Breitbart,Michigan Dem Slotkin Scolds Biden for Calling Trump Supporters Garbage,"Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), who is running in a tightly contested U.S. Senate race in Michigan, criticized President Joe Biden for calling Trump supporters “garbage.”
Slotkin distanced herself from Biden during an appearance on a Michigan radio station Wednesday, Fox News reported.
“He shouldn’t have said it, it’s inappropriate,” Slotkin said. “For me, I just think that kind of talk is the last thing we need in our politics.”
Biden’s divisive remark, which has drawn comparison to Hillary Clinton’s infamous “basket of deplorables” comment in 2016, went viral right as Vice President Kamala Harris delivered her dark and gloomy closing argument trashing Trump.
“The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters,” Biden said during a video call with Voto Latino.
Slotkin’s opponent, former U.S. House Intelligence Committee Chair Mike Rogers (R-MI), blasted Biden, Harris, and Slotkin as Biden’s viral moment began to make the rounds.
“Michiganders living paycheck to paycheck aren’t garbage, Joe!” Rogers wrote.
“The clear and disgusting contempt that Biden, Harris, and Slotkin have for Americans who don’t support their garbage policies is all you need to know and why we’re going to win next week,” he added.
Some other Democrats have distanced themselves from Biden’s comments.
A spokesman for Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), one of the most vulnerable incumbents this cycle, told Breitbart News in an exclusive statement that Brown disagrees that Trump supporters are garbage.
“Sherrod doesn’t agree with that and fights for all Ohioans, regardless of who they vote for,” Brown campaign spokesman Matt Keyes said.
Gov. Josh Shapiro (D-PA), who will not be up for reelection until 2026, was the first to scramble away from Biden’s remark during an appearance on CNN’s The Source Tuesday night.
He said Biden’s words are “certainly not words that I would choose, and I think it’s important that we remain focused on the contrast between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump and not attacking supporters of either candidate.”",2024-10-30
Breitbart,Americans Shop for Halloween Costumes at Thrift Stores amid Inflation,"Inflation is pushing many families to find cheaper options for Halloween costumes this year in the Biden-Harris economy.
A Goodwill shopper in the Nashville, Tennessee, area told WSVM it is important for families to consider essentials over things such as costumes, the outlet reported on Wednesday.
“There’s no sense in us parents stressing, getting the kids the best of the top, when they would be okay with something lower, and you don’t have to worry about what to feed your child,” Tiffany Hunt said.
Families in Las Vegas are also feeling the pinch when it comes to high prices. They too are looking to make the holiday season more affordable by shopping for Halloween costumes at thrift stores, KTNV reported October 14.
A mother of two children told the outlet, “With the economy being what it is right now and Halloween costumes being worn usually once, maybe twice, I’d much rather buy something used than brand new.”
According to the WSMV article:
Goodwill offers a variety of Halloween costumes and accessories at significantly lower prices than retail stores. For example, WSMV found a children’s turtle costume priced at $50 online at Goodwill for $7.99, while a Princess Peach dress, retailing for $70, sold for just $5.99 at the Bellevue store.
Goodwill’s 2024 Halloween survey highlights shifting consumer behavior, with nearly three-quarters of shoppers reporting that inflation has affected their Halloween spending. In response, about 60% of participants said they are more likely to buy materials from thrift stores this year.
It is important to note that the rising cost of chocolate could also affect people looking to have fun on Halloween, according to Breitbart News.
The outlet noted that retailers are offering more non-chocolate candies for shoppers. There has been a shortage of cocoa beans, from which chocolate is made, which has resulted in higher prices. Seventy percent of the beans are produced in West Africa, where various factors have contributed to the shortage.
Reuters reported, “More than 20 farmers, experts and industry insiders told Reuters that a perfect storm of rampant illegal gold mining, climate change, sector mismanagement, and rapidly spreading disease is to blame” for the cocoa bean shortage.
On Monday Breitbart News reported, “The cost of handing out candy to trick-or-treaters rose more rapidly under the Biden-Harris administration than they have in decades, a reminder of the steep toll of the inflationary policies of the Democrat White House.”

Breitbart,"Exclusive -- Steve Bannon: If Kamala 'Loses Any Aspect of the Blue Wall, Trump's President'","If Vice President Kamala Harris loses “any aspect of the blue wall, Trump’s president,” War Room host Steve Bannon said during an interview on Breitbart News Saturday just days ahead of the election.
Bannon is former chief strategist to Donald Trump. Recently released from federal prison after serving four months at the hands of the Biden administration, he walked through the current state of affairs in the election, explaining that he believes Republicans are better poised than Democrat moving into game day — Election Day — which is Republicans’ strength.
“We want a game day fight, right?” he said, explaining that he believes the focus should be less on expanding the map and more on “getting the 270 north.”
If Republicans “win the south” and take one of the blue walls, Trump is president, Bannon said, explaining that it should be the “maniacal focus.”
Bannon put this in greater perspective, explaining that a few weeks ago, Harris seemed to have several paths to the White House. That has since diminished.
“A couple of weeks ago, she had multiple paths to the presidency. What I like about where we are on the weekend before game day is that she only has one path to the presidency, and that’s the blue wall,” Bannon explained.
“She loses any aspect of the blue wall, Trump’s president, because they’ve done such a good job on these southern states. A couple of weeks ago, she had multiple paths to the presidency,” he emphasized before adding that Republicans are “perfectly teed up on this final weekend to play to our strengths, which is getting out the game day vote.”
LISTEN:
Bannon then asked host Matt Boyle what his focus will be going into game day, and he said he is going to be “maniacally focused on numbers,” particularly in Rust Belt States.
“Anything and everything. And then also the closing messages of the various candidates. Donald Trump, I believe, is going to Grand Rapids, Michigan, for his final rally. He did that in 2016 and 2020, so three straight presidential elections. A Republican candidate, Donald Trump, will be closing it out there. So that’s what I’ll be looking for,” he said. “But I’ll be maniacally following numbers. Polls don’t matter as much anymore. Now it’s all about votes.”

Breitbart,Wife of Miami Dolphins Star: 'A Vote for Kamala is a Vote for War',"Devon Mostert, the wife of Miami Dolphins running back Raheem Mostert, has come out against Vice President Kamala Harris, saying that a vote for her would be a vote for war.
In an Instagram Story on Tuesday, Mostert shared a segment from former Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard’s speech at Madison Square Garden in which she said that Harris could cause nuclear war in the future.
“An attack on America is going to happen. It’s not a matter (of) if … it’s a matter of when. AS HEARTBREAKING AS THAT IS (and I pray every day it doesn’t) … but it’s only a matter of a time. And a draft WILL happen,” Mostert said.
Mostert then took a swipe at the Biden administration for its withdrawal from Afghanistan and said a vote for Kamala Harris would be a “vote for war.”
“The side who doesn’t even acknowledge our fallen military service members?!?! The Biden administration’s (*let’s NOT forget, Kamala is currently the VP) withdrawal from Afghanistan was HORRIFIC – killed 13 of our own and left our allies for slaughter by the Taliban! Kamala said during the debate, ‘there is no one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone in any war zone around the world – the first time this century.’ – THAT’S A LIE,” she said.
“A vote for Kamala is a vote for war. NOBODY on the international stage is going to take HER seriously,” she concluded.
As noted by Fox News, Mostert recently generated backlash when she knocked Kamala’s criticism of Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for his emergency response to Hurricanes Helene and Milton.
“I really don’t think that Kamala’s comments about him add up,” Mostert told Fox News. “He is focused on taking care of his Floridians, and that’s exactly where his focus should be.”
Mostert said she received racist backlash for her comments.",2024-10-29
Breitbart,Farage Major Attack on Starmer Using 'Fear' to Crack Down on Speech,"The Starmer government has used fear to shut down public discussion and Parliamentary rules to silence lawmakers, Brexit leader Nigel Farage warned.
British Member of Parliament Nigel Farage said his written questions to the government to get facts about the Southport attack have gone unanswered, and attempts to ask spoken questions in the chamber have been shut down, amounting to what he calls “a near-blanket ban on discussing the case”.
The Southport attack earlier this year saw young children killed at a Taylor Swift-themed dance party and was followed by days of protests and riots. Suspect Axel Rudakubana is facing trial for charges of murder, attempted murder, a terrorism offence for possession of an Al-Qaeda publication, and a bio-weapons offence, but little has been revealed about the man or his motives, and this has led to accusations of a government-engineered “information vacuum”.
The situation, as laid out by Mr Farage, is particularly concerning. In normal times, Parliamentarians actually have more freedom-of-speech rights than ordinary Britons, given they have the privilege to speak inside the chamber without fear of prosecution. While Parliament traditionally self-regulates to not endanger live cases by prejudicing court proceedings, the Brexit leader alleges present changes go far beyond what has been considered proper in the past.
As expressed, what now counts as contempt of court is much lower than in the past, Farage said, claiming: “The Contempt of Court Act appears to have been deployed as a tool of suppression”.
Launching a major attack on the present climate of “fear” surrounding even discussing the Southport attack, what it means, and what the government knew and when engendered by the crackdown on the use of social media through custodial sentences for incautious members of the public, Mr Farage wrote in the Daily Telegraph on Friday that: “I understand the importance of not prejudicing a future trial, but in the current climate, there appears to be no room to separate the ongoing legal process from the questions I posed over the summer. This is deeply troubling.”
The situation now fundamentally challenges Farage’s duty as an elected Parliamentarian representing the interests of his constituents, which he said includes “asking difficult questions in order to get to the truth about national issues”.
Describing the events of the past week, when news broke of the Southport attack suspect being charged under biological weapon and terror charges while the attack itself was not said to be thought of by officials as terrorism itself, Mr Farage wrote:
This week, I asked the Home Secretary two written questions on this subject. The first asked if the suspect had ever been referred to the anti-terrorist Prevent programme; the second asked when she became aware of the discovery of ricin in the accused’s home. The questions will not be answered.”
… [of Wednesday this week when his party college Richard Tice was granted a spoken question to the Prime Minister in Parliament] That morning, he received three panicked emails from the Commons authorities asking what the content of his question might be.
Then, an hour before PMQs began, he received a telephone call in which he was told not to ask anything about the man accused of the Southport attacks. This point was reinforced strenuously by the Speaker in the Commons just before PMQs began. Parliamentary Privilege was effectively withdrawn.
Mr Tice did get a question in, but evidently worded it carefully to elicit some response without breaking the orders handed down by the office of the Speaker, and open himself up to administrative action by Parliamentary authorities. The Prime Minister declined to respond meaningfully, instead issuing a veiled warning to those who he said “undermined” the police by speaking out.
Farage and Tice have cited the words of Jonathan Hall KC, the government’s own independent reviewer of terrorism laws, who has spoken critically of the creation of an information vacuum post-Southport attack. The top lawyer had previously said that there was a “huge, huge interest” in the suspect’s identity after the attack and that the public “quite reasonably wanted to know as much as possible about a massacre of children”.
“The brutal reality is that at some stage in the future, there will be an attack by someone who is an asylum seeker or who came on a small boat,” he said in September. “It is better to be as level and as straight as you can be because terrorism is about attacking institutions, and if institutions do not appear to be transparent, then they suffer.”
Suggesting Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer stands to face much bigger problems by “kicking the can down the road”.

The YouTube account for the eight-year-old Saint West – which was under the handle @TheGoatSaint – was “allegedly taken down” by Kardashian, 44, after the political posts appeared, according to the Daily Beast.
“This page isn’t available. Sorry about that. Try searching for something else,” a message from the social media outlet read when clicking on the page, although some X – formerly known as Twitter – users pointed out, captured the moment that might have sparked the move with a video showing a cartoon character with the words, “I stepped in s**t” alongside a picture of Kamala:
Another video allegedly contained more direct abuse of the Democratic candidate.
The reality star said last month Saint agreed to a contract if he wanted a channel on the platform. It appeared he breached the terms of the deal just six days before the election.
The contract, posted on September 3 on Kardashian’s Instagram Stories, read: “I, Saint West, agree to follow my mom’s rules in order to have a YouTube channel. I am not allowed to comment any personal family information.”
Saint also agreed to not garner any footage containing “any personal information” or “while North is recording music.”
It continued: “I must show my mom or guardian all videos before I post them.
“I give permission to any grown up if mom says to delete my video for any reason. If I don’t listen to all of the rules, mom could make my page private or delete my account.”",2024-10-31
Breitbart,Poll: GOP Candidate Leads in Dem Rep. Elissa Slotkin's Michigan District,"A poll shows Republican congressional candidate Tom Barrett narrowly leading Democrat Curtis Hertel in Michigan’s 7th District — a seat currently held by Democrat Rep. Elissa Slotkin, who is running for Senate.
The Emerson College Polling survey shows Barrett leading Hertel 47 percent to 45 percent. One percent support Libertarian candidate L. Rachel Daily, and seven percent are undecided.
“Barrett has an advantage among independent voters in the district, who back him 47 percent over Hertel’s 41 percent, though 10 percent of independents are still undecided ahead of the election,” Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, said.
Slotkin gave Republicans the opportunity to pick up the House seat after announcing her bid for U.S. Senate, seeing her opportunity to advance her political career after Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) announced she would not seek reelection.
Slotkin had narrowly retained her House seat in the midterm election, receiving 51.7 percent of the vote to Barrett’s 46.3 percent.
Other recent polling has projected a close Senate race between Slotkin and her Republican rival former Rep. Mike Rogers (R-MI), 48 percent apiece.
The Emerson College Polling survey also found an even split of support in the district for Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, 49 percent to 49 percent.
“Men and women voters in the district break in opposite directions: men for Trump 58 percent to 41 percent, and women for Harris, 57 percent to 41 percent,” Kimball said.
Trump notably flipped the battleground state for the first time in over 20 years in 2016, and only lost Michigan to President Joe Biden by a few percentage points in 2020.
The survey was conducted between Oct. 24-26, 2024, with 535 likely Michigan District 7 voters. The credibility interval, similar to a margin of error, is ±4.2 percentage points.

Breitbart,"Moskowitz: Biden-Harris 'Slow to Respond' to Campus Protests, Quicker Action Would've Been Taken for Another Group","During a town hall on NewsNation on Wednesday, Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-FL) stated that while they have been good for Israel, the Biden-Harris administration “was slow to respond to the campus protests.” And stated that “everybody knows, if that wasn’t Jewish students, if those were minority students, if those were LGBTQ students blocked from going to their class, that wouldn’t have gotten past lunchtime on the first day.” And because “we don’t fit into this box of protected classes, … people on the left were silent and they failed.”
Moskowitz said, “Trump did a lot of good stuff for Israel in his administration. He did the Abraham Accords. He should get credit for that. He moved the embassy to Jerusalem. He should get credit for that. The Biden administration has continued those policies because they were the right policies for Israel. … But you don’t have to listen to my opinion on whether the Biden-Harris administration has been good for Israel. Go listen to the folks in Dearborn, MI, who hate the policies of the Biden-Harris administration because they have been pro-Israel. She gets protested everywhere she goes by progressives that I’ve had to deal with in my party and by socialists that don’t belong in my party, because of the Biden-Harris position on Israel. Trump has something going on in his party called isolationism. That’s a big problem for Israel. You should talk to your Republican friends about how Sen. JD Vance (R-OH) and that whole wing of the Republican Party are isolationists. Israel has not been exempt from that. And so, look, I actually think both candidates will be good for Israel. I think there’s a lot of evidence for that. I think Joe Biden’s been tremendous for Israel, okay, this idea that he has not been good for Israel is just not true.”
He continued, “Now, I think the administration was slow to respond to the campus protests. I’ve said that before. They were slow. There is no doubt. I think everybody knows, if that wasn’t Jewish students, if those were minority students, if those were LGBTQ students blocked from going to their class, that wouldn’t have gotten past lunchtime on the first day. But because it was Jews and not — we don’t fit into this box of protected classes, right? All of a sudden, people on the left were silent and they failed.”
Later, he added, “Both parties are failing [o]n this, and I’ll tell you what I mean. When Tucker Carlson has a Holocaust denier on his show, Republicans have a hard time calling him out, and Democrats have a hard time calling out stuff that comes from Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) and Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-MI). Easy to call out the other side, harder to deal with it in your tent. So, all of a sudden, antisemitism is a team sport.”
Moskowitz further stated, “We’ve got to have the conversations. Democrats and Republicans work on bills together. I worked with Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) on the campus antisemitism bill, together, to call for the resignations of those presidents. We’ve got to figure out how to bridge the divide. … If the Jewish community becomes a partisan issue, it’s going to be disastrous for the Jewish community.”

Breitbart,Detroit Police Investigating Why Lion's WR Not Arrested on Gun Charge,"The Detroit Police Department is conducting an internal investigation into why Lions’ wide receiver Jameson Williams was not arrested when a gun was found under his seat during an October 8, 2024, traffic stop.
TMZ’s Michael Babcock observed, “Williams was stopped on Oct 8, and cops found a gun in his car. JW should’ve been arrested, but wasn’t, and there’s strong evidence it’s because he plays for the Lions. Now cops are investigating, and everyone could be in trouble.”
WXYZ reported that Williams was pulled over for allegedly speeding and there were two guns in the car, one of which belonged to Williams brother. The gun that belonged to the brother was a non-issue because Williams’ brother has a concealed carry permit. However, the other gun was found under Williams’ seat and Williams does not have a permit.
According to WXYZ, Williams repeatedly reminded the patrol officer that he played for the Detroit Lions and, at another point, said, “I got the gun for protection. Do you guys know where I live at? Detroit!”
Williams was handcuffed and placed in a police cruiser, apparently about to be taken to jail, but a “supervisor was called to the scene.” Upon arrival, the supervisor made numerous calls and Williams was eventually un-cuffed and allowed to go along his way without so much as a warning.
The Detroit Free Press noted that although Williams did not have a concealed permit, the gun under his seat was registered to him. Whether this will be enough to prevent the issuance of a warrant remains to be seen.

Breitbart,13 Big Lies in Kamala Harris' 'Closing Argument' in Washington,"Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a long list of old lies in her “closing argument” speech in Washington, DC, on Tuesday night, defying fact-checkers and repeating false claims that had already been debunked during the campaign.
Here are the most egregious of Harris’s false claims:
1. Then-President Donald Trump “sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol to overturn the will of the people.” Trump did not send a “mob”; he told his supporters to march “peacefully and patriotically” to the Capitol. Rioters were already there — but they were not “armed” with guns. Only five rioters were ultimately charged with firearms crimes — but they did not use their guns during the riot. Few were “armed” with anything. And many of the protesters believed they were protecting an election, not overturning one, according to a Harvard study.
2. “He has an enemies list of people he intends to prosecute.” No such list exists, and Trump has pointed out that despite campaign rhetoric in 2016, he refrained from prosecuting his rival, Hillary Clinton, even though she had arguably broken the law with her misuse of classified information and destruction of government documents.
3. “He says that one of his highest priorities is to set free the violent extremists who assaulted those law enforcement officers on January 6.” Trump has never said that he would pardon violent people, or extremists. He has said that he would pardon “many” of the rioters, on a case by case basis, implying that he would pardon non-violent offenders. Notably, Harris herself urged people to bail out rioters arrested during the 2020 riots.
4. “Donald Trump intends to use the United States military against American citizens who simply disagree with him.” Trump has never said anything like that. What he said was that he would use “the National Guard, or if really necessary … the military” against “radical left lunatics” who tried to disrupt the election. This is actually a common position among both parties: Democrats deployed the military to protect the Capitol after the riot.
5. “I will always tell you the truth.” That is never a good thing for a politician to say, and it is easily disproven. Harris lied to the country about President Joe Biden’s mental state; she also lied about the Charlottesville “very fine people” hoax in the 2024 presidential debate, after being fact-checked about the same claim on live television in the 2020 vice presidential debate. And, of course, she lied in this speech — in the many examples above, and below.
6. Trump wants “tax cuts for billionaires and big corporations.” As Breitbart News has demonstrated in many repeated fact checks, the Trump tax cuts of 2017 primarily benefited the middle class, and actually imposed higher taxes on some wealthy households, especially in Democrat-run states. Trump did lower corporate taxes, but with the intent of encouraging companies to invest more at home than abroad, and to create jobs for Americans.
7. “He will pay for it with a 20% national sales tax.” Trump has never proposed a “national sales tax” and would certainly oppose one. The term “national sales tax” is how Democrats describe Trump’s tariffs, which could — in theory — raise some prices. But Democrats aren’t opposed to tariffs; the Biden-Harris administration kept the Trump tariffs in place. And those tariffs did not raise prices significantly; inflation kicked in when Biden took office.
8. “He tried to cut Medicare and Social Security every year.” This is a claim Breitbart News has fact-checked before — and so has NBC News, which said it “has merit, but it omits some key context.” His budget proposed some Social Security cuts but not Medicare benefit cuts. Ironically, as Breitbart noted, “the Biden-Harris administration has cut Medicare Advantage, which a majority of Medicare beneficiaries use over traditional Medicare.”
9. “He would ban abortion nationwide.” Trump has rejected this idea at every opportunity, saying that he believes the issue is best handled by the states, which can choose whatever policy they want. That was the effect of overturning Roe v. Wade in the Dobbs decision. Some liberal states granted abortion until birth. Some conservative states banned it in most circumstances, but in no instance were these “Trump abortion bans,” as Harris claimed.
10. Trump would “restrict access to birth control and to IVF.” Again, that is simply false. In fact, Trump has said that he would make government or private insurance policies pay for IVF, which is the opposite of restricting access. When Alabama’s highest court made a decision that resulted in many IVF providers refusing to provide the service, it was Trump who urged the state’s Republican legislature to convene to legalize IVF for hopeful parents.
11. Trump “killed” a border security bill. This is another tired Biden-Harris talking point. The administration was well aware that it does not need a new law to enforce border security, but tried to blame Congress for not passing “comprehensive immigration reform.” When one Republican worked with Democrats on a “bipartisan” bill that would have legalized migration at current levels, the rest balked. They did not need Trump to tell them to oppose the idea.
12. Trump called soldiers “suckers and losers.” This is an old hoax, cooked up by the left-wing Atlantic and refuted by many, many witnesses, including those (like former National Security Advisor John Bolton) who had broken with Trump politically. Ironically, again, it was Biden and Harris who failed to contact the families of the 13 Americans killed in the Afghanistan pullout, and Harris never apologized for smearing Border Patrol agents as racist.
13. Trump “wants to put [people who disagree with him] in jail.” Ambulance sirens were heard at times during Harris’s speech, and they may well have been “irony alerts,” because it is the Biden-Harris Department of Justice that is still trying to put Trump in jail. Harris also spoke on the same day former Trump aide Stephen K. Bannon emerged from prison after serving four months for a contempt of Congress charge widely viewed as bogus.
Harris went on to describe Trump as a “wannabe dictator” and “petty tyrant” in a speech that was as negative as any she has made in the campaign. Her “closing argument” was little more than a partisan attack — and a dishonest one.

Breitbart,Mark Halperin: Not All Roads Lead Through Pennsylvania for Donald Trump,"The chances of former President Donald Trump winning Wisconsin are good, Democrat and Republican sources told Mark Halperin — limiting Vice President Kamala Harris’s path to an Electoral College victory.
“My reporting is that she’s [Harris] in trouble in Wisconsin,” Halperin said on his 2Way platform.
“This is based on three sources, two Republicans, one Democrat, all of whom know the state quite well, and all of whom told me today the same version of they would be somewhere between surprised and shocked if Kamala Harris won Wisconsin,” Halperin said.
“The focus has been on Pennsylvania,” Halperin continued. “[Harris] may well win Pennsylvania and win the election, but she could win Pennsylvania and lose the election because she doesn’t win Wisconsin. Watch Wisconsin.”
“It is unlikely Harris wins Georgia, North Carolina, and Arizona,” according to Halperin, and if she doesn’t win those three states, he explained, she must win all three rust belt swing states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin.
“Michigan remains a bit of a puzzle,” he added.
“As forecasted here a long time ago, it appears that she’s basically back to where Joe Biden was on the eve of the debate, one Electoral College path to exactly 270 electoral votes,” he said. “So our intense focus for the rest of the way will be to continue to monitor to see whether she can actually win North Carolina, Georgia, or Arizona.”

Breitbart,Pro-Kamala Actor Billy Eichner's Anti-Trump Rant at Undecided Voters Backfires: 'Trump It is! Thanks Billy',"Actor Billy Eichner’s anti-Trump rant at undecided voters appeared to backfire, as social media users reacted to it by saying they would be voting for former President Donald Trump in the 2024 election.
“I’m getting a lot of texts and feeling a lot of people panicking, and then other people saying, ‘No, no, no don’t panic,’ and I think those people are wrong. It is time to fucking panic, okay? And not just panic, but to do something about it,” Eichner began in a video.
“Polls are not good. I’m just gonna be blunt. I don’t work for the Kamala campaign. I’m just gonna call it like I see it, the polls are not good. Trump has the momentum,” the Bros star continued.
After going on an anti-Trump diatribe, Eichner went on to lament that he has heard people saying, “I hate him, but I don’t know if I can vote for her.”
“What the fuck are you talking about? Please, get involved. He is a danger to the physical safety of American citizens everywhere,” the actor proclaimed. “He is very, very dangerous, and not in the cool fucking way that some of his fucking fanboys think he is.”
Watch Below:
“People are going to be like, ‘Billy Eichner is yelling at us to vote,’ great, you can be annoyed at me, but that’s not the point,” Eichner continued. “We can’t let what happened with Hillary in 2016 happen again.”
“I can feel it, I was out talking to voters yesterday, I did not like the vibe,” the actor added. “So, please, do what you can, because we will live to regret it if we don’t — even the people voting for him will live to regret it.”
But Eichner’s anti-Trump rant seemed to have the opposite affect he intended.
While the actor turned off the ability for social media users to comment on his Instagram post, his followers nonetheless took to other social media platforms to inform the comedian that they will be voting for Trump.
“Trump it is! Thanks Billy,” one social media user wrote on TikTok.
“I agree with Billy Trump 2024!!” another said.
“Just voted with this incredible momentum in California,” a third disclosed.
“Has Billy made any comments about the Doug [Emhoff] slugging a woman story or nah?” another inquired on X.
“Is it bad that I enjoy watching these people melt down in their delusional rants?” another asked. “Seriously, I can watch people like this all day, I think it is some of the best comedy around nowadays.”
“It is panic time indeed! For them,” another remarked. “That said, we need to take nothing for granted. You can never have enough votes. Especially against cheaters like the Democrats.”
Elon Musk also reacted to Eichner’s anti-Trump rant, writing, “And they don’t even realize how big the loss will be yet.”
Doing the opposite of the what celebrities demand of voters has become somewhat of a trend in this year’s election, noted Daily Mail, which cited talk show host Jimmy Kimmel’s 19-minute rant against Trump prompting viewers to declare they would now be supporting the 45th president.
“I was on the fence, but since Hollywood elites like Jimmy Kimmel are supporting Harris, I’ll cast a vote for Trump,” one social media user commented.
Trump currently holds a three-point lead over Vice President Kamala Harris, with data suggesting that the 45th president has gained support among independent and undecided voters.
Recent data revealed that Trump’s approval rating is closer to 50 percent, and Republican candidates are ahead of Democrats in down ballot races.

Breitbart,'We Can't Have 4 More Years of This': Boxer and Youtuber Jake Paul Endorses Donald Trump for President,"Boxer and YouTube star Jake Paul has made up his mind and, in a video posted to social media Thursday, has endorsed Donald Trump for president.
Paul posted a long, 18-minute video explaining why he chose Donald Trump but also urging viewers to do their own research and not just take the word of “pop stars” because “you like their songs” or even because he said so. Paul said voters need to look at the facts and choose based on logic, not feelings.
However, after his suggestions that voters think carefully about their vote, Paul insisted that the Democrats have proven that they cannot lead this country. And he is supporting Donald Trump.
Democrats have been in power for 12 of the last 16 years,” the boxer explained, adding, “So, if we aren’t happy with the current political state, economic state, environmental state, then who is to blame?”
He then noted that Democratic VP nominee Tim Walz “has even said this himself.” Paul then inserted a video clip of the Minn. Gov. saying, “We can’t afford four more years of this.”
“We can’t have four more years of this,” Paul insisted. “Even Tim says it needs to be changed, and he’s right.
“We need to change from Kamala Harris to the Republican candidate Donald Trump.

Breitbart,U.S. Marines Successfully Test Israel's Iron Dome System,"The U.S. Marines have successfully tested a modified version of Israel’s Iron Dome missile defense system, which was invented in Israel and developed with funding from the United States.
The Israeli Ministry of Defense said Tuesday:
The system is based on an American radar and command-and-control center, combined with the Iron Dome (Tamir) interceptor and a mobile launcher developed by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems and Raytheon as a prime contractor.
During the training, the Marines fully operated the system, leading to the successful interception of targets. Additionally, the continuous launch capability of the Iron Dome interceptors from a mobile launcher, developed specifically for the Marines, was tested.
The training followed the completion of an entire training program and a series of tests as part of the development and acquisition plan led by the Marines to assess a new prototype system for medium-range intercept capability (MRIC).
The successful training demonstrated the forces’ proficiency in fully operating the system, the performance of the mobile launcher developed for the Marines, and the capabilities of the Iron Dome interceptor in relevant and challenging interception scenarios.
The Tamir interceptor can intercept cruise missiles, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and various rockets, artillery shells, and mortars. The interceptor is developed by Rafael, which partnered with Raytheon as prime contractor in adapting it to the Marine Corps’s configuration and in training support.
The success of the live-fire exercise marks a significant milestone toward the operational deployment of the first prototype battery for the Marines.
The Iron Dome is often touted as an example of how U.S. aid to Israel helps America as well by funding advanced research and development by Israeli scientists and engineers that can then be used to strengthen U.S. forces.

Breitbart,Ohio Dem Sherrod Brown Disagrees Trump Supporters Are ‘Garbage',"A campaign spokesman for Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH), one of the most vulnerable Senators seeking reelection this cycle, told Breitbart News in an exclusive statement that Brown disagrees that Trump supporters are “garbage,” as President Joe Biden declared Tuesday.
In response to a Breitbart News comment request asking if Brown thinks Trump supporters are garbage, campaign spokesman Matt Keyes said Brown “doesn’t agree with that.”
“Sherrod doesn’t agree with that and fights for all Ohioans, regardless of who they vote for,” Keyes said.
Biden’s divisive and partisan comments overshadowed Vice President Kamala Harris’s closing argument address on the Ellipse in Washington, DC.
“The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters,” he said on a call with Voto Latino.
One of Brown’s donors felt Biden should have gone farther. Vinod Khosla, who contributed $3,300 to Brown’s principal campaign committee in May, tweeted, “Garbage is an understatement for MAGA extremists.”
Brown’s opponent, Republican businessman Bernie Moreno, slammed Biden, Harris, and Brown immediately after Biden’s remarks went orbital on social media.
“We always knew career politicians like Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Sherrod Brown hated American citizens. It’s obvious from their policies of open borders, high prices, and massive government overreach. Now, they are just saying the quiet part out loud,” Moreno wrote in a post on X.
Other prominent Democrats are scrambling to distance themselves from the comments trashing half of the country, including Gov. Josh Shapiro (D-PA)–who is not even up for election this cycle–and Michigan’s vulnerable Democrat Senate nominee, Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI).
Shapiro told CNN’s The Source on Tuesday night that Biden’s words are “certainly not words that I would choose, and I think it’s important that we remain focused on the contrast between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump and not attacking supporters of either candidate.”
Slotkin distanced herself from Biden on Wednesday.
“He shouldn’t have said it, it’s inappropriate,” Slotkin told a Michigan radio station, Fox News reported. “For me, I just think that kind of talk is the last thing we need in our politics.”
For her part, Harris dodged when asked about Biden’s “garbage” comment while he and Democrats have tried to reframe and explain it away.

Breitbart,"MI: Mike Rogers Surges Ahead in Senate Race, Trump Leads Harris","Former U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-MI) has surged six points in two weeks and now has a two-point lead over Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) in Michigan’s U.S. Senate race, according to a poll.
The Mitchell Research and Communications/ Michigan News Source poll, published on October 28-29, shows Rogers at 49 percent of support among likely voters, and Slotkin garners 47 percent.
A source in the Rogers campaign tells Breitbart News that the survey tracks along with their internal figures.
While Slotkin’s support is unchanged from an October 14 poll, Rogers has surged considerably. He has risen from 43 percent to 49 percent in just two weeks, signaling he has significant momentum behind him in the home stretch.
It is worth noting that Slotkin was the first vulnerable Democrat Senate nominee in any of the battleground states to rebuke President Joe Biden’s labeling of Trump supporters as garbage.
Slotkin also had the most vigorous response, which points to the campaign’s potential concern about the effect Biden’s smear could have on her prospects.
The survey also gauged the state of the presidential race, finding Trump with a narrow one-point lead on Harris.
Of the respondents, 48 percent prefer Trump, and 47 percent back Harris. The state of the race is unchanged compared to the poll from two weeks ago, when they garnered identical numbers, RealClearPolling shows.
“The more things change, the more they stay the same, and that is exactly what we are seeing in this poll,” Steve Mitchell, president of Mitchell Research & Communications, Inc., told Michigan News Source.
“Although there have been interesting changes in certain crosstabs, the race continues to be where it was two weeks ago, as close as 2 pages in a book,” he added.
Michigan News Source did not provide the sample size of likely voters, and the margin of error is ± 2.46 percentage points.",2024-10-31
Breitbart,'Someone Needs to Park Biden Out of Sight': Democrats Distance Themselves from Biden's 'Garbage' Remark,"“Anxious” Democrats are attempting to distance themselves and Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign from President Joe Biden’s controversial comment referring to supporters of former President Donald Trump as “garbage,” Axios reported.
After Biden said, “The only garbage I see floating out there are his supporters” during a virtual interview with Voto Latino that was meant to help Harris, the White House edited his words to spin the remark to refer to Trump’s “supporter’s” rhetoric:
“Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage — which is the only word I can think of to describe it. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable,” Biden said in a follow-up post on X, referring to comedian Tony Hinchcliffe’s joke about the island of Puerto Rico being “garbage” at Trump’s recent Madison Square Garden rally.
“That’s all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don’t reflect who we are as a nation,” Biden wrote:
After the wave of backlash from Republicans, some elected Democrats have admitted to Axios that Biden’s comments were bad for Harris’s campaign.
“Someone needs to park Biden out of sight till after the election,” one swing-district House Democrat told the outlet on the condition of anonymity.
A senior House Democrat remarked that the president’s “garbage” comment towards Trump supporters shows why it is “definitely smart to keep [Harris] out front and not Joe,” and that they are “less concerned after Kamala quickly disassociated” from it on Wednesday.
When asked about Biden’s comment on the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, Harris told reporters that she “strongly” disagrees with criticizing people for who they vote for.
“Listen, I think, first of all, he clarified his comments, but let me be clear: I strongly disagree with any criticism of people based on who they vote for. You heard my speech last night and continuously throughout my career. I believe that the work that I do is about representing all the people whether they support me or not,” the vice president said, before reiterating past comments that she will “represent all Americans” if elected.
WATCH — Frank Luntz: Biden’s Garbage Gaffe May Be “Turning Point” Leading to Trump Victory:
Yet another senior House Democrat told Axios that Biden’s latest gaffe is “very strongly” illustrative of why the aging president was pushed to end his campaign for reelection and has taken a backseat on the campaign trail.
“I think you’re not going to see him out there a lot,” the representative added.
Former Washington Post and current Semafor reporter David Weigel expressed his disbelief at Biden making such a controversial comment in a “low-pressure” Zoom interview:
“Can’t get over Biden making this gaffe in a low-pressure Zoom call for Voto Latino. It’s like bowling with bumpers, but somehow throwing a gutter ball that also sets the room on fire,” he wrote on X.
Poll aggregator Nate Silver also said that Biden is “one of Kamala Harris’ biggest impediments to victory” after his “garbage” comment, telling the Daily Mail that Biden will be largely responsible if Harris loses to Trump.
While claiming that Harris has done a “pretty good job” with her campaign so far, that FiveThirtyEight founder said that “Biden doing everything possible to fuck it up.”",2024-10-30
Breitbart,Bob Casey Faces Ad Blitz from Catholic Group Focusing on Democrats' Bigotry,"Embattled incumbent Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) is facing a new ad blitz from the conservative Frontiers of Freedom super PAC that focuses on the anti-Catholic bigotry of the Democratic Party.
As Breitbart News has reported, Frontiers of Freedom has been targeting vulnerable Democrats in states with large Latino and Catholic populations, starting in the southwest and moving to the industrial Midwest. Democrats have made the group’s message easier with Vice President Kamala Harris’s snub of the Al Smith charity dinner in New York earlier this month, and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s mock “communion” with an online influencer.
More recently, Harris said that she would not honor religious exemptions for religious people opposed to abortion.
The latest ads, in both English and Spanish below, note Democrats’ increasing hostility to the Catholic faith, but focus on Casey’s record specifically.
“Casey is a pro-abortion extremist supporting unrestricted, up-to-the-moment-of-birth abortions, paid for by taxpayers,” the ad says.
In a statement, Frontiers of Freedom explained:
[T]he super PAC is making a direct appeal to the 250,000 Hispanics who live in the Philadelphia area, airing two-minute Spanish-language ads on morning and evening news about the Casey’s and the Democrat Party’s record of anti-Catholic bigotry.
“Casey is particularly vulnerable because of his far-left record. When Hispanic voters—especially Hispanics who attend Catholic Mass—come to learn about their senator’s record of anti-Catholic bigotry, they are going to be stunned,” said George Landrith, president of Frontiers of Freedom.
…
The ad focuses on the candidates’ “cruel war” against the Little Sisters of the Poor, Democrats’ imposition of an “unconstitutional religious test” against Catholics nominated to serve in the federal judiciary, the left’s support of gender ideology, and their persecution of Catholics who uphold the Church’s teachings on life.
The group’s ads appear to have moved the needle, as many of the Democrats it has targeted face increasingly tough challenges in formerly safe states.

Breitbart,"Maher, Raskin: Outlets Saying Trump Called for Cheney's Execution 'Lying', He Said What Hippies Used to","During the “Overtime” segment of Friday’s broadcast of HBO’s “Real Time,” host Bill Maher said that media outlets that accused 2024 Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump called for the execution of former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) were lying and what Trump said “is exactly what hippies always said.” And “the spirit of it is something that if someone with a blue hat said it, people would nod along on the left.” And Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) agreed that Trump’s words were distorted.
Maher said, “I woke up today to the headline that Trump had called for a firing squad for Liz Cheney. And this is what I really don’t like about the media, no, he didn’t. You don’t have to move me to not like Donald Trump more than I already [do].”
Maher added that Trump was criticizing Cheney on foreign policy and “Now, of course, he expresses himself horribly, he has to add she’s a stupid person, because he’s a moron.”
After Raskin cut in to sarcastically quip, “Well, Trump knows what it’s really like from Vietnam.” Maher responded, “Okay. But, just to be clear, this is exactly what hippies always said. This is exactly what peaceniks always said. This is ‘Fortunate Son’, the song. It’s like, you know what, it’s very easy to sit in your building and send young men to die — apropos of Ukraine, because, I don’t know, that war does not look like it’s going in the right direction. But just so — just don’t lie to me. I don’t like Donald Trump. Don’t lie to me and tell me she was in — he wants her in front of a firing squad. He was saying something that, by the way, if it came out of the mouth — some of it, not the stupid part — again, sounds like what hippies used to say about not sending people to–.”
Raskin then cut in to say, “I agree with you on the lying. That is ridiculous and absurd and counterproductive” and to argue that Trump never criticized war hawks before and Maher responded that he’s not defending Trump and is just saying, “don’t lie to me.”
Raskin responded, “I agree with that. That’s just a distortion.”
Maher added, “And, again, the spirit of it is something that if someone with a blue hat said it, people would nod along on the left.”
Raskin added that he agrees with the criticism of the media coverage, but there has been violence and threats.
Maher further said that talking about guns being pointed at someone’s face isn’t what we want a president to say and there is too much obsession with mainstream media coverage since the influence of mainstream media is lower due to the increase in the number of media outlets.

Breitbart,House Judiciary Report: Facebook Censored Hunter Biden Laptop Story to Gain Favor with Biden-Harris Regime,"Facebook executives suppressed the bombshell Hunter Biden laptop story in order to gain favor with what they assumed would be the incoming Biden-Harris administration, according to a new report released by the House Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on the Weaponization of Government.
After the FBI falsely told tech companies that the forthcoming October 2020 report of the Hunter Biden “Laptop from Hell” scandal was Russian misinformation, Facebook executives internally discussed suppressing the revelations in order to please Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, according to an interim report by the House Judiciary Committee’s Subcommittee on the Weaponization of Government reports the New York Post.
The interim report found that Facebook employees referred to the Post‘s October 2020 bombshell story as the “exact content expected for hack and leak,” before censoring the scandal.
“Right on schedule,” another Facebook employee replied in an internal chat.
“Obviously, our calls on this could colour the way an incoming Biden administration views us more than almost anything else,” Facebook’s then-Vice President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg reportedly wrote to Vice President of Global Public Policy Joel Kaplan.
A Microsoft employee, meanwhile, wrote, “FBI tipped us all off last week that this Burisma story was likely to emerge,” the congressional investigation found.
The Post noted that it had “spent nearly a month verifying the authenticity of laptop files” before publishing the story, and that the FBI had possessed “Hunter Biden’s abandoned laptop since December 2019” and knew the files in the story “came from a Delaware computer repairman and not the Kremlin.”
This is because computer repairman-turned-whistleblower John Paul Mac Isaac gave the laptop to the FBI in December 2019, as he believed it contained significant information involving international corruption. Isaac then provided copies of the files to the New York Post.
After warning Big Tech companies about “Russia,” the FBI then remained silent “as 51 ex-intelligence officials suggested and then-candidate Joe Biden outright alleged that the files came from Russia,” the outlet reported.
Once the 2020 presidential election was over, New York Post’s bombshell Hunter Biden laptop story was corroborated by other news outlets, and files from the laptop were used by federal prosecutors in court.
Now, congressional Republicans say the FBI and Big Tech collaborated to defeat then-President Donald Trump in the 2020 election.
One Facebook employee even appears to admit in an internal July 2020 message that the tech giant is aware it “influenced the 2020 elections,” according to the congressional report.
“When we get hauled up to [Capitol] [H]ill to testify on why we influenced the 2020 elections we can say we have been meeting for YEARS with USG [the U.S. government] to plan for it,” the Facebook employee wrote.
The congressional report states, “If the FBI’s intent was truly to help social media companies combat actual foreign influence operations, the FBI should have shared the single most important fact: the influence-peddling allegations in the Post story were based off of real, credible information, including information in the FBI’s possession.”

Breitbart,"WATCH: Bill Clinton, Van Jones Tell Democrats the Truth About Israel, Palestinians","Campaign seasons rarely provide opportunities to discuss issues, but the last week of the 2024 election has yielded a surprisingly enlightened discussion — on the left — about who is to blame for the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
The first comments came from Van Jones, the veteran left-wing community organizer who is a strident partisan on cable news panels but also one of the few people who will speak honestly about the Democrats’ weaknesses as well.
Jones appeared on Jonah Platt’s new podcast, Being Jewish, to discuss the relationships between blacks and Jews. At one point, he made the rare but crucial observation that the pro-Palestinian movement has, thus far, been misguided:
The Palestinians deserve all the support in the world. Their cause is just, they want human rights, they want dignity, they want sovereignty — that’s beautiful. And it’s been hijacked by a Nazi organization called Hamas, who are terrible. They are not freedom fighters, they’re freedom takers. They are not interested in democracy, they’re not interested in human rights, they’re not interested in women’s rights, they’re not interested in gay rights — they’re not interested in anything that we care about over here. And they are trying to destroy Israel way more than they’re trying to help the Palestinians. It’s a Nazi organization … if you’re a Nazi, I’m against you first, and then we work out everything else. So when you have a good cause that’s been hijacked by bad people, that’s tough — and so you’ve got to be able to to talk about this stuff honestly. … I’ve had people pull money out of things I’m a part of, but who cares — it’s nothing compared to what those kids went through at at the Nova festival, nothing compared to what those people went through with the kibbutz. You’ve got to remember — I’m a progressive, so Hamas attacked my people. Those are my people on the kibbutz, those are liberals, those are my people. Those are my people. I’m a progressive. And so Hamas pushes through with bulldozers and butchers my people — progressive, liberal, peace-loving — you know, social justice people, were murdered and butchered. And then you have these idiots over here talking about, “Oh, these were Nazi, you know, Zionist colonizers, blah blah blah blah,” and I’m like, “Guys, you don’t know a thing about about anything , you sound like idiots, and the only reason that you can get away with it is because there’s just not that many Jewish people to fight back.”
In a similar vein, former President Bill Clinton addressed Democrats in Michigan as part of a get-out-the-vote effort. And he also told several hard truths that the left rarely hears:
Let me talk about the hardest issue — here in Michigan — is the Middle East. And I have to be careful what I say because there’s only one president at a time, and none of us can get ahead of where we’re going. But I think we’re going to have to essentially start again on the peace process. And I understand why young Palestinian and Arab Americans in Michigan think too many people have died since — I get that. But if you lived in one of those kibbutzim in Israel right next to Gaza, where the people there were the most pro-friendship with Palestine, most pro-two-state solution of any of the Israeli communities, were the ones right next to Gaza. And Hamas butchered them. And so then the people who criticize it are essentially saying, “Yeah, but look how many people you’ve killed in retaliating, so how many is enough for you to kill to punish them for the terrible things they did?” That all sounds nice until you realize: what would you do if it was your family and you hadn’t done anything but support a homeland for the Palestinians and one day they come for you and slaughter the people in your village? You would say, “Well, you’ll have to forgive me, I’m not keeping score that way. It isn’t how many we’ve had to kill, because Hamas makes sure that they’re shielded by civilians. they’ll force you to kill civilians if you want to defend yourself.” And, look — I worked on this hard, and the only time Yasser Arafat didn’t tell me the truth was when he promised he was going to accept the peace deal that we had worked out, which would have given the Palestinians a state on 96% of the West Bank and 4% of Israel, and they got to choose where the 4% of Israel was. So they would have the effect of the same land of all the West Bank. They would have a capital in East Jerusalem, they would have the — I can hardly talk about this — and they would have equal access all day every day to the security towers that Israel maintained all through the West Bank up to the Golan Heights. All this was offered — including, I will say it again, a capital in East Jerusalem and two of the four quadrants of the Old City of Jerusalem, confirmed by the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and his cabinet. And [the Palestinians] said no. And I think part of it is that Hamas did not care about a homeland for the Palestinians. They wanted to kill Israelis and make Israel uninhabitable. Well, I got news for them: they were there first, before there was their [Islamic] faith existed, they were there in the time of King David, and the southernmost tribes had Judea and Samaria. But the whole fight that you have seen played out was present in the beginning for Israel — two parts parties Likud and Labor. Likud says, “We want the whole West Bank because we had it in the time of David and to heck with whoever came and other things.” Labor said. “We will take what the United Nations has offered us and we will make a garden in the desert and we will have friends and we will work through it.” And they did — David Ben-Gurion. They’re still fighting this fight today. And so here’s what I want to tell you: I’m going to do everything I can to convince people that they cannot murder their way out of this — neither side. You can’t kill their your way out of
this. And they have to make a new beginning. But when I read that people in Michigan are thinking about not voting because they’re mad at the Biden Administration for honoring his historic obligation to try to keep Israel from being destroyed, I think that’s a mistake.
Clinton’s point was that Arab and Muslim voters should not believe that a Trump presidency would be better for the Palestinian cause. Many Arab and Muslim leaders have begun to conclude otherwise. However, the essence of his point remains true: it was Palestinians, not Israel, who chose war, and to punish any administration for defending Israel is to ensure the continuation of the conflict, not its solution.

Breitbart,"Walz on Third-Trimester Abortions: We Want Roe, Should Be Between Women, Doctors","On Wednesday’s broadcast of “CBS Mornings,” 2024 Democratic vice presidential candidate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz (D) responded to a question on if there should be any abortion limits by stating that the Harris-Walz ticket’s position is that we should “restore the right of Roe v. Wade, making sure that women and their healthcare providers — because these services are health care — making sure those decisions are made in the best interests of the health of the mother.”
Co-host Adriana Diaz asked, “One of the things that Vice President Harris says she wants to do is restore abortion rights. Should there be any limits on abortion, including limiting third-trimester abortions?”
Walz responded, “Look, the Vice President’s been very clear, making sure that we restore the right of Roe v. Wade, making sure that women and their healthcare providers — because these services are health care — making sure those decisions are made in the best interests of the health of the mother. And that’s exactly what we’ve talked about the entire time. So, for 52 years, we were very clear on where things were at. Donald Trump gleefully talks about the beautiful thing that he’s done, which means women having miscarriages in parking lots. I’m down here, and was in Georgia yesterday where Amber Thurman died, and it was totally preventable had we not had a Donald Trump abortion ban. So, we’ve been clear about that. Restoration of Roe, that’s what we’re looking for.”
Diaz then followed up, “Should there be a federal third-trimester abortion ban?”
Walz responded, “Look, I’m going to go back again. Roe was very clear on what they did. We want the restoration of Roe, and that’s the position we’re taking.”

Breitbart,"Hollywood Elite Jennifer Aniston Votes Kamala 'To Unite Us' After Democrats Call Trump Fascist, Supporters 'Garbage'","Friends star Jennifer Aniston has voted Kamala Harris for president, calling it a vote for “someone who will unite” the country. This as the Harris campaign and the establishment media have compared former President Donald Trump to Hitler and President Joe Biden called his supporters “garbage.”
The former Friends star issued her endorsement of Kamala Harris to her 44.8 million Instagram followers on Wednesday night, citing issues like “health care,” “reproductive freedom,” “equal rights,” “safe schools,” and a “fair economy.”
“Today not only did I vote for access to health care, for reproductive freedom, for equal rights, for safe schools, and for a fair economy, but also for SANITY and HUMAN DECENCY,” she wrote.
“Please remember that whoever you are and wherever you live, your voice matters. Your VOTE matters,” she added.
“I know we don’t agree on everything, and that is the beauty of this country, but GOOD LORD aren’t you tired of this negativity towards each other? The intimidation and constant threats to those who do not think the same as the other?”
Aniston finished her message with a pledge to end the “era of fear,” ignoring the fact that the Kamala Harris campaign and broader establishment media have compared Trump to Hitler.
As Breitbart News reported, Kamala Harris recently called Trump a fascist, which the establishment media followed up on by comparing him to a Nazi.
“Let me ask you tonight, do you think Donald Trump is a fascist?” CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked Harris in a recent town hall.
“Yes, I do. Yes, I do, and I also believe that the people who know him best on this subject should be trusted again,” she replied.
This past Sunday, Democrats pushed a counter-message during former President Donald Trump’s rally by projecting a message that he “praised Hitler” onto Madison Square Garden in New York.
The “Trump Praised Hitler” projection came in response to a recent report in The Atlantic that claimed the former president told his former chief-of-staff, Gen. John Kelly, that he wanted German generals like the ones Hitler had:
In their book, The Divider: Trump in the White House, Peter Baker and Susan Glasser reported that Trump asked John Kelly, his chief of staff at the time, “Why can’t you be like the German generals?” Trump, at various points, had grown frustrated with military officials he deemed disloyal and disobedient. (Throughout the course of his presidency, Trump referred to flag officers as “my generals.”) According to Baker and Glasser, Kelly explained to Trump that German generals “tried to kill Hitler three times and almost pulled it off.” This correction did not move Trump to reconsider his view: “No, no, no, they were totally loyal to him,” the president responded.
“‘Do you mean Bismarck’s generals?’” He went on: “I mean, I knew he didn’t know who Bismarck was, or about the Franco-Prussian War. I said, ‘Do you mean the kaiser’s generals? Surely you can’t mean Hitler’s generals? And he said, ‘Yeah, yeah, Hitler’s generals.’ I explained to him that Rommel had to commit suicide after taking part in a plot against Hitler.” Kelly told me Trump was not acquainted with Rommel.
While Kelly and former Gen. Mark Miley corroborated that this exchange took place, no audio recording was produced. Trump has also denied ever making the remark. Since the release of that article, Democrats and the Kamala Harris campaign have been openly calling the former president a “fascist,” which some Republican leaders say put him at risk of another assassination attempt.
“This summer, after the first attempted assassination of a presidential candidate in more than a century, President [Joe] Biden insisted that ‘we can’t allow this violence to be normalized.’ In September, after President Trump escaped yet another close call, Vice President Harris acknowledged that ‘we all must do our part to ensure that this incident does not lead to more violence,’” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) and House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) wrote in a joint statement.
Yet Harris “has only fanned the flames beneath a boiling cauldron of political animus,” their statements continued. “Her most recent and most reckless invocations of the darkest evil of the 20th century seem to dare it to boil over. The Vice President’s words more closely resemble those of President Trump’s second would-be assassin than her own earlier appeal to civility.”",2024-10-31
Breitbart,"Trump: LA Times, Washington Post Saying Harris Is 'No Good'","Former President Donald Trump spoke about how the Los Angeles Times and Washington Post had declined to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris, adding that they were sending a message that she was “no good.”
During a rally in Rocky Mount, North Carolina on Wednesday, Trump spoke about how several major news publications such as the LA Times, Washington Post, and USA Today, among others, had announced they would not endorse either Harris or Trump.
“The Washington Post and Los Angeles Times and all these papers. They’re not endorsing anybody,” Trump said. “You know what they’re really saying? Because they only endorse Democrats — they’re saying this Democrat’s no good. They’re no good. And, they think I’m doing a great job, they just don’t want to say it.”
Trump added that USA Today had also made the decision not to endorse a presidential candidate in the election, years after breaking “tradition in urging” its readers not to vote for Trump in the 2016 presidential election against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
In the 2020 presidential election, USA Today endorsed President Joe Biden, writing that it “unanimously” supported Biden’s election.
The LA Times, the hometown newspaper of Harris, first revealed that it would not be making a presidential endorsement, though it had previously endorsed Biden, former President Barack Obama, and Clinton.
Days later, the Post announced that it would also not be endorsing Harris.
William Lewis, the publisher and chief executive officer of the Post wrote in an opinion piece that the publication was “returning” to its “roots of not endorsing presidential candidates.”
The Washington Post will not be making an endorsement of a presidential candidate in this election. Nor in any future presidential election. We are returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates.
In response to the lack of endorsement of Harris from the news publications, readers of the LA Times and Post began canceling their subscriptions.
The Tampa Bay Times editorial board also announced that it would not be endorsing a presidential candidate, noting that there had never been a recommendation for a presidential candidate, because they “never planned” to have one.",2024-10-30

I don’t know, but it’s close because elections are close. Look back at all the elections of recent times they’re close.”
She added, “I can just tell you because I’ve been in a different city every day different yesterday, two cities in one state, Arizona the enthusiasm on the ground is enormous. You know, I’m a former chair of the party. I believe win the election you must own the ground. You must get out the vote. You must call. You must text. You must door knock. You must walk precincts. That’s what we see overwhelmingly.”

Breitbart,'Caught' -- Trump Campaign Rips 'Dishonest' White House for 'Covering Up' Biden’s ‘Garbage’ Smear,"The White House was “caught covering up” President Joe Biden’s “garbage” smear by editing the transcript to alter its meaning, the Trump campaign said Friday.
White House press officials pressured stenographers to edit Biden’s remark, which was “a breach of protocol and spoilation of transcript integrity between the Stenography and Press Offices,” according to a stenographer supervisor’s email obtained by the Associated Press (AP).
White House stenographers added an apostrophe to “supporters” and an em-dash to alter the meaning of Biden’s statement.
RELATED: Kamala Dodges on if She Sympathizes with People Offended by Biden Calling Them “Garbage”
C-SPAN“This would be called lying in a public document,” Clay Travis, founder of Outkick, reacted on X. House Conference Chair Elise Stefanik (R-NY) along with others, said the edit violated the Presidential Records Act. “[T]he most important question, did Kamala Harris and her campaign request this illegal edit?” Stefanik asked.
The Trump campaign issued a statement ripping the Harris-Biden administration as “the most dishonest administration in history.”
They tried to cover up Joe Biden calling Trump supporters “garbage.” They lied about crime statistics and had to revise the data showing that violent crime went up, not down. They lied about job numbers and had to revise them by 818,000. Kamala Harris has shown herself to be thoroughly dishonest: she said the border was secure, that Bidenomics is working, and that Joe Biden was in good health. Kamala Harris leads the most corrupt and dishonest administration in American history.
The change was made after the press office “conferred with the president,” according to an internal email from the head of the stenographers’ office that was obtained by The AP. The authenticity of the email was confirmed by two government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal matters.
…
According to the email, the press office had asked the stenographers to quickly produce a transcript of the call amid the firestorm. Biden himself took to social media to say that he was not calling all Trump supporters garbage and that he was referring specifically to the “hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump’s supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally.”
…
The supervisor, a career employee of the White House, raised the concerns about the press office action — but did not weigh in on the accuracy of the edit — in an email to White House communications director Ben LaBolt, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, and other press and communications officials.

Breitbart,"Panama to Start Fining Migrants Crossing Darién Gap Jungle $5,000","Panama will reportedly start imposing a fine of up to $5,000 on illegal migrants caught crossing through the Darién Gap jungle trail, President José Raúl announced on Thursday.
Mulino made the announcement in a weekly press conference where he covered a wide array of topics such as migration and health while also giving an update on some of the results of his policies.
“Any person who enters the country – foreigner – violating immigration checkpoints, land, air or sea, will be fined an amount ranging from one thousand dollars to five thousand dollars, depending on the seriousness of the infraction,” Mulino said.
Mulino explained that migrants who do not pay the fine will be “unable to leave the country” and deported “if they do not have the economic resources to comply with the sanction imposed.”
Upon taking office in July, Mulino began implementing measures to limit the flow of U.S.-bound migrants passing through the Darién Gap, a dangerous jungle trail that Panama shares with Colombia and the only land bridge connecting South and Central America.
Over the past several years, hundreds of thousands of migrants have passed through the dangerous jungle trail en route to the United States’ southern border. According to official statistics, an overwhelming majority of the migrants crossing through the Darién Gap are Venezuelan nationals fleeing their country and its authoritarian socialist regime.
Panama registered a record-breaking 520,085 migrants who crossed the Darién throughout 2023 — more than double the 248,284 migrants registered during 2022.
Some of the new measures implemented by Mulino’s administration include the installation of barbed wire fences across the jungle trail’s most commonly used routes, signing a deal with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for the establishment of U.S.-funded deportation flights, and the dismantling of “VIP” route services mostly used Chinese migrants — whose numbers have seen a significant surge in recent years, becoming the fourth largest group of migrants crossing through the jungle trail by nationality.
While the measures appeared to have had a noticeable effect in August, Panama’s Migrant Authority recorded a significant 51.23-percent surge of migrants crossing through the Darién Gap in September.
September’s surge was majorly driven by Venezuelans fleeing from their country in the aftermath of a fraudulent presidential election in July and dictator Nicolás Maduro’s brutal persecution campaign against dissidents and protesters.
Mulino gave a preliminary update on Panama’s migrant statistics during the month of October, explaining that, as of Thursday, October 31, local authorities documented roughly 21,542 migrants crossing the Darién Gap that month.
While the amount excludes Thursday, Mulino asserted, October’s final tally will wrap with fewer migrants than September.
The Panamanian president explained that, as of Thursday, Venezuelans continue to lead 2024’s total migrant crossing numbers through itsMulino territory at roughly 196,813, followed by about 16,000 Colombian nationals, 15,000 Ecuadorians, 12,000 Chinese, 11,000 Haitians, and 31,000 of other nationalities.
Mulino also referred to U.S.-funded deportation flights, stating that at least 23 flights of that nature have now taken place since July, the latest of which included “dozens” of Colombian nationals. Mulino expressed that he hopes to continue to carry out similar deportation flights every week.
The record-breaking number of U.S.- bound migrants crossing the Darién Gap since 2023 prompted Mulino to declare at the United Nations in September that the new “United States border” is functionally located in Panama, describing the large migrant flow as an “immense global problem.”

Breitbart,Passengers Thrown Off London Flight After Fight over MAGA Hat,"Two American women were kicked off a flight from London’s Heathrow airport this week after a brawl reportedly broke out over one of the passengers wearing a Make America Great Again hat.
According to a report from The Sun newspaper, the fight broke out between the two women after one demanded that the other remove their MAGA hat as they waited to board a British Airways flight to Austin, Texas, from Heathrow on Monday afternoon.
After the woman wearing the hat featuring Donald Trump’s trademark campaign slogan refused to take off her cap, punches began to be thrown. The British newspaper did not report which woman threw the first punch.
Despite the altercation breaking out in the terminal, the two women still boarded the plane.
However, as they were seated in the same premium economy section, the dispute continued, exchanging obscenities.
Finally, the captain called for police to intervene, and officers removed them from the flight.
A source from Heathrow airport told The Sun: “With the U.S. Presidential election so close, tensions are sky high. Airline crew could not run the risk of a full-scale punch-up at 30,000ft.”
“It was extraordinary,” the source continued, saying it is believed to be the first time a passenger’s baseball cap delayed a flight.
In a statement provided to Sky News, London’s Metropolitan Police said that officers at Heathrow were called to the scene of an incident at 12:45 pm on Monday.
“A woman in her 40s and a woman in her 60s made counter allegations of affray,” the police force said. So far, neither woman has been arrested.
All told, the altercation resulted in a two-hour delay for the flight.
British Airways said: “We apologised to our customers for the delay and got them on the way as quickly as possible.”",2024-10-30
Breitbart,Exclusive -- 'The Apprentice' Winner Kendra Todd: Donald Trump Is 'Tough' and He Needs to Be,"Former President Donald Trump is “tough,” and he has to be, season three winner of The Apprentice Kendra Todd said during an interview on Breitbart News Daily, defending Trump from attacks from other castmates.
When asked for an adjective to describe Trump, Todd said “tough,” clarifying that she does not mean it in the sense that he is a “difficult person.”
“I mean, he’s tough. He’s like Teflon. I mean, clearly he has to be. I can look at how he’s been attacked from literally every angle,” she said, pointing to the disloyalty of so many people, including some of The Apprentice contestants who have used their platform to bash Trump in the form of an open letter.
“He’s just tough. He just stands in the gap against all odds, even if he has to do so alone. And, I mean, I have lots of experiences,” Todd said, explaining that she worked with Trump for one year and has seen him in action, “in his offices” in Trump Tower.
“I’ve seen him, you know, on the golf course managing, you know, that enterprise at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. I mean, I’ve seen him in a variety of different settings, had tons of interaction with him. I’ve seen him drive a car. I know it’s weird imagery,” she continued, describing him as “kind.”
“He was, you know, always asking how he was doing, if there was anything I needed, how he could support me, what did I think about this or that,” she said, explaining that she really only ever saw him upset when he was “dealing with crap that was thrown at him,” such as a “construction union strike.”
“You know, [that] stopped our ability to finish the clubhouse at a Trump golf club that we were getting ready to launch. I’d be mad too,” she said, adding that overall, over the last 19 years, “I didn’t see him be erratic.”
“You know, he’s not angry orange man with his finger on the button with the … nuclear code. I don’t need to tell anybody this. You know, we had him in office for four years, and none of that happened. And frankly, we lived in a much safer world,” she said, dismissing the critiques of some former castmates as utterly irrelevant.
“I don’t think that they’re going to sway anyone,” she said, as host Mike Slater also pointed to a recent clip of former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer talking about the toughness of Trump and why some people in administrative positions hate him, particularly in politics. giving a specific example.
Spicer told Megyn Kelly on her podcast, The Megyn Kelly Show:
I think some of them just have a personal animus towards him because of how they personally were treated or the advice that they were given. I watched it constantly in the Oval Office. Two people would come in, give him two versions of a policy, and then he would choose one person. The other person would walk out of there and say, “Fine, I’m going to find people to undermine your argument. I’m going to leak it to the press.” People around him have big egos.
And when he said, I mean, I watched him bring in a bunch, we were talking about Afghanistan policy one day, and he said, I want ten enlisted soldiers to come in that have served in Afghanistan. And he sat around a table and said, “Tell me about your experience.” And it pissed a lot of people off that he wasn’t taking the advice of the more senior people and asking the actual enlisted folks, “Tell me what your experience has been. Did you understand the mission? Are we winning? Are we moving forward? Were you getting the equipment and the tools that you needed?” They hated that. They hated the fact that they came in, gave their PowerPoint presentation and they were being undermined by a guy who didn’t just sign off on it with like a blank check.
So I think Washington is full of a lot of guys with a lot of big egos that don’t like the fact that when they come into a room, everyone doesn’t just say, ‘Oh, great idea. Let’s move forward.’ … I watched it all the time, and Trump would blow up and say, we’re not just doing the same thing over and over again. And I think for people who are used to the system that said, “Oh, well, this is the way it’s always been,” they were pissed.
LISTEN:
“Who are the real toddlers in that story?” Todd responded. “Who are the ones that really have that fragile ego and are divisive and self-interested? I think Sean Spicer, I mean, I think he said it perfectly, but that’s how he was in business, and that’s, you know, how you have to be to get things done.
“If you want to identify inefficiencies, you don’t go to the heads of the department. You go to your work horses and say, ‘What’s working? What’s not working?’ It’s not that you slight their superiors, but you’re not going to get the full picture from them, because they’re not … the ones that are doing the current work,” she added.

Breitbart,Arnold Schwarzenegger Mocked for Harris Endorsement: ‘Go Screw Another Nanny Like Kamala’s Husband Did’,"Arnold Schwarzenegger is being mocked for his endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris endorsement. “Go screw another nanny like Kamala’s husband did,” one social media user replied.
In a Wednesday X post, Schwarzenegger began his lengthy announcement of his Harris endorsement by claiming that people want to hear from him because he’s “a celebrity,” as well as “a former Republican Governor.”
Schwarzenegger went on to say that while he doesn’t “like either party right now,” and “hate[s] politics more than ever,” he is nonetheless endorsing Harris for president.
“I am voting for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz,” the actor said, citing former President Donald Trump questioning the 2020 election as a reason for doing so.
Ironically, Schwarzenegger claimed that he is fighting to strip “the power from the politicians who rig the system against the people,” before announcing his support for Harris, who was installed as the Democrat nominee by the Party’s establishment, which ousted President Joe Biden from his reelection campaign, despite the fact that Democrat primary voters selected him as the nominee.
The actor went on to say that he is publicly sharing his support for Harris — who has been in office for the last three and a half years — “because I think there are a lot of you who feel like I do. You don’t recognize our country. And you are right to be furious.”
“The problems just keep rolling, and we all keep getting angrier,” Schwarzenegger said amid soaring inflation under the Biden-Harris administration. “It is a just game to [politicians]. But it is life for my fellow Americans. We should be pissed!”
“It will just be four more years of bullshit with no results that makes us angrier and angrier, more divided, and more hateful,” the Terminator star ironically proclaimed.
Schwarzenegger also referred to Trump as “a candidate who won’t respect your vote unless it is for him,” despite the fact that in July, a bandage-clad Trump stated at the Republican National Convention (RNC) — just days after surviving an assassination attempt in which he was struck with a bullet — that he was extending “a hand of loyalty and of friendship” to “every citizen.”
“To every citizen, whether you’re young or old, man or woman, Democrat, Republican or Independent, black or white, Asian or Hispanic, I extend to you a hand of loyalty and of friendship. Together we will lead America to new heights of greatness like the word has never seen before,” Trump said at the RNC.
Watch Below:
Schwarzenegger went on to bizarrely state that Trump “will divide” the nation.
In his tirade, the actor also stated that Trump sent “his followers to storm the Capitol,” which is patently false, given that the 45th president specifically told his supporters to march peacefully on January 6, 2021.
“That’s enough reason for me to share my vote with all of you,” Schwarzenegger said. “I want to move forward as a country, and even though I have plenty of disagreements with their platform, I think the only way to do that is with Harris and Walz.”
Social media users took to the comment section of Schwarzenegger’s post to blast the the actor for the sentiments shared in his lengthy diatribe.
“You are a washed up moral coward. You impregnated your nanny, covered this up for decades, and then finally acknowledged your son when it could no longer be denied,” author, filmmaker, and journalist Mike Cernovich reacted.
“During Covid you supported the most draconian lockdowns. You wanted every American forcibly injected with an experimental therapeutic, which was dishonestly called a vaccine. ‘Screw your freedom,’ was what you said to people who refused to live in a state of panic and hysteria,” Cernovich continued.
“Go screw another nanny, like Kamala’s husband did,” Cernovich added, before asking, “How many abortions have you paid for?”
The author went on to say, “You were in movies and built a great body when you were in your 20’s and 30’s. When other people gave you the lines, you sounded smart.”
“You have no insight, you’re not an intellectual or philosopher, and morally speaking, you’re a total goober,” he added. “Go back to doing what you do best – mindlessly fornicating like an animal in heat. The rest of us will do the thinking and leading for this great country.”
Conservative commentator Rogan O’Handley, also known as DC Draino, echoed Cernovich’s sentiments, writing, “Nobody cares about the opinion of a RINO nanny impregnator.”
“How much were you paid for this?” the popular X account Libs of TikTok inquired.
“How much did it cost to sell your soul?” another X user asked.
“This is the dumbest fcking post on X today and its not even close,” another stated.
“What a stupid move, Arnold… you support Marxism by supporting and endorsing Kamala,” another commented. “Now you lost me as a fan. I will no longer support you.”
“No surprise there commie,” another wrote, before pointing out that Schwarzenegger said in 2021, “Screw your freedom.”
“I am now dumber from having read your post in it’s entirety. Thanks for nothing Arnold,” another said.

Breitbart,How YAF Stopped the Biden Administration from Destroying Women’s Rights,"The following content is sponsored by Young America’s Foundation (YAF).
In a monumental legal victory, Young America’s Foundation (YAF) has successfully fought back against the Biden administration’s radical rewrite of Title IX, halting the push to allow men into women’s spaces. With a preliminary injunction from federal court, YAF is protecting countless students from the left’s dangerous gender ideology and reaffirming the foundational principles of privacy, safety, and truth.
Protecting Women’s Spaces from Radical Gender Ideology
Title IX was originally passed to ensure women had equal opportunities in education. But under the Biden administration’s rewrite, Title IX’s protections were set to be undermined, with the definition of sex being changed to include “gender identity.” This means men could enter women’s locker rooms, bathrooms, and other private spaces simply by identifying as female, endangering both privacy and safety.
YAF recognized the threat posed by this radical rewrite and took swift legal action. The result? A federal court granted YAF and its members a preliminary injunction, stopping the Biden administration from implementing or enforcing these dangerous rules at any school attended by YAF’s student members.
Students who join YAF not only gain access to the largest conservative youth organization in the country, but they also gain protection from the Biden administration’s overreach—for themselves and the rest of their campus. If you or a student you know joins YAF today, they will help preserve sanity, privacy, and safety for students on campus.
WATCH: How Young America’s Foundation Supports Young Conservatives
The Fight for Free Speech and Privacy
The Biden rewrite of Title IX does more than just open women’s spaces to men; it also attacks the free speech rights of students who refuse to conform to the left’s gender ideology. Under the radical rewrite, students can be punished for using biological pronouns or expressing discomfort with men in women’s restrooms.
YAF’s legal victory ensures that students have the right to speak the truth without fear of punishment. By becoming a YAF member, students can stand strong against the left’s attempts to control speech and advance a dangerous ideological agenda.
How YAF’s Legal Victory Protects Students
YAF’s legal action has created an opt-in system, allowing students to exempt their schools from the radical rewrite of Title IX. By becoming a YAF member, students can ensure their school is added to the list covered by the injunction, protecting themselves and their peers from these dangerous changes.
Here’s how it works: When a student joins YAF, their school’s name is submitted to the district court, which notifies the Department of Education that it cannot enforce Biden’s rewrite at that school. This protection extends to students from middle school to graduate programs. By joining YAF, students gain legal protections that allow them to stand up against the Biden administration’s overreach and ensure their school follows the original intent of Title IX.
Join the Fight
This legal victory for YAF is just one example of how the organization is fighting back against the radical left’s agenda and protecting conservative values. But this fight is far from over. The Biden administration and its allies will continue to push dangerous policies that threaten students’ rights to privacy, safety, and free speech.
By becoming a YAF member, students can be a part of the movement that’s taking real action to defend conservative principles on campuses across the country. Membership is free, and the benefits are life-changing—not only for students but for the future of the country.
Encourage the student in your life to join YAF today and stand up for the values that matter. And if you want to support YAF in its ongoing fight, consider making a donation to help us continue defending students from the Biden administration’s radical agenda.",2024-10-31
Breitbart,Marine Vet Is Murdered by Mexican Cartel; Only One Presidential Candidate Reached Out to His Family,"Nicholas Quets comes from generations of United States Armed Forces service members. He served in the U.S. Marine Corps, his father, sister, and brother-in-law all served in the military, and his grandfather served in World War II.
During an interview with Nicholas’s father Doug Quets and his brother-in-law Philip Sweet, they told Breitbart News of Nicholas’s love of God, family, country, and service — principles deeply rooted in this all-American family from Tuscon, Arizona.
“He was born in 1993,” Doug says of his 31-year-old son. “Ever since he was a little kid, he always wanted to join the military. That’s how he ended up in the military and working for Pima County, Arizona. He was a protector of other people — he was a tall guy, 6’3″, muscles stacked on top of muscles.”
Both describe Nicholas’s true passion above all else, his two-and-a-half-year-old nephew, with whom he hoped to one day share his love of fixing cars and motorcycles.
“He was the most proud of being an uncle,” Philip says. “Nick was my son’s favorite person in the world. My son would light up whenever Nick was around. He was the light of my son’s life and my son was the light of Nick’s life.”
Philip says he never imagined that his son would grow up without his Uncle Nick.
On Friday, Oct. 18, Nicholas departed from Pima County and drove to Nogales, Arizona, to pick up a few friends for a beach trip to Rocky Point Beach — a popular destination for Nicholas and other American tourists.
Rocky Point, for those unfamiliar, is known as “Arizona’s Beach” because of its proximity to the Grand Canyon State. Doug and Philip told Breitbart News that Nicholas was very familiar with Rocky Point and the area because he was an adventurous outdoorsman who loved the water and hiking trails.
Unbeknownst to the Quets family — likely along with most Americans — Nicholas used a highway that had recently experienced Mexican drug cartel violence with little-to-no national news coverage by the American media.
Two months before Nicholas’s trip to Rocky Point, two female U.S. residents — a 72- and 82-year-old — were murdered while driving the Caborca highway.
About halfway on his drive to Rocky Point, Nicholas was stopped at a roadblock along the highway. Mexican drug cartel gunmen opened fire on Nicholas, shooting him in the back and through his heart. He died at the scene.
Two arrests have been made since then. Nicholas’s murder was not a robbery gone wrong. The cash he was carrying was left behind and nothing was taken off his person, but the cartel gunmen did steal his truck.
In the middle of the night, Doug says the U.S. Consulate in Mexico called him to tell him Nicholas had been murdered. Likewise, federal agents with the State Department made contact with the Quets family.
Days later, by Monday morning, Doug and Philip say they expected to be contacted by a range of local and national media as well as Gov. Katie Hobbs (D) and their Sens. Kyrsten Sinema (I-AZ) and Mark Kelly (D-AZ).
Instead, they heard nothing.
“We feel like we have a voice in the government. We feel like if we can be ignored, anybody can be ignored,” Doug says.
As the Quets made contact with Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents about Nicholas’s murder, Doug and Philip say they expected a call from Attorney General Merrick Garland’s office, President Joe Biden, and Vice President Kamala Harris. Instead, nothing.
“I was shocked by this,” Doug said. “This is an American killed on the other side of the border … you’d think this would be a major news story, you’d think.”
“Here we are, a week and a half later, we’ve not heard from our governor, our senators, the attorney general, this administration. No one has reached out to our family,” Philip says. “Another thing too, I have no doubt in my mind, in the presidential daily briefing, there was a note about an American citizen being murdered in Mexico by suspected cartel members.”
The Quets are particularly appalled by the lack of response or action from Kelly and his office, noting that he too is a veteran having served in the U.S. Navy with combat missions in Operation Desert Storm.
“Kelly ran on his military background, but we’ve heard nothing from him,” Doug says.
For the Quets, they were being ignored by the very politicians they served to protect. That was until they were put in touch with Sen. JD Vance (R-OH), former President Donald Trump’s running mate, by Rep. Juan Ciscomani (R-AZ).
Vance arrived in Tuscon on Oct. 22 to hold a campaign rally. The Quets went to the rally not knowing what to expect from a sitting U.S. senator representing a state 2,000 miles away from their home.
Before the rally kicked off, Vance met with the Quets.
“Vance was the most incredibly normal guy you could ever meet,” Doug says. “Within ten seconds of us talking, we’re getting down to business about what happened to Nicholas. He asked us, what can he do about it, U.S. involvement in the investigation, extradition of those who are responsible, going after the Mexican drug cartel network as well, and U.S. policy to prevent this in the future.”
Vance asked the Quets if he could share Nicholas’s story at the rally. The family, Doug says, said, “of course, yes.”
“I want to talk about something that hasn’t gotten much news coverage and it’s connected to this border issue. And I want to name this family and this young man by name … just a few days ago, there was a United States Marine veteran who was killed by the Mexican drug cartels,” Vance said:
What the cartels are doing, my friends, it’s not just affecting us north of the border, it’s affecting north and south of the border. It’s affecting a young Marine who wants to visit friends and spend some time on the beach. [Emphasis added]
This family lost their son four days ago. Have they heard from a single elected official? Of course, they haven’t … because we’re led by incompetent people who don’t give a damn about the American people and that’s going to change when the United States is led by Donald Trump. [Emphasis added]
Most significantly, Vance vowed to the Quets, “While you’ve been ignored by your own government for the last four days in the midst of this unbelievable tragedy, I promise you, the calvary is coming, and when Donald Trump is president, we’re going to kick the cartels asses and we’re going to do it for you and for every person in this room.”
Vance, Doug and Philip say, was a “complete gentleman” and “the most incredibly normal guy you could ever meet,” far from the “weird” trope that the corporate media has attempted to label him.
“He was 100 percent genuine,” Philip said of Vance. “It was obvious we were meeting with someone who cared about our family and was so knowledgeable about the border issue.”
Nicholas’s story left such an impression on Vance that the next morning, the Trump campaign personally invited the Quets to the former president’s Oct. 24 rally in Tempe, Arizona. After arriving at the rally with special guest seats, the Quets met with Trump whom they say wanted to hear all about their son and what happened to him.
“He was one of the most normal and genuine people I’ve ever met,” Doug says. “We’re still grieving Nicholas at this point, and Trump actually had tears in his eyes. He said, ‘Oh my gosh, this is terrible, tell me what happened,’ and he was legitimately upset.”
Like with Vance, the Quets explained that they want U.S. involvement in the investigation, extradition for prosecution and incarceration, and a functioning border relationship between the U.S. and Mexico.
Perhaps most prominently, Doug told Breitbart News, is one request he made to Trump: For his son-in-law, Philip, who is a federal officer, to handcuff Nicholas’s killers when they are extradited to the U.S.
“If I’m elected, I can make that happen,” Trump told the Quets.
At his rally that evening, Trump acknowledged Nicholas and the Quets, pointing them out in the crowd and telling the story of their family’s great loss, which was followed by a standing ovation from the crowd. Like Vance, he made commitments to hold the cartel gunmen responsible to the fullest extent of the law.
After their meeting with Trump, Doug and Philip say they still had not heard from any other elected officials so they figured they would reach out to Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign as her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz’s (D), scheduled a rally for Phoenix, Arizona, on Oct. 26.
When the Quets sought to attend Walz’s rally, they were told there were no tickets available.
The day before Walz’s rally, President Joe Biden was in the Phoenix area as well. The Biden camp did not reach out to the Quets. The president attended an event where he made a formal apology to American Indians.
Doug and Philip told Breitbart News that he feels like the Biden-Harris administration is more concerned with problems around the world than with what is happening right next door to American communities. It is a sentiment that is reiterated throughout the interview.
“Right in our backyard, we’ve got this narco-terrorism problem, and yet we’re sending billions to wars thousands of miles away and we’re not putting the interests of the United States first,” Philip says.
“It’s 100 percent okay for us to have 25 million illegal migrants in the U.S., but for Nick to go an hour south of the border, that’s a death sentence,” Doug says, backing up Philip’s point.
In an election year, the Quets believe Nicholas’s murder in Mexico is being suppressed for the sake of helping one political party retain power and keeping Trump and Vance out of the White House. To them, there is no other explanation as to why elected officials have steered clear of even reaching out to their family or bringing awareness to the case.
For now, they are grateful for two men who did reach out — when no one else would.
“I can’t tell you who to vote for and what to do,” Doug says. “We have suffered a tragic loss and none of my elected officials reached out to me.”
“On the other side, a senator from Ohio took 15 minutes in the busiest time in his life to talk to my family. And a former president did the same. If you care about leadership, these two men were amazing,” he says with confidence.
Nicholas’s family and friends have launched a GoFundMe, which will establish the Nicholas Douglas Quets Memorial Scholarship for students pursuing welding and fabrication schooling, trades he loved.

Breitbart,MSNBC's Maddow: 'I'm Grateful' to Harris for Her Speech that Will 'Reconsecrate' the Ellipse,"MSNBC host Rachel Maddow said Tuesday on “The Reid Out” that she was “grateful” for Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris and her speech at the Ellipse in Washington, D.C. because it will “effectively reconsecrate” the ground.
Maddow said, “I don’t know about what I expect to hear. We all know there’s excerpts around. We have been told by the campaign what to expect in terms of overall themes. We have seen her on the stump doing so many interviews, so many appearances, so many rallies. We can kind of surmise contextually what she might say tonight, but I do think tonight is different. I gotta say, Joy, just as a citizen, I’m grateful that she’s going to the Ellipse.”
She continued, “So that a new big political important thing happens on the Ellipse to supplant what our memory is of that place. To have had, as you just showed it, to have had a U.S. president standing there, you know, in that historic place with a backdrop of the White House, in front of a crowd, telling them to go physically menace one of the branches of government in order to subvert the Constitution and install him without benefit of the people’s consent, that ought to be wiped off the historical timeline.”
Maddow added, “She could have given the speech tonight from anywhere. She could have done this on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, a lot of places that would have a lot of historical significance, but to do it there is to say, you know what, it was not a proper point in American history to have a president here doing that. We are going to move on and do something different than that. This place will mean something different. We will effectively reconsecrate this ground for the Constitution and for this republic. I will lead you as a president who respects both of those things. I don’t know if it’s going to be a good speech, I don’t know if it will be a turning point in the campaign, but I’m just grateful as a citizen that a big speech from the Ellipse is going to mean something different than the way he left it.”

Breitbart,Liberal Icon Naomi Wolf Endorses Trump: 'He's Being More Inclusive',"Liberal icon and feminist author Naomi Wolf endorsed former President Donald Trump, highlighting how he was “being more inclusive.”
During an interview with Steve Bannon, the host of the War Room podcast, and the former executive chairman of Breitbart News, Wolf was asked if she really endorsed Trump. Wolf added that the Republican Party had become the “unity party,” and Trump was leading it.
Wolf has previously worked as a presidential campaign adviser for former President Bill Clinton and former Vice President Al Gore.
“President Trump did something very smart,” Wolf said, highlighting how he had aligned himself with people such as former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (R-HI), and Elon Musk. “He’s being more inclusive.”
“He’s speaking out to the concerns of black people, white people, Puerto Rican people, Hispanic people of all kinds, women, men, it doesn’t matter,” Wolf added. “You guys have become the unity party, and he’s leading the unity party, and I would be an idiot if I didn’t recognize that.”
When asked by Bannon “what” it would take for someone “who is so renowned” in the “feminist movement and progressive movement” to endorse Trump, and “what specifically drove” her to do so.
“It’s a number of things, honestly,” Wolf responded. “I mean one of them is, a good friend of mine brought me to listen to President Trump speak. And, it was in Bedminster and he was speaking to a bunch of orthodox Jews and he talked to a group of orthodox Jews about peace in the Middle East, and what he had to say about no more wars and about bringing an end to the conflict in that region.”
Wolf noted that “the way that these people who have been prosecuted and persecuted and harassed for millennia reacted to his plans for peace” was “very, very moving” to her.
“All of my information about him was filtered through legacy media. ‘He’s a fascist. He’s a misogynist. He’s a racist,'” Wolf continued. “I saw someone who was eloquent, articulate, thoughtful, very funny. Not every joke he makes I would’ve endorsed. He was talking about — he was serious. He was a serious person talking seriously about peace in the Middle East, about saving lives, innocent lives — Palestinian and Israeli. And, how can that not be good?”
Wolf, who is the author of Facing the Beast: Courage, Faith, and Resistance in a New Dark Age, has previously penned an essay apologizing to conservatives for the Democrat Party’s reaction after video footage of the January 6, 2021 riot at the United States Capitol was released.",2024-10-30
Breitbart,Police Video Highlights Weekly Chaos in Texas Resulting from Biden-Harris Open Border Policies,"The Texas Department of Public Safety released a video showing the chaos occurring along the U.S.-Mexico border resulting from the open-border policies of the Biden-Harris administration. The video shows multiple human smuggling operations, drug seizures, and cartel gun battles near the border.
DPS spokesman Lt. Chris Olivarez posted a weekly recap showing the department’s activities along the Texas-Mexico border during the week ending October 25.
The video illustrates the chaos that happens all along the border in the wake of Biden-Harris border policies that led to millions of migrant crossings during the past three and one-half years. The activities include dangerous high-speed pursuits, the trafficking of human cargo in the trailers of 18-wheelers, and drug trafficking.
The video also shows the dangers present along the Mexican border as a DPS aircrew captured a violent gun battle taking place just across the Rio Grande.
The gun battle occurred just across the Rio Grande from Donna, Texas.

Breitbart,Nolte: Nevada Republican Early Voters Continue to Crush Democrats,"With only three days to go to vote early in Nevada, Republican turnout continues to crush Democrats.
As of Tuesday, the GOP enjoys an unprecedented (in the state’s early vote history) lead of 42,796 votes. Earlier this week, when Breitbart News reported on these numbers, Republicans led by only 26,000 votes and everyone assumed that was the peak.
Nope.
So far, 309,905 Republicans have voted early, compared to just 264,109 Democrats. Another 203,012 Independents have also voted early. This gives the GOP a 5.5-point lead.
The usual caveats apply: We don’t know who these people voted for. We don’t know if Democrats will flood early voting over the next few days. We don’t know how much of the Election Day vote has been cannibalized in these early votes. We don’t know who will win the Independent vote. Still, there is reason for Republicans to feel some optimism if for no other reason than Democrat enthusiasm appears, at least for now, to be pretty weak.
In Nevada, the biggest county is where you find Las Vegas — Clark County. This is where Democrats have always built a firewall of votes no amount of Election Day Republican voting could overcome. In 2020, Clark County Democrats had already built a firewall of over 72,000 votes around this same time in early voting. Today, that firewall is just 6,200.
We are seeing similar enthusiasm from early-voting Republicans in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Florida, and Arizona. Granted, in some of these states, like Pennsylvania, there have been more Democrat early voters than Republican early voters, but the percentage of the Republican early vote returns is higher than in the past, and when you’re talking about a 50/50 state, that means something.
Going into the last few days of early voting, Democrats are worrying about why their voters are not showing up (so far) in the expected numbers.
Republicans are worrying about whom those Independents are voting for, and if all this early voting merely ate up the advantage Republicans tend to enjoy on Election Day.
With the polls so close and so many unknowns, all you can safely say is this: Given a choice, I’d prefer to be Trump rather than Harris right now.

Breitbart,Actress Justine Bateman: Gavin Newsom ‘Is the Worst Governor We’ve Ever Had in California’,"Family Ties star Justine Bateman has called out California Governor Gavin Newsom (D) as its revealed the state’s job openings have experienced a fall of 30 percent as the unemployment rate stands at the second-worst in the country.
Taking to social media site X – formerly known as Twitter – the actress simply stated to her 139,000+ followers:
Newsom is the worst Governor we’ve ever had in Calif.
This is not the first time the Family Ties alum, 58, has got political.
Back in 2020 she joined a number of people who believed Newsom should be recalled.
In images obtained by the Daily Mail, Bateman could be seen at a “Recall Gavin 2020” campaign trailer signing a petition in agreeance with the movement to remove the politician from office.
“OK, how do we get rid of this guy? Where do I sign?” she reportedly asked at the trailer before taking a “to go” packet so that she can collect signatures to assist with the campaign.
“Thank you so much for being here,” the actress told the volunteers, the outlet reports. “Let’s do this!”
More recently she called out Newsom’s attempts to justify the state’s parlous financial disposition, also on social media.
Newsom was speaking as he unveiled a new tax credit program for film and TV in the hopes of bringing production back to Hollywood, as Breitbart News reported. She said:
PhD in deflection and world salad composition from World Salad College.
He hailed the proposed plan as an investment in the film industry’s future at a time when it is needed more than ever.
“California is the entertainment capital of the world, rooted in decades of creativity, innovation, and unparalleled talent,” said Newsom in a statement. “Expanding this program will help keep production here at home, generate thousands of good-paying jobs, and strengthen the vital link between our communities and the state’s iconic film and TV industry.”
A recent study from FilmLA showed that film and TV production “dropped by 5% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to the same timeframe of 2023,” per KTLA.
The Hollywood Reporter recently dubbed Los Angeles a “production graveyard”, warning: “Every category of filming for scripted content trails historical norms.”",2024-10-30
